11615,currently the economic wheat production faces severe challenges due to an increasing number of droughts in an effort to enhance yields most arid and semi arid areas increase the water volume used for irrigation and cultivation of wheat resulting in an intensified pressure on water resource systems therefore it has become increasingly important to determine the required water volume per unit area in relation to expected wheat performance however such an estimation of relevant performance factors has been difficult due to unpredictable water supply capacities and the lack of reliable estimates for the demand of water the potential crop water productivity pcwp defined in this study was comparing with its actual value has which obtained from field measurements based on a new approach of risk quantification using this comparison of water use the management coefficient was estimated and the production reliability of wheat was calculated based on these factors farms that had competently adapted their management in line with climate change and water availability were selected the results reveal that only 26 of a total of 666 wheat farms which evaluated for this case study have had reliable crop water productivity and could thus be used as models for other farms the results showed 100 increasing in cwp with a 27 reducing in hydro module on these farms in which case more than 34 will be reduced the groundwater withdrawal therefore the sustainability of groundwater resources would be better whereas the benefit cost ratio of the whole region and the superior farms has no significant difference the amount of water that these farms use and the resulting yield can be a suitable reference to determine the expected yield and required water volume per unit area keywords crop planning modeling optimization uncertainty water resources 1 introduction intensifying agriculture to increase the food supply of the ever growing population with only an economical and income focused point of view has been creating excessive pressure on environmental resources this pressure has especially been raised due to climatic changes associated with an increase of droughts in arid and semi arid regions these phenomena lead to soil degradation increase soil and water salinity and as a result compromise the regions agricultural stability gao et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to determine sustainable conditions for stable crop and agricultural production it is worth mentioning that quantifiable indicators are essential to assess stable conditions since measuring the intricate situation of any agricultural system is a very complex endeavor agricultural sustainability is not precisely measurable pretty 1995 acquisition and integration of spatially and temporally significant and thus suitable indicators is a general problem in the assessment of farming practices to predict system trends it is necessary to select suitable and specific indicators pretty and

system bhadra et al 2010 pereira et al 2012 and to detect the elements that cause problems in the water resource system vos 2005 shakir et al 2010 to quantify the gap between potential and actual crop water productivity it is necessary to strategically compare the farm and global crop water productivity this calls for a quantification of the vulnerability of the water resources system diwekar 2017 most studies in the arid and semi arid area have been focusing on the utilization of soil and water resources liu et al 2001 arfanuzzaman and rahman 2017 few studies focused on water sufficiency while providing a soil suitability analysis wang and lou 2001 evaluating farming practices with an interdisciplinary approach that encompasses environmental economic and socio institutional aspects is relatively new and also limited efforts have been made to evaluate farming practices via location specific indicators and their thresholds cwp is a function of many diverse factors such as atmospheric water vapor pressure deficit soil fertility irrigation and pest and disease control any management factor that increases crop yield including economical aspects also increases cwp making it less responsive to changes in these factors than yield liu et al 2007 however how to improve water productivity is a rather complex question given the agronomic hydrologic and socio economic conditions of the arid and semi arid area deihimfard et al 2007 climate change affects water resources and crop productivity and farmers cannot adapt their management strategy accordingly as a result the physical and chemical properties of water and soil are often transformed consequently cwp is not the same for all farms and can even change annually the cwp value for each farm is calculated by dividing the measured yield per unit of available water these two factors possess strong spatial and temporal variability and are the reason that cwp has been an obscure value with a range of variation created by climate change and farm management this unpredictability needs to be considered and modeled when cwp is applied as an indicator similar to the definition of sustainability by tamara and francesco cwp could be defined as an appropriate practice of natural resources by considering present and future resource consumption menichini and rosati 2013 thus energy producers such as farms need to generate integrated performances and balance between economic and environmental lines to satisfy inter generational equity needs modaresirad et al 2017 our study introduces an approach to assess the reliability of on farm crop water productivity which is essential for identifying key issues to improve water management here we compare the potential cwp with actual values obtained from field measurements this comparison of unpredictable conditions is based on a novel approach to quantify hazard and leads to a management coefficient of water use that is useful to understand the behavior of the farmer while taking general agricultural trends into account analyzing the results leads to insights into potential improvement methods and enable the development of water management policies that enable planners to improve the sustainability of water resources systems evaluation of the reaction of individual farmers to improve the sustainability of water resources systems would be ideal but is not easy because of time and investment limitations hua et al 2016 classification of farmers to homogenous groups of farm types and evaluation of the reaction of each farm type instead of individual farmers is a way which can be used for solving this problem our study attempts to enhance our understanding of the factors for differences in agricultural productivity and sustainability the main objective was to assess the performance of irrigated wheat farms with a focus on the analysis of cross sectional differences of cwp and to determine the potential productivity in the kamin region fars province iran we used a data base of 666 irrigated wheat farms located in this region to develop a model to simulate the spatial distribution of yield and the quantifying hazard for the use of available water in the classification of farms based on soil and water characteristics the difference in yields in each class is significant but the range of variations in each class is not the same in the whole region on the other hand the mean of each class has a significant difference and indicates the role of the basic production factors in yield but in this study there is a view point that due to the management of farmers in each class where water and soil conditions are the same there is a significant difference in yield hence the management coefficient we introduced in this study can show the role of these factors on sustainable water use it is worth noting that the difference between locally and globally calculated values of cwp could be caused by the changing climate of recent years due to climate change the water volume has been receding and irrigation has been increased to maintain production therefore management plays a role in increased productivity in recent years weakness of production management caused intensification of resources pressure and yield sustainability 1 1 reliability and hazard quantification risk quantification is the next step following problem formulation and the analysis of different uncertainties that potentially cause a risk of failure risk identification quantifying risk is of key importance in agriculture because simulation prediction and engineering design are all based on quantitative rather than qualitative concepts ganoulis 2009 mishra et al 2012 by definition risk analysis relates to uncertainties and any quantification of risks should be based on methodologies that take uncertainties into account two main theoretical approaches are available for doing so i the probabilistic approach and ii the fuzzy set theory when loads and resistances are assumed to be constant at a given time static reliability analysis is considered first although such a stochastic approach is relatively well established fitting probability laws and analyzing dependencies between random variables needs large quantities of data which are not always available if load and resistance are assumed as independent direct integration may be applied to quantify risk and reliability available data may be used to estimate extreme values and risk of accidents such as the hydrologic risk and management behaviors in the present study we consider loads and resistances to be time independent positive scalars applied on a single component of a system time independency is a necessary assumption that enables direct integration for risk quantification this approach is generally known as static reliability analysis unsteady system or reliability should be considered in situations where loads and resistances vector with several components on farm production with unsteady resources is also a system with several management components therefore the reliability of agricultural systems under hazard should be evaluated using the stochastic approach here we consider the load or exposure λ as a random variable l in this case uncertainties are associated with an estimation of l and are quantified via probabilistic methods the resistance or capacity r is expressed with the same unit as exposure in uncertain cases probabilistic methods may be used to describe resistance as the random variable r if both λ and r are positive random variables and probabilistic methods are utilized to quantify risk fig 1 we can compute the risk pf as follows 1 p f p l r 0 f r l f l l d l 1 2 potential crop water productivity crop water productivity is an important measure to understand water food relationships moreover this provides a basis for the assessment of system sustainability cwp combines the physical accounting of water with the resulting yield or economic output to indicate the value of a unit of water as 2 cwp y et here cwp is the crop water productivity in kgm 3 y is the crop yield in kgha 1 and et is the seasonal evapotranspiration in m3 ha 1 which can be assumed to be the consumptive water use however traditional methods are not sufficient to estimate cwp on a global scale while including large spatial and temporal variations across different geographical locations liu et al 2007 developed and tested a simulation model to estimate wheat triticum aestivum l yield and cwp they obtained good agreement from a comparison simulating yields and fao statistical yields in 102 countries over a total of 10 years simulated yield and reported cwp follow a linear regression 3 cwp 0 16 yield 0 4 r2 0 8788 p 0 01 in their study cwp values ranged from 0 160kgm3 in rwanda to 1 887kgm3 in ireland liu et al 2007 many factors that affecting plant growth such as water vapor pressure deficit of the atmosphere during the growth period of the crops the availability of water when it is most needed soil fertility application of fertilizer and general climatic conditions caused differences in observed cwp estimated yield and cwp values can be calculated via the following equation 4 cwp 0 18 yield 0 2 r2 0 7859 p 0 01 faramarzi et al 2010 studied irrigated wheat yield y and consumptive water use et using an uncertainty analysis at several locations in iran simulated y and et were used to calculate crop water productivity cwp via the following equation 5 cwp 0 13 yield 0 09 r2 0 64 p 0 01 the different values for cwp have been informed by global scale liu et al 2007 and local scale faramarzi et al 2010 reinforcing that using certain values of cwp that are based on a given value of yield is challenging thus potential values of cwp for each farm have a range of variability and consequently no fixed reference for cwp uncertainty methods should be applied to compare a farm s actual and potential cwp therefore a farm s cwp can be computed using the following equations r 1 0 18 y k 0 2 r 2 0 16 y k 0 4 r 3 0 13 y k 0 09 here yk yield per ton per ha on the kth farm in the present study as a result we defined a set of cwp values for each given value of yield with the mean r k and standard deviation σk 6 c w p k r k 1 n r i 1 n r r i 7 σ k 1 n r i 1 n r r i r k 2 here ri is the estimated value of cwp resulting from the above equations nr 1 nr and nr 3 for the kth farm k 1 nk of total farms nk 666 according to eq 1 the probability function for each farm s set of cwps is required which we consider as a resistance function in that equation supposing a normal variable distribution in each set the distribution and its function can be developed as follows 8 f r k r 1 σ k 2 π e r r k 2 2 σ k 2 9 f r k r r f r k z d z thus the potential value of cwp for any given value of yield is located within this uncertainty range this value compares to cwp which calculated by dividing crop production per available water volume actual cwp the yield value of each farm had a potential cwp value r k with an uncertainty range σk which we use to calculate risk and reliability 1 pf in this approach 1 3 actual crop water productivity we computed the actual value of cwp based on the yield of each farm and the available water volume calculated according to eq 2 although the crop water productivity is an uncertain value in here it is an important indicator and could also be used to evaluate a farm s sustainability hence it is necessary to analyze this uncertainty and determines the variability range of cwp based on the role of effective factors the hydro module of consumptive water use yield and resulting cwp is affected by crop production soil types and electrical conductivity of irrigation water use ec and the volume of available water thus all of these values need to be monitored and utilized to calculate a farm s cwp we calculated the hydro module hk by dividing the available water volume per farm area lit sec ha we estimated by yield yk dividing crop production per farm area ton ha we calculated crop water productivity lj by dividing crop productivity per the volume of available water kg m3 and defined j 1 nj as the class number we classified electrical conductivity soil type and yield based on a mont carle method classifying each of these using three classes low normal and high over their variability range e g we shaped 27 classes in this study and we defined the variability ranges of cwp in each class nj 27 each class j describes a set of farms and we assigned the calculated value of cwp to each farm we applied observed values of yield and water availability to calculate the cwp for each farm lk which is affected by soil type ec and yield factors each class has maximum medium minimum and the range of a farm s cwp due to the effects of unpredictable factors on crop production we created each class range based on the farm s soil yield and water salinity assuming a normal distribution for the probability function of each class of cwp we consider a load function in eq 1 and develop it as following 10 f l j l 1 σ j 2 π e l k l j 2 2 σ j 2 here the calculated cwp of each farm is l j and the variation range of its class is σj and they can be computed via the following equations 11 c w p j l j 1 n j k n j 1 1 n j l k 12 σ j 1 n j k n j 1 1 n j l k l j 2 1 4 management coefficient to evaluate production sustainability on each farm it is necessary to determine by how much the cwp value can increase this value may be defined as the potential value of cwp and can be used as a reference point for each farmer providing an estimate for similar yields for corresponding soil and water properties usually the cwp value is calculated as yield per water use and is a function of soil water climate and practical management on each farm many studies tried to estimate the cwp value based on impact parameters for wheat crop production as well as describing several models to present relationships between cwp and yield values e g a farm that used 5660m3 of water and produced three tons of wheat per hectare has a crop water productivity of 0 53kg m3 an analysis of referencing values revealed that the crop water productivity could range between 0 8 and 1 2 with this level of wheat production liu et al 2007 defining potential values of cwp and their range is inaccurate it is not a meaningful indication value and it is only a reference point for comparing farms however dividing cwp s obtained for each farm per the potential values will be the basis for calculating management coefficient mc as following 13 m c k l k r k this indicator will quantify the used resource efficiency in the field furthermore the management coefficient variations can be utilized to evaluate production sustainability the farm with the highest value of mc is the best farm though compared to other farms it does not have the highest value of yield or the maximum amount of cwp this farm competently adapted management methods as a response to climate change and water availability 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the kamin region in the fars province iran has a geographical area of 1754km2 and a semi arid climate regime fig 2 average rainfall is 280mm with a maximum of 519mm and a minimum of 152 5mm total farmland is 40 000ha with 22 000ha of farms and 600ha of gardens irrigated with groundwater resources between 2014 and 2015 over 95 of all groundwater resources are withdrawn to cover the water demand of agriculture we randomly selected a subset of the irrigation districts with a total area of 7000ha for each district we collected the observed data of one or several adjacent wheat farms the area of these selected districts was about 30 of the total irrigated land the monitored zones were a subunit of the collected data and we assumed that the obtained results can be generalized for the entire farmland via geo statistical methods 2 2 effective parameters on uncertainty of crop water productivity 2 2 1 land suitability land suitability evaluation looks for key production in the region including wheat alfalfa maize and barley covering a total area of 30 000ha based on semi detailed soil studies in this region we defined two soil families and eight soil series in two physiographic units we determined physiological requirements of each crop via described rated base methods for our qualitative evaluation we used land and climatic characteristics along with the growing crop needs based on the means of simple limitation and parametric method stories and root square method the obtained indexes for barley wheat and alfalfa were higher than those for other crops restrictive parameters on crop productivity in the region included soil physical properties such as carbonate contents soil salinity and drainage along with climatic variables the variation ranged from 0 to 100 demonstrating the value of each parameter we calculated the land suitability index for wheat yield by multiplying values as follow if the index is between 70 and 100 the land is suitable s1 if it is between 50 and 75 the land is relatively suitable s2 if it is between 25 and 50 the land is lightly suitable s3 if it is between 0 and 25 the land is unsuitable with the unsuitable classification to suitability potential n1 and any suitability potential n2 in this study we define the key word soil unit to represent the land suitability index for wheat at each farm and extend its values to the whole region via geo statistical methods kriging approach as shown in fig 3 a based on the qualitative evaluation of land suitability soil texture that disables wheat production extends from the southern to central flat plain and expected yields are low however suitable soil classes are situated in northern to central parts and their yields were expected to be better in comparison 2 2 2 available water and water quality recent droughts as well as the use of uncontrolled groundwater sources have caused a significant drop of the groundwater level in most plains of iran such as the kamin plain and as a result this region faces a new challenge of water restriction as a result of the water crisis accurate estimations of crop water requirements gross irrigation requirements hydro module and the volume of groundwater pumping are essential however this is not possible without accurate estimations of irrigation efficiencies in each plain when more than et water used is considered the term irrigation efficiency is used to define the effectiveness of the irrigation system in delivering all the water beneficially used to produce the crop irrigation efficiency is defined as the ratio of the volume of water that is beneficially used to the volume of irrigation water applied water losses that occur as a result of excessive deep percolation runoff weed et wind drift and spray droplet evaporation are normally not considered as beneficial uses and thus tend to decrease irrigation efficiency a major problem with using irrigation efficiency as a performance parameter is the subjectivity involved in the definition of beneficial use most irrigation systems in kamin are operated primarily to supply water for crop et which allows water application efficiency and irrigation efficiency to be used interchangeably other factors that impact beneficial uses and thus irrigation efficiency are local water regulation agency allocation rules and farmer practiced irrigation management strategies the overall irrigation efficiency represents the efficiency of the entire physical system and operating decisions in delivering irrigation water from a water supply source to the target crop it is calculated by multiplying the efficiencies of water conveyance and water application irmak et al 2011 in the kamin plain we selected several farms according to the level of implemented under pressure irrigation the total irrigated area of cultivation and the kinds of irrigation method traditional or modern system we determined available water and irrigation efficiency based on a field survey and farm measurements of several irrigated districts we measured quantity and quality of water use withdrawn from wells in selected farms based on measurement values and the geo statistical method simple kriging approach we modeled the spatial distributions of water quality and quantity and depict the results in fig 3 d and b according to the different levels of crop cultivation specially crop pattern we calculated the annual hydro module by dividing the water use volume by farm size during growing season defined as lit sec ha here farms hydro module has changed from 0 26 to 1 36 and its distribution is shown in fig 3 b then we extended the hydro module spatial variability to the whole region using the geo statistical method simple kriging approach and depict the results in fig 3 b our results reveal that only in a small part of this region hydro module was more than 1 0 lit sec ha but for most parts of the region hydro module was smaller than 0 8 lit sec ha also we calculated the hydro module for each month with a maximal value in july and with an amount of 1 3 lit sec ha we measured electrical conductivity ec of the irrigated water of selected farms as a water quality index the spatial variation of ec in the region was 0 5 5 2 ds m2 by using simple kriging approach we modeled and expanded these variations to the whole region fig 3 d ec fluctuations matched the land suitability results but did not show any consistent trend in relation to yield 2 2 3 spatial variability of yield all factors affecting the uncertainty of crop water productivity also had an effect on yield we applied the yield to determine cwp as a management coefficient and to assess the crop production of each farm and the resulting resources sustainability therefore determining the relationship between variations in yield and these factors is necessary to evaluate the range of cwp as a result we made an effort to find the spatial relationship between yield and the factors mentioned water salinity soil unit and hydro module with geo statistical simulation methods like co kriging for all cases we calibrated with reasonable accuracy but we found no significant relationship between the measured values of yield and the results of simulation models in the validation phase fig 3 c we tested the relationship between yield and the factors mentioned via multivariate regression and curve fitting methods but without obtaining acceptable results to summarize we were not able to obtain a significant relationship between yield and salinity soil unit and hydro module variables 3 results we measured land suitability water use quality and quantity and yield for each farm within the data collection areas we simulated the yield results based on the geo statistical method kriging approach as shown in fig 3 c the amount of yield changed from 1 to 10 tons per ha throughout the different parts of this study comparing results for the spatial variation model of farm yield and soil classification revealed that the distribution of yield did not match land suitability patterns we observed the highest yields on the southern flat plains 10 tons per hectare while land suitability was not a very good fit for wheat production to find a perfect correlation coefficient between yield and soil unit we used and failed approaches like curve fitting and disjunctive co kriging geo statistical method and ultimately we did not find a model to describe the correlation table 1 subsequently we assumed that the volume of available water could be the reason for differences between land suitability and observed yields a spatial variability comparison of yield and hydro module showed a small relationship between these factors hence we utilized multivariable regression and curve fitting approaches to investigate these issues as a result yield had an improved relationship with hydro module compared to the soil unit however the result was not significant next we considered the spatial relationship between the electrical conductivity ec of the water the hydro module of the available water and soil considering yield via multivariable geo statistical methods such as disjunctive co kriging all of the calibration results of the model were acceptable but we observed many differences between measured and estimated yields in the validation process finally we concluded that no significant correlation existed between the spatial variation of yields and the water quality and quantity due to soil salinity some areas in the sample region were not suitable for wheat production however the land suitability of these areas could be improved by the quality of irrigation water thus it seems that the main yield variations could be affected by imprecise factors such as farm management abolpour et al 2006 abolpour and javan 2007 razavitoosi and samani 2016 therefore we evaluated the effect of these factors on yield via water use efficiency indicators such as crop water productivity the range of cwp as an indicator to classify farms needs to be explained the maximum and minimum amount of cwp obtained in the study area has been creating the variation range used to classify the farms based on a monte carlo approach we placed the variation ranges of yield soil texture and water salinity in the region on three classes for each of these factors and created 27 classes of their fluctuations as a result table 2 we calculated potential and actual values of cwp of farms from eqs 6 and 11 and illustrated average and standard deviation for each class in tables 2 and 3 the results were used to calculate the reliability and risk based on eqs 8 10 climate change cultivation management and water amount affect cwp thus changing it over time even in a same area for that reason maximum and minimum values of cwp observed in the study area were neither certain nor deterministic and they changed in different conditions however when the actual cwp is lower than the potentially possible value farmers over impacted the water resources to achieve more yields at the cost of future sustainability of production in this region therefore potential values of cwp and the corresponding range could be defined as production sustainability indicator similar to liu et al 2007 and faramarzi et al 2010 we used the following equation to calculate the uncertainty range of cwp the equation was developed based on measured yield and water use from each farm obtained from real data rather than estimated data 14 cwp 0 1 yield 0 1 r2 0 69 p 0 01 although increasing water use causes also increases crop production crop water productivity may subsequently be reduced each crop needs enough water to increase production as long as the crop water productivity does not reduce determining the expected performance and required water volume per unit area has therefore become vitally important however a reliable determination of water demand is difficult due to the role of other production factors in performance and even more so due to unstable and uncertain conditions for the estimation of water supply capacity therefore it is necessary to define the optimal point of water use in this condition we illustrate this point in fig 4 where risk and performance curves intersect in addition the curves of lower and upper limits of our risk and performance predictions are depicted in fig 4 α 0 01 we located the optimal condition within the area of hydro module from 0 33 to 0 63 with an optimal value of 0 44 lit sec ha in this optimum rage we obtained values of 12 to 38 for risk and 62 to 88 for performance based on the results presented in fig 4 risk increases and performance decreases when the hydro module was raised as following 15 r i s k α r β r h 16 p e r f α p β p h where αr 65 and αp 35 βr βp 17 and h is the hydro module by lit sec ha p 0 01 we obtained these equations based on a curve fitting analysis and the results are shown in table 4 we calculated the management coefficient by dividing the cwp of each farm by the potential values eq 13 and extended its spatial variability to the whole region via geo statistical methodology simple kriging approach the results for this are shown in fig 5 comparing these results between the distribution maps of yield soil class and quantity and quality of water use fig 3 and the results of management coefficient distribution fig 5 revealed that mc variations did not match the spatial distribution patterns of these factors however the mc distribution map reveals a clear pattern and this region can be divided into two parts one with good management and another with poor management because of this it seems that groupie management or colony farmers is the main reason affecting mc variations as a consequence each colony needs a groupie manager who is a leader and provides a pattern for the other farmers fig 6 shows the farms with optimal performance improved crop water productivity and high probability for yield in these farms 26 of a total of 666 wheat farms had a hydro module of 0 44 lit sec ha crop water productivity ranging between 0 7 and 1 00kg m3 and a probability of high wheat production of more than 70 comparing the results of figs 5 and 6 shows that the colonies are located according to these farms as a result they competently adapted their management methods with climate change and water availability finally these farms were sustainable farms and their yield and water use can be used as a suitable reference to determine expected yield and required water volume per area unit some of the production factors on the superior farms were compared with other farms table 5 comparing the mean values showed that except hydro module of water use and cwp other factors don t have significant changes with the superior farms the comparison of minimum each factor was similar to the above case but in maximum the differences were significant for example the maximum area of farms was 70ha in the region but it was 17ha in the superior farms table 5 therefore the farms lower than 20ha have the better adaptation with the fluctuations of water resource capacity other factors which can have the role in superiority of these farms are the suitable irrigation duration based on the chemical and physical characteristic of soil and the farm level the irrigation duration more than 36days was observed in this region whereas it was 10days for superior farms table 5 it can be concluded that complying the irrigation duration and farm level has a role in improving management efficiency and creating optimum conditions in the farmland the maximum depth of groundwater level was 90m around the superior farms but it was 125m on the other sites in the superior farms the maximum withdrawal of groundwater resources was less than 20 lit sec and it was observed more than 30lit sec on the other sites table 5 therefore one of the major achievements of the superior farms modeling is sustainability of groundwater resources in which case the reduction in groundwater withdrawal will be more than 34 the maximum of irrigation efficiency was 57 in the superior farms whereas 67 was also observed for irrigation efficiency in the region but they were being out of the category of superior farms table 5 therefore opinion of increasing irrigation efficiency to create superior farms is not correct the maximum of crop production was 10 tons per hectare in the region but in the superior farms were produced 9 tons per hectare on the maximum conditions table 5 therefore it is observed that the choosing superior farms is not only due to increase in production sometimes in order to increase the production water use has increased and it has been approved when cwp of top farms were compared with others the cwp s mean of superior farms and other farms were equal 1 and 0 54 respectively which is about 100 increase in cwp table 5 but considerable matter is that the superior farms merely because the increase in cwp were not selected for example in the region was also observed the cwp more than 2 but these farms were being out of the selected group by the here model presented the reason for this is that it has no enough credit in comparison with the cwp s region potential and also it was outside of the limitations boundary of uncertainty conditions it may be only in specific circumstances and probably happened for one year therefore because of high risk of acquiring this cwp these farms omitted in the model this issues also observed when the minimum and the standard deviation of cwp s superior farms were compared with the others for example the cwp s range of superior farms was 0 7 1 5 with 0 2 standard deviation but it was 0 3 2 14 with 0 4 standard deviation in the region table 5 therefore it seems that superior farms had proper cwp with the high reliability and a lesser amount of risk the variable range of the benefit per cost of the whole region and the superior farms has no significant difference according to result water management and production type in superior farms has no more cost for farmers but also increase their farms income so it seems that this type of water use management and crop produce would be better for them table 5 comparing hydro module is showed to reduce 27 between 0 47 of superior farms with 0 64 of other farms lit sec based on the results it is confirmed that due to comply the different sustainable aspects on superior farms including production factors economic and social issues they had achieved to stability conditions 4 conclusion for a specific yield the calculated values of crop water productivity decreased one to one from eqs 3 to 5 and 14 e g according to the average yield in the region of about 5 tons per hectare calculated values of cwp were 1 2 1 1 0 74 and 0 6 respectively comparing these values indicated that the crop water productivity in this region was nearly half of the normally expected values since the yield was kept constant in our calculations the result can only be explained by additional water use we conducted this study to find the spatial distribution models for yield quality and quantity of water use and land suitability index using geo statistical analyses furthermore via multivariate regression curve fitting and geo statistical methods we tested the relationship between yield and mentioned factors but did not obtain a satisfactory result not only were the spatial variations of these parameters not simulated but also the spatial classifications of these parameters were not zoned clearly fig 3 however the management coefficient variations were simulated with a spatially classified separate zone fig 5 therefore it seems that the effects of management by the farmer towards a sustainable production were more significant than other basic production factors such as soil water and climate change groupie management or colony farmers could affect this management hence the management coefficient we introduced in this study can show the role of these factors on sustainable water use it is worth noting that the difference between locally and globally calculated values of cwp could be caused by the changing climate of recent years due to climate change the water volume has been receding and irrigation has been increased to maintain production therefore management plays a role in increased productivity in recent years weakness of production management caused intensification of resources pressure and yield sustainability our results indicate that wheat farms could reduce risk by 25 13 by adopting best practices of efficient farms deficiency of irrigation water and poor land quality are two fundamental constraints to increase reliability by 75 13 in the region because of subsidies such as seed fertilizer and credit the produced wheat is costlier than other crops and continually causes change in cropping patterns the results of suggested analysis could create a sustained cropping pattern through effective management and additional investments in both land and water resources

11615,currently the economic wheat production faces severe challenges due to an increasing number of droughts in an effort to enhance yields most arid and semi arid areas increase the water volume used for irrigation and cultivation of wheat resulting in an intensified pressure on water resource systems therefore it has become increasingly important to determine the required water volume per unit area in relation to expected wheat performance however such an estimation of relevant performance factors has been difficult due to unpredictable water supply capacities and the lack of reliable estimates for the demand of water the potential crop water productivity pcwp defined in this study was comparing with its actual value has which obtained from field measurements based on a new approach of risk quantification using this comparison of water use the management coefficient was estimated and the production reliability of wheat was calculated based on these factors farms that had competently adapted their management in line with climate change and water availability were selected the results reveal that only 26 of a total of 666 wheat farms which evaluated for this case study have had reliable crop water productivity and could thus be used as models for other farms the results showed 100 increasing in cwp with a 27 reducing in hydro module on these farms in which case more than 34 will be reduced the groundwater withdrawal therefore the sustainability of groundwater resources would be better whereas the benefit cost ratio of the whole region and the superior farms has no significant difference the amount of water that these farms use and the resulting yield can be a suitable reference to determine the expected yield and required water volume per unit area keywords crop planning modeling optimization uncertainty water resources 1 introduction intensifying agriculture to increase the food supply of the ever growing population with only an economical and income focused point of view has been creating excessive pressure on environmental resources this pressure has especially been raised due to climatic changes associated with an increase of droughts in arid and semi arid regions these phenomena lead to soil degradation increase soil and water salinity and as a result compromise the regions agricultural stability gao et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to determine sustainable conditions for stable crop and agricultural production it is worth mentioning that quantifiable indicators are essential to assess stable conditions since measuring the intricate situation of any agricultural system is a very complex endeavor agricultural sustainability is not precisely measurable pretty 1995 acquisition and integration of spatially and temporally significant and thus suitable indicators is a general problem in the assessment of farming practices to predict system trends it is necessary to select suitable and specific indicators pretty and

system bhadra et al 2010 pereira et al 2012 and to detect the elements that cause problems in the water resource system vos 2005 shakir et al 2010 to quantify the gap between potential and actual crop water productivity it is necessary to strategically compare the farm and global crop water productivity this calls for a quantification of the vulnerability of the water resources system diwekar 2017 most studies in the arid and semi arid area have been focusing on the utilization of soil and water resources liu et al 2001 arfanuzzaman and rahman 2017 few studies focused on water sufficiency while providing a soil suitability analysis wang and lou 2001 evaluating farming practices with an interdisciplinary approach that encompasses environmental economic and socio institutional aspects is relatively new and also limited efforts have been made to evaluate farming practices via location specific indicators and their thresholds cwp is a function of many diverse factors such as atmospheric water vapor pressure deficit soil fertility irrigation and pest and disease control any management factor that increases crop yield including economical aspects also increases cwp making it less responsive to changes in these factors than yield liu et al 2007 however how to improve water productivity is a rather complex question given the agronomic hydrologic and socio economic conditions of the arid and semi arid area deihimfard et al 2007 climate change affects water resources and crop productivity and farmers cannot adapt their management strategy accordingly as a result the physical and chemical properties of water and soil are often transformed consequently cwp is not the same for all farms and can even change annually the cwp value for each farm is calculated by dividing the measured yield per unit of available water these two factors possess strong spatial and temporal variability and are the reason that cwp has been an obscure value with a range of variation created by climate change and farm management this unpredictability needs to be considered and modeled when cwp is applied as an indicator similar to the definition of sustainability by tamara and francesco cwp could be defined as an appropriate practice of natural resources by considering present and future resource consumption menichini and rosati 2013 thus energy producers such as farms need to generate integrated performances and balance between economic and environmental lines to satisfy inter generational equity needs modaresirad et al 2017 our study introduces an approach to assess the reliability of on farm crop water productivity which is essential for identifying key issues to improve water management here we compare the potential cwp with actual values obtained from field measurements this comparison of unpredictable conditions is based on a novel approach to quantify hazard and leads to a management coefficient of water use that is useful to understand the behavior of the farmer while taking general agricultural trends into account analyzing the results leads to insights into potential improvement methods and enable the development of water management policies that enable planners to improve the sustainability of water resources systems evaluation of the reaction of individual farmers to improve the sustainability of water resources systems would be ideal but is not easy because of time and investment limitations hua et al 2016 classification of farmers to homogenous groups of farm types and evaluation of the reaction of each farm type instead of individual farmers is a way which can be used for solving this problem our study attempts to enhance our understanding of the factors for differences in agricultural productivity and sustainability the main objective was to assess the performance of irrigated wheat farms with a focus on the analysis of cross sectional differences of cwp and to determine the potential productivity in the kamin region fars province iran we used a data base of 666 irrigated wheat farms located in this region to develop a model to simulate the spatial distribution of yield and the quantifying hazard for the use of available water in the classification of farms based on soil and water characteristics the difference in yields in each class is significant but the range of variations in each class is not the same in the whole region on the other hand the mean of each class has a significant difference and indicates the role of the basic production factors in yield but in this study there is a view point that due to the management of farmers in each class where water and soil conditions are the same there is a significant difference in yield hence the management coefficient we introduced in this study can show the role of these factors on sustainable water use it is worth noting that the difference between locally and globally calculated values of cwp could be caused by the changing climate of recent years due to climate change the water volume has been receding and irrigation has been increased to maintain production therefore management plays a role in increased productivity in recent years weakness of production management caused intensification of resources pressure and yield sustainability 1 1 reliability and hazard quantification risk quantification is the next step following problem formulation and the analysis of different uncertainties that potentially cause a risk of failure risk identification quantifying risk is of key importance in agriculture because simulation prediction and engineering design are all based on quantitative rather than qualitative concepts ganoulis 2009 mishra et al 2012 by definition risk analysis relates to uncertainties and any quantification of risks should be based on methodologies that take uncertainties into account two main theoretical approaches are available for doing so i the probabilistic approach and ii the fuzzy set theory when loads and resistances are assumed to be constant at a given time static reliability analysis is considered first although such a stochastic approach is relatively well established fitting probability laws and analyzing dependencies between random variables needs large quantities of data which are not always available if load and resistance are assumed as independent direct integration may be applied to quantify risk and reliability available data may be used to estimate extreme values and risk of accidents such as the hydrologic risk and management behaviors in the present study we consider loads and resistances to be time independent positive scalars applied on a single component of a system time independency is a necessary assumption that enables direct integration for risk quantification this approach is generally known as static reliability analysis unsteady system or reliability should be considered in situations where loads and resistances vector with several components on farm production with unsteady resources is also a system with several management components therefore the reliability of agricultural systems under hazard should be evaluated using the stochastic approach here we consider the load or exposure λ as a random variable l in this case uncertainties are associated with an estimation of l and are quantified via probabilistic methods the resistance or capacity r is expressed with the same unit as exposure in uncertain cases probabilistic methods may be used to describe resistance as the random variable r if both λ and r are positive random variables and probabilistic methods are utilized to quantify risk fig 1 we can compute the risk pf as follows 1 p f p l r 0 f r l f l l d l 1 2 potential crop water productivity crop water productivity is an important measure to understand water food relationships moreover this provides a basis for the assessment of system sustainability cwp combines the physical accounting of water with the resulting yield or economic output to indicate the value of a unit of water as 2 cwp y et here cwp is the crop water productivity in kgm 3 y is the crop yield in kgha 1 and et is the seasonal evapotranspiration in m3 ha 1 which can be assumed to be the consumptive water use however traditional methods are not sufficient to estimate cwp on a global scale while including large spatial and temporal variations across different geographical locations liu et al 2007 developed and tested a simulation model to estimate wheat triticum aestivum l yield and cwp they obtained good agreement from a comparison simulating yields and fao statistical yields in 102 countries over a total of 10 years simulated yield and reported cwp follow a linear regression 3 cwp 0 16 yield 0 4 r2 0 8788 p 0 01 in their study cwp values ranged from 0 160kgm3 in rwanda to 1 887kgm3 in ireland liu et al 2007 many factors that affecting plant growth such as water vapor pressure deficit of the atmosphere during the growth period of the crops the availability of water when it is most needed soil fertility application of fertilizer and general climatic conditions caused differences in observed cwp estimated yield and cwp values can be calculated via the following equation 4 cwp 0 18 yield 0 2 r2 0 7859 p 0 01 faramarzi et al 2010 studied irrigated wheat yield y and consumptive water use et using an uncertainty analysis at several locations in iran simulated y and et were used to calculate crop water productivity cwp via the following equation 5 cwp 0 13 yield 0 09 r2 0 64 p 0 01 the different values for cwp have been informed by global scale liu et al 2007 and local scale faramarzi et al 2010 reinforcing that using certain values of cwp that are based on a given value of yield is challenging thus potential values of cwp for each farm have a range of variability and consequently no fixed reference for cwp uncertainty methods should be applied to compare a farm s actual and potential cwp therefore a farm s cwp can be computed using the following equations r 1 0 18 y k 0 2 r 2 0 16 y k 0 4 r 3 0 13 y k 0 09 here yk yield per ton per ha on the kth farm in the present study as a result we defined a set of cwp values for each given value of yield with the mean r k and standard deviation σk 6 c w p k r k 1 n r i 1 n r r i 7 σ k 1 n r i 1 n r r i r k 2 here ri is the estimated value of cwp resulting from the above equations nr 1 nr and nr 3 for the kth farm k 1 nk of total farms nk 666 according to eq 1 the probability function for each farm s set of cwps is required which we consider as a resistance function in that equation supposing a normal variable distribution in each set the distribution and its function can be developed as follows 8 f r k r 1 σ k 2 π e r r k 2 2 σ k 2 9 f r k r r f r k z d z thus the potential value of cwp for any given value of yield is located within this uncertainty range this value compares to cwp which calculated by dividing crop production per available water volume actual cwp the yield value of each farm had a potential cwp value r k with an uncertainty range σk which we use to calculate risk and reliability 1 pf in this approach 1 3 actual crop water productivity we computed the actual value of cwp based on the yield of each farm and the available water volume calculated according to eq 2 although the crop water productivity is an uncertain value in here it is an important indicator and could also be used to evaluate a farm s sustainability hence it is necessary to analyze this uncertainty and determines the variability range of cwp based on the role of effective factors the hydro module of consumptive water use yield and resulting cwp is affected by crop production soil types and electrical conductivity of irrigation water use ec and the volume of available water thus all of these values need to be monitored and utilized to calculate a farm s cwp we calculated the hydro module hk by dividing the available water volume per farm area lit sec ha we estimated by yield yk dividing crop production per farm area ton ha we calculated crop water productivity lj by dividing crop productivity per the volume of available water kg m3 and defined j 1 nj as the class number we classified electrical conductivity soil type and yield based on a mont carle method classifying each of these using three classes low normal and high over their variability range e g we shaped 27 classes in this study and we defined the variability ranges of cwp in each class nj 27 each class j describes a set of farms and we assigned the calculated value of cwp to each farm we applied observed values of yield and water availability to calculate the cwp for each farm lk which is affected by soil type ec and yield factors each class has maximum medium minimum and the range of a farm s cwp due to the effects of unpredictable factors on crop production we created each class range based on the farm s soil yield and water salinity assuming a normal distribution for the probability function of each class of cwp we consider a load function in eq 1 and develop it as following 10 f l j l 1 σ j 2 π e l k l j 2 2 σ j 2 here the calculated cwp of each farm is l j and the variation range of its class is σj and they can be computed via the following equations 11 c w p j l j 1 n j k n j 1 1 n j l k 12 σ j 1 n j k n j 1 1 n j l k l j 2 1 4 management coefficient to evaluate production sustainability on each farm it is necessary to determine by how much the cwp value can increase this value may be defined as the potential value of cwp and can be used as a reference point for each farmer providing an estimate for similar yields for corresponding soil and water properties usually the cwp value is calculated as yield per water use and is a function of soil water climate and practical management on each farm many studies tried to estimate the cwp value based on impact parameters for wheat crop production as well as describing several models to present relationships between cwp and yield values e g a farm that used 5660m3 of water and produced three tons of wheat per hectare has a crop water productivity of 0 53kg m3 an analysis of referencing values revealed that the crop water productivity could range between 0 8 and 1 2 with this level of wheat production liu et al 2007 defining potential values of cwp and their range is inaccurate it is not a meaningful indication value and it is only a reference point for comparing farms however dividing cwp s obtained for each farm per the potential values will be the basis for calculating management coefficient mc as following 13 m c k l k r k this indicator will quantify the used resource efficiency in the field furthermore the management coefficient variations can be utilized to evaluate production sustainability the farm with the highest value of mc is the best farm though compared to other farms it does not have the highest value of yield or the maximum amount of cwp this farm competently adapted management methods as a response to climate change and water availability 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the kamin region in the fars province iran has a geographical area of 1754km2 and a semi arid climate regime fig 2 average rainfall is 280mm with a maximum of 519mm and a minimum of 152 5mm total farmland is 40 000ha with 22 000ha of farms and 600ha of gardens irrigated with groundwater resources between 2014 and 2015 over 95 of all groundwater resources are withdrawn to cover the water demand of agriculture we randomly selected a subset of the irrigation districts with a total area of 7000ha for each district we collected the observed data of one or several adjacent wheat farms the area of these selected districts was about 30 of the total irrigated land the monitored zones were a subunit of the collected data and we assumed that the obtained results can be generalized for the entire farmland via geo statistical methods 2 2 effective parameters on uncertainty of crop water productivity 2 2 1 land suitability land suitability evaluation looks for key production in the region including wheat alfalfa maize and barley covering a total area of 30 000ha based on semi detailed soil studies in this region we defined two soil families and eight soil series in two physiographic units we determined physiological requirements of each crop via described rated base methods for our qualitative evaluation we used land and climatic characteristics along with the growing crop needs based on the means of simple limitation and parametric method stories and root square method the obtained indexes for barley wheat and alfalfa were higher than those for other crops restrictive parameters on crop productivity in the region included soil physical properties such as carbonate contents soil salinity and drainage along with climatic variables the variation ranged from 0 to 100 demonstrating the value of each parameter we calculated the land suitability index for wheat yield by multiplying values as follow if the index is between 70 and 100 the land is suitable s1 if it is between 50 and 75 the land is relatively suitable s2 if it is between 25 and 50 the land is lightly suitable s3 if it is between 0 and 25 the land is unsuitable with the unsuitable classification to suitability potential n1 and any suitability potential n2 in this study we define the key word soil unit to represent the land suitability index for wheat at each farm and extend its values to the whole region via geo statistical methods kriging approach as shown in fig 3 a based on the qualitative evaluation of land suitability soil texture that disables wheat production extends from the southern to central flat plain and expected yields are low however suitable soil classes are situated in northern to central parts and their yields were expected to be better in comparison 2 2 2 available water and water quality recent droughts as well as the use of uncontrolled groundwater sources have caused a significant drop of the groundwater level in most plains of iran such as the kamin plain and as a result this region faces a new challenge of water restriction as a result of the water crisis accurate estimations of crop water requirements gross irrigation requirements hydro module and the volume of groundwater pumping are essential however this is not possible without accurate estimations of irrigation efficiencies in each plain when more than et water used is considered the term irrigation efficiency is used to define the effectiveness of the irrigation system in delivering all the water beneficially used to produce the crop irrigation efficiency is defined as the ratio of the volume of water that is beneficially used to the volume of irrigation water applied water losses that occur as a result of excessive deep percolation runoff weed et wind drift and spray droplet evaporation are normally not considered as beneficial uses and thus tend to decrease irrigation efficiency a major problem with using irrigation efficiency as a performance parameter is the subjectivity involved in the definition of beneficial use most irrigation systems in kamin are operated primarily to supply water for crop et which allows water application efficiency and irrigation efficiency to be used interchangeably other factors that impact beneficial uses and thus irrigation efficiency are local water regulation agency allocation rules and farmer practiced irrigation management strategies the overall irrigation efficiency represents the efficiency of the entire physical system and operating decisions in delivering irrigation water from a water supply source to the target crop it is calculated by multiplying the efficiencies of water conveyance and water application irmak et al 2011 in the kamin plain we selected several farms according to the level of implemented under pressure irrigation the total irrigated area of cultivation and the kinds of irrigation method traditional or modern system we determined available water and irrigation efficiency based on a field survey and farm measurements of several irrigated districts we measured quantity and quality of water use withdrawn from wells in selected farms based on measurement values and the geo statistical method simple kriging approach we modeled the spatial distributions of water quality and quantity and depict the results in fig 3 d and b according to the different levels of crop cultivation specially crop pattern we calculated the annual hydro module by dividing the water use volume by farm size during growing season defined as lit sec ha here farms hydro module has changed from 0 26 to 1 36 and its distribution is shown in fig 3 b then we extended the hydro module spatial variability to the whole region using the geo statistical method simple kriging approach and depict the results in fig 3 b our results reveal that only in a small part of this region hydro module was more than 1 0 lit sec ha but for most parts of the region hydro module was smaller than 0 8 lit sec ha also we calculated the hydro module for each month with a maximal value in july and with an amount of 1 3 lit sec ha we measured electrical conductivity ec of the irrigated water of selected farms as a water quality index the spatial variation of ec in the region was 0 5 5 2 ds m2 by using simple kriging approach we modeled and expanded these variations to the whole region fig 3 d ec fluctuations matched the land suitability results but did not show any consistent trend in relation to yield 2 2 3 spatial variability of yield all factors affecting the uncertainty of crop water productivity also had an effect on yield we applied the yield to determine cwp as a management coefficient and to assess the crop production of each farm and the resulting resources sustainability therefore determining the relationship between variations in yield and these factors is necessary to evaluate the range of cwp as a result we made an effort to find the spatial relationship between yield and the factors mentioned water salinity soil unit and hydro module with geo statistical simulation methods like co kriging for all cases we calibrated with reasonable accuracy but we found no significant relationship between the measured values of yield and the results of simulation models in the validation phase fig 3 c we tested the relationship between yield and the factors mentioned via multivariate regression and curve fitting methods but without obtaining acceptable results to summarize we were not able to obtain a significant relationship between yield and salinity soil unit and hydro module variables 3 results we measured land suitability water use quality and quantity and yield for each farm within the data collection areas we simulated the yield results based on the geo statistical method kriging approach as shown in fig 3 c the amount of yield changed from 1 to 10 tons per ha throughout the different parts of this study comparing results for the spatial variation model of farm yield and soil classification revealed that the distribution of yield did not match land suitability patterns we observed the highest yields on the southern flat plains 10 tons per hectare while land suitability was not a very good fit for wheat production to find a perfect correlation coefficient between yield and soil unit we used and failed approaches like curve fitting and disjunctive co kriging geo statistical method and ultimately we did not find a model to describe the correlation table 1 subsequently we assumed that the volume of available water could be the reason for differences between land suitability and observed yields a spatial variability comparison of yield and hydro module showed a small relationship between these factors hence we utilized multivariable regression and curve fitting approaches to investigate these issues as a result yield had an improved relationship with hydro module compared to the soil unit however the result was not significant next we considered the spatial relationship between the electrical conductivity ec of the water the hydro module of the available water and soil considering yield via multivariable geo statistical methods such as disjunctive co kriging all of the calibration results of the model were acceptable but we observed many differences between measured and estimated yields in the validation process finally we concluded that no significant correlation existed between the spatial variation of yields and the water quality and quantity due to soil salinity some areas in the sample region were not suitable for wheat production however the land suitability of these areas could be improved by the quality of irrigation water thus it seems that the main yield variations could be affected by imprecise factors such as farm management abolpour et al 2006 abolpour and javan 2007 razavitoosi and samani 2016 therefore we evaluated the effect of these factors on yield via water use efficiency indicators such as crop water productivity the range of cwp as an indicator to classify farms needs to be explained the maximum and minimum amount of cwp obtained in the study area has been creating the variation range used to classify the farms based on a monte carlo approach we placed the variation ranges of yield soil texture and water salinity in the region on three classes for each of these factors and created 27 classes of their fluctuations as a result table 2 we calculated potential and actual values of cwp of farms from eqs 6 and 11 and illustrated average and standard deviation for each class in tables 2 and 3 the results were used to calculate the reliability and risk based on eqs 8 10 climate change cultivation management and water amount affect cwp thus changing it over time even in a same area for that reason maximum and minimum values of cwp observed in the study area were neither certain nor deterministic and they changed in different conditions however when the actual cwp is lower than the potentially possible value farmers over impacted the water resources to achieve more yields at the cost of future sustainability of production in this region therefore potential values of cwp and the corresponding range could be defined as production sustainability indicator similar to liu et al 2007 and faramarzi et al 2010 we used the following equation to calculate the uncertainty range of cwp the equation was developed based on measured yield and water use from each farm obtained from real data rather than estimated data 14 cwp 0 1 yield 0 1 r2 0 69 p 0 01 although increasing water use causes also increases crop production crop water productivity may subsequently be reduced each crop needs enough water to increase production as long as the crop water productivity does not reduce determining the expected performance and required water volume per unit area has therefore become vitally important however a reliable determination of water demand is difficult due to the role of other production factors in performance and even more so due to unstable and uncertain conditions for the estimation of water supply capacity therefore it is necessary to define the optimal point of water use in this condition we illustrate this point in fig 4 where risk and performance curves intersect in addition the curves of lower and upper limits of our risk and performance predictions are depicted in fig 4 α 0 01 we located the optimal condition within the area of hydro module from 0 33 to 0 63 with an optimal value of 0 44 lit sec ha in this optimum rage we obtained values of 12 to 38 for risk and 62 to 88 for performance based on the results presented in fig 4 risk increases and performance decreases when the hydro module was raised as following 15 r i s k α r β r h 16 p e r f α p β p h where αr 65 and αp 35 βr βp 17 and h is the hydro module by lit sec ha p 0 01 we obtained these equations based on a curve fitting analysis and the results are shown in table 4 we calculated the management coefficient by dividing the cwp of each farm by the potential values eq 13 and extended its spatial variability to the whole region via geo statistical methodology simple kriging approach the results for this are shown in fig 5 comparing these results between the distribution maps of yield soil class and quantity and quality of water use fig 3 and the results of management coefficient distribution fig 5 revealed that mc variations did not match the spatial distribution patterns of these factors however the mc distribution map reveals a clear pattern and this region can be divided into two parts one with good management and another with poor management because of this it seems that groupie management or colony farmers is the main reason affecting mc variations as a consequence each colony needs a groupie manager who is a leader and provides a pattern for the other farmers fig 6 shows the farms with optimal performance improved crop water productivity and high probability for yield in these farms 26 of a total of 666 wheat farms had a hydro module of 0 44 lit sec ha crop water productivity ranging between 0 7 and 1 00kg m3 and a probability of high wheat production of more than 70 comparing the results of figs 5 and 6 shows that the colonies are located according to these farms as a result they competently adapted their management methods with climate change and water availability finally these farms were sustainable farms and their yield and water use can be used as a suitable reference to determine expected yield and required water volume per area unit some of the production factors on the superior farms were compared with other farms table 5 comparing the mean values showed that except hydro module of water use and cwp other factors don t have significant changes with the superior farms the comparison of minimum each factor was similar to the above case but in maximum the differences were significant for example the maximum area of farms was 70ha in the region but it was 17ha in the superior farms table 5 therefore the farms lower than 20ha have the better adaptation with the fluctuations of water resource capacity other factors which can have the role in superiority of these farms are the suitable irrigation duration based on the chemical and physical characteristic of soil and the farm level the irrigation duration more than 36days was observed in this region whereas it was 10days for superior farms table 5 it can be concluded that complying the irrigation duration and farm level has a role in improving management efficiency and creating optimum conditions in the farmland the maximum depth of groundwater level was 90m around the superior farms but it was 125m on the other sites in the superior farms the maximum withdrawal of groundwater resources was less than 20 lit sec and it was observed more than 30lit sec on the other sites table 5 therefore one of the major achievements of the superior farms modeling is sustainability of groundwater resources in which case the reduction in groundwater withdrawal will be more than 34 the maximum of irrigation efficiency was 57 in the superior farms whereas 67 was also observed for irrigation efficiency in the region but they were being out of the category of superior farms table 5 therefore opinion of increasing irrigation efficiency to create superior farms is not correct the maximum of crop production was 10 tons per hectare in the region but in the superior farms were produced 9 tons per hectare on the maximum conditions table 5 therefore it is observed that the choosing superior farms is not only due to increase in production sometimes in order to increase the production water use has increased and it has been approved when cwp of top farms were compared with others the cwp s mean of superior farms and other farms were equal 1 and 0 54 respectively which is about 100 increase in cwp table 5 but considerable matter is that the superior farms merely because the increase in cwp were not selected for example in the region was also observed the cwp more than 2 but these farms were being out of the selected group by the here model presented the reason for this is that it has no enough credit in comparison with the cwp s region potential and also it was outside of the limitations boundary of uncertainty conditions it may be only in specific circumstances and probably happened for one year therefore because of high risk of acquiring this cwp these farms omitted in the model this issues also observed when the minimum and the standard deviation of cwp s superior farms were compared with the others for example the cwp s range of superior farms was 0 7 1 5 with 0 2 standard deviation but it was 0 3 2 14 with 0 4 standard deviation in the region table 5 therefore it seems that superior farms had proper cwp with the high reliability and a lesser amount of risk the variable range of the benefit per cost of the whole region and the superior farms has no significant difference according to result water management and production type in superior farms has no more cost for farmers but also increase their farms income so it seems that this type of water use management and crop produce would be better for them table 5 comparing hydro module is showed to reduce 27 between 0 47 of superior farms with 0 64 of other farms lit sec based on the results it is confirmed that due to comply the different sustainable aspects on superior farms including production factors economic and social issues they had achieved to stability conditions 4 conclusion for a specific yield the calculated values of crop water productivity decreased one to one from eqs 3 to 5 and 14 e g according to the average yield in the region of about 5 tons per hectare calculated values of cwp were 1 2 1 1 0 74 and 0 6 respectively comparing these values indicated that the crop water productivity in this region was nearly half of the normally expected values since the yield was kept constant in our calculations the result can only be explained by additional water use we conducted this study to find the spatial distribution models for yield quality and quantity of water use and land suitability index using geo statistical analyses furthermore via multivariate regression curve fitting and geo statistical methods we tested the relationship between yield and mentioned factors but did not obtain a satisfactory result not only were the spatial variations of these parameters not simulated but also the spatial classifications of these parameters were not zoned clearly fig 3 however the management coefficient variations were simulated with a spatially classified separate zone fig 5 therefore it seems that the effects of management by the farmer towards a sustainable production were more significant than other basic production factors such as soil water and climate change groupie management or colony farmers could affect this management hence the management coefficient we introduced in this study can show the role of these factors on sustainable water use it is worth noting that the difference between locally and globally calculated values of cwp could be caused by the changing climate of recent years due to climate change the water volume has been receding and irrigation has been increased to maintain production therefore management plays a role in increased productivity in recent years weakness of production management caused intensification of resources pressure and yield sustainability our results indicate that wheat farms could reduce risk by 25 13 by adopting best practices of efficient farms deficiency of irrigation water and poor land quality are two fundamental constraints to increase reliability by 75 13 in the region because of subsidies such as seed fertilizer and credit the produced wheat is costlier than other crops and continually causes change in cropping patterns the results of suggested analysis could create a sustained cropping pattern through effective management and additional investments in both land and water resources

11616,the seeds of cassia obtusifolia l are widely used in traditional chinese medicine and health tea the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of water availability on plant growth seed yield and seed quality in c obtusifolia for improving its cultivation pot and field irrigation experiments were conducted in qingdao of china in 2013 and 2014 respectively seven water irrigation treatments including 100 90 80 70 60 50 and 40 of field capacity fc in pot experiments while five water irrigation treatments including 100 85 70 55 and 40 of field capacity fc in field experiments were applied on the plant of c obtusifolia respectively in both experiments the results showed that different drought stress significantly resulted in different reduction in plant growth and seed yield attributes of c obtusifolia and more pronounced with the severity of drought however as for the seed quality attributes both results showed that weak and moderate drought stress significantly increased the content of anthraquinones plant secondary metabolites while significantly decreased the content of protein plant primary metabolites in the seeds of c obtusifolia except that strong drought stress significantly decreased both of them notably the weak drought stress 70 fc in pot and in field did not decrease the seed yield significantly which resulted in a biggest harvest index among other treatments and thus resulted in the highest anthraquinones yields per plant in addition results showed that strong and moderate drought stress affected the proportion between hydrophilic and lipophilic anthraquinones in seed of c obtusifolia significantly our study suggested that a certain of deficit irrigation has the potential to compromise seed yield and seed quality of c obtusifolia which can be used as a practical irrigation strategy for cultivation improving of c obtusifolia as a medicinal plant keywords cassia obtusifolia l deficit irrigation anthraquinones 1 introduction the ripe seed of cassia obtusifolia l called as jue ming zi in chinese has been widely used as traditional herbal medicine or health tea in china for improving eyesight alleviating constipation and lowering hypertension and hyperlipidemia china pharmacopoeia committee 2010 hao et al 2001 xiao 2002 several classes of bioactive metabolites have been identified from the seeds of c obtusifolia including anthraquinones sterols triterpenoids and xanthones etc hao et al 2001 sob et al 2010 tang et al 2015 xiao 2002 xu et al 2012 zhang et al 2009 in which anthraquinones are the most abundant group of active metabolites in the seeds of c obtusifolia and the contents of aurantio obtusin and chrysophanol are important indicators for the quality of raw herbal materials and related products of c obtusifolia seeds china pharmacopoeia committee 2010 numerous health promoting activities such as anti cancer neuroprotective and anti hypercholesterolemic effects and inhibition of oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein have been reported particularly in c obtusifolia seed extracts ju et al 2010 kim et al 2011 patil et al 2004 sob et al 2010 tang et al 2015 consumer awareness and knowledge about the health benefits of c obtusifolia have greatly stimulated marketing and consumption of c obtusifolia seed products and the demand for this plant has increased rapidly in recent years in asia the cultivation of c obtusifolia was developed widely in 29 countys of 7 provinces of china including qingdao of shandong province thus there is considerable interest in the development of cultivation technology to improve both yield and quality of this medicinal plant the yield and quality of medicinal plants when cultivated are strongly influenced by growing conditions such as temperature light regime soil nutrient supply soil water availability etc guo et al 2013 ncube et al 2012 ncube and van staden 2015 ramakrishna and ravishankar 2011 water availability is a most important abiotic factor influencing all plant physiological process including primary and secondary metabolism during whole plant life cycle including vegetative and reproductive growth water availability deviating from the optimum has an effect on the rate of relevant physiological processes thereby constituting a water stress to the plant water stress is generally considered as negative factor being responsible for severe yield losses in agriculture however a large numbers of studies manifested that plants exposed to water stress accumulate higher concentrations of secondary metabolites and thus a better quality resulted in many medicinal plants kleinwächter and selmar 2015 kleinwächter et al 2015 li et al 2011 selmar and kleinwächter 2013a b this poses a dilemma for a herb grower to yield or to quality the need for an irrigation regime suitable for balancing the yield and quality in medicinal plant cultivation is therefore of vital importance with c obtusifolia though widely cultivated in china water availability induced variations in yield and quality have not been fully understood and whether water availability treatments have the potential to compromise yield and quality have not been investigated deliberately therefore searching for an irrigation schedule for cultivation control of this herbal medicine that would cater for a balance between yield and quality is a major justification of the present study meanwhile this study try to provide a preliminary foundation for elucidating the mechanisms of variations in yield and quality of this herbal medicine under different water availability 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site pot experiments were conducted during croping season of c obtusifolia under natural day night conditions from

water deficit treatment pot treatments were imposed from the 51th to the 204th das may 21 2013 to october 21 2013 seven water treatments were predefined in this experiments including 100 of fc as control and 6 levels of deficit irrigation at 90 80 70 60 50 and 40 of fc respectively at the beginning of pot treatments from the 51th to the 70th das may 21 2013 to june 9 2013 water loss of all the pots were determined by weighing the pots daily using the electronic weighing devices until soil water depletion reached their respective target levels different group of pots were weighed on every three days and watered to their respective weight on every three or six or nine days to maintain the soil moisture content at 100 90 80 70 60 50 and 40 of fc respectively table 2 there were seven replications per treatment arranged in a completely randomized block design totally 49 pots in order to eliminate the interference of plant weights one pot from each replication kept with same weight soil but without plants was weighed and watered in its respective way for monitoring soil water loss in the absence of the plants plants of all treatments were observed and recorded for plant growth and seed yield attributes from the beginning of water availability treatments and till they were sampled at harvest october 21 in 2013 for determination of plant growth seed yield and quality attributes field treatments were imposed from the 51th to the 191th das may 21 2014 to october 8 2014 five water treatments were predefined in this experiments including 100 of fc as control and 4 levels of deficit irrigation at 85 70 55 and 40 of fc respectively at the beginning of field treatments from the 51th to the 71th das may 21 2014 to june 10 2014 the soil water contents swc of all the plots were determined daily by a portable soil moisture monitoring system diviner 2000 sentek pty ltd australia after the swc reached their respective predefined target levels different plots were determined continuely on every three days and then the irrigation amounts were calculated using the following formula huang 2007 irrigation a m o u n t s mm 1000 θ t a r θ a c t z r where ɵ tar is the target soil water contents m3 m 3 ɵ act is the actual soil water contents m3 m 3 zr is the average maximum rooting depth 0 6m in this experiments in this experiment groundwater recharge runoff and deep percolation can be ignored because of deep groundwater level no rainfall and shallow depth of wetted soil of drip irrigation in the experimental area according to the calculated data different plots were irrigated to their respective swc on every three or six days to maintain the average swc at 100 85 70 55 and 40 of fc respectively table 3 all the treatments were completely randomized block design with three replicates totally 15 plots plants of all treatments were observed and recorded for plant growth and seed yield attributes from the beginning of water availability treatments and till they were sampled at harvest october 8 in 2014 for determination of plant growth seed yield and quality attributes 2 3 experimental measurements 2 3 1 vegetative growth attributes in pot experiments number of branches and leaves of the selected plants one in each pot were observed and recorded during plant growth and after sampled at harvest plants from each treatment were harvested with the roots and washed with tap water to remove adhering foreign particles they were surface dried thereafter using blotting sheets the plant shoot height was measured using a measuring tape fresh weight of the plant including root and shoot was recorded using electronic balance dry weight of plant including root and shoot was recorded after drying them at 60 c ratio of root to shoot of dry

room temperature to this 0 5ml of folin phenol reagent was added repidly and kept for additional 30min absorbance of the blue colored complex was recorded at 650nm on a spectrophotometer uv9100b labtech china the protein content in seed of c obtusifolia was estimated with a calibration curve obtained using a known graded dilutions of standard bovine serum albumin solution the individual anthraquinone contents in seed of c obtusifolia were analyzed following the method of xu et al 2012 with some modification the powder of c obtusifolia seed 1g accurately weighed was refluxed with 100ml of 80 ethanol for 2 5h in a soxhlet extractor then the extract was filtered and evaporated to dryness in a rotary evaporator afterwards the residue was hydrolyzed with 50ml of 2mol l hcl in 98 100 c water bath for 3h after cooling the hydrolysate was extracted with 30ml chloroform for 4 times and the extraction was merged together and evaporated to dryness in a rotary evaporator the residue was redissolved and transferred into a 10ml volumetric flask by methanol finally the sample solution was filtrated through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane filter prior to injection standard compounds of aurantio obtusin 1 aloe emodin 2 rhein 3 obtusifolin 4 emodin 5 chrysophanol 6 and physcion 7 were purchased from the http www guidechem com hangzhou china the stock standard solutions were prepared by dissolving 10mg of pure compounds in 10ml methanol to yield a nominal content of 1 00mg ml respectively the stock standard solutions were further diluted in methanol to produce standard working calibration solutions at a series of contents the linearity of each standard curve was confirmed by plotting the peak area against the corresponding content of the standards the seven individual anthraquinone constituents were identified by comparing their retention times with authentic standards the individual anthraquinone contents were calculated by comparing peak areas of

by 6 42 11 13 17 73 58 24 67 36 77 40 respectively table 4 these results clearly showed that drought stress hampered the growth but the degrees of growth reduction were depending on the severity of drought treatment from very slight to extremely severe when compared to control treatment 100 fc these results also indicated that in comparison with the control treatment 100 fc the weak water stress treatments from 90 to 80 to 70 of fc did not significantly decrease all the growth parameters though gradually obviously whereas these growth parameters were gradually significantly affected by moderate 60 50 fc and strong 40 fc drought stress table 4 in pot experiments we observed significant differences in plant root and shoot fresh weights root and shoot dry weights among seven water availability treatments table 4 compared with control treatment 100 fc the root and shoot fresh weights of the plants subjected to 90 80 70 60 50 and 40 of fc water deficit treatments decreased by 4

and 40 of fc water deficit treatments increased by 0 00 1 37 7 27 30 16 33 52 43 95 respectively when compared with control treatment 100 fc table 4 in field experiments we also determined the root dry weights the shoot dry weights the ratio of root to shoot and the total dry weights of c obtusifolia plants subjected to five water availability treatments and results were shown in fig 1 which these results presented a similar trend as in pot experiments compared with control treatment 100 fc the total dry weights of the plants subjected to 85 70 55 and 40 of fc water deficit treatments decreased by 7 72 22 70 45 48 71 89 respectively while the root and shoot dry weights of the plants subjected to 85 70 55 and 40 of fc water deficit treatments decreased by 4 89 15 22 33 33 54 35 and

irrigation treaments 100 of fc is not in favor of the yield attributes including pod numbers per plant seed numbers per pod 100 seed weights and seed yield per plant weak drought stress 90 80 70 of fc increased them slightly though not significantly while moderate 60 50 of fc and strong 40 of fc drought stress decreased them gradually significantly as for harvest index weak drought stress 90 80 70 of fc increased them gradually significantly while moderate 60 50 of fc and strong 40 of fc drought stress decreased them gradually significantly when compared with the control 100 fc notably maximum harvest index were observed in the weak drought stress 70 fc when compared with other treatments table 5 in field experiments we determined the seed yield per plant and harvest index of c obtusifolia plants subjected to five water availability treatments and results were shown in fig 2 which these results presented a similar trend as in pot experiments compared with control treatment 100 fc the seed yield per plant in plants subjected to 85 70 55 and 40 of fc water deficit treatments decreased by 3 36 12 06 52 37 and 80 05 however the harvest index in plants subjected to the 85 fc and 70 fc water deficit treatments increased by 11 43 and 17 14 respectively while it was decreased by 8 57 and 25 71 in 55 fc and 40 fc water deficit treatments respectively when compared with the control

treatments changed by 1 49 2 37 10 44 15 09 22 31 and 32 85 respectively in comparison to the control treatment 100 fc table 6 as for the seed protein yield per plant results showed that the seed protein yield per plant of c obtusifolia subjected to 90 80 70 60 50 and 40 of fc water deficit treatments changed by 8 29 4 94 7 52 54 07 69 22 and 84 92 respectively in comparison to the control treatment 100 fc table 6 results showed that the total anthraquinones content in the seeds of c obtusifolia plants subjected to 90 80 70 60 50 and 40 fc water deficit treatments changed by 4 17 44 74 129 19 106 27 74 84 and 17 22 table 6 as for the anthraquinones yield per plant results showed that the anthraquinones yield per plant of c obtusifolia subjected to 90 80 70 60 50 and 40 of fc water deficit treatments changed by 11 04 55 53 136 64 11 58 30 79 and 81 40 respectively in comparison to the control treatment 100 fc table 6 these results indicated that c obtusifolia under weak drought stress especially 70 fc may reach a better balance point between seed yield and seed quality of c obtusifolia cultivated as a medicinal plant table 5 and 6 in field experiments the results of the total protein contents and the total anthraquinone contents in the seeds of c obtusifolia plants subjected to five water availability treatments were shown in fig 3 and results of the seed protein yield per plant and the seed anthraquinone yield per plant of c obtusifolia plants subjected to five water availability treatments were shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 3 compared with control treatment 100 fc as the total protein contents in the seeds of c obtusifolia plants subjected to 85 70 55 and 40 of fc water deficit treatments progressively decreased by 0 03 16 36 24 48 and 46 55 the total anthraquinone contents in the seeds of c obtusifolia subjected to the five water availability treatments present an almost opposite trend of which the total anthraquinone contents increased by 65 70 162 45 and 138 63 in 85 70 and 55 of fc water deficit treatments respectively except that the total anthraquinone contents decreased by 15 88 in 40 of fc water deficit treatments as shown in fig 4 compared with control treatment 100 fc as the seed protein yield per plant of c obtusifolia plants subjected to 85 70 55 and 40 of fc water deficit treatments progressively sharply decreased by 3 91 26 69 64 06 and 91 10 the seed anthraquinone yield per plant of c obtusifolia subjected to the five water availability treatments present a nearly similar trend as the results of the total anthraquinone contents fig 3 of which the seed anthraquinone yield per plant increased by 58 92 112 53 and 19 18 in 85 70 and 55 of fc water deficit treatments respectively except that they decreased by 81 86 in 40 of fc water deficit treatments these results confirmed again that weak drought stress especially 70 fc in field experiments can also compromise seed yield and seed quality of c obtusifolia best as in pot experiments figs 2 4 results of seven individual anthraquinone constituents contents in the seeds of c obtusifolia in pot and field experiments are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively both results presented a roughly similar change trend in the contents of seven individual anthraquinones in the seeds of c obtusifolia caused by similar water treatments between pot and field experiments compared with control treatment 100 fc in pot and field weak water stress from 90 to 80 to 70 fc in pot from 85 to 70 fc in field increase most individual anthraquinones slightly and then significantly and both reach a maximum value in 70 fc in pot and field it keep a relatively higher level in moderate water stress from 60 to 50 fc in pot 55 fc in field but decrease gradually than that in 70 fc in pot and field strong water stress 40 fc in pot and field decrease most individual anthraquinones substantially and significantly except that emodin from 100 to 40 fc in pot and field and physcion from 100 to 50 fc in pot from 100 to 55 fc in field increase continuously both results also presented that almost all the seven anthraquinones constituents were considerably affected by water availability treatments but the contents of relatively hydrophilic aurantio obtusin aloe emodin rhein and obtusifolin and relatively lipophilic emodin chrysophanol and physcion anthraquinones constituents presented different pattern in both experiments the ratio of hydrophilic lipophilic anthraquinones among the seven anthraquinones constituents above mentioned were also determined figs 5 and 6 results showed that the ratio of hydrophilic lipophilic anthraquinones decreased significantly with the severity of drought stress which indicated that the hydrophilic anthraquinones constituents were decreased while the lipophilic anthraquinones were increased by drought treatments 4 discussion as expected drought markedly reduced some growth attributes including plant heights fresh and dry weights branch numbers and leaf numbers but increased the root shoot ratios of c obtusifolia and this effect was more pronounced with the severity of drought table 4 and fig 1 such phenomena repeatedly confirmed in many other plants kerbiriou et al 2013 li et al 2011 liu et al 2011 xu et al 2015 the negative correlations between root and shoot can be explained by balanced growth hypothesis garnier 1991 which states that plants preferentially allocate more biomass to roots when water and nutrients become limited to growth results also showed that drought markedly reduced some yield attributes including pods numbers seeds numbers 100 seed weights and seed yields and this effect was also more pronounced with the severity of drought table 5 and fig 2 as expected it is inevitable because inhibited vegetative growth may decrease the allocation of photosynthates to reproductive structures under drought conditions as the vegetative and reproductive growth hypothesis predicts that there are trade offs between vegetative and reproductive attributes hansen et al 2013 houter and nederhoff 2007 thus we can deduced that the drought condition may be the primary reason for the reduced plant growth and seed yield as other environmental factors was suitable for c obtusifolia in this study however significant differences in the plant growth and seed yield parameters of c obtusifolia under different water treatments were observed both in the pot experiments and in the field experiments compared with the control treatment 100 fc in pot and field moderate 60 and 50 fc in pot 55 fc in field and strong 40 fc in pot and field drought treatment markedly inhibited the growth of plants and resulted in a significant reduced seed yield tables 4 and 5 figs 1 and 2 which may be due to low water availability and the limited absorption of nutrients caused by a reduction in the soil moisture miao et al 2015 and resulted in cell growth and differentiation were seriously restrained under the shortage of water leading to slow development of the seeds belder et al 2004 tardieu et al 2000 but weak drought treatment from 90 to 70 fc in pot from 85 to 70 fc in field only slightly inhibited the growth of plants and resulted in a marginally reduced seed yield tables 4 and 5 figs 1 and 2 notably for both experiments a maximum harvest index presented in 70 fc in pot and field when compared with respective other treatments table 5 fig 2 the reason may be due to two aspects on one hand weak drought treatment 70 fc in pot and field may inhibit an excess of overly vegetative growth caused by the excess of water and fertiliser such as in well watered conditions liu et al 2017 vicente et al 2015 this may reduce competition for photoassimilates by vegetative growth feng et al 2017 on the other hand we noticed that weak drought treatment 70 fc in pot and field may start reproducing at smaller plant sizes and completed reproductive maturity earlier than well watered control conditions personal observation in contrast to the general reductions in plant growth and seed yield the chemical composition in the seed of c obtusifolia i e the most important factors for the seed quality of this medicinal plants presented different tendency between primary metabolites and secondary metabolites the content and yield of seed protein plant primary metabolites in the seed of c obtusifolia were reduced continuously by gradually strengthened drought stress table 6 figs 3 and 4 the content of secondary metabolites some anthraquinones in the seed of c obtusifolia were strongly enhanced by weak drought treatment especially 70 fc in pot and field and moderate drought treatment 60 50 fc in pot 55 fc in field but the yield of these anthraquinones in the seed of c obtusifolia were maximum only in the weak drought treatment especially 70 fc in pot and field which was also closely related to the seed yield per plant table 6 figs 2 4 a large numbers of studies manifested that medicinal plants exposed to drought stress accumulate higher concentrations of secondary metabolites of medicinal benefits than those cultivated under well watered conditions abdul jaleel et al 2007 chung et al 2006 kirakosyan et al 2004 kleinwächter and selmar 2015 kleinwächter et al 2015 li et al 2011 liu et al 2011 nacif de abreu and mazzafera 2005 selmar and kleinwächter 2013a b the reduction of the yield of these anthraquinones in the seed of c obtusifolia under moderate drought treatment 60 50 fc in pot 55 fc in field may due to overly reduced in the seed yield per plant of c obtusifolia table 6 figs 2 4 both the content and the yield of these anthraquinones in the seed of c obtusifolia under strong drought treatment 40 fc in pot and field were reduced drastically table 6 figs 2 4 which the reason may be due to the overly drought seriously inhibited the plant primary metabolism and consequently results in substantial reduction in the allocation to secondary metabolites some theories propose that plant growth was based mainly on plant primary metabolism while plant defense was based mainly on plant secondary metabolism and it can be deduced that there is a trade off between plant primary and secondary metabolism barto and cipollini 2005 haugen et al 2008 houter and nederhoff 2007 huot et al 2014 sudha and ravishankar 2002 these theory also explain that plants in certain situation are able to optimize their trade offs on the basis of the availability of environmental factors when plants are in suitable environments then plant growth and primary metabolism dominates in plants but when environmental factors become stressful plant defense and secondary metabolism is predominant gayler et al 2004 haugen et al 2008 huot et al 2014 le bot et al 2009 matyssek et al 2005 sudha and ravishankar 2002 these trade offs between primary and secondary metabolism has important agricultural production implications on the yield and quality of medicinal plants and thus environmental factors can be used as a switch to regulate the trade off between primary and secondary metabolism in order to compromise between yield and quality of medicinal plants kleinwächter and selmar 2015 kleinwächter et al 2015 ncube et al 2012 ncube and van staden 2015 selmar and kleinwächter 2013a b here our results showed weak drought treatment 70 fc in pot and field can attain higher quantity of better quality seeds of c obtusifolia with anthraquinones as the quality standard table 6 figs 2 6 these results indicated that water availability have the potential to compromise seed yield and seed quality of c obtusifolia as the trade offs between primary and secondary metabolism might be achieved under controlled deficit irrigation which provided that growers had access to quantitative information not only related to yield but also to quality 5 conclusions to improve the cultivation technology of c obtusifolia as a medicinal plant our study tested a hypothesis that regulated water availability may compromise seed yield and seed quality by regulating the plant growth involving the trade off between root and shoot between vegetative and reproductive growth between primary and secondary metabolism in c obtusifolia our results showed that application of regulated deficit irrigation on c obtusifolia plants significantly changed plant growth attributes including the root shoot ratio seed yield attributes including the harvest index seed quality attributes including the accumulation of anthraquinone active constituents of which the weak drought treatment 70 fc in pots and fields had been found to increase the anthraquinone yield of the seeds of c obtusifolia significantly this indicates weak drought treatment such as 70 fc can be a practical irrigation strategy to maximize anthraquinone active constituent yield in c obtusifolia limitation of this study is a lack of information on mechanism of plant secondary metabolism involving the anthraquinones in the seeds of c obtusifolia under drought stress further research needs to be conducted to corroborate these findings acknowledgements this work was supported by the qingdao science and technology development funds of pr china under grant 10 3432 jch 
11616,the seeds of cassia obtusifolia l are widely used in traditional chinese medicine and health tea the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of water availability on plant growth seed yield and seed quality in c obtusifolia for improving its cultivation pot and field irrigation experiments were conducted in qingdao of china in 2013 and 2014 respectively seven water irrigation treatments including 100 90 80 70 60 50 and 40 of field capacity fc in pot experiments while five water irrigation treatments including 100 85 70 55 and 40 of field capacity fc in field experiments were applied on the plant of c obtusifolia respectively in both experiments the results showed that different drought stress significantly resulted in different reduction in plant growth and seed yield attributes of c obtusifolia and more pronounced with the severity of drought however as for the seed quality attributes both results showed that weak and moderate drought stress significantly increased the content of anthraquinones plant secondary metabolites while significantly decreased the content of protein plant primary metabolites in the seeds of c obtusifolia except that strong drought stress significantly decreased both of them notably the weak drought stress 70 fc in pot and in field did not decrease the seed yield significantly which resulted in a biggest harvest index among other treatments and thus resulted in the highest anthraquinones yields per plant in addition results showed that strong and moderate drought stress affected the proportion between hydrophilic and lipophilic anthraquinones in seed of c obtusifolia significantly our study suggested that a certain of deficit irrigation has the potential to compromise seed yield and seed quality of c obtusifolia which can be used as a practical irrigation strategy for cultivation improving of c obtusifolia as a medicinal plant keywords cassia obtusifolia l deficit irrigation anthraquinones 1 introduction the ripe seed of cassia obtusifolia l called as jue ming zi in chinese has been widely used as traditional herbal medicine or health tea in china for improving eyesight alleviating constipation and lowering hypertension and hyperlipidemia china pharmacopoeia committee 2010 hao et al 2001 xiao 2002 several classes of bioactive metabolites have been identified from the seeds of c obtusifolia including anthraquinones sterols triterpenoids and xanthones etc hao et al 2001 sob et al 2010 tang et al 2015 xiao 2002 xu et al 2012 zhang et al 2009 in which anthraquinones are the most abundant group of active metabolites in the seeds of c obtusifolia and the contents of aurantio obtusin and chrysophanol are important indicators for the quality of raw herbal materials and related products of c obtusifolia seeds china pharmacopoeia committee 2010 numerous health promoting activities such as anti cancer neuroprotective and anti hypercholesterolemic effects and inhibition of oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein have been reported particularly in c obtusifolia seed extracts ju et al 2010 kim et al 2011 patil et al 2004 sob et al 2010 tang et al 2015 consumer awareness and knowledge about the health benefits of c obtusifolia have greatly stimulated marketing and consumption of c obtusifolia seed products and the demand for this plant has increased rapidly in recent years in asia the cultivation of c obtusifolia was developed widely in 29 countys of 7 provinces of china including qingdao of shandong province thus there is considerable interest in the development of cultivation technology to improve both yield and quality of this medicinal plant the yield and quality of medicinal plants when cultivated are strongly influenced by growing conditions such as temperature light regime soil nutrient supply soil water availability etc guo et al 2013 ncube et al 2012 ncube and van staden 2015 ramakrishna and ravishankar 2011 water availability is a most important abiotic factor influencing all plant physiological process including primary and secondary metabolism during whole plant life cycle including vegetative and reproductive growth water availability deviating from the optimum has an effect on the rate of relevant physiological processes thereby constituting a water stress to the plant water stress is generally considered as negative factor being responsible for severe yield losses in agriculture however a large numbers of studies manifested that plants exposed to water stress accumulate higher concentrations of secondary metabolites and thus a better quality resulted in many medicinal plants kleinwächter and selmar 2015 kleinwächter et al 2015 li et al 2011 selmar and kleinwächter 2013a b this poses a dilemma for a herb grower to yield or to quality the need for an irrigation regime suitable for balancing the yield and quality in medicinal plant cultivation is therefore of vital importance with c obtusifolia though widely cultivated in china water availability induced variations in yield and quality have not been fully understood and whether water availability treatments have the potential to compromise yield and quality have not been investigated deliberately therefore searching for an irrigation schedule for cultivation control of this herbal medicine that would cater for a balance between yield and quality is a major justification of the present study meanwhile this study try to provide a preliminary foundation for elucidating the mechanisms of variations in yield and quality of this herbal medicine under different water availability 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site pot experiments were conducted during croping season of c obtusifolia under natural day night conditions from

compared with control treatment 100 fc as the seed protein yield per plant of c obtusifolia plants subjected to 85 70 55 and 40 of fc water deficit treatments progressively sharply decreased by 3 91 26 69 64 06 and 91 10 the seed anthraquinone yield per plant of c obtusifolia subjected to the five water availability treatments present a nearly similar trend as the results of the total anthraquinone contents fig 3 of which the seed anthraquinone yield per plant increased by 58 92 112 53 and 19 18 in 85 70 and 55 of fc water deficit treatments respectively except that they decreased by 81 86 in 40 of fc water deficit treatments these results confirmed again that weak drought stress especially 70 fc in field experiments can also compromise seed yield and seed quality of c obtusifolia best as in pot experiments figs 2 4 results of seven individual anthraquinone constituents contents in the seeds of c obtusifolia in pot and field experiments are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively both results presented a roughly similar change trend in the contents of seven individual anthraquinones in the seeds of c obtusifolia caused by similar water treatments between pot and field experiments compared with control treatment 100 fc in pot and field weak water stress from 90 to 80 to 70 fc in pot from 85 to 70 fc in field increase most individual anthraquinones slightly and then significantly and both reach a maximum value in 70 fc in pot and field it keep a relatively higher level in moderate water stress from 60 to 50 fc in pot 55 fc in field but decrease gradually than that in 70 fc in pot and field strong water stress 40 fc in pot and field decrease most individual anthraquinones substantially and significantly except that emodin from 100 to 40 fc in pot and field and physcion from 100 to 50 fc in pot from 100 to 55 fc in field increase continuously both results also presented that almost all the seven anthraquinones constituents were considerably affected by water availability treatments but the contents of relatively hydrophilic aurantio obtusin aloe emodin rhein and obtusifolin and relatively lipophilic emodin chrysophanol and physcion anthraquinones constituents presented different pattern in both experiments the ratio of hydrophilic lipophilic anthraquinones among the seven anthraquinones constituents above mentioned were also determined figs 5 and 6 results showed that the ratio of hydrophilic lipophilic anthraquinones decreased significantly with the severity of drought stress which indicated that the hydrophilic anthraquinones constituents were decreased while the lipophilic anthraquinones were increased by drought treatments 4 discussion as expected drought markedly reduced some growth attributes including plant heights fresh and dry weights branch numbers and leaf numbers but increased the root shoot ratios of c obtusifolia and this effect was more pronounced with the severity of drought table 4 and fig 1 such phenomena repeatedly confirmed in many other plants kerbiriou et al 2013 li et al 2011 liu et al 2011 xu et al 2015 the negative correlations between root and shoot can be explained by balanced growth hypothesis garnier 1991 which states that plants preferentially allocate more biomass to roots when water and nutrients become limited to growth results also showed that drought markedly reduced some yield attributes including pods numbers seeds numbers 100 seed weights and seed yields and this effect was also more pronounced with the severity of drought table 5 and fig 2 as expected it is inevitable because inhibited vegetative growth may decrease the allocation of photosynthates to reproductive structures under drought conditions as the vegetative and reproductive growth hypothesis predicts that there are trade offs between vegetative and reproductive attributes hansen et al 2013 houter and nederhoff 2007 thus we can deduced that the drought condition may be the primary reason for the reduced plant growth and seed yield as other environmental factors was suitable for c obtusifolia in this study however significant differences in the plant growth and seed yield parameters of c obtusifolia under different water treatments were observed both in the pot experiments and in the field experiments compared with the control treatment 100 fc in pot and field moderate 60 and 50 fc in pot 55 fc in field and strong 40 fc in pot and field drought treatment markedly inhibited the growth of plants and resulted in a significant reduced seed yield tables 4 and 5 figs 1 and 2 which may be due to low water availability and the limited absorption of nutrients caused by a reduction in the soil moisture miao et al 2015 and resulted in cell growth and differentiation were seriously restrained under the shortage of water leading to slow development of the seeds belder et al 2004 tardieu et al 2000 but weak drought treatment from 90 to 70 fc in pot from 85 to 70 fc in field only slightly inhibited the growth of plants and resulted in a marginally reduced seed yield tables 4 and 5 figs 1 and 2 notably for both experiments a maximum harvest index presented in 70 fc in pot and field when compared with respective other treatments table 5 fig 2 the reason may be due to two aspects on one hand weak drought treatment 70 fc in pot and field may inhibit an excess of overly vegetative growth caused by the excess of water and fertiliser such as in well watered conditions liu et al 2017 vicente et al 2015 this may reduce competition for photoassimilates by vegetative growth feng et al 2017 on the other hand we noticed that weak drought treatment 70 fc in pot and field may start reproducing at smaller plant sizes and completed reproductive maturity earlier than well watered control conditions personal observation in contrast to the general reductions in plant growth and seed yield the chemical composition in the seed of c obtusifolia i e the most important factors for the seed quality of this medicinal plants presented different tendency between primary metabolites and secondary metabolites the content and yield of seed protein plant primary metabolites in the seed of c obtusifolia were reduced continuously by gradually strengthened drought stress table 6 figs 3 and 4 the content of secondary metabolites some anthraquinones in the seed of c obtusifolia were strongly enhanced by weak drought treatment especially 70 fc in pot and field and moderate drought treatment 60 50 fc in pot 55 fc in field but the yield of these anthraquinones in the seed of c obtusifolia were maximum only in the weak drought treatment especially 70 fc in pot and field which was also closely related to the seed yield per plant table 6 figs 2 4 a large numbers of studies manifested that medicinal plants exposed to drought stress accumulate higher concentrations of secondary metabolites of medicinal benefits than those cultivated under well watered conditions abdul jaleel et al 2007 chung et al 2006 kirakosyan et al 2004 kleinwächter and selmar 2015 kleinwächter et al 2015 li et al 2011 liu et al 2011 nacif de abreu and mazzafera 2005 selmar and kleinwächter 2013a b the reduction of the yield of these anthraquinones in the seed of c obtusifolia under moderate drought treatment 60 50 fc in pot 55 fc in field may due to overly reduced in the seed yield per plant of c obtusifolia table 6 figs 2 4 both the content and the yield of these anthraquinones in the seed of c obtusifolia under strong drought treatment 40 fc in pot and field were reduced drastically table 6 figs 2 4 which the reason may be due to the overly drought seriously inhibited the plant primary metabolism and consequently results in substantial reduction in the allocation to secondary metabolites some theories propose that plant growth was based mainly on plant primary metabolism while plant defense was based mainly on plant secondary metabolism and it can be deduced that there is a trade off between plant primary and secondary metabolism barto and cipollini 2005 haugen et al 2008 houter and nederhoff 2007 huot et al 2014 sudha and ravishankar 2002 these theory also explain that plants in certain situation are able to optimize their trade offs on the basis of the availability of environmental factors when plants are in suitable environments then plant growth and primary metabolism dominates in plants but when environmental factors become stressful plant defense and secondary metabolism is predominant gayler et al 2004 haugen et al 2008 huot et al 2014 le bot et al 2009 matyssek et al 2005 sudha and ravishankar 2002 these trade offs between primary and secondary metabolism has important agricultural production implications on the yield and quality of medicinal plants and thus environmental factors can be used as a switch to regulate the trade off between primary and secondary metabolism in order to compromise between yield and quality of medicinal plants kleinwächter and selmar 2015 kleinwächter et al 2015 ncube et al 2012 ncube and van staden 2015 selmar and kleinwächter 2013a b here our results showed weak drought treatment 70 fc in pot and field can attain higher quantity of better quality seeds of c obtusifolia with anthraquinones as the quality standard table 6 figs 2 6 these results indicated that water availability have the potential to compromise seed yield and seed quality of c obtusifolia as the trade offs between primary and secondary metabolism might be achieved under controlled deficit irrigation which provided that growers had access to quantitative information not only related to yield but also to quality 5 conclusions to improve the cultivation technology of c obtusifolia as a medicinal plant our study tested a hypothesis that regulated water availability may compromise seed yield and seed quality by regulating the plant growth involving the trade off between root and shoot between vegetative and reproductive growth between primary and secondary metabolism in c obtusifolia our results showed that application of regulated deficit irrigation on c obtusifolia plants significantly changed plant growth attributes including the root shoot ratio seed yield attributes including the harvest index seed quality attributes including the accumulation of anthraquinone active constituents of which the weak drought treatment 70 fc in pots and fields had been found to increase the anthraquinone yield of the seeds of c obtusifolia significantly this indicates weak drought treatment such as 70 fc can be a practical irrigation strategy to maximize anthraquinone active constituent yield in c obtusifolia limitation of this study is a lack of information on mechanism of plant secondary metabolism involving the anthraquinones in the seeds of c obtusifolia under drought stress further research needs to be conducted to corroborate these

11617,this study was planned for investigating the role of biodegradable cellulose based superabsorbent polymers in the management of water irrigation systems in bean crop cultivations in areas affected by water scarcity the paper focused the attention on the bean crop phaseolus vulgaris l cultivated in the mediterranean region during the summer seasons characterised by optimal thermal conditions but with a systematic absence of water for irrigation due to the low level of precipitations we analysed the performance and the role of cellulose based superabsorbent in the irrigation systems where it is necessary to ensure a continuous and adequate level of soil moisture based on crop evapotranspiration demand calculated from the analysis of weather data deficits and full drip irrigation strategies were applied full and deficit irrigation treatments received 100 70 and 50 of evapotranspiration demand respectively in addition given amounts of superabsorbent polymer granules saps were mixed with the soil in particular 0 5 and 10g were added to the soil for full and deficit irrigation treatments this study highlights a significant difference between the treatments the combination of deficit irrigation and soil amendment hydrogel leads to a maximization of the crop water productivity index in fact the highest water use efficiency indexes were obtained with soil amendment hydrogel strategies under water deficit irrigation conditions our findings could be useful to optimize the consume of water resources in bean crop cultivations in the mediterranean regions keywords water deficit irrigation water use efficiency superabsorbent polymers time domain reflectometry monitoring bean crop 1 introduction to date the water scarcity has strongly required new

efficiency of the drip irrigated orange trees and corn under the mediterranean climatic conditions were highlighted nowadays drip irrigation is extremely widespread all over the world for its capability of providing small quantities of water if compared to other irrigation systems bozkurt et al 2006 yaghi et al 2013 directly and slowlyin the nearby of the plant roots besides drip irrigation used as a strategy to increase irrigation efficiency biswas et al 2015 the employment of superabsorbent polymers which can retain water and thus increase the capacity of soil to store and release water under irrigation deficiency preserving the plant growth should be taken into account the quality of irrigation plays an important role in the bean crop production in the mediterranean area the common bean phaseolus vulgaris l is the most important worldwide legume for human consumption because it is a source of proteins jones 1999 builes et al 2011 this cultivation requires a high temperature and appropriate soil moisture for a good harvest the thermal conditions favorable for plants occur in the summer season when the rains are not abundant and able to guarantee a good level of soil moisture drip irrigation technique provides water at a slow application rate only to the plant root zone thus smaller quantities of water are used to the utmost efficiency allen 1998 simsek et al 2011 this is very important because water is not lost through drainage but after irrigation the superabsorbent granules applied in the soil around the root zone absorb the water by swelling and then release it slowly through a diffusive mechanism as the soil dries out cannazza et al 2014 demitri et al 2013 the total available soil water in the root zone taw is the amount of water that a crop can extract from its root zone calculated from the equation 1 t a w a w c d r z where awc is the available water capacity of the root zone mm of water per mm of soil and drz is the depth of root zone that changes with development phases mm in irrigation practice a management allowed the depletion mad of the taw must be specified because water stress occurs before soil water is depleted up to the welting point pwp thus only a percentage of taw is allowed to be consumed this taw fraction is called readily available soil water in the root zone raw and can be expressed in terms of depth of water mm using the following equation 2 r a w m a d t a w where mad is the amount of water to be removed from plants before irrigation so that undesirable crop water stress does not occur as reported by allen 1998 for dry bean crop the soil water depletion should not exceed 45 percent of the total soil water available almost the whole water uptake by the plants from the soil is lost as evapotranspiration et and the measurement of the crop evapotranspiration etc on a daily scale and for the whole vegetative cycle is equal to the water requirement of the given crop allen 1998 katerji and rana 2008 in this work in order to assess the irrigation efficiency and effectiveness and exploit the rain potential to the full an innovative class of biodegradable cellulose based superabsorbent hydrogel was used as a water reservoir in the cultivation of bean crop in the mediterranean area in particular the superabsorbent hydrogels used are a particular class of totally biodegradable and biocompatible macromolecular gels which can be mixed with the soil in the proximity of plant roots these granules mixed with the soil in given amounts absorb water during irrigation then as the soil gets dry they release water slowly and in this way water is not lost through drainage or evaporation because it is retained by superabsorbent hydrogel cannazza et al 2014 demitri et al 2013 sannino and nicolais 2005 sannino et al 2009 in arid areas during dry seasons this function is extremely important as the hydrogel holds soil moisture to be returned when required by the plant root system in addition as reported in cannazza et al 2014 when the hydrogel granules swell soil porosity increases providing the plant root zone with a better oxygenation this paper deals with the influences of sap in combination with drip irrigation in deficit irrigation conditions to this purpose sap was employed in a cultivation of a local population of dry bean in order to evaluate the possibility to reduce water irrigation but at the same time ensuring a sufficient water supply to the plant roots when needed therefore as reported by benlhabib et al 2014 a proper agricultural management with the selection of appropriate crops and varieties of crops as well as the use of technologies in water management can affect the productivity and sustainability of cropping systems in a positive way in fact the local population of dry bean used in this study was little susceptible to water stress in a previous experimental test under water deficit conditions in the same area satriani et al 2015 thus confirming that the decision to use local varieties can be a strategy towards a reduction in water consumption in agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental details a field experiment was

basilicata region southern italy fig 1 only a bean cultivar was chosen for field testing in order to eliminate differences in yield response between cultivars and assess the sap treatment in optimal and stress irrigation conditions in fact during the growing season between the months of june and september the field study was carried out for a local population dry bean phaseolus vulgaris l named fagiolo rosso scritto the bean crop in the research area characterised by a mediterranean climate with dry summers is possible only with irrigation because the amount of rainfall is not often sufficient to satisfy the need for water supply for irrigation wet sieving has been used to separate different particle size fractions into sediments in the soil samples collected within the first 60cm of soil profile and by the granulometric analysis the soil was classified as silty clay loam astm d422 63 2007 table 1 reports the soil physical characteristics the soil chemical analysis was carried out based on the methods of soil chemical and physical analysis as described in the italian official gazette n 248 of 21 10 1999 for the first 60cm of soil layer soil organic matter was 34 9g kg alkaline reaction with a ph of 7 6 total nitrogen was 2 1g kg available p and k were 53 0 and 317 0mg kg respectively for the experiment at hand the seeds were hand sown on may 29 2015 on rows 2m long and 1 5m apart a drip irrigation system was installed before sowing and placed at each row with drippers spaced every 20cm one flow meter has recorded the amount of water applied in each irrigation event after sowing an irrigation water equal to 20mm was given and after the emergence plants were thinned to secure one plant every 20cm within the rows 10 plants for row and in correspondence of each dripper a single bean plant was placed in order to optimize the use of irrigation water and especially reduce the consumption of water after the emergence cellulose based superabsorbent polymer sap was mixed with the soil close to the plant at a depth of 10cm about in particular the sap used is the result of a synthesis process where the carbohymethy lcellulose sodium salt and hydroxyethylcellulose were the precursors of the hydrogel synthesis demitri et al 2013 its peculiarity is that it is completely biodegradable this field experiment was performed as a randomized block design with 4 replications fig 2 the polymer is currently produced in the laboratory and for the limited amount available in order to verify its efficacy just a few different irrigation water amounts with different levels of superabsorbent were considered treatment a with irrigation amounting to 100 etc demand and with 0 0g sap i100 no sap applied treatment b with

daily reference crop evapotranspiration et0 was obtained by using the methods by blaney criddle and hargreaves allen et al 1994 and the empirical formulae use meteorological data provided by a weather station located in the experimental farm the crop water requirements etc were determined using a crop coefficient kc multiplied et0 in particular crops kc equal to 0 4 1 2 and 0 35 during the initial the mid season and the late season stage were used respectively allen 1998 the amount of water to be applied iwa in an irrigation event during the vegetative cycle to return 100 of the evapotranspiration demand was determined using the following equation 3 i w a s w d e t c e a where iwa is the irrigation water applied mm or lm 2 swd is the soil water deficit on the previous day mmday 1 etc is the crop water requirements mmday 1 ea is the application efficiency that was considered equal to 90 for drip irrigation allen 1998 a real time monitoring of soil moisture content was carried out by means of the multiplexing time domain reflectometry system model trase 6050 3k1 soilmoisture equipment corp california usa the system was remotely controlled by a computer connected to the internet network tdr provides an indirect measurement of the soil water content by measuring the travel time that the electromagnetic wave employs to propagate through the thickness of the soil to be reflected at the end of probe and to return back roth et al 1992 topp et al 1980 six 20cm long tdr waveguides were installed vertically in the 5 25cm soil depths relative to the soil surface in the middle of the rows of blocks 2 and 3 fig 2 the waveguides were installed after the first 5cm of soil because the surface layer is subject to soil moisture changes mainly due to direct insulation the extent of the field does not allow installing tdr waveguides in all four plots and connecting them to the data logger to acquire soil moisture this restriction will be overcome in the future using a wireless probe system during harvest which took place in the second half of october 2015 the pods of 10 plants were taken from each rows after leaving the plants to dry in field and the grain weight was measured for each treatment grain yield per hectare was determined by product between the average weight of the dry bean seeds per plant multiplied by the average number of bean plants per hectare about 33335 plants ha with rows 1 5m apart irrigation water use efficiency index iwue was calculated as grain yield divided by applied water during the whole growing time agricultural water productivity index awp was calculated as grain yield divided by total water use jensen 1983 molden et al 2010 2 3 statistical analysis all the data collected were statistically analysed origin originlab corporation northampton usa and xlstat for microsoft excel addinsoft 2015 codes were used to carry out the analysis of variance anova to test the difference in grain yield and wue between different treatments the treatment means were compared by using the tukey s test and the probability level for the determination of significance was set at 5 gomez and gomez 1984 kao and green 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 patterns of evapotranspiration and soil moisture under different water and sap supplies the bean crop cultivated on silty clay loam soil and with a maximum root depth of about 60mm allen 1998 could extract an amount of water equal to 48 30mm raw from its root zone before moisture stress therefore in view of this value when the soil water deficit swd became greater or equal to the raw the bean crop was irrigated because a copious irrigation took place immediately after sowing irrigation water equal to 20mm corresponding to 200 mc ha the initial soil water was assumed to be at field capacity this meant that swd was zero at the beginning of the growing season and this assumption was confirmed by soil moisture determination according to eq 3 the total amount of irrigation water applied besides rainfall was 390 9mm equal to 100 of etc demand 273 6mm equal to 70 of etc demand 195 5mm equal to 50 of etc demand for treatments a b and c respectively table 2 contains monthly time series of precipitation temperatures and irrigation water supplied to the cultivar fagiolo rosso scritto of course the months of july and august which are crucial for the crop were warmer and less rainy with respect to the remaining months table 3 reports the climatic date of the location during the crop cycle june through september the total rainfall was 152 6mm and average air temperature values minimum maximum and average were 11 3 c 27 7 c and 19 2 c respectively these values are approximately close to the average values of the 2011 2014 period in fact for the same time frame june september the average temperature values minimum maximum mean were equal to 12 1 c 27 8 c and 19 8 c while rainfall was 180 7mm the year of experimentation was warm and not rainy which in our opinion has allowed us to highlight the potential of the gel as a water reserve under water stress conditions fig 3 shows the cumulative evapotranspiration and cumulative water rainfall irrigation consumed for dry bean crop in the three different treatments during vegetative cycle and especially after emergence daily crop evapotranspiration increased significantly up to approximately 90days after sowing from the planting to the maturity at 120days after sowing the dry bean crop consumed a total of 495mm of water by evapotranspiration soil moisture content is directly linked to the evapotranspiration process and the trends of soil water content concerning the three treatments are shown in fig 4 generally speaking as reported in allen 1998 optimum soil water conditions are the actual field conditions in well managed fields and in this test the soil moisture was not significantly reduced in the treatments under deficit irrigation despite the water supply was lower in agreement with the reports of dabhi et al 2013 parvathy et al 2014 the same trend might be due to the fact that the sap granules absorb water and then slowly release it back to the soil balancing the lesser water supply other research has confirmed that the application of sap in conditions for water scarcity has mitigated the negative effect of deficit irrigation islam et al 2011 sannino 2008 sayyari and ghanbari 2012 in addition the irrigation intervals of crops could be increased as reported by fallahi et al 2015 moreover wang and wang 2010 have reported that the addition of hydrogel in sandy soil decreased water evaporation rate compared to the untreated soil similar effects of sap on loamy and sandy soil water holding properties have been investigated by akhter et al 2004 and by dorraji et al 2010 3 2 bean grain yield the bean crops need to be irrigated during the growing period and was considered suitable for studying the effect of sap and irrigation on grain yield the maximum value of dry grain yield was obtained when the crop was irrigated with the amount of irrigation water equal to 100 and 70 of etc demand while lower values were obtained in the treatment with the amount of irrigation water equal to 50 of etc demand in our opinion the soil treatment with sap in moderate deficit irrigation condition made it possible to achieve the same production as the well irrigated treatment 100 of etc demand or full etc this might depend on the fact that sap is able to store water and release it in drought stress conditions re establishing the optimal conditions of soil moisture useful for plant growth fig 5 shows a significant second degree polynomial relationship between dry bean grain yield y and seasonal irrigation water i this relationship is curvilinear and shows that grain yield increasing with the water supply and once a certain level is reached it does not rise anymore a study by dehkordi 2015 confirmed our results in fact the evaluation of sap application on corn yield under deficit irrigation conditions showed that by increasing the severity of drought stress grain yield reduced but there was no significant difference between the treatments with 100 and 75 percent of needed water for the plant with 0 0 and 45 0g m2 of sap respectively conversely the lowest grain yield was obtained in the treatments with 50 percent of needed water for the plants the outcomes reported in table 4 show that the iwue and awp highest values with significantly different means p 0 05 were obtained in treatments b and c if compared to treatment a zhang et al 2008 showed that water use efficiency indexes was negatively related to the total water use during the growing season and for greater iwue the water should be reduced below the irrigation requirement for highest grain yield therefore the combination of moderate water deficit irrigation and soil amendment hydrogel that leads to raise the crop water productivity index was a good strategy to optimize bean grain yield and water use the results obtained were confirmed by the studies on bean cotton maize peanut sorghum dehkordi 2015 hazrati et al 2017 mazen et al 2015 najafinezhad et al 2014 papastylianou and argyrokastritis 2014 pouresmaeil et al 2012 ziaeidoustan et al 2013 4 conclusions the results show that using sap hydrogel for conserving irrigation water it is possible to maintain the production and at the same time reduce the irrigation water amount the application of super absorbent hydrogel to the plants of a local bean population subject to drought stress maintained a good soil water potential the highest values of dry bean grain yield under different sap and water amounts were obtained when the crop was irrigated with the amount of irrigation water equal to 100 and 70 of crop evapotranspiration demand but the combination of deficit irrigation and soil amendment hydrogel leads to maximize the crop water productivity indexes therefore the use of hydrogel in the irrigated crops should be encouraged also on the basis of the results obtained and as reported in the text confirmed by other studies on different crops this research activity is of great interest for the mediterranean area where the dryness conditions in the summer season allow the planning of experimental testing for evaluating the effectiveness of the superabsorbent polymers on different cultivations in the next future new tests to determine the optimal amount of sap to be applied in the soil are required also because the dosage of sap depends on factors such as the soil type and the crop to be irrigated

addition as reported in cannazza et al 2014 when the hydrogel granules swell soil porosity increases providing the plant root zone with a better oxygenation this paper deals with the influences of sap in combination with drip irrigation in deficit irrigation conditions to this purpose sap was employed in a cultivation of a local population of dry bean in order to evaluate the possibility to reduce water irrigation but at the same time ensuring a sufficient water supply to the plant roots when needed therefore as reported by benlhabib et al 2014 a proper agricultural management with the selection of appropriate crops and varieties of crops as well as the use of technologies in water management can affect the productivity and sustainability of cropping systems in a positive way in fact the local population of dry bean used in this study was little susceptible to water stress in a previous experimental test under water deficit conditions in the same area satriani et al 2015 thus confirming that the decision to use local varieties can be a strategy towards a reduction in water consumption in agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental details a field experiment was conducted at the experimental agricultural farm pantano of pignola 40 33 31 34 n and 15 45 31 66 e and 400m above sea level of alsia agency for the agricultural development and innovation of lucania basilicata region southern italy fig 1 only a bean cultivar was chosen for field testing in order to eliminate differences in yield response between cultivars and assess the sap treatment in optimal and stress irrigation conditions in fact during the growing season between the months of june and september the field study was carried out for a local population dry bean phaseolus vulgaris l named fagiolo rosso scritto the bean crop in the research area characterised by a mediterranean climate with dry summers is possible only with irrigation because the amount of rainfall is not often sufficient to satisfy the need for water supply for irrigation wet sieving has been used to separate different particle size fractions into sediments in the soil samples collected within the first 60cm of soil profile and by the granulometric analysis the soil was classified as silty clay loam astm d422 63 2007 table 1 reports the soil physical characteristics the soil chemical analysis was carried out based on the methods of soil chemical and physical analysis as described in the italian official gazette n 248 of 21 10 1999 for the first 60cm of soil layer soil organic matter was 34 9g kg alkaline reaction with a ph of 7 6 total nitrogen was 2 1g kg available p and k were 53 0 and 317 0mg kg respectively for the experiment at hand the seeds were hand sown on may 29 2015 on rows 2m long and 1 5m apart a drip irrigation system was installed before sowing and placed at each row with drippers spaced every 20cm one flow meter has recorded the amount of water applied in each irrigation event after sowing an irrigation water equal to 20mm was given and after the emergence plants were thinned to secure one plant every 20cm within the rows 10 plants for row and in correspondence of each dripper a single bean plant was placed in order to optimize the use of irrigation water and especially reduce the consumption of water after the emergence cellulose based superabsorbent polymer sap was mixed with the soil close to the plant at a depth of 10cm about in particular the sap used is the result of a synthesis process where the carbohymethy lcellulose sodium salt and hydroxyethylcellulose were the precursors of the hydrogel synthesis demitri et al 2013 its peculiarity is that it is completely biodegradable this field experiment was performed as a randomized block design with 4 replications fig 2 the polymer is currently produced in the laboratory and for the limited amount available in order to verify its efficacy just a few different irrigation water amounts with different levels of superabsorbent were considered treatment a with irrigation amounting to 100 etc demand and with 0 0g sap i100 no sap applied treatment b with irrigation amounting to 70 etc demand and with 5 0g sap for plant i70 sap5 treatment c with irrigation equal to 50 etc demand and with 10 0g sap for plant i50 sap10 2 2 measurements estimated average daily reference crop evapotranspiration et0 was obtained by using the methods by blaney criddle and hargreaves allen et al 1994 and the empirical formulae use meteorological data provided by a weather station located in the experimental farm the crop water requirements etc were determined using a crop coefficient kc multiplied et0 in particular crops kc equal to 0 4 1 2 and 0 35 during the initial the mid season and the late season stage were used respectively allen 1998 the amount of water to be applied iwa in an irrigation event during the vegetative cycle to return 100 of the evapotranspiration demand was determined using the following equation 3 i w a s w d e t c e a where iwa is the irrigation water applied mm or lm 2 swd is the soil water deficit on the previous day mmday 1 etc is the crop water requirements mmday 1 ea is the application efficiency that was considered equal to 90 for drip irrigation allen 1998 a real time monitoring of soil moisture content was carried out by means of the multiplexing time domain reflectometry system model trase 6050 3k1 soilmoisture equipment corp california usa the system was remotely controlled by a computer connected to the internet network tdr provides an indirect measurement of the soil water content by measuring the travel time that the electromagnetic wave employs to propagate through the thickness of the soil to be reflected at the end of probe and to return back roth et al 1992 topp et al 1980 six 20cm long tdr waveguides were installed vertically in the 5 25cm soil depths relative to the soil surface in the middle of the rows of blocks 2 and 3 fig 2 the waveguides were installed after the first 5cm of soil because the surface layer is subject to soil moisture changes mainly due to direct insulation the extent of the field does not allow installing tdr waveguides in all four plots and connecting them to the data logger to acquire soil moisture this restriction will be overcome in the future using a wireless probe system during harvest which took place in the second half of october 2015 the pods of 10 plants were taken from each rows after leaving the plants to dry in field and the grain weight was measured for each treatment grain yield per hectare was determined by product between the average weight of the dry bean seeds per plant multiplied by the average number of bean plants per hectare about 33335 plants ha with rows 1 5m apart irrigation water use efficiency index iwue was calculated as grain yield divided by applied water during the whole growing time agricultural water productivity index awp was calculated as grain yield divided by total water use jensen 1983 molden et al 2010 2 3 statistical analysis all the data collected were statistically analysed origin originlab corporation northampton usa and xlstat for microsoft excel addinsoft 2015 codes were used to carry out the analysis of variance anova to test the difference in grain yield and wue between different treatments the treatment means were compared by using the tukey s test and the probability level for the determination of significance was set at 5 gomez and gomez 1984 kao and green 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 patterns of evapotranspiration and soil moisture under different water and sap supplies the bean crop cultivated on silty clay loam soil and with a maximum root depth of about 60mm allen 1998 could extract an amount of water equal to 48 30mm raw from its root zone before moisture stress therefore in view of this value when the soil water deficit swd became greater or equal to the raw the bean crop was irrigated because a copious irrigation took place immediately after sowing irrigation water equal to 20mm corresponding to 200 mc ha the initial soil water was assumed to be at field capacity this meant that swd was zero at the beginning of the growing season and this assumption was confirmed by soil moisture determination according to eq 3 the total amount of irrigation water applied besides rainfall was 390 9mm equal to 100 of etc demand 273 6mm equal to 70 of etc demand 195 5mm equal to 50 of etc demand for treatments a b and c respectively table 2 contains monthly time series of precipitation temperatures and irrigation water supplied to the cultivar fagiolo rosso scritto of course the months of july and august which are crucial for the crop were warmer and less rainy with respect to the remaining months table 3 reports the climatic date of the location during the crop cycle june through september the total rainfall was 152 6mm and average air temperature values minimum maximum and average were 11 3 c 27 7 c and 19 2 c respectively these values are approximately close to the average values of the 2011 2014 period in fact for the same time frame june september the average temperature values minimum maximum mean were equal to 12 1 c 27 8 c and 19 8 c while rainfall was 180 7mm the year of experimentation was warm and not rainy which in our opinion has allowed us to highlight the potential of the gel as a water reserve under water stress conditions fig 3 shows the cumulative evapotranspiration and cumulative water rainfall irrigation consumed for dry bean crop in the three different treatments during vegetative cycle and especially after emergence daily crop evapotranspiration increased significantly up to approximately 90days after sowing from the planting to the maturity at 120days after sowing the dry bean crop consumed a total of 495mm of water by evapotranspiration soil moisture content is directly linked to the evapotranspiration process and the trends of soil water content concerning the three treatments are shown in fig 4 generally speaking as reported in allen 1998 optimum soil water conditions are the actual field conditions in well managed fields and in this test the soil moisture was not significantly reduced in the treatments under deficit irrigation despite the water supply was lower in agreement with the reports of dabhi et al 2013 parvathy et al 2014 the same trend might be due to the fact that the sap granules absorb water and then slowly release it back to the soil balancing the lesser water supply other research has confirmed that the application of sap in conditions for water scarcity has mitigated the negative effect of deficit irrigation islam et al 2011 sannino 2008 sayyari and ghanbari 2012 in addition the irrigation intervals of crops could be increased as reported by fallahi et al 2015 moreover wang and wang 2010 have reported that the addition of hydrogel in sandy soil decreased water evaporation rate compared to the untreated soil similar effects of sap on loamy and sandy soil water holding properties have been investigated by akhter et al 2004 and by dorraji et al 2010 3 2 bean grain yield the bean crops need to be irrigated during the growing period and was considered suitable for studying the effect of sap and irrigation on grain yield the maximum value of dry grain yield was obtained when the crop was irrigated with the amount of irrigation water equal to 100 and 70 of etc demand while lower values were obtained in the treatment with the amount of irrigation water equal to 50 of etc demand in our opinion the soil treatment with sap in moderate deficit irrigation condition made it possible to achieve the same production as the well irrigated treatment 100 of etc demand or full etc this might depend on the fact that sap is able to store water and release it in drought stress conditions re establishing the optimal conditions of soil moisture useful for plant growth fig 5 shows a significant second degree polynomial relationship between dry bean grain yield y and seasonal irrigation water i this relationship is curvilinear and shows that grain yield increasing with the water supply and once a certain level is reached it does not rise anymore a study by dehkordi 2015 confirmed our results in fact the evaluation of sap application on corn yield under deficit irrigation conditions showed that by increasing the severity of drought stress grain yield reduced but there was no significant difference between the treatments with 100 and 75 percent of needed water for the plant with 0 0 and 45 0g m2 of sap respectively conversely the lowest grain yield was obtained in the treatments with 50 percent of needed water for the plants the outcomes reported in table 4 show that the iwue and awp highest values with significantly different means p 0 05 were obtained in treatments b and c if compared to treatment a zhang et al 2008 showed that water use efficiency indexes was negatively related to the total water use during the growing season and for greater iwue the water should be reduced below the irrigation requirement for highest grain yield therefore the combination of moderate water deficit irrigation and soil amendment hydrogel that leads to raise the crop water productivity index was a good strategy to optimize bean grain yield and water use the results obtained were confirmed by the studies on bean cotton maize peanut sorghum dehkordi 2015 hazrati et al 2017 mazen et al 2015 najafinezhad et al 2014 papastylianou and argyrokastritis 2014 pouresmaeil et al 2012 ziaeidoustan et al 2013 4 conclusions the results show that using sap hydrogel for conserving irrigation water it is possible to maintain the production and at the same time reduce the irrigation water amount the application of super absorbent hydrogel to the plants of a local bean population subject to drought stress maintained a good soil water potential the highest values of dry bean grain yield under different sap and water amounts were obtained when the crop was irrigated with the amount of irrigation water equal to 100 and 70 of crop evapotranspiration demand but the combination of deficit irrigation and soil amendment hydrogel leads to maximize the crop water productivity indexes therefore the use of hydrogel in the irrigated crops should be encouraged also on the basis of the results obtained and as reported in the text confirmed by other studies on different crops this research activity is of great interest for the mediterranean area where the dryness conditions in the summer season allow the planning of experimental testing for evaluating the effectiveness of the superabsorbent polymers on different cultivations in the next future new tests to determine the optimal amount of sap to be applied in the soil are required also because the dosage of sap depends on factors such as the soil type and the crop to be irrigated 
11618,conversion to surface water irrigation is one of the critical initiatives to address the decline in groundwater supply a double bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation survey is used to estimate producers willingness to pay wtp for surface water supplied by irrigation districts in arkansas united states the estimated mean wtp for irrigation water is 2 7 m3 33 21 acre foot comparison indicates a significant share of producers are likely to have higher wtps for surface water than the average pumping cost in the study area producers located in areas with less groundwater resources have higher wtps producers that are more concerned with a water shortage occurring in the state in the next 10 years have higher wtps a somewhat unexpected result is that participation in the conservation reserve program predicts lower wtps one possible explanation is that farmers see the transfer of land out of crop production as a more viable financial decision when groundwater supply decreases keywords willingness to pay for irrigation water groundwater shortage mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer 1 introduction diminishing groundwater resources is threatening the security of nearly half of the world s drinking water supply and 43 of the world s irrigation water supply van der gun 2012 one main solution policy makers in many countries have relied on to reduce groundwater use is to improve irrigation efficiency however several recent empirical studies have shown that using more efficient irrigation technologies may actually increase total farm level water use e g pfeiffer and lin 2014 groundwater trading can increase the allocative efficiency by moving water to higher value users while market based mechanisms may increase water use by activating previously unused sleeper or under used dozer water entitlements palazzo and brozović 2014 wheeler et al 2014 conversion to surface water irrigation where surface water resources are abundantly available has the most direct impact on reducing groundwater withdrawals although this approach has not been widely studied in academics it has caught the attention of policy makers both in the us e g mwh 2008 north harris county regional water authority 2014 and in other developed countries as well as developing countries such as bangladesh krupnik et al 2016 in areas where infrastructure needs to be constructed to deliver surface water estimates of the economic value of irrigation water to producers would be needed to conduct cost benefit analysis of such projects as well as assess the financial viability of surface water irrigation systems while several studies have examined the impact of water scarcity on the market value of water few have analyzed non market benefit of water to agricultural users mesa jurado et al 2012 used the contingent valuation method cvm to show that the willingness to pay wtp of farmers in the guadalquivir river basin in southern spain increased under conditions of water scarcity when farmers perceived the impact of guaranteed water supply to positively influence their own welfare toshisuke and hiroshi 2008 evaluated the economic value of irrigation water to urban and non urban users in japan and found that rural users who rely on water resources for household use and to maintain agricultural income have a higher wtp for water than urban users storm et al 2011 model demand for irrigation water in the moroccan drâa valley using cvm and found that producer s true wtp exceeds current water prices in the region but also note that only small increases in cost would be politically tenable and because demand for irrigation water is relatively inelastic such price increases would do little to prevent aquifer drawdown this study uses a double bounded contingent valuation method to estimate agricultural producers wtp for off farm surface water in an environment of decreased availability of groundwater resources in the mississippi delta region of the southern united states our wtp findings are useful to policy makers and agricultural producers around the world where irrigated agriculture is critical to the economy and adaptation to decreasing groundwater supply is a concern in particular the results are critical for evaluating the economic viability of infrastructure projects to bring surface water to farming communities our analysis also examines which factors have predictive power for influencing producers wtp for off farm shipments of irrigation water both our research design and research findings are useful for understanding the potential for conversion to surface water to alleviate the pressure on groundwater the rest of our paper is organized as follows the next section describes the study region the third section presents the survey data and variables used in the empirical analyses the fourth section outlines econometric methodology the fifth section reports results the final section concludes 2 study area the climate of the state of arkansas in the united states is humid and subtropical with an average high temperature of approximately 22 2 c 72 f and an average low temperature of approximately 10 c 50 f anrc 2017 during summer months temperatures regularly reach 37 8 100 f and in winter months temperatures often fall below 0 c 32 f the region experiences an average total annual rainfall of 127cm 50 in however months with the greatest quantities of rainfall october through may occur outside of the growing seasons of major crops such as rice and soybean as such there is usually insufficient rainfall within the study region during the growing season to sustain agricultural production causing producers to rely heavily on groundwater to meet irrigation needs agricultural production is of key importance to arkansas s economy the value of rice soybean corn and cotton production totaled 2 6 billion in 2013 about 2 4 of the state s gross domestic product english et al 2015 arkansas ranks first among states in terms of rice production accounting for 49 96 of total us production usda ers 2016 it also exports large quantities of rice and is an important player in the global rice economy arf 2015 english et al 2013 richardson and outlaw 2010 irrigation is the most important input in arkansas crop production for example despite a widespread drought throughout much of arkansas in 2012 arkansas soybean farmers harvested record yields hightower 2012 in 2013 arkansas accounted for 8 9 of all cropland under irrigation in the us and the state is the third largest user of irrigation water in the country usda nass 2014 irrigated hectares in arkansas have also increased steadily over years in 2013 arkansas farmers irrigated about 93 of rice soybean corn and cotton compared to 81 in 2003 and 87 in 2008 usda nass 2004 2009 2014 most crop production is in the arkansas delta located in eastern arkansas the area is underlain by the mississippi river alluvial aquifer mrvaa which extends approximately 402km 250 miles from north to south and 121km to 241km 75 150 miles from west to east czarnecki et al 2002 the arkansas natural resources commission anrc 2012 estimates that agricultural irrigation is responsible for 96 of all withdrawals from the mrvaa however the continuous and unsustainable pumping has put the mrvaa in danger by withdrawing at rates greater than the natural rate of recharge many counties in east arkansas have been designated as critical groundwater areas due to continued decline in groundwater levels arkansas soil and water conservation commission 2003 continued drawdown of the mrvaa largely the result of increased irrigation to insure against drought induced losses as in 2012 poses a threat to the continued success of water intensive crops in arkansas kovacs et al 2015 an annual gap in groundwater as large as 8 6 billion cubic meters 7 26 million acre feet is projected for 2050 and most of the expected shortfall is attributed to agriculture anrc 2015 in focus groups conducted by the authors in november 2014 with stakeholders from east arkansas the decline in groundwater supply was ranked among the top concerns by producers to combat growing projected scarcity the state of arkansas and the anrc have identified two critical initiatives in the 2014 arkansas water plan update highlight adopting conservation measures that can improve on farm irrigation efficiency as well as infrastructure based solutions that convert more irrigated hectares currently supplied by groundwater to surface water in eastern arkansas anrc 2015 surface water in arkansas is relatively abundant and is allocated to farmers based on riparian water rights 1 1 in arkansas when land toucfhes a surface water resource a lake stream river or other waterway land owners have the right to divert water without permit if doing so does not unreasonably harm another use arkansas law also provides a mechanism for non riparian owners to divert surface water with approval from the anrc as long as the use is reasonable beneficial and will not adversely impact the environment anrc 2015 the anrc 2015 estimates that average annual excess surface water available for inter basin transfer and non riparian use is 9 4 billion cubic meters 7 605 800 acre feet currently the purchase of off farm surface water is relatively rare in arkansas in the farm and ranch irrigation survey conducted by the national agricultural statistics service nass of the usda only 245 farms 4 82 reported utilization of off farm surface water in arkansas in 2012 nass 2014 the per cubic meter price these produces paid ranged from less than 0 08 to more than 4 9 1 to 60 per acre foot the grand prairie area demonstration project and the bayou metro project 2 2 these projects are expected to supply irrigation water to 15 of regions with expected groundwater gaps anrc 2015 are both important features of the arkansas water plan which are designed to supplement agricultural groundwater irrigation with surface water in the hopes of reducing groundwater withdrawals in the grand prairie critical groundwater area and preventing decline of the deeper sparta aquifer which is a critical source of drinking water for the region anrc 2015 in total anrc 2015 estimates that the construction of needed infrastructure to shift groundwater irrigation to surface water irrigation in the nine major river basins of eastern arkansas will cost between 3 4 and 7 7 billion financing these projects has grown increasingly difficult because of decreases in the availability of federal grants cost share and loans anrc 2015 as such understanding the nature of water use and quantifying the full value of irrigation water to agricultural producers in the delta will be critical for continued funding and long run success of irrigation district projects as well as the long run viability of agricultural production in arkansas 3 data and variable definitions the data set comes from the arkansas irrigation use survey conducted by the authors with collaborators from mississippi state university the survey was completed in october 2016 survey data were collected via telephone interviews administered by the mississippi state university social science research center potential survey respondents come from the water user database managed by the anrc and all commercial crop growers identified by dun bradstreet records for the state of arkansas of 3712 attempted contacts 842 resulted in calls to disabled numbers resulting in a net sample size of 2870 of the remaining contacts 1321 led to no answer busy signal or voicemail another 925 contacts were ineligible due to illness or language barrier or identified as non farmer in total 624 contacts reached were eligible to complete the survey among the eligible contacts 255 contacts declined to participate 7 scheduled callbacks but did not complete the survey and 171 contacts discontinued the survey the final sample size is 199 producers that completed the survey in its entirety depending on how response rate is calculated the response rate for this survey varies from 6 87 to 32 25 the survey has nearly 150 questions and took respondents about 30 40min to finish by phone the survey collected a wealth of information about producers decision about crop production and irrigation practices the survey also collected information on a variety of socio economic factors we believe the sampling procedure is appropriate and the reasons for the attrition of sample are not likely to result in biased sample however because the final sample size is small we compare our sample to the sample of the 2012 census of agriculture using several variables that are collected in both surveys the comparison indicates that our sample is comparable to that of the census the shares of irrigated land in rice are similar between the census of agriculture and our sample 27 5 versus 27 51 table 1 the shares are also similar for soybean the share of irrigated area in soybean is slightly higher in our sample 53 93 than in the census 49 19 given the upward trend in irrigated soybean production in arkansas we believe that the difference is likely attributable to the 4 year gap between the two samples in our sample the years of farming experience ranged from one to 60 years with an average of 30 91 years this is higher than the average in the census of agriculture 24 47 years most likely this is because the census reports years of experience as operators rather than total years of farming experience as in our survey we believe that these two years of experience are consistent in addition to the variables described above several other variables are included in our analysis to control for the characteristics of farms and producers table 2 the variable total irrigated hectares under production in 2015 is included in addition to gross income the share of total income that comes from farming is also included to measure the importance of crop production to a respondent s livelihoods we also measure producers education level the highest education attained by producers in our sample vary widely twenty six respondents highest educational attainment is high school or less 16 had attended college but not graduated 8 reported earning an associate s degree and 64 reported earning a bachelor s degree or higher in the final specification of the empirical analysis we include a binary variable that equals one if the highest level of education of a producer is a bachelor s or equivalent or higher degree in arkansas crowley s ridge in the north divides the delta into two distinct regions fig 1 the area to the east of crowley s ridge is characterized by relative water abundance while the area to the west of crowley s ridge is characterized by relative water scarcity county of residence is used to construct a dummy variable that equals one if the respondent lives to the east in part or fully of crowley s ridge relative water abundant area out of 114 respondents 39 indicated that they reside in a county east of crowley s ridge a set of questions were used to gauge a respondent s general awareness of water issues in the delta we first asked the respondent in your opinion do you have a groundwater shortage problem on your farm if the answer is yes we then asked the respondent to rate the groundwater shortage problem on a 5 point scale with 1 meaning no problem and 5 meaning severe problem we also asked the respondent in your opinion do you have a groundwater shortage problem in your state the answer is also on a 5 point scale only 15 of the respondents think their farms have groundwater shortage problems this is in sharp contrast to 71 of the respondents that think the state has groundwater shortage problems one possible explanation for this difference is that although groundwater levels are declining in the mrvaa the depth to water is still above the depth of pumps as such producers may not detect the decline in groundwater on their farm producers could better detect the decline in groundwater if flow meters were installed on their wells and a drop in the water yield were observed in our sample about 36 of the producers own any flow meters among the producers without any flow meters 11 8 think there is groundwater shortage problem on their farm which is lower than the share among producers with flow meters 22 2 a t test indicates that the difference is statistically significant with a p value of 0 026 in the final specification of the empirical analysis we use the respondent rating of groundwater shortage in arkansas the average rating was 2 66 and 68 respondents 59 6 ranked the severity of shortage as three or greater two variables were constructed to conservation program awareness and participation first to determine awareness of options for conversion to surface water irrigation respondents were asked if they were aware of a state tax credit program that allow them to claim up to 9000 tax credit for conversions to surface water or land leveling about 48 of the respondents were aware of this program respondents were also asked if they have ever participated in the conservation reserve program crp about 49 of the respondents indicated that they have participated in the crp table 2 lists all the variable definitions and summary statistics 3 1 wtp questions the key information used in this study comes from the block of the survey that asked respondents a set of dichotomous choice contingent valuation questions table 3 six sets of questions are used in the survey each with a different starting value 10 20 30 40 50 60 the range of wtp values proposed and units of pricing dollars per acre foot were determined by examining average energy costs for groundwater withdrawals as well as the payment schedules for irrigation districts throughout the us but primarily in california oregon and washington board of directors 2013 burt 2007 christian smith and kaphiem 2011 weinberg 1997 wichelns 2010 prior to implementation of the final survey this range of values was tested in a pilot survey and confirmed as appropriate to reduce starting point bias when a respondent was interviewed one out of the 6 sets of questions was randomly selected to ask the producer aprahamian et al 2007 flachaire and hollard 2006 each producer first answered an initial question would you be willing to pay per acre foot of water to purchase water from an irrigation district when a respondent answered yes no the question was repeated at a higher lower bid value with a 50 increment by increasing the interval between the first and second bid as the initial bid level increase we control for acquiescence bias alhassan et al 2013 lee et al 2015 for respondents who answered no to the initial bid and no to the following lower bid a third wtp question with a nominal bid amount of 0 04 m3 50 acre foot was used to determine whether true wtp was zero or if the respondent was offering a protest bid out of the 199 producers that completed survey 6 respondents refused to answer both wtp questions and 1 refused to answer the second bid level twenty four respondents answered no to this third question of the remaining 169 respondents 54 registered don t know responses to one or more of the proposed bid levels all three groups of respondents were excluded from analysis in total 114 respondents were retained for final analysis table 4 reports responses at each bid level 4 econometric model the model constructed relies on double bounded dichotomous choice dbdc contingent valuation methodology which is a simple extension of the single bound dichotomous choice sbdc model in a single bound model survey respondents are asked to state yes or no if they would be willing to pay a single bid amount for a good or service for each respondent the probability of responding yes to a given bid amount is defined by 1 p i y b k pr b k max w t p where bk is the offered bid amount and the probability of a no response is 1 p i y b k hanemann et al 1991 following hanemann 1989 and koss and khawaja 2001 we restrict wtp to positive values and assume a logistic probability distribution then the probability that a respondent s wtp is greater than the offered bid amount is written as 2 π y 1 1 e α β b k δ j z j where πy is the probability of a yes response β is the bid coefficient and δj is the coefficient vector corresponding to the vector of j control variables z in contrast to the sbdc model the dbdc model requires each respondent to answer yes or no to two sequential bids if a respondent answered yes to the initial question a corresponding higher bid value was proposed while respondents who answered no to the initial question were asked a corresponding lower bid value thus each respondent falls into one of four categories yes yes yy yes no yn no yes ny or no no nn we denote the probability of each response sequence as πyy πyn πny and πnn such that 3 π y y b i i b i u pr b i i max w t p and b i u max w t p 4 π y n b i i b i u pr b i i max w t p and b i u max w t p 5 π n y b i i b i l pr b i i max w t p and b i l max w t p 6 π n n b i i b i l pr b i i max w t p and b i l max w t p where the b i i b i u and b i l correspond to the initial upper and lower bid values respectively and i is the respondent index in contrast to the single bound dichotomous choice model which results in only one minimum or maximum value for each respondent s wtp the dbdc methodology allows for the construction of a bounded interval eqs 4 and 5 or minimum or maximum bound eqs 3 and 6 of each respondent s wtp and improves the asymptotic efficiency of parameter estimates hanemann et

where y i x x is an indictor variable of the ith respondent hanemann et al 1991 koss and khawaja 2001 statistical analyses were conducted using stata data analysis and statistical software as shown in

model are reported in table 5 goodness of fit of double bounded models is best measured by the sequential classification procedure outlined by kanninen and khawaja 1995 the steps of sequential classification result in two values initial correctly classified cases iccc and fully correctly classified cases fccc the latter means both cases answer to initial bid and answer to subsequent bid are correctly specified correctly classified is defined as an estimated probability greater than 0 5 for an event observed in the data fccc is used to test the goodness of fit of the model while no standard for a good model exists the maximum chance criterion the percentage of correctly classified cases that would be achieved if all responses were allocated to the group with the highest number of cases is used as a benchmark to determine the relative predictive power of the model kanninen and khawaja 1995 the computed value of fccc for our model is 50 88 58 cases which exceeds the benchmark established by the maximum chance criterion 33 33 38 no no as such the model specified above correctly classifies more respondents than if all responses were grouped within the most frequent case although the estimated coefficient of an independent variable does not directly measure the marginal effect of that variable on wtp the sign of the estimated coefficient does indicate the direction of the effect 3 3 taking the derivate of both sides of eq 12 with respect to zj we can show that sign wtp zj sign α δ i j z i j zj the coefficient of the bid variable is negative and significant at the 1 level indicating that respondents are more likely to say no to a large bid this result is consistent with theoretical expectations the coefficient for the binary variable that indicates a producer is located east of crowley s ridge is also negative and statistically significant at the 5 level this is probably because groundwater resources are more abundant in areas east of crowley s ridge and so producers are likely to exhibit lower wtp than those in the western portion of the delta coefficients of variables that measure awareness of conservation and water shortage issues are statistically significant as expected the coefficient of respondent s rating of groundwater shortage in the state is positive and statistically significant at the 5 level indicating greater willingness to pay for irrigation water when groundwater resources are perceived as scarce respondents who indicated awareness of arkansas tax credit program for construction of on farm surface water infrastructure display a greater likelihood to answer yes to a higher bid these results highlight the importance of increasing extension efforts to raise awareness of growing and long term groundwater scarcity in the delta as well as providing information that explains financial or technical assistance available to farmers who wish to transition to surface water irrigation a somewhat unexpected result is that arkansas producers wtp for irrigation water from irrigation districts decreases if they have participated in or are currently enrolled in the crp previous studies have shown that producers who participate in conservation programs such as the crp have better access to conservation information and make production decisions based on the impact of their choices in future periods lubbell et al 2013 it appears that when financial assistance is received to retire land farmers may be less willing to pay for water from irrigation districts when groundwater resources become limited the estimated coefficient of years of farming experience and the squared term are statistically significant at 1 in contrast to findings from previous studies that age is strictly negatively correlated with wtp for irrigation water we find that wtp for water from irrigation districts increases with years of farming experience until approximately 38 years of experience after which wtp decreases with years of farming experience mesa jurado et al 2012 the nonlinear relationship exhibited here may be the result of mixed influences of three factors first for both very young inexperienced and very old experienced producers exit may be a more preferred option than continued farming with purchased off farm water when groundwater is scarce for young farmers each additional year of experience increases their dependence on farming and thus decreases their ease of exit this explanation may contribute to the positive relationship between years of farming and wtp observed among farmers with fewer than 28 years of farming experience older producers or in the sample data those with more than 38 years of experience are more likely to start to plan for retirement in this case years of farming may lead to a decrease in wtp since each additional year moves a producer closer to the age of retirement and ease of exit increases second younger producers tend to be more concerned with the future availability of productive resources and maintaining the long term viability of their farming operation than older producers mesa jurado et al 2012 since age and years of farming experience are highly correlated this will lead to a negative relationship between years of farming experience and wtp third producers who have farmed in the delta for many decades are accustomed to free water where the cost of water is only the cost of energy needed to pump groundwater from the aquifer as such a sense of entitlement towards water resources makes the purchase of irrigation water unpalatable and causes wtp to decline with years of farming experience the coefficients for gross income percent of income from farming and education were not statistically significant of the three variables for crop mix neither percent of total irrigated hectares in rice nor percent of total irrigated hectares in soybean were statistically significant however the coefficient for total irrigated hectares was statistically significant at the 5 significance level and negative this result conforms to the expectation of demand theory as total irrigated hectares increases per hectare willingness to pay decreases the purchase of irrigation water from irrigation districts is dependent on a producer s bottom line the total expenditure required to meet all irrigation needs rather than intermediate and long run cropping decisions as such in the face of chronic groundwater shortage producers may choose to shift toward production of less water intensive crops rather than purchasing water from irrigation districts 5 1 estimated willingness to pay willingness to pay is estimated for each observation using eq 12 of producers sampled the minimum wtp is 0 3 m3 and the maximum wtp was 6 m3 the mean wtp is 3 m3 table 6 there are few estimates of wtp for irrigation water from previous studies against which we can compare our results however the estimated values of wtps are consistent with prices charged by irrigation districts in other regions of the us as well as with prices currently paid by producers in arkansas who purchase surface water from off farm sources board of directors 2013 burt 2007 christian smith and kaphiem 2011 weinberg 1997 wichelns 2010 one important finding is that for a significant share of the producers the estimated wtp for surface water is likely to be greater than the energy cost they are currently paying to pump groundwater from aquifers the arkansas irrigation use survey did not collect information on pumping cost by producer using the data on the depth to groundwater from the natural resources conservation service swaim et al 2016 and energy prices we calculate the pumping cost producers are currently paying to extract groundwater about 72 of our sample producers use both electric and diesel pumps 12 use exclusively electric pumps and 13 exclusively use diesel powered pumps mcdougal 2015 reported that diesel powered irrigation pumps were 2 7 times more expensive to operate than electric the cost of water for a diesel pump from an alluvial well is 0 6 m3 6 72 acre foot per 10 feet of total dynamic head mcdougal 2015 the estimated pumping cost for the arkansas delta is 2 2 m3 27 21 acre foot which is about the 39th percentile using the distribution of the estimated wtps table 6 this means about 1 61 of the producers have estimated wtps higher than the estimated average pumping cost the comparison is also carried out for lonoke county which is located to the west of crowley s ridge and has the greatest average depth to groundwater in arkansas although the median wtp is lower than the average pumping cost 3 4 m3 or 42 03 acre foot versus 4 5 m3 56 01 acre foot at least 1 8 of our sample producers have estimated wtps higher than the estimated average pumping cost in the county with the greatest average depth to groundwater mississippi county is located east of crowley s ridge where the average depth to ground water is as shallow as 4 88m 16 feet and pumping costs may rarely exceed 0 9 m3 10 89 acre foot the estimated median wtp is 2 m3 24 81 acre foot much higher than the average pumping cost of 0 9 m3 10 89 acre foot thus even in areas of the state where groundwater is most abundant producers wtp for surface water is likely to exceed the energy cost paid to pump it from the aquifer 6 conclusion depth to groundwater in the mrvaa has consistently increased since early 20th century long term projections indicate that only 40 of groundwater demand may be met by 2050 anrc 2015 critical initiatives to slow and reverse groundwater decline in the delta include the adoption of more efficient irrigation technology and the construction of infrastructure to increase the use of surface water resources that are relatively abundant in the state the objective of this study is to estimate producers wtp for irrigation water from irrigation districts the study generates an estimated wtp of 2 7 m3 33 21 acre foot importantly these estimated values are greater than the cost of pumping groundwater producers are currently paying our study also identifies a set of factors that influence producers wtp while producers are aware of growing state level groundwater scarcity few producers believe that scarcity is a problem which directly impacts their farm operations nonetheless higher awareness seems to predict increases in producers wtp for irrigation water this finding highlights the importance of continued outreach by the extension service to increase awareness of water problems in arkansas in total 8 variables are statistically significant the bid value awareness of state tax credit if county of residence east of crowley s ridge participation in the crp perception of groundwater shortage years farming and its squared term and total irrigated hectares all have statistically significant impacts on wtp the conclusion that participation in the crp decreases wtp could have important policy implications while large water savings could be achieved by increasing producers awareness of the crp such practices may also decrease the level of producers wtp for water from irrigation districts if the downward influence on the wtps of such programs is to the extent that irrigation districts cannot set the price of surface water to a level that allows them to recover the cost of delivering water then the financial viability of such projects may be hampered similar conflict may also arise between conservation programs that focus on improving irrigation efficiency and programs that focus on conversions to surface water both types of programs would positively impact the sustainability of the aquifer by reducing groundwater use or moving producers towards surface water resources however the effectiveness or viability of one program may negatively influence the other program if such changes limit the revenue earned by irrigation districts the financial viability of such projects may also be limited policymakers need to take such unintended consequences into account when promoting these programs for example conservation programs that focus on improving irrigation efficiency may be more fruitful in areas where conversion to surface water is not an option e g due to lack of infrastructure funding this project was supported by the arkansas rice research and promotion board arkansas soybean promotion board united soybean board and mid south soybean board 
11618,conversion to surface water irrigation is one of the critical initiatives to address the decline in groundwater supply a double bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation survey is used to estimate producers willingness to pay wtp for surface water supplied by irrigation districts in arkansas united states the estimated mean wtp for irrigation water is 2 7 m3 33 21 acre foot comparison indicates a significant share of producers are likely to have higher wtps for surface water than the average pumping cost in the study area producers located in areas with less groundwater resources have higher wtps producers that are more concerned with a water shortage occurring in the state in the next 10 years have higher wtps a somewhat unexpected result is that participation in the conservation reserve program predicts lower wtps one possible explanation is that farmers see the transfer of land out of crop production as a more viable financial decision when groundwater supply decreases keywords willingness to pay for irrigation water groundwater shortage mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer 1 introduction diminishing groundwater resources is threatening the security of nearly half of the world s drinking water supply and 43 of the world s irrigation water supply van der gun 2012 one main solution policy makers in many countries have relied on to reduce groundwater use is to improve irrigation efficiency however several recent empirical studies have shown that using more efficient irrigation technologies may actually increase total farm level water use e g pfeiffer and lin 2014 groundwater trading can increase the allocative efficiency by moving water to higher value users while market based mechanisms may increase water use by activating previously unused sleeper or under used dozer water entitlements palazzo and brozović 2014 wheeler et al 2014 conversion to surface water irrigation where surface water resources are abundantly available has the most direct impact on reducing groundwater withdrawals although this approach has not been widely studied in academics it has caught the attention of policy makers both in the us e g mwh 2008 north harris county regional water authority 2014 and in other developed countries as well as developing countries such as bangladesh krupnik et al 2016 in areas where infrastructure needs to be constructed to deliver surface water estimates of the economic value of irrigation water to producers would be needed to conduct cost benefit analysis of such projects as well as assess the financial viability of surface water irrigation systems while several studies have examined the impact of water scarcity on the market value of water few have analyzed non market benefit of water to agricultural users mesa jurado et al 2012 used the contingent valuation method cvm to show that the willingness to pay wtp of farmers in the guadalquivir river basin in southern spain increased under conditions of water scarcity when farmers perceived the impact of guaranteed water supply to positively influence their own welfare toshisuke and hiroshi 2008 evaluated the economic value of irrigation water to urban and non urban users in japan and found that rural users who rely on water resources for household use and to maintain agricultural income have a higher wtp for water than urban users storm et al 2011 model demand for irrigation water in the moroccan drâa valley using cvm and found that producer s true wtp exceeds current water prices in the region but also note that only small increases in cost would be politically tenable and because demand for irrigation water is relatively inelastic such price increases would do little to prevent aquifer drawdown this study uses a double bounded contingent valuation method to estimate agricultural producers wtp for off farm surface water in an environment of decreased availability of groundwater resources in the mississippi delta region of the southern united states our wtp findings are useful to policy makers and agricultural producers around the world where irrigated agriculture is critical to the economy and adaptation to decreasing groundwater supply is a concern in particular the results are critical for evaluating the economic viability of infrastructure projects to bring surface water to farming communities our analysis also examines which factors have predictive power for influencing producers wtp for off farm shipments of irrigation water both our research design and research findings are useful for understanding the potential for conversion to surface water to alleviate the pressure on groundwater the rest of our paper is organized as follows the next section describes the study region the third section presents the survey data and variables used in the empirical analyses the fourth section outlines econometric methodology the fifth section reports results the final section concludes 2 study area the climate of the state of arkansas in the united states is humid and subtropical with an average high temperature of approximately 22 2 c 72 f and an average low temperature of approximately 10 c 50 f anrc 2017 during summer months temperatures regularly reach 37 8 100 f and in winter months temperatures often fall below 0 c 32 f the region experiences an average total annual rainfall of 127cm 50 in however months with the greatest quantities of rainfall october through may occur outside of the growing seasons of major crops such as rice and soybean as such there is usually insufficient rainfall within the study region during the growing season to sustain agricultural production causing producers to rely heavily on groundwater to meet irrigation needs agricultural production is of key importance to arkansas s economy the value of rice soybean corn and cotton production totaled 2 6 billion in 2013 about 2 4 of the state s gross domestic product english et al 2015 arkansas ranks first among states in terms of rice production accounting for 49 96 of total us production usda ers 2016 it also exports large quantities of rice and is an important player in the global rice economy arf 2015 english et al 2013 richardson and outlaw 2010 irrigation is the most important input in arkansas crop production for example despite a widespread drought throughout much of arkansas in 2012 arkansas soybean farmers harvested record yields hightower 2012 in 2013 arkansas accounted for 8 9 of all cropland under irrigation in the us and the state is the third largest user of irrigation water in the country usda nass 2014 irrigated hectares in arkansas have also increased steadily over years in 2013 arkansas farmers irrigated about 93 of rice soybean corn and cotton compared to 81 in 2003 and 87 in 2008 usda nass 2004 2009 2014 most crop production is in the arkansas delta located in eastern arkansas the area is underlain by the mississippi river alluvial aquifer mrvaa which extends approximately 402km 250 miles from north to south and 121km to 241km 75 150 miles from west to east czarnecki et al 2002 the arkansas natural resources commission anrc 2012 estimates that agricultural irrigation is responsible for 96 of all withdrawals from the mrvaa however the continuous and unsustainable pumping has put the mrvaa in danger by withdrawing at rates greater than the natural rate of recharge many counties in east arkansas have been designated as critical groundwater areas due to continued decline in groundwater levels arkansas soil and water conservation commission 2003 continued drawdown of the mrvaa largely the result of increased irrigation to insure against drought induced losses as in 2012 poses a threat to the continued success of water intensive crops in arkansas kovacs et al 2015 an annual gap in groundwater as large as 8 6 billion cubic meters 7 26 million acre feet is projected for 2050 and most of the expected shortfall is attributed to agriculture anrc 2015 in focus groups conducted by the authors in november 2014 with stakeholders from east arkansas the decline in groundwater supply was ranked among the top concerns by producers to combat growing projected scarcity the state of arkansas and the anrc have identified two critical initiatives in the 2014 arkansas water plan update highlight adopting conservation measures that can improve on farm irrigation efficiency as well as infrastructure based solutions that convert more irrigated hectares currently supplied by groundwater to surface water in eastern arkansas anrc 2015 surface water in arkansas is relatively abundant and is allocated to farmers based on riparian water rights 1 1 in arkansas when land toucfhes a surface water resource a lake stream river or other waterway land owners have the right to divert water without permit if doing so does not unreasonably harm another use arkansas law also provides a mechanism for non riparian owners to divert surface water with approval from the anrc as long as the use is reasonable beneficial and will not adversely impact the environment anrc 2015 the anrc 2015 estimates that average annual excess surface water available for inter basin transfer and non riparian use is 9 4 billion cubic meters 7 605 800 acre feet currently the purchase of off farm surface water is relatively rare in arkansas in the farm and ranch irrigation survey conducted by the national agricultural statistics service nass of the usda only 245 farms 4 82 reported utilization of off farm surface water in arkansas in 2012 nass 2014 the per cubic meter price these produces paid ranged from less than 0 08 to more than 4 9 1 to 60 per acre foot the grand prairie area demonstration project and the bayou metro project 2 2 these projects are expected to supply irrigation water to 15 of regions with expected groundwater gaps anrc 2015 are both important features of the arkansas water plan which are designed to supplement agricultural groundwater irrigation with surface water in the hopes of reducing groundwater withdrawals in the grand prairie critical groundwater area and preventing decline of the deeper sparta aquifer which is a critical source of drinking water for the region anrc 2015 in total anrc 2015 estimates that the construction of needed infrastructure to shift groundwater irrigation to surface water irrigation in the nine major river basins of eastern arkansas will cost between 3 4 and 7 7 billion financing these projects has grown increasingly difficult because of decreases in the availability of federal grants cost share and loans anrc 2015 as such understanding the nature of water use and quantifying the full value of irrigation water to agricultural producers in the delta will be critical for continued funding and long run success of irrigation district projects as well as the long run viability of agricultural production in arkansas 3 data and variable definitions the data set comes from the arkansas irrigation use survey conducted by the authors with collaborators from mississippi state university the survey was completed in october 2016 survey data were collected via telephone interviews administered by the mississippi state university social science research center potential survey respondents come from the water user database managed by the anrc and all commercial crop growers identified by dun bradstreet records for the state of arkansas of 3712 attempted contacts 842 resulted in calls to disabled numbers resulting in a net sample size of 2870 of the remaining contacts 1321 led to no answer busy signal or voicemail another 925 contacts were ineligible due to illness or language barrier or identified as non farmer in total 624 contacts reached were eligible to complete the survey among the eligible contacts 255 contacts declined to participate 7 scheduled callbacks but did not complete the survey and 171 contacts discontinued the survey the final sample size is 199 producers that completed the survey in its entirety depending on how response rate is calculated the response rate for this survey varies from 6 87 to 32 25 the survey has nearly 150 questions and took respondents about 30 40min to finish by phone the survey collected a wealth of information about producers decision about crop production and irrigation practices the survey also collected information on a variety of socio economic factors we believe the sampling procedure is appropriate and the reasons for the attrition of sample are not likely to result in biased sample however because the final sample size is small we compare our sample to the sample of the 2012 census of agriculture using several variables that are collected in both surveys the comparison indicates that our sample is comparable to that of the census the shares of irrigated land in rice are similar between the census of agriculture and our sample 27 5 versus 27 51 table 1 the shares are also similar for soybean the share of irrigated area in soybean is slightly higher in our sample 53 93 than in the census 49 19 given the upward trend in irrigated soybean production in arkansas we believe that the difference is likely attributable to the 4 year gap between the two samples in our sample the years of farming experience ranged from one to 60 years with an average of 30 91 years this is higher than the average in the census of agriculture 24 47 years most likely this is because the census reports years of experience as operators rather than total years of farming experience as in our survey we believe that these two years of experience are consistent in addition to the variables described above several other variables are included in our analysis to control for the characteristics of farms and producers table 2 the variable total irrigated hectares under production in 2015 is included in addition to gross income the share of total income that comes from farming is also included to measure the importance of crop production to a respondent s livelihoods we also measure producers education level the highest education attained by producers in our sample vary widely twenty six respondents highest educational attainment is high school or less 16 had attended college but not graduated 8 reported earning an associate s degree and 64 reported earning a bachelor s degree or higher in the final specification of the empirical analysis we include a binary variable that equals one if the highest level of education of a producer is a bachelor s or equivalent or higher degree in arkansas crowley s ridge in the north divides the delta into two distinct regions fig 1 the area to the east of crowley s ridge is characterized by relative water abundance while the area to the west of crowley s ridge is characterized by relative water scarcity county of residence is used to construct a dummy variable that equals one if the respondent lives to the east in part or fully of crowley s ridge relative water abundant area out of 114 respondents 39 indicated that they reside in a county east of crowley s ridge a set of questions were used to gauge a respondent s general awareness of water issues in the delta we first asked the respondent in your opinion do you have a groundwater shortage problem on your farm if the answer is yes we then asked the respondent to rate the groundwater shortage problem on a 5 point scale with 1 meaning no problem and 5 meaning severe problem we also asked the respondent in your opinion do you have a groundwater shortage problem in your state the answer is also on a 5 point scale only 15 of the respondents think their farms have groundwater shortage problems this is in sharp contrast to 71 of the respondents that think the state has groundwater shortage problems one possible explanation for this difference is that although groundwater levels are declining in the mrvaa the depth to water is still above the depth of pumps as such producers may not detect the decline in groundwater on their farm producers could better detect the decline in groundwater if flow meters were installed on their wells and a drop in the water yield were observed in our sample about 36 of the producers own any flow meters among the producers without any flow meters 11 8 think there is groundwater shortage problem on their farm which is lower than the share among producers with flow meters 22 2 a t test indicates that the difference is statistically significant with a p value of 0 026 in the final specification of the empirical analysis we use the respondent rating of groundwater shortage in arkansas the average rating was 2 66 and 68 respondents 59 6 ranked the severity of shortage as three or greater two variables were constructed to conservation program awareness and participation first to determine awareness of options for conversion to surface water irrigation respondents were asked if they were aware of a state tax credit program that allow them to claim up to 9000 tax credit for conversions to surface water or land leveling about 48 of the respondents were aware of this program respondents were also asked if they have ever participated in the conservation reserve program crp about 49 of the respondents indicated that they have participated in the crp table 2 lists all the variable definitions and summary statistics 3 1 wtp questions the key information used in this study comes from the block of the survey that asked respondents a set of dichotomous choice contingent valuation questions table 3 six sets of questions are used in the survey each with a different starting value 10 20 30 40 50 60 the range of wtp values proposed and units of pricing dollars per acre foot were determined by examining average energy costs for groundwater withdrawals as well as the payment schedules for irrigation districts throughout the us but primarily in california oregon and washington board of directors 2013 burt 2007 christian smith and kaphiem 2011 weinberg 1997 wichelns 2010 prior to implementation of the final survey this range of values was tested in a pilot survey and confirmed as appropriate to reduce starting point bias when a respondent was interviewed one out of the 6 sets of questions was randomly selected to ask the producer aprahamian et al 2007 flachaire and hollard 2006 each producer first answered an initial question would you be willing to pay per acre foot of water to purchase water from an irrigation district when a respondent answered yes no the question was repeated at a higher lower bid value with a 50 increment by increasing the interval between the first and second bid as the initial bid level increase we control for acquiescence bias alhassan et al 2013 lee et al 2015 for respondents who answered no to the initial bid and no to the following lower bid a third wtp question with a nominal bid amount of 0 04 m3 50 acre foot was used to determine whether true wtp was zero or if the respondent was offering a protest bid out of the 199 producers that completed survey 6 respondents refused to answer both wtp questions and 1 refused to answer the second bid level twenty four respondents answered no to this third question of the remaining 169 respondents 54 registered don t know responses to one or more of the proposed bid levels all three groups of respondents were excluded from analysis in total 114 respondents were retained for final analysis table 4 reports responses at each bid level 4 econometric model the model constructed relies on double bounded dichotomous choice dbdc contingent valuation methodology which is a simple extension of the single bound dichotomous choice sbdc model in a single bound model survey respondents are asked to state yes or no if they would be willing to pay a single bid amount for a good or service for each respondent the probability of responding yes to a given bid amount is defined by 1 p i y b k pr b k max w t p where bk is the offered bid amount and the probability of a no response is 1 p i y b k hanemann et al 1991 following hanemann 1989 and koss and khawaja 2001 we restrict wtp to positive values and assume a logistic probability distribution then the probability that a respondent s wtp is greater than the offered bid amount is written as 2 π y 1 1 e α β b k δ j z j where πy is the probability of a yes response β is the bid coefficient and δj is the coefficient vector corresponding to the vector of j control variables z in contrast to the sbdc model the dbdc model requires each respondent to answer yes or no to two sequential bids if a respondent answered yes to the initial question a corresponding higher bid value was proposed while respondents who answered no to the initial question were asked a corresponding lower bid value thus each respondent falls into one of four categories yes yes yy yes no yn no yes ny or no no nn we denote the probability of each response sequence as πyy πyn πny and πnn such that 3 π y y b i i b i u pr b i i max w t p and b i u max w t p 4 π y n b i i b i u pr b i i max w t p and b i u max w t p 5 π n y b i i b i l pr b i i max w t p and b i l max w t p 6 π n n b i i b i l pr b i i max w t p and b i l max w t p where the b i i b i u and b i l correspond to the initial upper and lower bid values respectively and i is the respondent index in contrast to the single bound dichotomous choice model which results in only one minimum or maximum value for each respondent s wtp the dbdc methodology allows for the construction of a bounded interval eqs 4 and 5 or minimum or maximum bound eqs 3 and 6 of each respondent s wtp and improves the asymptotic efficiency of parameter estimates hanemann et al 1991 nayga et al 2006 using eq 2 eqs 3 6 are rewritten as 7 π y y 1 1 e α β b i u δ j z j 6 π y n 1 1 e α β b i i δ j z j 1 1 e α β b i u δ j z j 9 π n y 1 1 e α β b i l δ j z j 1 1 e α β b i i δ j z j 10 π n n 1 1 1 e α β b i l δ j z j the log likelihood function for the dbdc model ldb is define as 11 l d b i y i y y log π i y y i y i y n log π i y n i y i n y log π i n y i y i n n log π i n n where y i x x is an indictor variable of the ith respondent hanemann et al 1991 koss and khawaja 2001 statistical analyses were conducted using stata data analysis and statistical software as shown in koss and khawaja 2001 using eq 2 and the estimation results of the dbdc model the mean wtp can be imputed as 12 w t p ln 1 e α δ i j z i j β 5 results and discussion estimation results of the dbdc model are reported in table 5 goodness of fit of double bounded models is best measured by the sequential classification procedure outlined by kanninen and khawaja 1995 the steps of sequential classification result in two values initial correctly classified cases iccc and fully correctly classified cases fccc the latter means both cases answer to initial bid and answer to subsequent bid are correctly specified correctly classified is defined as an estimated probability greater than 0 5 for an event observed in the data fccc is used to test the goodness of fit of the model while no standard for a good model exists the maximum chance criterion the percentage of correctly classified cases that would be achieved if all responses were allocated to the group with the highest number of cases is used as a benchmark to determine the relative predictive power of the model kanninen and khawaja 1995 the computed value of fccc for our model is 50 88 58 cases which exceeds the benchmark established by the maximum chance criterion 33 33 38 no no as such the model specified above correctly classifies more respondents than if all responses were grouped within the most frequent case although the estimated coefficient of an independent variable does not directly measure the marginal effect of that variable on wtp the sign of the estimated coefficient does indicate the direction of the effect 3 3 taking the derivate of both sides of eq 12 with respect to zj we can show that sign wtp zj sign α δ i j z i j zj the coefficient of the bid variable is negative and significant at the 1 level indicating that respondents are more likely to say no to a large bid this result is consistent with theoretical expectations the coefficient for the binary variable that indicates a producer is located east of crowley s ridge is also negative and statistically significant at the 5 level this is probably because groundwater resources are more abundant in areas east of crowley s ridge and so producers are likely to exhibit lower wtp than those in the western portion of the delta coefficients of variables that measure awareness of conservation and water shortage issues are statistically significant as expected the coefficient of respondent s rating of groundwater shortage in the state is positive and statistically significant at the 5 level indicating greater willingness to pay for irrigation water when groundwater resources are perceived as scarce respondents who indicated awareness of arkansas tax credit program for construction of on farm surface water infrastructure display a greater likelihood to answer yes to a higher bid these results highlight the importance of increasing extension efforts to raise awareness of growing and long term groundwater scarcity in the delta as well as providing information that explains financial or technical assistance available to farmers who wish to transition to surface water irrigation a somewhat unexpected result is that arkansas producers wtp for irrigation water from irrigation districts decreases if they have participated in or are currently enrolled in the crp previous studies have shown that producers who participate in conservation programs such as the crp have better access to conservation information and make production decisions based on the impact of their choices in future periods lubbell et al 2013 it appears that when financial assistance is received to retire land farmers may be less willing to pay for water from irrigation districts when groundwater resources become limited the estimated coefficient of years of farming experience and the squared term are statistically significant at 1 in contrast to findings from previous studies that age is strictly negatively correlated with wtp for irrigation water we find that wtp for water from irrigation districts increases with years of farming experience until approximately 38 years of experience after which wtp decreases with years of farming experience mesa jurado et al 2012 the nonlinear relationship exhibited here may be the result of mixed influences of three factors first for both very young inexperienced and very old experienced producers exit may be a more preferred option than continued farming with purchased off farm water when groundwater is scarce for young farmers each additional year of experience increases their dependence on farming and thus decreases their ease of exit this explanation may contribute to the positive relationship between years of farming and wtp observed among farmers with fewer than 28 years of farming experience older producers or in the sample data those with more than 38 years of experience are more likely to start to plan for retirement in this case years of farming may lead to a decrease in wtp since each additional year moves a producer closer to the age of retirement and ease of exit increases second younger producers tend to be more concerned with the future availability of productive resources and maintaining the long term viability of their farming operation than older producers mesa jurado et al 2012 since age and years of farming experience are highly correlated this will lead to a negative relationship between years of farming experience and wtp third producers who have farmed in the delta for many decades are accustomed to free water where the cost of water is only the cost of energy needed to pump groundwater from the aquifer as such a sense of entitlement towards water resources makes the purchase of irrigation water unpalatable and causes wtp to decline with years of farming experience the coefficients for gross income percent of income from farming and education were not statistically significant of the three variables for crop mix neither percent of total irrigated hectares in rice nor percent of total irrigated hectares in soybean were statistically significant however the coefficient for total irrigated hectares was statistically significant at the 5 significance level and negative this result conforms to the expectation of demand theory as total irrigated hectares increases per hectare willingness to pay decreases the purchase of irrigation water from irrigation districts is dependent on a producer s bottom line the total expenditure required to meet all irrigation needs rather than intermediate and long run cropping decisions as such in the face of chronic groundwater shortage producers may choose to shift toward production of less water intensive crops rather than purchasing water from irrigation districts 5 1 estimated willingness to pay willingness to pay is estimated for each observation using eq 12 of producers sampled the minimum wtp is 0 3 m3 and the maximum wtp was 6 m3 the mean wtp is 3 m3 table 6 there are few estimates of wtp for irrigation water from previous studies against which we can compare our results however the estimated values of wtps are consistent with prices charged by irrigation districts in other regions of the us as well as with prices currently paid by producers in arkansas who purchase surface water from off farm sources board of directors 2013 burt 2007 christian smith and kaphiem 2011 weinberg 1997 wichelns 2010 one important finding is that for a significant share of the producers the estimated wtp for surface water is likely to be greater than the energy cost they are currently paying to pump groundwater from aquifers the arkansas irrigation use survey did not collect information on pumping cost by producer using the data on the depth to groundwater from the natural resources conservation service swaim et al 2016 and energy prices we calculate the pumping cost producers are currently paying to extract groundwater about 72 of our sample producers use both electric and diesel pumps 12 use exclusively electric pumps and 13 exclusively use diesel powered pumps mcdougal 2015 reported that diesel powered irrigation pumps were 2 7 times more expensive to operate than electric the cost of water for a diesel pump from an alluvial well is 0 6 m3 6 72 acre foot per 10 feet of total dynamic head mcdougal 2015 the estimated pumping cost for the arkansas delta is 2 2 m3 27 21 acre foot which is about the 39th percentile using the distribution of the estimated wtps table 6 this means about 1 61 of the producers have estimated wtps higher than the estimated average pumping cost the comparison is also carried out for lonoke county which is located to the west of crowley s ridge and has the greatest average depth to groundwater in arkansas although the median wtp is lower than the average pumping cost 3 4 m3 or 42 03 acre foot versus 4 5 m3 56 01 acre foot at least 1 8 of our sample producers have estimated wtps higher than the estimated average pumping cost in the county with the greatest average depth to groundwater mississippi county is located east of crowley s ridge where the average depth to ground water is as shallow as 4 88m 16 feet and pumping costs may rarely exceed 0 9 m3 10 89 acre foot the estimated median wtp is 2 m3 24 81 acre foot much higher than the average pumping cost of 0 9 m3 10 89 acre foot thus even in areas of the state where groundwater is most abundant producers wtp for surface water is likely to exceed the energy cost paid to pump it from the aquifer 6 conclusion depth to groundwater in the mrvaa has consistently increased since early 20th century long term projections indicate that only 40 of groundwater demand may be met by 2050 anrc 2015 critical initiatives to slow and reverse groundwater decline in the delta include the adoption of more efficient irrigation technology and the construction of infrastructure to increase the use of surface water resources that are relatively abundant in the state the objective of this study is to estimate producers wtp for irrigation water from irrigation districts the study generates an estimated wtp of 2 7 m3 33 21 acre foot importantly these estimated values are greater than the cost of pumping groundwater producers are currently paying our study also identifies a set of factors that influence producers wtp while producers are aware of growing state level groundwater scarcity few producers believe that scarcity is a problem which directly impacts their farm operations nonetheless higher awareness seems to predict increases in producers wtp for irrigation water this finding highlights the importance of continued outreach by the extension service to increase awareness of water problems in arkansas in total 8 variables are statistically significant the bid value awareness of state tax credit if county of residence east of crowley s ridge participation in the crp perception of groundwater shortage years farming and its squared term and total irrigated hectares all have statistically significant impacts on wtp the conclusion that participation in the crp decreases wtp could have important policy implications while large water savings could be achieved by increasing producers awareness of the crp such practices may also decrease the level of producers wtp for water from irrigation districts if the downward influence on the wtps of such programs is to the extent that irrigation districts cannot set the price of surface water to a level that allows them to recover the cost of delivering water then the financial viability of such projects may be hampered similar conflict may also arise between conservation programs that focus on improving irrigation efficiency and programs that focus on conversions to surface water both types of programs would positively impact the sustainability of the aquifer by reducing groundwater use or moving producers towards surface water resources however the effectiveness or viability of one program may negatively influence the other program if such changes limit the revenue earned by irrigation districts the financial viability of such projects may also be limited policymakers need to take such unintended consequences into account when promoting these programs for example conservation programs that focus on improving irrigation efficiency may be more fruitful in areas where conversion to surface water is not an option e g due to lack of infrastructure funding this project was supported by the arkansas rice research and promotion board arkansas

regions worldwide duan and fedler 2013 the increasing world population will require additional food and drinkable water however soil salinization is one of the most crucial problems for crop production in arid and semi arid regions ladeiro 2012 therefore there is a need for more experimental studies on the potential of halophyte irrigation using wastewater after treating brackish and saline waters irrigation water salinity could subsequently cause seed dormancy which relies on physical defense to exclude predators and pathogens and rapid seed germination to escape pathogens at the emergence stage dalling et al 2011 sustainable land application of ro concentrate for halophyte farming and using desalinated water for agriculture could decrease salinization of agriculture soils and

most studies on quantifying the influence of saline irrigation water on soil and plant growth and physiology are conducted by preparing solutions of different concentrations of various salt mixtures these solutions have generally very high solubility as opposed to the natural bgw used in this study with a suite of chemicals with high to very low solubility natural bgw and saline ro concentrate of similar concentration and solubility will be used by growers interested in halophyte farming in this study it was hypothesized that halophyte plant species will grow better when irrigated with ro

elevation of 1186m above sea level the experiment was conducted in the greenhouse because according to new mexico department of agriculture guidelines irrigation water above 4ds m salinity cannot be land applied the first experiment season one started on october 5 2015 and was concluded on january 3 2016 during the season two experiments were conducted between february 15 2016 and may 14 2016 the experimental set up consisted of 32 cylindrical pots 4 replicates 4 treatments 2 species for each of the two seasons cylindrical pots of 14 10cm diameter and 18cm length were packed with air dried sterilized at 60 c for 6h soil the packing was started by first placing cheese cloth at the base of the pot over the two holes to prevent soil loss and then gravel was placed to allow for free drainage pots were packed with soil at 3cm depth increments to obtain a homogenous profile the bulk density of soil in the pots varied slightly standard error of 0 01 with a mean of 1 37g cm3 according to the usda textural classification soil used in the greenhouse experiment was sandy loam table 1 which is a dominant soil found at the west mesa site along desert margins a space of about 3cm was left on the top of the pot for irrigation purposes to avoid preferential flow between the soil and the pot soil was filled up to the top along the edges and compacted care was taken that irrigation water was slowly applied and depth of ponding was kept below one cm prior to each irrigation soil on the edge was monitored and any cracks or gaps were closed 2 3 irrigation water treatments four water treatments were used in this experiment including irrigation water at the greenhouse tap water ec 0 8ds m bgw 5ds m ro1 8ds m concentrate and ro2 10ds m concentrate ro mixed with

chemical analysis of water included determinations of ph ec mg2 na and ca2 ion concentrations the fertilizer was applied with irrigation after at least one leaf had been established to prevent burning a half strength hoagland s solution was mixed with irrigation water in a ratio of approximately 1 5 fertilizer water hoagland and arnon 1950 the ecs of the irrigation water with fertilizers were 0 9 4

virgatum xtriticosecale were tested before for emergence in sandy loam soil using the same irrigation waters ozturk 2016 hordeum vulgare l barley and x xtriticosecale wittm triticale were chosen because seed from these two species had higher final percent emergence in a 30 day greenhouse experiment however mean emergence time increased by about two days with increasing irrigation water salinity all seeds were supplied from curtis curtis inc in clovis nm both h vulgare and xtriticosecale plant species are in the poaceae family xtriticosecale is a cross between triticum aestivum wheat and secale cereale rye both h vulgare and xtriticosecale are annual graminoids and are not native to the united states usda nrcs 2015 but h vulgare is found in most parts of the u s 2 5 greenhouse meteorological data inside the greenhouse hourly measurements of air temperature relative humidity and photosynthetically active radiation par were taken using a watchdog 2475 plant growth weather station we used specware 9 basic software spectrum technologies inc auro il for data download during season one the daily mean greenhouse temperatures varied between 12 8 and 35 7 c whereas variations during season two were between 13 3 and 38 5 c the variations in relative humidity in the greenhouse were similar during the two seasons with 8 0 89 0 for season one and 8 0 82 0 for season two the mean and maximum par were 33 6 and 1614 0μm m2s respectively during season one and 39 4 and 1845 0μm m2s respectively during season two fig 1 the drop in par in fig 1 during season two was due to the installation of a shade on march 14 2016 on the top of the greenhouse to maintain the internal temperature 2 6 irrigation leaching and water balance seeds were sown at 2cm depth from the soil surface

generally management allowed depletion mad of 50 is used for agriculture crops and is assumed to cause limited plant stress shukla 2014 in this study plants were irrigated at a mad of about 50 of the saturated water content mostly on the 7th day after the irrigation there were 10 and 11 irrigations during season one and two respectively for the 90 day experimental study all species were irrigated using the same irrigation interval and irrigation volumes thus a fixed irrigation schedule was maintained as opposed to a constant leaching fraction to represent a field planted with both species four weeks after the seedling establishment irrigation water treatments were gradually introduced this was done to prevent shock to the plants the volume of the leachate deep percolation dp was collected

aboveground biomass at the end of the greenhouse study all plants were harvested by cutting the stem near the soil surface the plants were weighted to determine the fresh weight afterwards the plants were dried at 65 c for 72h weighed and the dry biomass and the plant moisture contents were determined 2 8 plant ion content total dry biomass was used to determine the concentrations of calcium magnesium and sodium ions through microwave aided digestion 0 25g of ground biomass was mixed with 5ml of concentrated nitric acid and 2ml of 30 hydrogen peroxide the mixture was heated in a microwave accelerated reaction system mars5 hp 500 plus and following a cooling period the samples were filtered diluted and analyzed using a perkinelmer optima 4300 dv icp oes according to epa methods 3051a

fisher s least significant difference lsd and were considered significant for an alpha α of 0 05 3 results 3 1 physical and chemical soil properties the soil moisture characteristic curves showed that volumetric water contents at saturation at 0mpa were 0 39 0 42 and 0 45cm3 water per cm3 soil respectively for soil irrigated with tap water bgw and ro2 concentrate table 2 the field capacity water contents at 0 03mpa were 0 31 0 34 0 37cm3 cm3 respectively and wilting point water contents at 1 5mpa were 0 04 0 05 0 06cm3 cm3 respectively for soil irrigated with tap water bgw and ro2 concentrate the available water contents for sandy loam soil irrigated with tap water bgw and ro2 concentrate were 0 27 0 29 0 31cm3 cm3 respectively fig 2 only statistical difference was observed among irrigation treatments for water content at saturation the ks of sandy loam soil showed an increase with increasing irrigation water salinity from ecs of 0 8 to 10ds m table 3 however differences were not statistically significant the concentrations of magnesium calcium and sodium were 1 82 5 35 and 2 14meq l respectively for the sandy loam soil table 4 the high calcium content of the soil was consistent with the high soil ph and groundwater chemistry of the region the soil was non saline and non sodic with an ec of 1 01ds m and an sar of 1 12 respectively 3 2 water chemical properties in the control water potassium 6 2mg l was the dominant cation table 5 in the bgw the dominant cation was calcium 22 5meq l followed by sodium 20 0meq l and magnesium 17 1meq l the dominant cation in the ro1 concentrate water was calcium 51 8meq l while sodium and magnesium concentrations were similar 40 1 and 40 0meq l respectively on the other hand the dominant cation in the ro2 concentrate water was sodium 72 4meq l while calcium and magnesium concentrations were 51 2 and 39 9meq l respectively the ecs for the control bgw ro1 concentrate and ro2 concentrate waters prior to the addition of fertilizer were 0 8 5 8 10ds m respectively the sar values were 2 2 4 5 5 9 10 7 for the control bgw ro1 concentrate and ro2 concentrate respectively because the ec was less than 4 and sar was less than 13 the control water was neither saline nor sodic while bgw ro1 and ro2 were saline ec 4 but not sodic sar 13 table 5 3 3 aboveground fresh and dry biomass aboveground dry biomass for the h vulgare did not vary significantly among irrigation water treatments during season one however significant differences among treatments were observed during season two p 0 05 table 6 no significant differences for h vulgare were detected between control and ro2 during both seasons during season 1 statistically significant differences were seen for fresh biomass yield and biomass moisture content for xtriticosecale table 6 dry biomass yields for xtriticosecale plants were similar during season one but slightly lower for ro2 than control during season two plant moisture content for the xtriticosecale increased with increasing salinity during both seasons 3 4 evapotranspiration and deep percolation there were 10 irrigations applied during season one and 11 during season two over the course of the 90 day experimental period table 7 total depth of irrigation applied was 40 67cm during season 1 and 50 27cm during season 2 for water balance analysis δs was assumed to be zero because pots were weighted prior to irrigation at or near 50 depletion and few differences were noted both h vulgare and xtriticosecale plants responded similarly to irrigation water salinity and et was significantly higher for control and bgw than for ro2 in season one during season two no significant differences in total et were observed for both species by irrigation treatments table 7 during season one et was about 70 of the applied irrigation water in the control treatment for both species while it was about 67 of the applied irrigation water for both species during season two figs 3 6 for the ro1 concentrate treatment et was about 67 of the applied irrigation water for both species during season one while it was about 66 of the applied irrigation water for both species during season two the et was about 64 of the applied irrigation water for the ro2 treatment for both species during season one on the other hand et was about 67 of the applied irrigation water for the ro2 treatment for both species during season two the measured mean dp and mean et of hordeum vulgare plants over the course of 10 irrigations 90days in season one and 11 irrigations 90days in season two showed a clear pattern of increasing et with the growing season and a decrease towards the end at maturity for all four irrigation treatments figs 3 and 5 similar observations can be made for xtriticosecale plants irrigated with control bgw ro1 and ro2 waters figs 4 and 6 3 5 volumetric leaching fractions during season one as the salinity of irrigation water increased the total lf also increased table 8 this was evident for both h vulgare and xtriticosecale plant species however lfs did not increase for both h vulgare and xtriticosecale plant species under salinity treatments during season two 3 6 plant ion contents when a significant difference was evident with increasing irrigation water ec the concentration of the na mg ca and cl ions increased table 9 the sodium concentration in xtriticosecale was significant for both seasons and the h vulgare differences were significant only during season one for h vulgare plants the highest concentration of sodium was for the ro2 irrigated plants the xtriticosecale plants had no significant difference in sodium concentration between ro1 and ro2 irrigated plants in season two however both were statistically higher than the control and bgw irrigated plants the difference in calcium concentration with increasing salinity was evident in season one for xtriticosecale on the other hand h vulgare plants showed the highest concentrations of calcium in the control in season one for h vulgare and xtriticosecale plants statistical differences in magnesium concentration were observed only in season one whereas differences for xtriticosecale were detected for both seasons h vulgare plants had no significant difference in chloride concentration by treatment in both seasons whereas it was evident during both seasons for xtriticosecale 3 7 soil ion contents the soil ion concentrations were consistently significantly different between ro1 and ro2 and control irrigated soils table 10 the differences between soil ph irrigated with control bgw and concentrates were low and soil ph ranged between 7 38 and 7 78 during the two growing seasons table 11 the soil ec and sar were consistently higher for ro1 and ro2 irrigated soil than bgw and control for the ro2 irrigated soil and xtriticosecale grown pots the soil sar increased to about 13 and soil became nearly sodic during both growing seasons the mass balance for various ions was determined from the total applied through irrigation deposited in soil removed through deep percolation leaching and plant uptake table 12 mass balance errors for ions increased with increasing irrigation water salinity two important sources of errors were the roots and precipitates in the leachate which could not be analyzed as part of the ion balance ion concentrations of leachate soil and uptake by plants increased with increasing irrigation water salinity nearly 10 times increase in the soil ion concentrations were observed between control and ro2 4 discussion 4 1 soil hydraulic properties significant difference p 0 003 in soil water content among treatments was observed at saturation only this could be due to the higher density of the ro2 concentrate irrigation water however we did not see any differences in field capacity and wilting point water contents this study showed no significant differences in ks with increasing salinity in contrast a decrease in ks with increasing soil salinity is reported and is attributed to an increase in bulk density due to accumulation of fine particles and precipitates in the pores pupisky and shainberg 1979 mcneal et al 1968 adhikari et al 2012a b the sar for ro2 irrigated soil at the end of growing season was close to 13 during both growing seasons raising serious soil sodicity concerns with continued irrigation increases in soil sar using sodium rich treated wastewater was also reported by adhikari et al 2012b thus sodium rich ro could be applied throughout the growing season but it would be better to limit the application until the vegetation establishment is complete this study showed that irrigation with ro could increase soil ion concentration by 4 10 times compared to irrigation with the control similar increases were also observed when bgw is used for irrigation plant ion uptake cannot compensate for the increases in soil salinity therefore continued irrigation with bgw also has the potential of causing soil salinization thus the bgw must be desalinated prior to its use for irrigating agricultural crops or it can be intermittently along with less saline river water 4 2 water balance and aboveground dry biomass both abiotic stresses due to salinity and water content impact plant growth and biomass yield in this study total lfs for h vulgare and xtriticosecale plants ranged between 29 and 36 during both seasons on the other hand another h vulgare study in a sandy soil reported lfs of 17 15 9 for the control bgw and ro treatments respectively flores et al 2016 in any case the lfs in this study were greater than the recommended 15 to maintain soil salinity conducive to plant growth for irrigation with water ec 0 7ds m beltran 1999 direct relationship between biomass yield and et are reported katerji et al 2009 khan 1996 in this study only direct significant relationship was observed between et and fresh biomass weight for h vulgare r2 0 88 similarly water use efficiency as the ratio of fresh biomass weight and et also increased with increasing irrigation water salinity for only h vulgare r2 0 31 otherwise only minor to no significant differences were obtained for fresh biomass yield for h vulgare and xtriticosecale confirming that both these species are halophytes and reuse of ro concentrate 8 and 10ds m rich in calcium or sodium is an option to grow halophytes this was supported by the minor differences in the cumulative et values for both the species irrigated with control or saline waters no differences in biomass yields and higher moisture content of biomass at higher irrigation water salinity levels could be due to the higher lf maintained throughout the growing season for both species observed increase in water content of biomass with increasing irrigation water salinity under high lf was not consistent and further research is needed katerji et al 2009 reported early flowering and ear formation for h vulgare in the higher saline treatments however some cultivars of h vulgare were reported to be susceptible to salinity and plant growth decreased with increasing irrigation water salinity hussain et al 1997 triticum durum one of the two species crossed to create xtristicosecale responded negatively to a salinity increase from an ec of 1 1ds m to 3 6ds m katerji et al 2009 indicating it is not a halophyte the results of this study did not agree with a study by shalaby et al 1993 who reported a general decrease in the biomass with increasing salinity the shalaby et al 1993 study showed a 50 decrease in xtriticosecale biomass at or above the salinity of 31ds m the important difference between this study and shalaby et al 1993 is that the latter used naci solutions whereas irrigation water in this study was non sodic with large amounts of calcium and magnesium 4 3 halophytic characteristics no foliar toxicities or injuries to any of the species under any of the irrigation treatments and no reductions in growth and biomass yields of both species showed tolerance and halophytic characteristics no leaf burns were observed and toxicity associated with sodium and chloride ions was not evident no significant differences in et also showed salt tolerance and halophytic characteristics because stomata closing was not likely needed for these two species to tackle higher sodium and chloride concentrations in ro waters higher sodium and chloride contents seemed to adjust osmotic differences to maintain water uptake for plants irrigated with bgw and ro concentrates no changes in calcium or magnesium uptake were noted for any of the species with increasing irrigation water salinity unlike some other reported studies hussain et al 2015 flores et al 2017 increasing sodium uptake by both species did not cause decreases in calcium or magnesium uptake however it does not seem that these two species can excrete sodium via vesiculated leaf hairs like a lentiformis panta et al 2016 or a canescens flores et al 2016 in this study about ten times more sodium uptake was noted for xtricosecale irrigated with ro2 than control while it was only about two times for h vulgare table 12 chloride contents in the plant biomass were also much higher in ro2 however very low to no reductions in calcium uptake were observed for h vulgare and no reductions were observed for xtricosecale maximum plant chloride content of 4 64 was observed which is much lower than the toxicity levels of 9 reported for animals gough et al 1979 both sodium and chloride were primarily taken up from applied irrigation water because soil sodium and chloride contents were low and soil was leached prior to the experiment however sodium and chloride associated phytotoxicity effects were not observed further confirming that both species can be classified as halophytes increases in irrigation water salinity did not show any evidence of growth suppression or stomatal closing with increasing salinity further confirming that the plant spices were halophytes 4 4 implication this study addresses the problem of potential soil salinization due to the use of bgw for irrigation and the problems associated with using the desalination waste the main problem with inland desalination is the reuse or disposal of the saline concentrate byproduct unlike coastal desalination plants the option of returning the concentrate to the initial water resource does not exist for inland desalination plants a cost effective solution is the land application which can become a viable answer to counter ever growing irrigation water scarcity and water quality problems in the arid and desert areas results of this study will be useful for obtaining site specific permission from department of agriculture and other entities for halophyte farming for sustaining agriculture in fresh water scare area with plenty of low quality gw this study showed no differences in biomass yields of both h vulgare and xtriticosecale when irrigated with the ro water for one year however more experiments should be conducted where irrigation is applied for multiple years to observe the performances of these two species both species can be used as animal fodder and can contribute to the usda s mission of food security ro irrigation could easily be done in greenhouse nurseries or in areas where groundwater table is deep and land is not suitable for agriculture chemical composition of bgw and ro waters must be determined prior to application periodic soil monitoring must be done to control excessive soil salinization and efficient irrigation schedule protocols must be developed 5 conclusions this study utilized the available irrigation water natural bgw and the ro concentrate produced through the desalination of bgw in general for h vulgare and xtriticosecale no differences in biomass yields were observed with increasing irrigation water salinity total et was mostly higher and total dp was lower for plants irrigated with control than those irrigated with ro concentrates both h vulgare and xtriticosecale demonstrated good growth under bgw ro1 and ro2 concentrates and these plants could potentially be used in animal fodder this study demonstrates that irrigation of salt tolerant plants using concentrate is a realistic method of concentrate reuse it could help initiate the implementation of inland desalination plants in arid and semi arid areas to augment good quality drinking and irrigation water supplies however further research should be done to identify the appropriate leaching fractions maximum leaching depths and develop site specific irrigation scheduling protocols based on the depth of the groundwater to ensure no concentrate

hordeum vulgare and xtriticosecale plants were arranged in a completely randomized design and four irrigation treatments ec 0 8 5 8 and 10ds m were applied for 90days during the two seasons no significant differences were observed in the saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention of sandy loam soil irrigated with different brackish waters total et obtained from water balance was higher for plants irrigated with control than brackish waters only in season one an increase in irrigation water salinity increased soil salinity and mean leaching fraction lf while mean et decreased there were no differences in dry biomass yield for both species in season 1 and very small differences in season 2 the sodium uptake primarily from irrigation water confirmed that both

regions worldwide duan and fedler 2013 the increasing world population will require additional food and drinkable water however soil salinization is one of the most crucial problems for crop production in arid and semi arid regions ladeiro 2012 therefore there is a need for more experimental studies on the potential of halophyte irrigation using wastewater after treating brackish and saline waters irrigation water salinity could subsequently cause seed dormancy which relies on physical defense to exclude predators and pathogens and rapid seed germination to escape pathogens at the emergence stage dalling et al 2011 sustainable land application of ro concentrate for halophyte farming and using desalinated water for agriculture could decrease salinization of agriculture soils and

soil is reported to decrease the soil hydraulic conductivity mcneal et al 1968 adhikari et al 2012b decreases in biomass yield about 6 of some medicinal plants were observed between control and 10ds m and reduced water uptake with increasing salinity was identified as one of the main causes muhammad and hussain 2010 seedling establishment and growth of h vulgare was low due to high electrical

grown in sand and irrigated up to 8ds m of natural irrigation water however irrigation water salinity is reported to increase soil salinity with attendant decreases in et plant growth and biomass yields allen et al 1998 low soil salinity and high et corresponds to higher biomass yields diaz et al 2013 the reported relationships between soil salinity et and biomass yields for agricultural crops does not follow the same patterns for halophytes halophytic species tolerate high soil salinity without a decrease in et or biomass yield in some cases biomass yields are increased flores et al 2016 showed that the et was higher for plants irrigated with control water than saline water in spite of the differences in et flores et al 2016 showed no differences in biomass yields for six halophytes grown in sand but some limitation for those grown in clay in contrast panta et al 2016 reported that biomass yield for atriplex lentiformis was higher in clay than in the sandy loam soil irrigation with high salinity water could cause reductions in plants growth without showing signs of salinity toxicity bernstein 1975 sodium and chloride could cause ion toxicity and produce salt burns in leaves alvarez et al 2012 deb et al 2013 reductions in plant growth and functions are reported due to the exclusion of calcium and potassium when excess sodium is present hussain et al 2015 flores et al 2017 most studies on quantifying the influence of saline irrigation water on soil and plant growth and physiology are conducted by preparing solutions of different concentrations of various salt mixtures these solutions have generally very high solubility as opposed to the natural bgw used in this study with a suite of chemicals with high to very low solubility natural bgw and saline ro concentrate of similar concentration and solubility will be used by growers interested in halophyte farming in this study it was hypothesized that halophyte plant species will grow better when irrigated with ro concentrate the objectives of the experimental study were to evaluate salinity induced changes on 1 soil hydraulic properties and 2 et lf soil salinity and dry biomass yield of halophyte species 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil analysis in the experiment knowledge of soil physical properties is crucial because it plays an important role in regulating plant growth air flow compaction and

elevation of 1186m above sea level the experiment was conducted in the greenhouse because according to new mexico department of agriculture guidelines irrigation water above 4ds m salinity cannot be land applied the first experiment season one started on october 5 2015 and was concluded on january 3 2016 during the season two experiments were conducted between february 15 2016 and may 14 2016 the experimental set up consisted of 32 cylindrical pots 4 replicates 4 treatments 2 species for each of the two seasons cylindrical pots of 14 10cm diameter and 18cm length were packed with air dried sterilized at 60 c for 6h soil the packing was started by first placing cheese cloth at the base of the pot over the two holes to prevent soil loss and then gravel was placed to allow for free drainage pots were packed with soil at 3cm depth increments to obtain a homogenous profile the bulk density of soil in the pots varied slightly standard error of 0 01 with a mean of 1 37g cm3 according to the usda textural classification soil used in the greenhouse experiment was sandy loam table 1 which is a dominant soil found at the west mesa site along desert margins a space of about 3cm was left on the top of the pot for irrigation purposes to avoid preferential flow between the soil and the pot soil was filled up to the top along the edges and compacted care was taken that irrigation water was slowly applied and depth of ponding was kept below one cm prior to each irrigation soil on the edge was monitored and any cracks or gaps were closed 2 3 irrigation water treatments four water treatments were used in this experiment including irrigation water at the greenhouse tap water ec 0 8ds m bgw 5ds m ro1 8ds m concentrate and ro2 10ds m concentrate ro mixed with

chemical analysis of water included determinations of ph ec mg2 na and ca2 ion concentrations the fertilizer was applied with irrigation after at least one leaf had been established to prevent burning a half strength hoagland s solution was mixed with irrigation water in a ratio of approximately 1 5 fertilizer water hoagland and arnon 1950 the ecs of the irrigation water with fertilizers were 0 9 4

virgatum xtriticosecale were tested before for emergence in sandy loam soil using the same irrigation waters ozturk 2016 hordeum vulgare l barley and x xtriticosecale wittm triticale were chosen because seed from these two species had higher final percent emergence in a 30 day greenhouse experiment however mean emergence time increased by about two days with increasing irrigation water salinity all seeds were supplied from curtis curtis inc in clovis nm both h vulgare and xtriticosecale plant species are in the poaceae family xtriticosecale is a cross between triticum aestivum wheat and secale cereale rye both h vulgare and xtriticosecale are annual graminoids and are not native to the united states usda nrcs 2015 but h vulgare is found in most parts of the u s 2 5 greenhouse meteorological data inside the greenhouse hourly measurements of air temperature relative humidity and photosynthetically active radiation par were taken using a watchdog 2475 plant growth weather station we used specware 9 basic software spectrum technologies inc auro il for data download during season one the daily mean greenhouse temperatures varied between 12 8 and 35 7 c whereas variations during season two were between 13 3 and 38 5 c the variations in relative humidity in the greenhouse were similar during the two seasons with 8 0 89 0 for season one and 8 0 82 0 for season two the mean and maximum par were 33 6 and 1614 0μm m2s respectively during season one and 39 4 and 1845 0μm m2s respectively during season two fig 1 the drop in par in fig 1 during season two was due to the installation of a shade on march 14 2016 on the top of the greenhouse to maintain the internal temperature 2 6 irrigation leaching and water balance seeds were sown at 2cm depth from the soil surface and grown under natural sunlight tap water was used during seedling establishment to provide similar abiotic stresses and obtain a similar growth pattern for both species under different treatments generally management allowed depletion mad of 50 is used for agriculture crops and is assumed to cause limited plant stress shukla 2014 in this study plants were irrigated at a mad of about 50 of the saturated water content mostly on the 7th day after the irrigation there were 10 and 11 irrigations during season one and two respectively for the 90 day experimental study all species were irrigated using the same irrigation interval and irrigation volumes thus a fixed irrigation schedule was maintained as opposed to a constant leaching fraction to represent a field planted with both species four weeks after the seedling establishment irrigation water treatments were gradually introduced this was done to prevent shock to the plants the volume of the leachate deep percolation dp was collected at the end of each irrigation and was used for the volumetric leaching fraction lf and evapotranspiration et calculations lf was determined using eq 3 ayers and wescot 1985 3 lf vdrainage virrigation

aboveground biomass at the end of the greenhouse study all plants were harvested by cutting the stem near the soil surface the plants were weighted to determine the fresh weight afterwards the plants were dried at 65 c for 72h weighed and the dry biomass and the plant moisture contents were determined 2 8 plant ion content total dry biomass was used to determine the concentrations of calcium magnesium and sodium ions through microwave aided digestion 0 25g of ground biomass was mixed with 5ml of concentrated nitric acid and 2ml of 30 hydrogen peroxide the mixture was heated in a microwave accelerated reaction system mars5 hp 500 plus and following a cooling period the samples were filtered diluted and analyzed using a perkinelmer optima 4300 dv icp oes according to epa methods 3051a and 200 7 us environmental protection agency staff 1982 2007 plant chloride content was determined by mixing 0 25g of plant with 50ml of 2 acetic acid shaking for 30min filtering and analyzing on the technicon auto analyzer ii 2 9 statistical analysis the plants were arranged in a completely randomized design with four replicates randomization was achieved by generating random numbers in microsoft excel 2013 statistical analyses were done using sas software version 9 2 for both species differences due to treatments were determined using one way analysis of variance anova means were separated by fisher s least significant difference lsd and were considered significant for an alpha α of 0 05 3 results 3 1 physical and chemical soil properties the soil moisture characteristic curves showed that volumetric water contents at saturation at 0mpa were 0 39 0 42 and 0 45cm3 water per cm3 soil respectively for soil irrigated with tap water bgw and ro2 concentrate table 2 the field capacity water contents at 0 03mpa were 0 31 0 34 0 37cm3 cm3 respectively and wilting point water contents at 1 5mpa were 0 04 0 05 0 06cm3 cm3 respectively for soil irrigated with tap water bgw and ro2 concentrate the available water contents for sandy loam soil irrigated with tap water bgw and ro2 concentrate were 0 27 0 29 0 31cm3 cm3 respectively fig 2 only statistical difference was observed among irrigation treatments for water content at saturation the ks of sandy loam soil showed an increase with increasing irrigation water salinity from ecs of 0 8 to 10ds m table 3 however differences were not statistically significant the concentrations of magnesium calcium and sodium were 1 82 5 35 and 2 14meq l respectively for the sandy loam soil table 4 the high calcium content of the soil was consistent with the high soil ph and groundwater chemistry of the region the soil was non saline and non sodic with an ec of 1 01ds m and an sar of 1 12 respectively 3 2 water chemical properties in the control water potassium 6 2mg l was the dominant cation table 5 in the bgw the dominant cation was calcium 22 5meq l followed by sodium 20 0meq l and magnesium 17 1meq l the dominant cation in the ro1 concentrate water was calcium 51 8meq l while sodium and magnesium concentrations were similar 40 1 and 40 0meq l respectively on the other hand the dominant cation in the ro2 concentrate water was sodium 72 4meq l while calcium and magnesium concentrations were 51 2 and 39 9meq l respectively the ecs for the control bgw ro1 concentrate and ro2 concentrate waters prior to the addition of fertilizer were 0 8 5 8 10ds m respectively the sar values were 2 2 4 5 5 9 10 7 for the control bgw ro1 concentrate and ro2 concentrate respectively because the ec was less than 4 and sar was less than 13 the control water was neither saline nor sodic while bgw ro1 and ro2 were saline ec 4 but not sodic sar 13 table 5 3 3 aboveground fresh and dry biomass aboveground dry biomass for the h vulgare did not vary significantly among irrigation water treatments during season one however significant differences among treatments were observed during season two p 0 05 table 6 no significant differences for h vulgare were detected between control and ro2 during both seasons during season 1 statistically significant differences were seen for fresh biomass yield and biomass moisture content for xtriticosecale table 6 dry biomass yields for xtriticosecale plants were similar during season one but slightly lower for ro2 than control during season two plant moisture content for the xtriticosecale increased with increasing salinity during both seasons 3 4 evapotranspiration and deep percolation there were 10 irrigations applied during season one and 11 during season two over the course of the 90 day experimental period table 7 total depth of irrigation applied was 40 67cm during season 1 and 50 27cm during season 2 for water balance analysis δs was assumed to be zero because pots were weighted prior to irrigation at or near 50 depletion and few differences were noted both h vulgare and xtriticosecale plants responded similarly to irrigation water salinity and et was significantly higher for control and bgw than for ro2 in season one during season two no significant differences in total et were observed for both species by irrigation treatments table 7 during season one et was about 70 of the applied irrigation water in the control treatment for both species while it was about 67 of the applied irrigation water for both species during season two figs 3 6 for the ro1 concentrate treatment et was about 67 of the applied irrigation water for both species during season one while it was about 66 of the applied irrigation water for both species during season two the et was about 64 of the applied irrigation water for the ro2 treatment for both species during season one on the other hand et was about 67 of the applied irrigation water for the ro2 treatment for both species during season two the measured mean dp and mean et of hordeum vulgare plants over the course of 10 irrigations 90days in season one and 11 irrigations 90days in season two showed a clear pattern of increasing et with the growing season and a decrease towards the end at maturity for all four irrigation treatments figs 3 and 5 similar observations can be made for xtriticosecale plants irrigated with control bgw ro1 and ro2 waters figs 4 and 6 3 5 volumetric leaching fractions during season one as the salinity of irrigation water increased the total lf also increased table 8 this was evident for both h vulgare and xtriticosecale plant species however lfs did not increase for both h vulgare and xtriticosecale plant species under salinity treatments during season two 3 6 plant ion contents when a significant difference was evident with increasing irrigation water ec the concentration of the na mg ca and cl ions increased table 9 the sodium concentration in xtriticosecale was significant for both seasons and the h vulgare differences were significant only during season one for h vulgare plants the highest concentration of sodium was for the ro2 irrigated plants the xtriticosecale plants had no significant difference in sodium concentration between ro1 and ro2 irrigated plants in season two however both were statistically higher than the control and bgw irrigated plants the difference in calcium concentration with increasing salinity was evident in season one for xtriticosecale on the other hand h vulgare plants showed the highest concentrations of calcium in the control in season one for h vulgare and xtriticosecale plants statistical differences in magnesium concentration were observed only in season one whereas differences for xtriticosecale were detected for both seasons h vulgare plants had no significant difference in chloride concentration by treatment in both seasons whereas it was evident during both seasons for xtriticosecale 3 7 soil ion contents the soil ion concentrations were consistently significantly different between ro1 and ro2 and control irrigated soils table 10 the differences between soil ph irrigated with control bgw and concentrates were low and soil ph ranged between 7 38 and 7 78 during the two growing seasons table 11 the soil ec and sar were consistently higher for ro1 and ro2 irrigated soil than bgw and control for the ro2 irrigated soil and xtriticosecale grown pots the soil sar increased to about 13 and soil became nearly sodic during both growing seasons the mass balance for various ions was determined from the total applied through irrigation deposited in soil removed through deep percolation leaching and plant uptake table 12 mass balance errors for ions increased with increasing irrigation water salinity two important sources of errors were the roots and precipitates in the leachate which could not be analyzed as part of the ion balance ion concentrations of leachate soil and uptake by plants increased with increasing irrigation water salinity nearly 10 times increase in the soil ion concentrations were observed between control and ro2 4 discussion 4 1 soil hydraulic properties significant difference p 0 003 in soil water content among treatments was observed at saturation only this could be due to the higher density of the ro2 concentrate irrigation water however we did not see any differences in field capacity and wilting point water contents this study showed no significant differences in ks with increasing salinity in contrast a decrease in ks with increasing soil salinity is reported and is attributed to an increase in bulk density due to accumulation of fine particles and precipitates in the pores pupisky and shainberg 1979 mcneal et al 1968 adhikari et al 2012a b the sar for ro2 irrigated soil at the end of growing season was close to 13 during both growing seasons raising serious soil sodicity concerns with continued irrigation increases in soil sar using sodium rich treated wastewater was also reported by adhikari et al 2012b thus sodium rich ro could be applied throughout the growing season but it would be better to limit the application until the vegetation establishment is complete this study showed that irrigation with ro could increase soil ion concentration by 4 10 times compared to irrigation with the control similar increases were also observed when bgw is used for irrigation plant ion uptake cannot compensate for the increases in soil salinity therefore continued irrigation with bgw also has the potential of causing soil salinization thus the bgw must be desalinated prior to its use for irrigating agricultural crops or it can be intermittently along with less saline river water 4 2 water balance and aboveground dry biomass both abiotic stresses due to salinity and water content impact plant growth and biomass yield in this study total lfs for h vulgare and xtriticosecale plants ranged between 29 and 36 during both seasons on the other hand another h vulgare study in a sandy soil reported lfs of 17 15 9 for the control bgw and ro treatments respectively flores et al 2016 in any case the lfs in this study were greater than the recommended 15 to maintain soil salinity conducive to plant growth for irrigation with water ec 0 7ds m beltran 1999 direct relationship between biomass yield and et are reported katerji et al 2009 khan 1996 in this study only direct significant relationship was observed between et and fresh biomass weight for h vulgare r2 0 88 similarly water use efficiency as the ratio of fresh biomass weight and et also increased with increasing irrigation water salinity for only h vulgare r2 0 31 otherwise only minor to no significant differences were obtained for fresh biomass yield for h vulgare and xtriticosecale confirming that both these species are halophytes and reuse of ro concentrate 8 and 10ds m rich in calcium or sodium is an option to grow halophytes this was supported by the minor differences in the cumulative et values for both the species irrigated with control or saline waters no differences in biomass yields and higher moisture content of biomass at higher irrigation water salinity levels could be due to the higher lf maintained throughout the growing season for both species observed increase in water content of biomass with increasing irrigation water salinity under high lf was not consistent and further research is needed katerji et al 2009 reported early flowering and ear formation for h vulgare in the higher saline treatments however some cultivars of h vulgare were reported to be susceptible to salinity and plant growth decreased with increasing irrigation water salinity hussain et al 1997 triticum durum one of the two species crossed to create xtristicosecale responded negatively to a salinity increase from an ec of 1 1ds m to 3 6ds m katerji et al 2009 indicating it is not a halophyte the results of this study did not agree with a study by shalaby et al 1993 who reported a general decrease in the biomass with increasing salinity the shalaby et al 1993 study showed a 50 decrease in xtriticosecale biomass at or above the salinity of 31ds m the important difference between this study and shalaby et al 1993 is that the latter used naci solutions whereas irrigation water in this study was non sodic with large amounts of calcium and magnesium 4 3 halophytic characteristics no foliar toxicities or injuries to any of the species under any of the irrigation treatments and no reductions in growth and biomass yields of both species showed tolerance and halophytic characteristics no leaf burns were observed and toxicity associated with sodium and chloride ions was not evident no significant differences in et also showed salt tolerance and halophytic characteristics because stomata closing was not likely needed for these two species to tackle higher sodium and chloride concentrations in ro waters higher sodium and chloride contents seemed to adjust osmotic differences to maintain water uptake for plants irrigated with bgw and ro concentrates no changes in calcium or magnesium uptake were noted for any of the species with increasing irrigation water salinity unlike some other reported studies hussain et al 2015 flores et al 2017 increasing sodium uptake by both species did not cause decreases in calcium or magnesium uptake however it does not seem that these two species can excrete sodium via vesiculated leaf hairs like a lentiformis panta et al 2016 or a canescens flores et al 2016 in this study about ten times more sodium uptake was noted for xtricosecale irrigated with ro2 than control while it was only about two times for h vulgare table 12 chloride contents in the plant biomass were also much higher in ro2 however very low to no reductions in calcium uptake were observed for h vulgare and no reductions were observed for xtricosecale maximum plant chloride content of 4 64 was observed which is much lower than the toxicity levels of 9 reported for animals gough et al 1979 both sodium and chloride were primarily taken up from applied irrigation water because soil sodium and chloride contents were low and soil was leached prior to the experiment however sodium and chloride associated phytotoxicity effects were not observed further confirming that both species can be classified as halophytes increases in irrigation water salinity did not show any evidence of growth suppression or stomatal closing with increasing salinity further confirming that the plant spices were halophytes 4 4 implication this study addresses the problem of potential soil salinization due to the use of bgw for irrigation and the problems associated with using the desalination waste the main problem with inland desalination is the reuse or disposal of the saline concentrate byproduct unlike coastal desalination plants the option of returning the concentrate to the initial water resource does not exist for inland desalination plants a cost effective solution is the land application which can become a viable answer to counter ever growing irrigation water scarcity and water quality problems in the arid and desert areas results of this study will be useful for obtaining site specific permission from department of agriculture and other entities for halophyte farming for sustaining agriculture in fresh water scare area with plenty of low quality gw this study showed no differences in biomass yields of both h vulgare and xtriticosecale when irrigated with the ro water for one year however more experiments should be conducted where irrigation is applied for multiple years to observe the performances of these two species both species can be used as animal fodder and can contribute to the usda s mission of food security ro irrigation could easily be done in greenhouse nurseries or in areas where groundwater table is deep and land is not suitable for agriculture chemical composition of bgw and ro waters must be determined prior to application periodic soil monitoring must be done to control excessive soil salinization and efficient irrigation schedule protocols must be developed 5 conclusions this study utilized the available irrigation water natural bgw and the ro concentrate produced through the desalination of bgw in general for h vulgare and xtriticosecale no differences in biomass yields were observed with increasing irrigation water salinity total et was mostly higher and total dp was lower for plants irrigated with control than those irrigated with ro concentrates both h vulgare and xtriticosecale demonstrated good growth under bgw ro1 and ro2 concentrates and these plants could potentially be used in animal fodder this study demonstrates that irrigation of salt tolerant plants using concentrate is a realistic method of concentrate reuse it could help initiate the implementation of inland desalination plants in arid and semi arid areas to augment good quality drinking and irrigation water supplies however further research should be done to identify the appropriate leaching fractions maximum leaching depths and develop site specific irrigation scheduling protocols based on the depth of the groundwater to ensure no concentrate is leaching to groundwater acknowledgements authors thank nakayama endowment bor wrri agreement nifa and nmsu agricultural experiment station for support
