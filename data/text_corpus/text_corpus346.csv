1730,the urban heat island uhi effect is accelerated with urbanization and climate change thus threatening human survival the evaporation from water body e takes away energy through heat absorption process thereby effectively play a role in temperature cooling and uhi effect alleviation however the response of uhi effect to urban e is still lacks study in the current uhi research to address this issue this work proposes a customized water body evaporation model in urban areas the newly developed urban e model considers the contribution of anthropogenic heat flux ahf to the energy balance in urban areas meanwhile ahf is also used to enhance the simulation of the water heat storage change g for urban water body validation results in two megacities in china indicate that the developed urban e model which considered ahf in the energy balance equation significantly improves the simulation performance of e in the main urban area the root mean square error rmse significantly decreased by 26 6 w m2 compared with the original penman formula for e in the main urban area eu simulation the consideration of ahf in the g determination improves the simulation performance of e in the deep water body the rmse significantly decreased by 33 3 w m2 compared to the ahf penman model that do not considering g for e simulation in deep water body the developed urban e model is further used to evaluate the response of uhi to the eu and e in the suburban area es it is found that eu effectively alleviates uhi while es aggravate uhi moreover the cooling effect of e in the main urban areas δtau and suburbs δtas are increased with urbanization the increasing rate of δtau is higher than δtas indicate the contribution of evaporation cooling to the uhi alleviation is increased with urbanization further analysis demonstrate the urbanization process can explain approximately 90 of the enhanced ability of e to mitigate the uhi effect correlation analysis shows that the mitigation capability of e to uhi effect is mainly controlled by the volume and surface size of water body finally future climate scenario based urban e forecast confirms that δtau and δtas will continue to rise with climate change the average increasing rate are 0 018 c year and 0 013 c year for δtau and δtas respectively under the three representative concentration pathways the increasing rate of δtau is larger than δtas suggesting the mitigation of the uhi effect will benefit more from urban e under the future climate change generally our findings highlight that the mitigation of the uhi effect mainly benefits from e in the main urban area rather than e in the suburban area this study gains insight into e in urban areas including its algorithm interaction with the uhi effect and responses to urbanization and climate change the results of this study provide a good scientific basis for urban landscape water planning keywords urban heat island uhi effect urban water body evaporation anthropogenic heat

reaching 70 by 2050 guo et al 2022 li et al 2019 bagan and yamagata 2014 due to vehicle exhaust human respiration and building emissions the air and surface temperature in main urban areas are higher than those in suburban areas such a temperature difference phenomenon is called the urban heat island uhi effect zhao et al 2014 meng et al 2017 sobrino et al 2012 the uhi effect directly affects the living environment of human beings since it significantly increases the thermal stress and discomfort of the human body xia et al 2022 estoque et al 2016 the uhi effect has been exacerbated by persistent heatwave events in recent years which means that human survival in urban areas faces unprecedented challenges ramamurthy and bou zeid 2017 patz et al 2005 mitigation of the uhi effect is a global problem in which one of the effective means is to increase evaporation in urban areas moss et al 2018 zhang 2020 the evaporative endothermic process takes away the storage heat of the surface and air thereby cooling the surface and air temperature kaboré et al 2020 paschalis et al 2021 chen et al 2022b c previous studies have shown that the construction of landscape water bodies and landscape vegetation in urban areas can effectively mitigate the uhi effect since evaporation and transpiration from water bodies and vegetation surfaces occurs continuously unless the water is depleted soydan 2020 gao et al 2020 park et al 2021 paschalis et al 2021 the mitigation effect of vegetation transpiration on the uhi effect has been widely studied e g yan et al 2020 zhang 2020 ueyama ando 2020 peng et al 2022 erell zhou 2022 rakoto et al 2021 efforts have been made to compare the evaporative cooling performance under different vegetation species pataki et al 2011 chen et al 2019a vegetation patterns soydan 2020 rakoto et al 2021 peng et al 2022 and vegetation coverage erell zhou 2022 generally these vegetation cooling studies significantly enhanced the people s understanding of the response of the uhi effect to vegetation transpiration thus contributing to the alleviation of urban warming however there are relatively few studies has focused on the mitigation effect of water body evaporation e to uhi effect schibuola tambani 2020 weisman brutsaert 1973 it is pointed out here that the urban water bodies mentioned in the study include artificial landscape water bodies rivers ponds and reservoirs previous studies indicated that the evaporation rate of open water body surface is faster than that of vegetation surface because evaporation from open water bodies e is not constrained by the water supply and the opening and closing of stomata chen et al 2022a therefore evaporation from urban water bodies could be more effective than vegetation transpiration in achieving the uhi effect mitigation purpose several studies have investigated the cooling effect of urban e to urban thermal environment weisman brutsaert 1973 developed a semiempirical turbulence evaporation theory and investigated the cooling effect of a lake evaporation to urban thermal environment schibuola tambani 2020 assessed the mitigation performance of seawater cooled chillers to uhi effect over a coastal city suggested the uhi effect can be reduced 58 by seawater cooled chillers recently chakraborty et al 2023 evaluated the cooling effect of lake michigan to chicago through an ensemble model indicated the water body evaporation significantly reduced heat stress in chicago wang et al 2023 integrated weather research and forecasting model and urban canopy model to assess the mitigation effect of summer lake breeze on urban warming in chicago reported the lake breeze can effective mitigate heat stress in the afternoon although efforts have been made to evaluate the effect of urban e in mitigation of urban heat stress uhi effect significant knowledge gaps still exist including the followings 1 previous researches mainly focus on the evaluation of cooling performance of a specific urban water body however all water bodies within the urban area will play a role in urban temperature cooling 2 current researches investigates the response of urban temperature to water body evaporation but there is a lack of research on the response of uhi effect to water body evaporation 3 current researches does not distinguish between the response of heat stress and uhi effect to urban e from main urban and suburban areas 4 the current urban models in assessing the mitigation performance of urban e to uhi effect is relatively outdated lead to significant uncertainty of the model results these knowledge gaps cause the urban managers and policy makers cannot fully use urban water body evaporation to mitigate the uhi effect therefore a comprehensive analysis of the effect of urban e to uhi mitigation from main urban and suburban areas that based on a customized urban e model is highly expected the first knowledge gap is the lack of customized water body evaporation models for urban areas one significant difference between the urban area and natural area is a large amount of anthropogenic heat flux ahf in urban areas due to motor vehicle building emissions and human respiration which alters the surface energy balance process chen et al 2019a sun et al 2018 liu et al 2021 therefore significant errors will occur if the conventional surface energy balance equation is directly used to simulate e in urban areas another limitation is that the changes in water heat storage g are not well parameterized for urban water bodies it is known that e mainly occurs at the surface layer of the water body bowen 1926 zhao gao 2019 indicated that e is not only controlled by the interaction between the surface and the air but also controlled by the interaction between the water surface and the water column zhao et al 2020 the interaction between the water surface and the air is governed by the atmospheric moisture demand e g clausius clapeyron cc relation which is mainly manifested in air temperature saturated vapour deficit and wind speed mcvicar et al 2012 while the interaction between the water surface and the water column is mainly parameterized by the storage heat in the water column g de bruin 1982 zhao et al 2020 the classic penman and priestley taylor models are widely used to simulate e and potential evaporation in the natural ecosystem penman 1948 priestley and taylor 1972 unfortunately when these two classic models are used to simulate e in urban areas there will be large uncertainty since these models do not account for changes in water heat storage chernet 2001 sima et al 2013 note that the heat storage and its temporal variations in urban water bodies are distinct from natural water bodies due to the existence of ahf and uhi effects on the other hand previous studies suggested that the water heat storage can occupy half of the net radiative flux in a deeper water body e g depth greater than 10 m allen tasumi 2014 zhao gao 2019 zhao et al 2020 as a result the effect of water heat storage on e may be more pronounced for deep water bodies this is critical for accurately modelling e in urban areas since the depth of water bodies in urban areas often varies in a wide range e g 2 20 m to this end developing a customized urban water body evaporation model that accounts for both ahf and water heat storage change is urgent and necessary for accurate simulations of urban e the second knowledge gap is that the effect of water body location on the mitigation performance of the uhi effect is remain unclear urban areas can be broadly classified into main and suburban areas where the total urban area is usually greater than 100 km2 schneider et al 2010 weng 2012 revealing the response of uhi to e in main urban areas eu and e in suburban areas es is essential as it directly affects the mitigation performance of e to the uhi effect for example the construction of landscape water bodies on the suburban fringe may play a limited role in mitigating the uhi effect the ultimate goal of policy makers is to find a balance between the construction of urban landscape water body and commercial and residential areas in other words people want to mitigate the uhi effect on the premise of realizing urban economic development and human habitation however inadequate knowledge about the relationship between water body location and uhi mitigation performance hindered scientific urban landscape water body planning the third knowledge gap is that the response of urban e to urbanization is rarely studied urbanization leads to significant changes in urban land use and microclimate pathirana et al 2014 carlson arthur 2000 vinayak et al 2022 past studies has shown that the increase in impervious surface leads to a decrease in soil and vegetation coverage in urban areas resulting in a decrease in total urban evapotranspiration fang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 chen et al 2022a however there is still a lack of insight about how urbanization changes water body evaporation to our best knowledge only chen et al 2022a evaluated the response of urban e to urbanization and reported that urbanization has led to an increase in urban e due to urban warming unfortunately their study only analyzed the response of water body evaporation to urbanization in whole urban areas but did not distinguish the responses of eu and es to urbanization it is mentioned that the distinction between the responses of eu and es to urbanization is crucial because it helps to improve the understanding of the genesis and regulating mechanism of the uhi effect therefore the construction of a long term time series of urban e changes is critical which can facilitate the accurate revealing of the responses of eu and es to urbanization to address the several scientific issues mentioned above the main purposes of this study include the following 1 to conduct a customized water body evaporation model that considers ahf and g to gain the capability to simulate e in urban areas 2 to reveal the responses of uhi effect to eu and es 3 to reveal the responses of eu es and uhi effect to urbanization 4 to analyze the changing trends of eu and es under the future climate change this study will enhance our understanding of urban water body evaporation including its estimation method response to urbanization and climate change and interaction with the uhi effect the ultimate objective of this study is to provide a scientific basis for the urban landscape water body planning to alleviate the uhi effect 2 materials and methods 2 1 algorithm formulation 2 1 1 determination of e as mentioned before the significant difference between urban areas and natural ecosystem is the existence of anthropogenic heat flux ahf in the energy balance of urban areas therefore the energy balance equation for urban water body should add the ahf item shown in eq 1 1 r n a h f l e h g where rn ahf le and h represents the heat fluxes of net radiation anthropogenic latent heat and sensible heat w m2 respectively in the original energy balance equation g represents the soil heat flux w m2 for urban water body areas g represents the change of water heat storage w m2 the rn for the water body area is estimated using eq 2 2 r n 1 α w r s σ ε w w s t 4 ε a r l where αw represents the albedo for an open water body unitless accurate acquisition of αw involves a series of landsat imagery bands which include visible near infrared and thermal infrared bands subin et al 2012 rs and rl represents the downward solar shortwave radiation and downward atmospheric longwave radiation w m2 εw represents the specific emissivity for a water body set to 0 97 εa represents the specific emissivity for air set to 0 98 σ represents the stefan boltzman constant set to 4 9 10 9 mj m2 k4 e in an urban water body is determined through a modified penman model that account for the anthropogenic heat flux ahf penman model penman 1948 zhao and gao 2019 zhao et al 2020 shown as eq 3 the ahf penman model considers the combined constraints of energy balance anthropogenic heat flux and turbulent diffusion on e notice that not all ahfs in urban areas has an impact on the energy balance of water body considering the energy advection effect we only add ahf within 2 km radius of an open water body to the energy balance equation 3 e δ r n a h f g γ f u e s e a λ δ γ where λ represents the latent heat of water vaporization γ represents the psychrometric constant kpa c δ represents the slope of the temperature saturation water vapour curve at air temperature kpa c es and ea represents the saturated water vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure kpa respectively 2 1 2 determination of wind fetch length function the key to apply penman formula to calculate water body evaporation lies in the determination of the wind fetch length function f u in eq 3 when the wind moves from upwind direction to downwind direction of a water body the humidity above the water surface at the downwind direction will gradually increase due to the evaporation loss as a consequence the evaporation in the downwind direction of the water body will gradually decrease due to the increased humidity therefore the influence of wind direction on water body evaporation cannot be ignored mcjannet et al 2012 proposed a wind fetch length to account for the effect of wind direction on e the proposed wind function considers the increased air humidity in the downwind direction of the water body through a fetch length parameter shown as eq 4 4 f u λ 2 33 1 65 u f l where f u represents the wind function which is controlled by the fetch length of open water body mcjannet et al 2012 zhao and gao 2019 zhao et al 2020 u represents the wind speed at 2 m height m s fl represent the fetch length of the water body m estimated as fl a w a represents the total area of open water body m2 w represents the width of open water body m fl is calculated for each water body under specific wind direction w is calculated as the distance between two tangents of water body in a direction parallel to the wind direction mcjannet et al 2012 zhao and gao 2019 zhao et al 2020 figure s1 shows a schematic diagram of the wind fetch length 2 1 3 determination of ahf there are three sources of ahf in urban areas namely building emissions vehicle emissions and human respiration eq 5 liu et al 2021 chen et al 2022a it is assumed that all of the energy consumption in the urban area will eventually convert into the heat flux between the atmosphere and the land surface while the hysteresis effect of energy conversion is ignored 5 ahf a h f b a h f v a h f h where ahfb ahfv and ahfh represents the ahf from building vehicle and human respiration w m2 respectively the ahfb can be estimated through the downscaling of statistical building energy consumption data liu et al 2021 first urban buildings are classified as 6 categories including residential areas commercial areas industrial areas school areas hospital areas and shopping areas then the 6 categories of urban buildings are given different energy consumption weights the settings of energy consumption weights for different urban building types are depended on the energy consumption intensity the details of energy consumption intensity for different urban building types can be referred to liu et al 2021 next the volume of 6 building types and their energy consumption is regressed to obtain the relationship between the building volume and energy consumption lastly the ahfb for a specific building can be downscaled based on the statistical building energy consumption energy consumption weights and building volume once downscaling the statistical building energy consumption to an individual building the expression of ahfb for a specific building i can be written as eq 6 liu et al 2021 6 ah f bi e di c h a i where ahfbi represents the ahfb for a specific building i edi represents the energy consumption for a specific building i ch represents the standard coal heat set to 2 9 107 j kg liu et al 2021 ai represents the area for a specific building i ahfv mainly comes from motor vehicle exhaust emissions therefore its value largely depends on traffic conditions in this study the ahfv is estimated through the vehicle number fuel efficiency driving distance and areas of traffic road the expression of ahfv is presented as eq 7 chen et al 2019a sun et al 2018 liu et al 2021 7 ah f v v d ρ v a b a v where v represents the total numbers of vehicles for a specific traffic area d represents the total driving distance for a specific vehicle km which is set to 10000 15000 km according to the government report ρv represents the fuel density set to 0 85 kg l a represents the fuel efficiency set to 0 12 l km b represents the vehicle heat emissions set to 4 5 107 j kg quah and roth 2012 av represents the total area for a specific traffic road m2 the ahfh is estimated based on the density of human activities since the human body has different metabolic rates during the daytime and nighttime the daytime and nighttime are separated to estimate ahfh shown as eq 8 8 ah f h p d ij m ra 16 p d ij m rs 8 a h where pdij represents the population density for a specific pixel i j person m2 mra represents the metabolic rate during the daytime 7 00 23 00 set to 175 w person mra represents the metabolic rate during the nighttime 23 00 7 00 set to 75 w person ah represents total areas that has human activity m2 2 1 4 determination of water heat storage changes water heat storage change g is another key variable for accurately simulating e in ahf penman model previous studies suggested that the e will be overestimated in spring and summer but underestimated in autumn and winter if the g is ignored in the penman formula zhao and gao 2019 currently there exist three types of methods to determine g the first is the empirical regression method which conducts the relationship between the g and rn duan and bastiaanssen 2015 the second is the equilibrium temperature method which parameterizes the water surface temperature when there is no heat exchange between the water surface and the air bruin 1982 the third is the water temperature profile method the water temperature profile method fully considers the change of water temperature in the vertical direction and enhances the simulation capacity of e zhao et al 2020 due to the large uncertainty of the empirical regression method and the dependence on in situ measurements of the temperature profile method the equilibrium temperature method has been most widely applied in the past few decades e g bogan et al 2003 caissie et al 2005 mcjannet et al 2008 mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 in this study we modified the conventional equilibrium temperature algorithm that account for the ahf to estimate g for the urban water body the equilibrium temperature method assumes the water temperature remains unchanged vertically where the equilibrium temperature te is calculated based on the energy balance shown as eq 9 9 r n a h f l e h it is pointing that the r n in eq 9 is distinct from rn in eq 2 since the longwave upward radiation in r n is calculated based on the equilibrium temperature te rather than wst the determinations of longwave upward rl and longwave downward radiation rl in r n are presented as eqs 10 11 zhao and gao 2019 10 r l ε a σ t a 273 4 ε a k t a c 11 r l ε w σ t e 273 4 ε w k t e c where te represents the equilibrium temperature c k and c are two constants set to 0 46 and 28 4 mj m2 d respectively the sensible heat flux and latent heat flux in eq 9 are parameterized through eqs 12 13 12 h γ f u t e t a 13 le δ r n a h f g γ f u e s e a δ γ bringing the eqs 10 13 into eq 9 the expression of te for urban water body can be written as eq 14 14 t e k ε a t a f u δ γ t a 1 α r s a h f c ε w ε a f u e s e a k ε w f u δ γ the water column temperature tw and lag time τ are estimated through eqs 15 16 15 t w t e t w 0 t e e 1 τ 16 τ ρ w c w z w 4 σ t n 273 13 3 λ f u δ

represents the specific heat capacity of water 4 2 103 j kg c zw represents the depth of water body m the final g is estimated using eq 17 once g is obtained g is further brought into eq 3 to determine e 17 g ρ w c w z w t w t wo 2 2 evaporative cooling effect of water body to evaluate the cooling performance of urban water body evaporation the temperature decrease induced by e is further estimated the cooling effect of 10 m3 air column above the unit area of water surface evaporation within one minute is calculated by the following formula zou et al 2019 18 δ t a 60 e ρ air c air v where δta represents the cooling rate of water surface for unit area c min m2 cair represents the specific heat capacity of air 1 005 103 j kg c v represents the air volume set to 10 m3 ρair represents the air density kg m2 estimated using eq 19 19 ρ air 1 2387 0 0039 t a the temperature decrease induced by water body evaporation among n water bodies is estimated based on the area of water body shown as eq 20 20 δ t an s 1 δ t 1 s 2 δ t 2 s 3 δ t 3 s n δ t n where δtan represents the cooling rate for all of n water bodies c min sn represents the area for nth water body m2 and δtn represents the cooling rate for nth water body c min the cooling effect induced by e in the main urban area δtau and e in the suburbs δtas can be calculated by the following equation 21 δ t u s 1 δ t 1 s 2 δ t 2 s 3 δ t 3 s un δ t un s u 22 δ t s s 1 δ t 1 s 2 δ t 2 s 3 δ t 3 s sn δ t sn s s where δtun represents the cooling rate for all of n water bodies in the main urban area and δtsn represents the cooling rate for all of n water bodies in the suburb area c min su represents the total area for main urban region and ss represents the total area for suburb region m2 2 3 trend attribution analysis 2 3 1 relative contribution of evaporation and temperature changes to the uhi effect trend the temporal variation of uhi effect is caused by the changes in urban microclimate for example an increase in the temperature may exacerbate the uhi effect while an increase in the evaporation cooling may alleviate the uhi effect determining the relative contribution of temperature and evaporation changes to the uhi effect is helpful to provide a deep understanding about the mechanism of uhi effect variations in the present study the one factor at a time method is used to quantify the relative contributions of temperature increase and evaporation increase to the trend of uhi effect during the period 1986 2015 wei et al 2013 ma and zhang 2022 it is mentioned that we assume the long term uhi variation is caused by a combination of rising air temperature induced by urbanization and enhanced cooling performance induced by e increase while the contribution of other factors to the uhi trend is ignored e g radiation ra and u this is due to the fact that the variations of ra and u has minimal impact on uhi effect the expression of the trend attribution analysis of uhi effect is shown in eq 23 23 u h i t u h i t am t am t u h i e m e m t δ where the tam and em represent the mean temperature and mean evaporation for the whole urban area uhi t tam t and em t represent the derivatives of uhi tam and em over time similar uhi tam and uhi em represent the derivatives of uhi over tam and em δ represents the error term 2 3 2 relative contribution of meteorological factors variations to the evaporative cooling trend the relative contribution of meteorological factors variations to the evaporative cooling trend is further investigated the difference between δtau and δtas for the two cities δt u s is firstly calculated the variable δt u s can reflect the mitigation of uhi effect induced by evaporative cooling then the differences in various meteorological factors between main urban areas and suburbs are further determined the trend of δt u s during the period 1986 2015 is attributed to temporal variations in differences in various meteorological factors between main urban areas and suburbs ta ra u and rh the expression of the trend attribution analysis of δt u s is shown in eq 24 24 δ t u s t δ t u s t a u s t a u s t δ t u s r a u s r a u s t δ t u s u u s u u s t δ t

different climatic regions are selected for the e analysis to comprehensively reveal the mitigation performance of urban e to uhi effect the first megacity is tianjin located in northern china and the northeastern part of the north china plain tianjin belongs to a semi humid monsoon climate in the warm temperate zone with an annual average temperature of 14 c july is the hottest month with a monthly average temperature of 28 c january is the coldest month with an average monthly temperature of 2 c the uhi effect caused the air temperature in the main urban area to be 0 4 2 1 c higher than that in the suburb area the average annual precipitation varies in the range of 360 970 mm the total number of water body within the tianjin is 205 where 95 water bodies in main urban area and 110 water bodies in suburban area the relative proportion of man made landscape water body river reservoir and pond areas to the total water surface area are 4 32 10 71 50 14 and 34 83 respectively the second megacity is shenzhen located in the southern coast of guangdong province in south china shenzhen belongs to a subtropical monsoon climate with significantly higher annual precipitation and temperature than tianjin the annual average temperature in shenzhen is 23 3 c the coldest month january is 15 7 c and the hottest month july august is 29 c the annual precipitation is 1932 9 mm and most of the precipitation is concentrated in the flood season april september the uhi effect cause the air temperature in the main urban area to be 0 6 2 4 c higher than that in the suburb area the total number of water body within the shenzhen is 139 where 65 water bodies in main urban area and 74 water bodies in suburban area the relative proportion of man made landscape water body river reservoir and pond areas to the total water surface area are 12 16 12 74 31 31 and 43 79 respectively the reasons for choosing these two cities as research areas include the following four aspects 1 the total water body area in the main urban region is close to the total water body area in the suburban region for these two cities therefore when comparing the evaporative cooling effect between main urban and suburban regions the varying evaporative cooling performance caused by different water surface areas for these two regions is avoided 2 the urbanization process has a small impact on the water surface area of the two cities resulting in a smaller range of changes in the water surface area of the two cities in the past 30 years 3 the water body evaporation of these two cities has long term field observations which ensure the model performance can be comprehensively evaluated 4 these two cities belong to different climatic conditions hence it helps to provide a deep understanding about the response of e to different climatic settings fig 1 shows the geographic locations and spatial distributions of water bodies in tianjin and shenzhen 2 5 data collection 2 5 1 field observations of e e over the two cities is measured using the evaporation pan and bowen ratio energy balance breb methods during the period 2016 2021 specifically a total of 12 water bodies in tianjin and 25 water bodies in shenzhen have long term evaporation pan observations these evaporation pan observations contain a variety of water surface evaporation i e rivers lakes ponds and a wide variation of water depth conditions therefore they are representative for evaluating of the model performance the diameter and depth of the evaporation pan are 2 m and 0 3 m respectively the daily e is determined based on the difference in the weight of the evaporation pan on the previous day and the next day anda et al 2018 moreover these evaporation pan also have meteorological variables measurements in addition to evaporation pan observations 3 open water bodies in tianjin and 2 open water bodies in shenzhen has long term breb based daily e observations the breb method calculates the bowen ratio br by observing the slope of the air temperature difference and the humidity difference between two heights above the water surface hicks et al 2020 the height difference is 1 2 m for the breb system the net radiation flux rn is measured using rebs united states the air temperature of the two heights is measured using pft 01 prede japan and the humidity of the two heights is measured using chs aps tdk japan the final e for the breb method is determined based on the energy balance theory hicks et al 2020 2 5 2 input data collection the model input data consist of meteorological forcing and satellite imagery for water bodies that have evaporation pan and breb observations the meteorological inputs including air temperature ta radiation ra relative humidity rh wind speed u and vapuor pressure deficit vpd are directly taken from the field data collection for water bodies without field observations various meteorological forcing is taken from the china meteorological sharing platform cmsp http www nmic cn data cdcindex cid 6d1b5efbdcbf9a58 html the meteorological factors provided by cmsp often has missed observations due to instrument failure as a supplement to cmsp meteorological forcing of the two cities are also downloaded from terraclimate at a spatial resolution of 1 24 abatzoglou et al 2018 the terraclimate dataset is also applied to obtain historical meteorological factors during the period 1986 2015 over the two cities the meteorological factors of different urban water bodies over the two cities are extracted from grid imagery of terraclimate according to their longitude and latitude moreover the water surface temperature wst is retrieved from the landsat thermal infrared band 10 6 12 51 μm it is worth mentioning that the landsat satellite images are affected by cloud cover especially for shenzhen which is often hit by typhoons to solve this issue we use the curve fitting approach to generate continuous spatial temporal wst images ding and elmore 2015 the area and shape of urban open water body over the two cities are extracted through landsat green band 0 525 0 600 μm and near infrared band 0 845 0 885 μm olthof rainville 2022 pickens et al 2020 to ensure that different data sources have the same spatial resolution the various meteorological forcing and satellite imagery is resampled to grid data with 30 m 30 m spatial resolution the validation with the ground in situ meteorological and wst record suggest that the terraclimate and landsat could provide reliable meteorological and wst observations the average mean absolute percentage error mapd over the two cities are 1 7 2 8 2 0 and 1 5 for ta ra u and rh respectively compared with the in situ meteorological observations the average mapd for landsat based wst retrieval over the two cities is 0 9 for each urban water bodies the temporal series meteorological data is obtained through averaging overlapping grid cells according to their shapefile this effectively reduces the uncertainty caused by the meteorological grid data and facilitate the extraction of all grid cells to assess the responses of es and eu to future climate change the future climate data is downloaded from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isi mip warszawski et al 2014 the isi mip is a global scale climate projection the ta ra u and rh under three representative concentration pathways rcp rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 are obtained over the two cities during the period 2023 2100 specifically when isi mip is applied to tianjin and shenzhen the future climate data is firstly extracted for the two cities based on their geographical locations then the extracted future climate data of the two cities is downscaled in a high spatial resolution 100 m 100 m finally the future climate data for a specific water body is extracted based on its latitude and longitude from the downscaled future climate dataset the statistical dynamical downscaling sdd method is applied to downscale the three rcp datasets to urban scale at 100 m spatial resolution roy et al 2021 duchêne et al 2020 2022 the sdd is a state of art downscaling method designed for urban region which coupled the regional climate model with the land surface model roy et al 2021 duchêne et al 2020 2022 the validation with urban historical meteorological record indicate that the sdd method successfully downscale the original isi mip data to the urban scale over the two megacities the average mapd over the two cities are 2 3 3 5 2 8 and 4 3 for the downscaling of ta ra u and rh respectively 2 6 model operation and evaluation as limited by available in situ urban e datasets the proposed ahf penman model is operated and verified from 2016 to 2021 at a daily scale the calculated urban water surface evaporation is divided into e from main urban areas eu and e from suburban areas es the simulated e in these two regions is verified independently using four conventional statistical parameters including root mean square error rmse determination coefficient r2 bias and mapd the cooling effect of e in the main urban area δtau and suburban area δtas are further separated to evaluate the responses of uhi effect to eu and es for the reconstruction of historical urban δtau and δtas variations the model is run on a monthly scale for the prediction of urban δtau and δtas in the next 78 years the model is run on a monthly scale and then average to a yearly scale due to the mismatch issue of the temporal resolution of various input data sets the mann kendall m k trend test is applied to test the historical and future trends of δtau and δtas at 95 confidence level güçlü 2020 hamed 2009 3 results and analysis 3 1 model performance evaluation the performance of the proposed ahf penman model is verified with the evaporation pan and breb observations across 42 water bodies within the two cities fig 2 a shows the scatterplot between the observed daily e and predicted daily e tables 1 and 2 present the specific statistics parameters generally the modified penman model that considers ahf improved the simulation accuracy of urban e compared with the original penman model the original penman model is defined as the penman model do not consider ahf the average r2 across 42 urban water bodies increased by 0 10 when coupled with ahf in the model framework the rmse and mapd values were reduced by 16 1 w m2 and 3 8 respectively according to the bias results the original penman model shows an underestimation of e in case of ahf is ignored average bias is 12 3 w m2 across 42 urban water bodies the underestimation of urban e in the original penman model also reflected in the monthly series of measured urban e and simulated urban e by original penman model refer to fig 3 the ahf penman model effectively alleviates the e underestimation issue even though the bias value is negative average bias is 2 2 w m2 for ahf penman model across 42 urban water bodies it is speculated that the issue of e underestimation in the original penman model is due to the fact that the ahf is not incorporated into the energy balance equation the model performance improvements for eu and es simulations are further analyzed fig 2 b c display the r2 and rmse distributions for simulations of eu and es when using both the original penman and ahf penman models for es simulation the r2 slightly increased by 0 04 and rmse slightly decreased by 6 5 w m2 compared with the original penman model in terms of eu simulation the r2 significantly increased by 0 20 and rmse significantly decreased by 26 6 w m2 compared with the original penman formula fig 4 present the spatial distribution of rmse obtained by the original penman model minus the rmse obtained by the ahf penman model δrmse clearly the δrmse is larger in main urban area and smaller in suburbs area over the two cities these verification results shows that the model performance improvements of e simulation in main urban areas are significantly higher than that in suburban areas when considering ahf in the energy balance equation which proves the effectiveness and necessity of fusion ahf for enhancing e simulation in main urban areas in essence the significant improvement of model accuracy for the main urban area in case of considering ahf can be explained by the abundant ahf sources in the main urban area according to the statistical results the average ahf value of the main urban area over the two cities can reach 90 8 w m2 while the average ahf value of the suburbs area over the two cities is only 22 4 w m2 therefore the model performance improvements when considering ahf will be benefit more from eu simulation and less from es simulation fig 5 provide the relative contributions of the three ahf components ahfb ahfv and ahfh to the total ahf over the two cities as envisaged in fig 5 the ahfb is the dominant part in the total ahf which account for 72 8 and 80 2 of the total ahf for tianjin and shenzhen respectively the ahfh has the smallest proportion in the total ahf with only 7 2 and 3 3 for tianjin and shenzhen respectively the relative contributions of the three components of ahf in tianjin and shenzhen is similar to previous study in beijing liu et al 2021 to evaluate the effect of g on e simulation improvement we further simulate e by ahf penman model without considering g it is pointed out here that ahf is considered in this case the verification results suggested that the r2 significantly decreased by 0 12 rmse and mapd significantly increased by 19 0 w m2 and 4 8 compared to the ahf penman model which proves that g is essential in the accurate simulation of urban e table 2 the e over the two cities is further divided into evaporation from shallow water bodies esh and evaporation from deep water bodies ede according to the depth of the water body the shallow water body is defined as the water depth 5 m while the deep water body is defined as the water depth larger than 5 m fig 2 d e presents the rmse and r2 distributions for esh and ede simulations using the ahf penman model and the ahf penman model that do not integrate g for esh simulation a slight decline in model accuracy is observed evidenced by the r2 only decreased by 0 05 and rmse only increased by 6 7 w m2 compared to the ahf penman model that considering g unfortunately significant model performance degradation appeared for the simulation of ede the r2 and rmse are 0 62 and 49 5 w m2 for ede simulation which decreased by 0 23 and increased by 33 3 w m2 respectively compared to the ahf penman model that considering g clearly the consideration of g is more effective in improving the e simulation performance of deep water bodies but less effective in improving the e simulations of shallow water bodies previous research also indicated that the influence of water heat storage on e is more significant in deep water than in shallow water bodies abtew 2001 linacre 1993 zhao and gao 2019 conclusively the above ground verification results demonstrate that the fusion of g and ahf in the classic penman formula both help to improve the simulation accuracy of water body evaporation in urban areas the consideration of ahf in the penman formula mainly enhances the e simulation for the main urban area while the consideration of g in the penman formula mainly enhances the e simulation for deep water bodies 3 2 response of the uhi effect on eu and es the estimated eu and es are further converted into air temperature decrease δta according to eqs 18 22 the temporal series of monthly average δtau and δtas of tianjin and shenzhen are presented in fig 6 as envisaged in fig 6 the monthly δtau and δtas exhibit significant seasonal variation during 2016 2021 which is higher in summer but lower in winter the seasonal characteristics of δtau and δtas are consistent with e radiation air temperature and potential evapotranspiration intercomparing δtau and δtas indicates that the δtau is always larger than δtas for the two cities the monthly average δtau range between 1 6 5 1 c with an average value of 3 3 c for tianjin 2 2 5 6 c with an average value of 3 9 c for shenzhen as a comparison the monthly average δtas range between 1 3 4 3 c with an average value of 2 8 c for tianjin 1 7 4 8 c with an average value of 3 2 c for shenzhen the δtau is higher than δtas over the two cities because the air temperature in the main urban area is higher than that in the suburbs which accelerates the evaporation of the water body and enhances its cooling effect it is mentioned that the water surface area of the suburb and the main urban area in these two cities are relatively close as a result the evaporative cooling performance of the main urban area is stronger than that of the suburb area due to the higher e value in addition δtau and δtas in shenzhen are higher than those in tianjin which could be attributed to the higher air temperature and radiation in shenzhen many previous studies have also reported that the potential evaporation and water evaporation rate in southern china are significant larger than those in northern china e g jin et al 2022 tian et al 2021 wang et al 2019 the uhi effect for the two cities is determined to evaluate the response of the uhi effect to eu and es variations the uhi effect is calculated as the spatial average air temperature in the main urban area minus spatial average air temperature in the suburban area fig 7 a shows the temporal series of the annual average uhi effect for the two cities the six years average uhi effect for tianjin and shenzhen is 1 2 c and 1 4 c during the period 2016 2021 where the uhi effect in these two cities is higher in summer and lower in winter to determine the response of uhi effect to eu and es a numerical experiment is conducted over the two cities specifically the uhi effect are evaluated in the case of completely removing water body evaporation in main urban and suburban areas respectively from fig 7b if all water bodies in the main urban areas of the two cities are removed the six year s average uhi effect will be significantly increased to 4 5 c and 5 3 c for tianjin and shenzhen respectively however suppose all water bodies in the suburban area of two cities are removed the six year average uhi effect will significantly decrease to 1 6 c and 1 8 c for tianjin and shenzhen respectively in this case the two cities exhibit an urban cold island effect rather than an urban heat island effect these results highlight the mitigation of the uhi effect benefits from the water body evaporation from main urban area rather than water body evaporation from suburban area the removal of water bodies in the main urban area or creating of a water body in the suburbs area will not alleviate the uhi effect but will aggravate the uhi effect 3 3 response of δtau δtas and uhi effect to urbanization the long term eu and es variations are reconstructed through the landsat observations and reanalysis meteorological dataset and then convert to δtau and δtas according to the landsat observations urbanization do not significantly change the water surface area of the two cities during the period 1986 to 2015 urbanization only led to a 1 1 decrease of the water body area in tianjin and 1 4 decrease of the water body area in shenzhen therefore the influence of water surface area variation that induced by urbanization on evaporative cooling change is minimal fig 8 presents the monthly δtau and δtas anomalies during the period 1986 2015 over the two cities the m k trend testing results suggest that the δtau acts to a significant upward trend during 1986 2015 for tianjin and shenzhen specifically δtau significantly increases at a rate of 0 008 c year p 0 05 corresponding to an 8 6 increase above the multi year average δtau for tianjin similarity δtau significantly increase at a rate of 0 011 c year p 0 05 corresponding to a 11 2 increase above the multi year average δtau for shenzhen the significant upward trend of δtau could be attributed to the rising temperatures in main urban area that induced by the combined effect of climate change and urbanization intercomparing the upward rate of δtau over the two cities indicates that the upward rate of δtau for shenzhen is higher than that of tianjin 0 008 c year and 8 6 for tianjin 0 011 c year and 11 2 for shenzhen the higher upward rate of δtau associated with shenzhen could be attribute to its faster urbanization than tianjin according to the landsat observation the fractional impervious surface coverage in shenzhen increased approximately 15 times during the period 1985 2020 while this number is only 4 times for tianjin apart from δtau δtas over the two cities does not show a consistent temporal trend pattern for tianjin the δtas slightly increase at a rate of 0 001 c year p 0 05 with no statistical significance corresponding to only a 1 1 increase above the multi year average δtas while the upward trend of δtas for shenzhen has a statistical significance evidenced by the average increase rate is 0 006 c year p 0 05 corresponding to a 5 8 increase above the multi year average δtas note that although the upward trend of δtas in shenzhen has been statistically significant during the 30 years analysis period the increase rate of δtas for both two cities is lower than the increase rate of δtau during the 30 years period this can be explained as urbanization causing the increasing magnitude of impervious areas and the population in the main urban area is higher than in the suburbs as a consequence the temperature increase rate in the main urban area induced by urbanization is significantly larger than that in the suburbs which in turn accelerates the water body evaporation and its cooling performance in the main urban area in contrast the δtas rise in suburban areas is mainly caused by the regional temperature increases induced by climate change rather than urbanization the response of uhi effect to urbanization is further analyzed as envisaged in fig 9 a the uhi effect of both two cities exhibit an upward trend with rapid urbanization the rising rate of the uhi effect in shenzhen is still larger than that of tianjin 0 03 c year and 145 for tianjin 0 04 c year and 172 for shenzhen which is consistent with the above findings of δtau and δtas trends as mentioned before the higher uhi effect in shenzhen can be explained by its faster urbanization process the long term δtau and δtas variations are further removed from the uhi time series to evaluate the uhi response in case of the absence of eu and es according to the analysis results two main findings are summarized below first the rate of the uhi effect increases significantly when δtau is removed the rising rate of uhi effect increases considerable to 0 13 c year for tianjin corresponding to a 672 increase above the multi year average uhi effect fig 9b similarly the rising rate of the uhi effect increases to 0 15 c year for shenzhen corresponding to a 723 increase above the multi year average uhi effect fig 9b second the uhi effect rate significantly decrease when δtas is removed the rising rate of uhi effect decreases considerable to 0 08 c year for tianjin corresponding to a 423 decrease above the multi year average uhi effect fig 9c similarly the rising rate of the uhi effect decreased to 0 09 c year for shenzhen corresponding to a 486 decrease above the multi year average uhi effect fig 9c the above simulation experiments emphasize the importance role of eu to mitigate the uhi effect during the urbanization process removing the water body in the main urban area will significantly increase the temperature of the main urban area which will lead to an uncontrollable uhi effect on the contrary the removal of the water body in the suburban area will mitigate the uhi effect to a large extent 3 4 relative contribution of e increase and temperature increase on the uhi effect according to the above results the average uhi effect for tianjin and shenzhen are 1 2 c and 1 4 c during the period 2016 2021 meanwhile rapid urbanization exacerbated the uhi effect while the elevated water body evaporation partially offset the uhi effect with urbanization the trend attribution results indicate that the relative contribution of the increase in tam and the increase in em to the uhi trend are 80 and 20 in tianjin 82 and 18 in shenzhen fig 10 b in other words the rise in temperature induced by urbanization has increased the uhi effect of tianjin and shenzhen by 1 19 c and 1 53 c respectively during the 30 years period fig 10a however the uhi effect has dropped by 0 29 c and 0 33 c in tianjin and shenzhen during the 30 years period due to increased water surface evaporation refer to fig 10a although the contribution of rising e to the uhi trend is significantly smaller than that of rising temperature the importance role of e in slowing the upward trend of the uhi effect cannot be ignored notice that these evaporative cooling performances are evaluated in tianjin and shenzhen where the water body volume over the two cities is relatively smaller it can be speculated that for cities with more water bodies in the main urban area such as venice italy the relative contribution of e to the slowing of upward trend of the uhi effect will further increase 3 5 relationship between urban water body evaporation and the uhi effect the above results confirm that eu can effectively mitigate the uhi effect while es aggravates the uhi effect essentially the cooling capacity of a given water body depends on several aspects include the evaporation rate water body area ws and water body depth wd the evaporation rate is controlled by meteorological elements their relationship has been well studied therefore we mainly focus on the relationship between ws wd and evaporation cooling performance fig 11 a b shows the correlation analysis between the ws wd and δta generally a larger ws leads to a higher δta value and vice versa the pearson correlation coefficient r reaches 0 91 p 0 05 and 0 96 p 0 05 between ws and δta for tianjin and shenzhen respectively while the relationship between the wd and δta has no statistical significance the r values are only 0 12 p 0 05 and 0 08 p 0 05 between wd and δta for tianjin and shenzhen respectively these correlation analysis results show that the water body area rather than water depth plays a dominant role in controlling e and its cooling effect which is consistent with numerous previous studies findings e g fuentes et al 2020 zhao and gao 2019 2020 guan et al 2022 to gain a deep understanding about the relationships between δtau δtas and uhi effect a simulation experiment is conducted to determine the impact of different water body that has different ws and wd on the uhi effect we randomly remove one urban water body in each simulation experiment and calculate δta and uhi values over the two cities as a consequence a total of 343 sets of simulation scenarios are generated and 343 groups of δta and uhi data sets are obtained the results presented in fig 11c suggest that the relationship between δtau and uhi is positive r of 0 65 and 0 71 p 0 05 for tianjin and shenzhen respectively on the contrary the relationship between δtas and uhi effect is negative fig 11d r of 0 68 and 0 62 p 0 05 for tianjin and shenzhen respectively therefore the larger size water body in the main urban area leads to more substantial evaporation and cooling effects thus enhancing the mitigation performance of the uhi effect however although the larger size water bodies in the suburban area lead to more substantial evaporation and cooling effects the mitigation performance of the uhi effect is greatly reduced in this case in addition to the area and location of water bodies the volume of water bodies is also an essential factor in affecting uhi mitigation performance we sequentially remove 1 n water bodies from the suburbs and main urban areas over the two cities and determine δta and uhi values for each simulation scenario the n is set to 95 for water bodies in the main urban area of tianjin 110 for the suburbs area of tianjin 65 for the main urban area of shenzhen and 74 for the suburbs area of shenzhen as envisaged in fig 12 the uhi gradually increases when n vary from 1 95 for the main urban area in tianjin and gradually increases when n vary from 1 65 for the main urban area in shenzhen while the uhi gradually decreases when n vary from 1 110 for suburbs area in tianjin and gradually decreases when n vary from 1 74 for suburban area in shenzhen to this end the mitigation of the uhi effect will benefit greatly from the increase in the number of water bodies in the main urban area or the decrease in the number of water bodies in the suburbs these results underscore the importance of massive construction of large area water bodies in main urban areas to better exert the function of water evaporation in alleviating the uhi effect which is entirely meaningful as it provides an excellent scientific basis for the planning of urban landscape water bodies 3 6 response of δtau and δtas to future climate change previous studies have shown that future climate change led to increases in co2 concentration and air temperature which in turn consequence an upward trend in global land surface evapotranspiration e g miralles et al 2014 dong and dai 2017 pascolini campbell et al 2021 ma et al 2021 however how future climate change affects water body evaporation especially in urban areas remains unclear assessing the impact of future climate change on urban e is of great significance as it contributes to better urban landscape water planning under the background of a warming climate the isi mip dataset is used to construct future climate change scenarios as mentioned in section 2 5 2 for the forecasting of urban e during the period 2023 2100 two assumptions are adopted 1 it is assumed that the urban water surface area remains unchanged during the period 2023 2100 2 since future ahf data is not available it is assume that ahf keeps linearly increasing with air temperature as a result the future ahf is estimated based on the current ahf value as a baseline and predicted as a linear relationship with air temperature figs 13 and 14 shows the annual changes of δtau and δtas over two cities during 2023 2100 clearly both the δtau and δtas for the two cities maintain an upward trend under future climate scenarios specifically δtau significantly increases at a rate of 0 007 c year p 0 05 0 015 c year p 0 05 and 0 029 c year p 0 05 under the climate scenarios of rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively for tianjin as a comparison the increase rate of δtas is slightly lower than δtau evidenced by the δtas increase at a rate of 0 004 c year p 0 05 0 011 c year p 0 05 and 0 022 c year p 0 05 under the climate scenarios of rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively for tianjin a similar phenomenon also occurred in shenzhen where the δtau significantly increase at a rate of 0 008 c year p 0 05 0 017 c year p 0 05 and 0 031 c year p 0 05 under the climate scenarios of rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively however the rate of increasing reduces to 0 004 c year p 0 05 0 012 c year p 0 05 and 0 023 c year p 0 05 under the climate scenarios of rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively for δtas generally the rising rate of δtau and δtas under rcp 8 5 scenario is higher than that of rcp 4 5 and rcp 2 6 scenarios which can be explained by the higher co2 emissions scenarios lead to a faster temperature rise rate thus the consequence of higher e and δt values moreover the rising rate of δta in main urban areas is higher than in the suburbs for the two cities which is quite similar to the findings in section 3 3 overall the above results emphasize that the cooling performance of urban water surface evaporation will be further enhanced under the future climate change which will gain the capability of urban e to offset the uhi effect 4 discussion 4 1 model performance evaluation and algorithm merits accurate estimation of urban water evaporation is challenging due to the multiple heat flux sources and complex turbulent transport processes in urban areas to our knowledge this is the first customized model to simulate water body evaporation in urban areas the model validation results indicate that considering ahf in the penman formula significantly improves the simulation accuracy of eu and considering the water heat storage change in the penman formula significantly improves the simulation accuracy of deep water bodies ground validation of the ahf penman model over two megacities yielded an rmse of 21 1 w m2 and an r2 of 0 82 which exhibit comparable and slight better performance than most previous studies conducted in natural water bodies e g guan et al 2022 fuentes et al 2020 tian et al 2021 mcjannet et al 2012 zhao and gao 2019 zhao et al 2020 chernet 2001 linacre 1993 the relatively better performance of the ahf penman model could be attributed to the following aspects 1 the ahf penman model avoids complex calculation of aerodynamic impedance parameters in the classic penman formula the greatest uncertainty lies in the calculation of the aerodynamic impedance parameters as its determination involves a series of complex thermodynamic and momentum roughness variables the proposed ahf penman model solved this problem by adding a wind function term f u see eq 4 in the model architecture which significantly reduces model complexity and uncertainty 2 the ahf not only integrated into the modified penman formula to estimate e but also integrated into the parametric scheme of g therefore the ahf penman model achieves a seamless and in depth coupling of ahf and classic penman model which ensures the surface energy balance equation can be implemented in urban areas 3 the landsat thermal infrared observation significantly reduces uncertainty of wst retrieval unlike previous studies in e simulation that extensively use moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis thermal infrared observations to retrieve wst this study use landsat thermal infrared band to retrieve wst due to its higher spatial resolution in urban areas the validation with in situ wst suggest that the rmse for wst retrieval by landsat thermal infrared sensors range between 0 9 1 5 k and the bias range between 0 3 0 4 k over the two cities this accuracy for wst retrieval is significantly higher than other thermal infrared satellite observations the rmse range between 1 2 3 6 k for modis and 1 4 2 5 k for ecostress over the two cities the reliable wst retrieval improves the simulation accuracy of longwave upward radiation as well as rn thus enhancing e simulation 4 the ahf penman model consider the effect of humidity change above the water body at the downwind direction through the integration of a wind fetch length function eq 4 this ensures that the ahf penman model has the ability to capture the decrease of e at downwind direction which caused by the increased air humidity to learn the effectiveness of wind fetch length function to improve the performance of urban e simulation we compare the urban e simulation accuracy by ahf penman model with the integration of f u and without the integration of f u fig 15 shows the distribution of wind direction of all water bodies over the two cities and the distribution of rmse for urban e simulation under the two simulation scenarios as envisaged in fig 15 when the ahf penman model do not integrate f u the error of the urban e simulation slightly increased the average rmse increase 3 8 w m2 and 4 5 w m2 for e simulation in tianjin and shenzhen respectively compared with the ahf penman model with the integration of f u this is solid evidence of the importance of considering the wind direction on the simulation of water body evaporation 4 2 impact of urbanization on urban e to mitigate uhi effect the results in section 3 3 demonstrate that the increase in δt u s enhances the mitigation capacity of urban e to uhi effect to gain further insight about the increased δt u s is caused by urbanization or other factors we conducted a trend attribution analysis of δt u s fig 16 a shows the results of the trend attribution analysis of δt u s over the two cities overall the ta u s is the dominant factor that control the trend of δtu s followed by ra u s u u s and rh u s for tianjin the relative contribution of the four meteorological elements to δt u s trend are 80 5 11 4 5 6 and 2 5 for ta u s ra u s u u s and rh u s respectively for shenzhen the relative contribution of the four meteorological elements to δt u s trend are 84 2 9 7 3 8 and 2 3 for ta u s ra u s u u s and rh u s respectively therefore the increased ta u s is the leading cause for the rise of δt u s during the 1986 2015 over the two cities in other words the increased temperature difference between the main urban and suburbs area uhi effect or ta u s is the main factor leading to the enhanced ability of e to mitigate the uhi effect the correlation between urbanization process with δt u s and uhi effect is further analyzed here the urbanization process is characterized as fractional impervious surface coverage fi which is retrieved from the satellite imagery as envisaged in fig 16 b the r reach 0 90 and 0 93 for the correlations between δt u s and fi in tianjin and shenzhen respectively indicate the urbanization process can explain more than 90 δt u s trend moreover the r reach 0 89 and 0 91 for the correlations between ta u s and fi in tianjin and shenzhen respectively indicate the urbanization process can explain approximately 90 uhi effect trend this is a solid evidence that the rise in temperature difference between main urban and suburbs areas uhi effect or ta u s induced by urbanization is the main reason for the enhanced ability of urban e to mitigate uhi effect according to the above results the urbanization process can explain approximately 90 of the enhanced ability of e to mitigate the uhi effect therefore although urbanization has accelerated the uhi effect this intensified uhi effect also enhances the mitigation ability of urban e to uhi effect to a certain extent 4 3 primary uncertainties and ways forward several sources of uncertainty contribute to the simulation errors of urban e include extraction of water surface area model mechanism and assumptions simulation of heat storage changes and ahf and various input datasets the first uncertainty comes from extracting the urban water body area from satellite imagery in this study the otsu thresholding method is applied to extract the water surface area of the two cities as suggested by zhao and gao 2020 however previous studies have shown that although the ostu thresholding method significantly improves the accuracy of water surface area extraction it will cause significant errors when applied to long term water body area extraction zhao and gao 2020 in addition compared with water bodies in natural ecosystems the size of water bodies in urban ecosystems is relatively smaller and their distributions are relatively scattered the landsat visible light imagery with 30 m spatial resolution may ignore part of small water surfaces e g the width of the water body smaller than 30 m which leads to inevitable errors in the estimation of e and its cooling performance therefore the mitigation effect of water surface evaporation on the uhi effect may be underestimated in the present study due to part of very small water bodies cannot be well captured moreover the relatively lower spatial resolution of the satellite images also has uncertainty for the accurate extraction of water body edges which further brings errors to the model results to this end it is recommended that follow up research use high spatial resolution satellite images for urban water surface extraction e g the spatial resolution higher than 10 m the second uncertainty could be attributed to the model algorithm and the determination of empirical parameters 1 although the ahf penman model takes into account the contribution of ahf to the energy balance other energy and water sources from the water body are not considered for example the validation results in section 3 1 shows that the ahf penman model tends to underestimate e due to the contribution of the horizontal laminar flow to the energy balance is ignored moreover the contributions of respiration and photosynthesis of aquatic plants aquatic organisms and birds to energy balance are also not considered in the revised model framework more importantly to improve water quality part of landscape water bodies has water inflow and outflow consequent the water volume is dynamic rather than static this dynamic process of the water body is also not parameterized in the model architecture 2 the empirical parameters involved in the ahf penman algorithm are set to constants which bring uncertainty to e simulation for instance simply setting the air εa and water specific emissivity εw to be constant increases model uncertainty in fact εa varied in a smaller range under a clear sky and cloudy conditions and εw is varied with the temperature change of the water body choi et al 2008 finch and hall 2001 similar uncertainty also exists in the settings of a and b in ahfv determination and the setting of k in g determination to this end the accuracy of the ahf penman model can be further improved if these empirical parameters are given physics expressions while this practice may further increase the model complexity the third uncertainty lies in the determination of the ahf and the heat storage change of the water body this study uses the statistical downscaling method to determine ahf from buildings the ahf from motor vehicles and human respiration are determined based on their densities and volumes however whether these statistics data can truly reflect heat flux emissions from buildings vehicles and humans require further investigation besides uncertainty also exists in the weight determination and regression of six building types in ahfb estimation regarding the simulation of water body heat storage a fundamental assumption in the equilibrium temperature method is that the water temperature remains unchanged vertically bruin 1982 however this assumption may produce large errors when applied to water bodies with sizeable vertical temperature variation in this case the temperature profile method is a good alternative to determine g moreover the simplified of longwave upward l and downward longwave radiation l in r n parametric scheme refer to eqs 10 11 also generate inevitable errors to g estimates zhao and gao 2019 finally although the proposed g parameterization scheme for urban water bodies has a strong physics basis the model framework is relatively complex and requires numerous meteorological inputs to reduce the complexity of the model architecture and the requirements for numerous input variables a simplified empirical regression method that considers ahf is highly expected in the subsequent research the last uncertainty comes from the meteorological driven dataset and field observations of e the results in section 2 5 2 indicate that there are systematic errors in the terraclimate meteorological data set these errors associate with various meteorological factors will be accumulated into the final e estimates through error propagation besides the uncertainty involved in the breb based e measurements cannot be ignored during the model validation it is assuming that the footprints of latent heat flux observed by the breb system are all from the water body area this assumption is perfectly applicable for large water body areas but there may be large errors for small water body areas because part of the observed flux footprints come from surrounding vegetation and impervious areas rather than water body areas to this end the flux trace based on the flux footprint approach for breb observations provides an opportunity for model performance further improvement 5 conclusions this study proposes an ahf penman model for simulation of water body evaporation e in urban areas the ahf penman model considers the contribution of anthropogenic heat flux ahf to the energy balance equation the ahf also integrated into the equilibrium temperature method to enhance the water heat storage g simulation the performance of the proposed ahf penman is validated in two megacities in china the urban water body evaporation and its cooling effects in main urban δtau and suburbs areas δtas are further evaluated using the ahf penman model the responses of uhi effect to eu and es in these two areas is revealed the long term historical δtau and δtas changes are reconstructed and the impact of urbanization on δtau δtas and uhi effects are assessed finally the responses of δtau and δtas to future climate change are evaluated the main conclusions and findings of this study are summarized as follows 1 considering ahf significantly improves the simulation accuracy of urban e especially for the simulation of e in the main urban area where the sources and magnitude of ahf are larger than in the suburban area the average r2 across 42 urban water bodies increased by 0 10 and the average rmse and mapd values reduced by 16 1 w m2 and 4 8 respectively compared to the original penman model in urban e simulation moreover the consideration of g in the penman formula is more effective for enhancing the model performance of deep water bodies than shallow water bodies for the simulation of e in shallow water bodies the r2 only increases by 0 05 and rmse only decreased by 6 7 w m2 compared to the penman model that do not consider g 2 the δtau is larger than δtas over the two cities due to the higher temperatures in the main urban areas consequence the evaporative cooling effect of the water body in the main urban area is larger than that in the suburbs in addition increasing e in the main urban area helps to alleviate the uhi while increasing e in the suburbs exacerbates the uhi the mitigation of the uhi effect mainly benefits from e in the main urban area rather than e in the suburban area 3 both of δtau δtas and uhi shows an upward trend with rapid urbanization the relative contribution of the increase in air temperature and the increase in water evaporation to the uhi trend is 80 and 20 for tianjin 82 and 18 for shenzhen the upward trend of δtau is slightly higher than that of δtas indicating that the contribution of evaporation cooling to uhi effect mitigation is increased with urbanization further analysis suggest the urbanization process can explain approximately 90 of the enhanced ability of e to mitigate the uhi effect the relatively higher increase rate associated with δtau could be attributed to the combined effect of climate change and urbanization while the lower increase rate of δtas is explained as its changes are only controlled by climate change 4 the cooling effect of water surface evaporation is dominated by the volume and area of the water body rather than the depth of the water body the large amount of large area water bodies in the main urban area helps to mitigate the uhi effect in contrast the large amount of large area water bodies in the suburbs accelerates the uhi effect 5 both δtau and δtas will increase under the future climate change the increase rate of δtau is larger than δtas suggesting the mitigation performance of urban e to uhi effect will be further enhanced with future climate change credit authorship contribution statement han chen data curation

1730,the urban heat island uhi effect is accelerated with urbanization and climate change thus threatening human survival the evaporation from water body e takes away energy through heat absorption process thereby effectively play a role in temperature cooling and uhi effect alleviation however the response of uhi effect to urban e is still lacks study in the current uhi research to address this issue this work proposes a customized water body evaporation model in urban areas the newly developed urban e model considers the contribution of anthropogenic heat flux ahf to the energy balance in urban areas meanwhile ahf is also used to enhance the simulation of the water heat storage change g for urban water body validation results in two megacities in china indicate that the developed urban e model which considered ahf in the energy balance equation significantly improves the simulation performance of e in the main urban area the root mean square error rmse significantly decreased by 26 6 w m2 compared with the original penman formula for e in the main urban area eu simulation the consideration of ahf in the g determination improves the simulation performance of e in the deep water body the rmse significantly decreased by 33 3 w m2 compared to the ahf penman model that do not considering g for e simulation in deep water body the developed urban e model is further used to evaluate the response of uhi to the eu and e in the suburban area es it is found that eu effectively alleviates uhi while es aggravate uhi moreover the cooling effect of e in the main urban areas δtau and suburbs δtas are increased with urbanization the increasing rate of δtau is higher than δtas indicate the contribution of evaporation cooling to the uhi alleviation is increased with urbanization further analysis demonstrate the urbanization process can explain approximately 90 of the enhanced ability of e to mitigate the uhi effect correlation analysis shows that the mitigation capability of e to uhi effect is mainly controlled by the volume and surface size of water body finally future climate scenario based urban e forecast confirms that δtau and δtas will continue to rise with climate change the average increasing rate are 0 018 c year and 0 013 c year for δtau and δtas respectively under the three representative concentration pathways the increasing rate of δtau is larger than δtas suggesting the mitigation of the uhi effect will benefit more from urban e under the future climate change generally our findings highlight that the mitigation of the uhi effect mainly benefits from e in the main urban area rather than e in the suburban area this study gains insight into e in urban areas including its algorithm interaction with the uhi effect and responses to urbanization and climate change the results of this study provide a good scientific basis for urban landscape water planning keywords urban heat island uhi effect urban water body evaporation anthropogenic heat

than those in suburban areas such a temperature difference phenomenon is called the urban heat island uhi effect zhao et al 2014 meng et al 2017 sobrino et al 2012 the uhi effect directly affects the living environment of human beings since it significantly increases the thermal stress and discomfort of the human body xia et al 2022 estoque et al 2016 the uhi effect has been exacerbated by persistent heatwave events in recent years which means that human survival in urban areas faces unprecedented challenges ramamurthy and bou zeid 2017 patz et al 2005 mitigation of the uhi effect is a global problem in which one of the effective means is to increase evaporation in urban areas moss et al 2018 zhang 2020 the evaporative endothermic process takes away the storage heat of the surface and air thereby cooling the surface and air temperature kaboré et al 2020 paschalis et al 2021 chen et al 2022b c previous studies have shown that the construction of landscape water bodies and landscape vegetation in urban areas can effectively mitigate the uhi effect since evaporation and transpiration from water bodies and vegetation surfaces occurs continuously unless the water is depleted soydan 2020 gao et al 2020 park et al 2021 paschalis et al 2021 the mitigation effect of vegetation transpiration on the uhi effect has been widely studied e g yan et al 2020 zhang 2020 ueyama ando 2020 peng et al 2022 erell zhou 2022 rakoto et al 2021 efforts have been made to compare the evaporative cooling performance under different vegetation species pataki et al 2011 chen et al 2019a vegetation patterns soydan 2020 rakoto et al 2021 peng et al 2022 and vegetation coverage erell zhou 2022 generally these vegetation cooling studies significantly enhanced the people s understanding of the response of the uhi effect to vegetation transpiration thus contributing to the alleviation of urban warming however there are relatively few studies has focused on the mitigation effect of water body evaporation e to uhi effect schibuola tambani 2020 weisman brutsaert 1973 it is pointed out here that the urban water bodies mentioned in the study include artificial landscape water bodies rivers ponds and reservoirs previous studies indicated that the evaporation rate of open water body surface is faster than that of vegetation surface because evaporation from open water bodies e is not constrained by the water supply and the opening and closing of stomata chen et al 2022a therefore evaporation from urban water bodies could be more effective than vegetation transpiration in achieving the uhi effect mitigation purpose several studies have investigated the cooling effect of urban e to urban thermal environment weisman brutsaert 1973 developed a semiempirical turbulence evaporation theory and investigated the cooling effect of a lake evaporation to urban thermal environment schibuola tambani 2020 assessed the mitigation performance of seawater cooled chillers to uhi effect over a coastal city suggested the uhi effect can be reduced 58 by seawater cooled chillers recently chakraborty et al 2023 evaluated the cooling effect of lake michigan to chicago through an ensemble model indicated the water body evaporation significantly reduced heat stress in chicago wang et al 2023 integrated weather research and forecasting model and urban canopy model to assess the mitigation effect of summer lake breeze on urban warming in chicago reported the lake breeze can effective mitigate heat stress in the afternoon although efforts have been made to evaluate the effect of urban e in mitigation of urban heat stress uhi effect significant knowledge gaps still exist including the followings 1 previous researches mainly focus on the evaluation of cooling performance of a specific urban water body however all water bodies within the urban area will play a role in urban temperature cooling 2 current researches investigates the response of urban temperature to water body evaporation but there is a lack of research on the response of uhi effect to water body evaporation 3 current researches does not distinguish between the response of heat stress and uhi effect to urban e from main urban and suburban areas 4 the current urban models in assessing the mitigation performance of urban e to uhi effect is relatively outdated lead to significant uncertainty of the model results these knowledge gaps cause the urban managers and policy makers cannot fully use urban water body evaporation to mitigate the uhi effect therefore a comprehensive analysis of the effect of urban e to uhi mitigation from main urban and suburban areas that based on a customized urban e model is highly expected the first knowledge gap is the lack of customized water body evaporation models for urban areas one significant difference between the urban area and natural area is a large amount of anthropogenic heat flux ahf in urban areas due to motor vehicle building emissions and human respiration which alters the surface energy balance process chen et al 2019a sun et al 2018 liu et al 2021 therefore significant errors will occur if the conventional surface energy balance equation is directly used to simulate e in urban areas another limitation is that the changes in water heat storage g are not well parameterized for urban water bodies it is known that e mainly occurs at the surface layer of the water body bowen 1926 zhao gao 2019 indicated that e is not only controlled by the interaction between the surface and the air but also controlled by the interaction between the water surface and the water column zhao et al 2020 the interaction between the water surface and the air is governed by the atmospheric moisture demand e g clausius clapeyron cc relation which is mainly manifested in air temperature saturated vapour deficit and wind speed mcvicar et al 2012 while the interaction between the water surface and the water column is mainly parameterized by the storage heat in the water column g de bruin 1982 zhao et al 2020 the classic penman and priestley taylor models are widely used to simulate e and potential evaporation in the natural ecosystem penman 1948 priestley and taylor 1972 unfortunately when these two classic models are used to simulate e in urban areas there will be large uncertainty since these models do not account for changes in water heat storage chernet 2001 sima et al 2013 note that the heat storage and its temporal variations in urban water bodies are distinct from natural water bodies due to the existence of ahf and uhi effects on the other hand previous studies suggested that the water heat storage can occupy half of the net radiative flux in a deeper water body e g depth greater than 10 m allen tasumi 2014 zhao gao 2019 zhao et al 2020 as a result the effect of water heat storage on e may be more pronounced for deep water bodies this is critical for accurately modelling e in urban areas since the depth of water bodies in urban areas often varies in a wide range e g 2 20 m to this end developing a customized urban water body evaporation model that accounts for both ahf and water heat storage change is urgent and necessary for accurate simulations of urban e the second knowledge gap is that the effect of water body location on the mitigation performance of the uhi effect is remain unclear urban areas can be broadly classified into main and suburban areas where the total urban area is usually greater than 100 km2 schneider et al 2010 weng 2012 revealing the response of uhi to e in main urban areas eu and e in suburban areas es is essential as it directly affects the mitigation performance of e to the uhi effect for example the construction of landscape water bodies on the suburban fringe may play a limited role in mitigating the uhi effect the ultimate goal of policy makers is to find a balance between the construction of urban landscape water body and commercial and residential areas in other words people want to mitigate the uhi effect on the premise of realizing urban economic development and human habitation however inadequate knowledge about the relationship between water body location and uhi mitigation performance hindered scientific urban landscape water body planning the third knowledge gap is that the response of urban e to urbanization is rarely studied urbanization leads to significant changes in urban land use and microclimate pathirana et al 2014 carlson arthur 2000 vinayak et al 2022 past studies has shown that the increase in impervious surface leads to a decrease in soil and vegetation coverage in urban areas resulting in a decrease in total urban evapotranspiration fang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 chen et al 2022a however there is still a lack of insight about how urbanization changes water body evaporation to our best knowledge only chen et al 2022a evaluated the response of urban e to urbanization and reported that urbanization has led to an increase in urban e due to urban warming unfortunately their study only analyzed the response of water body evaporation to urbanization in whole urban areas but did not distinguish the responses of eu and es to urbanization it is mentioned that the distinction between the responses of eu and es to urbanization is crucial because it helps to improve the understanding of the genesis and regulating mechanism of the uhi effect therefore the construction of a long term time series of urban e changes is critical which can facilitate the accurate revealing of the responses of eu and es to urbanization to address the several scientific issues mentioned above the main purposes of this study include the following 1 to conduct a customized water body evaporation model that considers ahf and g to gain the capability to simulate e in urban areas 2 to reveal the responses of uhi effect to eu and es 3 to reveal the responses of eu es and uhi effect to urbanization 4 to analyze the changing trends of eu and es under the future climate change this study will enhance our understanding of urban water body evaporation including its estimation method response to urbanization and climate change and interaction with the uhi effect the ultimate objective of this study is to provide a scientific basis for the urban landscape water body planning to alleviate the uhi effect 2 materials and methods 2 1 algorithm formulation 2 1 1 determination of e as mentioned before the significant difference between urban areas and natural ecosystem is the existence of anthropogenic heat flux ahf in the energy balance of urban areas therefore the energy balance equation for urban water body should add the ahf item shown in eq 1 1 r n a h f l e h g where rn ahf le and h represents the heat fluxes of net radiation anthropogenic latent heat and sensible heat w m2 respectively in the original energy balance equation g represents the soil heat flux w m2 for urban water body areas g represents the change of water heat storage w m2 the rn for the water body area is estimated using eq 2 2 r n 1 α w r s σ ε w w s t 4 ε a r l where αw represents the albedo for an open water body unitless accurate acquisition of αw involves a series of landsat imagery bands which include visible near infrared and thermal infrared bands subin et al 2012 rs and rl represents the downward solar shortwave radiation and downward atmospheric longwave radiation w m2 εw represents the specific emissivity for a water body set to 0 97 εa represents the specific emissivity for air set to 0 98 σ represents the stefan boltzman constant set to 4 9 10 9 mj m2 k4 e in an urban water body is determined through a modified penman model that account for the anthropogenic heat flux ahf penman model penman 1948 zhao and gao 2019 zhao et al 2020 shown as eq 3 the ahf penman model considers the combined constraints of energy balance anthropogenic heat flux and turbulent diffusion on e notice that not all ahfs in urban areas has an impact on the energy balance of water body considering the energy advection effect we only add ahf within 2 km radius of an open water body to the energy balance equation 3 e δ r n a h f g γ f u e s e a λ δ γ where λ represents the latent heat of water vaporization γ represents the psychrometric constant kpa c δ represents the slope of the temperature saturation water vapour curve at air temperature kpa c es and ea represents the saturated water vapor pressure and actual water vapor pressure kpa respectively 2 1 2 determination of wind fetch length function the key to apply penman formula to calculate water body evaporation lies in the determination of the wind fetch length function f u in eq 3 when the wind moves from upwind direction to downwind direction of a water body the humidity above the water surface at the downwind direction will gradually increase due to the evaporation loss as a consequence the evaporation in the downwind direction of the water body will gradually decrease due to the increased humidity therefore the influence of wind direction on water body evaporation cannot be ignored mcjannet et al 2012 proposed a wind fetch length to account for the effect of wind direction on e the proposed wind function considers the increased air humidity in the downwind direction of the water body through a fetch length parameter shown as eq 4 4 f u λ 2 33 1 65 u f l where f u represents the wind function which is controlled by the fetch length of open water body mcjannet et al 2012 zhao and gao 2019 zhao et al 2020 u represents the wind speed at 2 m height m s fl represent the fetch length of the water body m estimated as fl a w a represents the total area of open water body m2 w represents the width of open water body m fl is calculated for each water body under specific wind direction w is calculated as the distance between two tangents of water body in a direction parallel to the wind direction mcjannet et al 2012 zhao and gao 2019 zhao et al 2020 figure s1 shows a schematic diagram of the wind fetch length 2 1 3 determination of ahf there are three sources of ahf in urban areas namely building emissions vehicle emissions and human respiration eq 5 liu et al 2021 chen et al 2022a it is assumed that all of the energy consumption in the urban area will eventually convert into the heat flux between the atmosphere and the land surface while the hysteresis effect of energy conversion is ignored 5 ahf a h f b a h f v a h f h where ahfb ahfv and ahfh represents the ahf from building vehicle and human respiration w m2 respectively the ahfb can be estimated through the downscaling of statistical building energy consumption data liu et al 2021 first urban buildings are classified as 6 categories including residential areas commercial areas industrial areas school areas hospital areas and shopping areas then the 6 categories of urban buildings are given different energy consumption weights the settings of energy consumption weights for different urban building types are depended on the energy consumption intensity the details of energy consumption intensity for different urban building types can be referred to liu et al 2021 next the volume of 6 building types and their energy consumption is regressed to obtain the relationship between the building volume and energy consumption lastly the ahfb for a specific building can be downscaled based on the statistical building energy consumption energy consumption weights and building volume once downscaling the statistical building energy consumption to an individual building the expression of ahfb for a specific building i can be written as eq 6 liu et al 2021 6 ah f bi e di c h a i where ahfbi represents the ahfb for a specific building i edi represents the energy consumption for a specific building i ch represents the standard coal heat set to 2 9 107 j kg liu et al 2021 ai represents the area for a specific building i ahfv mainly comes from motor vehicle exhaust emissions therefore its value largely depends on traffic conditions in this study the ahfv is estimated through the vehicle number fuel efficiency driving distance and areas of traffic road the expression of ahfv is presented as eq 7 chen et al 2019a sun et al 2018 liu et al 2021 7 ah f v v d ρ v a b a v where v represents the total numbers of vehicles for a specific traffic area d represents the total driving distance for a specific vehicle km which is set to 10000 15000 km according to the government report ρv represents the fuel density set to 0 85 kg l a represents the fuel efficiency set to 0 12 l km b represents the vehicle heat emissions set to 4 5 107 j kg quah and roth 2012 av represents the total area for a specific traffic road m2 the ahfh is estimated based on the density of human activities since the human body has different metabolic rates during the daytime and nighttime the daytime and nighttime are separated to estimate ahfh shown as eq 8 8 ah f h p d ij m ra 16 p d ij m rs 8 a h where pdij represents the population density for a specific pixel i j person m2 mra represents the metabolic rate during the daytime 7 00 23 00 set to 175 w person mra represents the metabolic rate during the nighttime 23 00 7 00 set to 75 w person ah represents total areas that has human activity m2 2 1 4 determination of water heat storage changes water heat storage change g is another key variable for accurately simulating e in ahf penman model previous studies suggested that the e will be overestimated in spring and summer but underestimated in autumn and winter if the g is ignored in the penman formula zhao and gao 2019 currently there exist three types of methods to determine g the first is the empirical regression method which conducts the relationship between the g and rn duan and bastiaanssen 2015 the second is the equilibrium temperature method which parameterizes the water surface temperature when there is no heat exchange between the water surface and the air bruin 1982 the third is the water temperature profile method the water temperature profile method fully considers the change of water temperature in the vertical direction and enhances the simulation capacity of e zhao et al 2020 due to the large uncertainty of the empirical regression method and the dependence on in situ measurements of the temperature profile method the equilibrium temperature method has been most widely applied in the past few decades e g bogan et al 2003 caissie et al 2005 mcjannet et al 2008 mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 in this study we modified the conventional equilibrium temperature algorithm that account for the ahf to estimate g for the urban water body the equilibrium temperature method assumes the water temperature remains unchanged vertically where the equilibrium temperature te is calculated based on the energy balance shown as eq 9 9 r n a h f l e h it is pointing that the r n in eq 9 is distinct from rn in eq 2 since the longwave upward radiation in r n is calculated based on the equilibrium temperature te rather than wst the determinations of longwave upward rl and longwave downward radiation rl in r n are presented as eqs 10 11 zhao and gao 2019 10 r l ε a σ t a 273 4 ε a k t a c 11 r l ε w σ t e 273 4 ε w k t e c where te represents the equilibrium temperature c k and c are two constants set to 0 46 and 28 4 mj m2 d respectively the sensible heat flux and latent heat flux in eq 9 are parameterized through eqs 12 13 12 h γ f u t e t a 13 le δ r n a h f g γ f u e s e a δ γ bringing the eqs 10 13 into eq 9 the expression of te for urban water body can be written as eq 14 14 t e k ε a t a f u δ γ t a 1 α r s a h f c ε w ε a f u e s e a k ε w f u δ γ the water column temperature tw and lag time τ are estimated through eqs 15 16 15 t w t e t w 0 t e e 1 τ 16 τ ρ w c w z w 4 σ t n 273 13 3 λ f u δ

determine e 17 g ρ w c w z w t w t wo 2 2 evaporative cooling effect of water body to evaluate the cooling performance of urban water body evaporation the temperature decrease induced by e is further estimated the cooling effect of 10 m3 air column above the unit area of water surface evaporation within one minute is calculated by the following formula zou et al 2019 18 δ t a 60 e ρ air c air v where δta represents the cooling rate of water surface for unit area c min m2 cair represents the specific heat capacity of air 1 005 103 j kg c v represents the air volume set to 10 m3 ρair represents the air density kg m2 estimated using eq 19 19 ρ air 1 2387 0 0039 t a the temperature decrease induced by water body evaporation among n water bodies is estimated based on the area of water body shown as eq 20 20 δ t an s 1 δ t 1 s 2 δ t 2 s 3 δ t 3 s n δ t n where δtan represents the cooling rate for all of n water bodies c min sn represents the area for nth water body m2 and δtn represents the cooling rate for nth water body c min the cooling effect induced by e in the main urban area δtau and e in the suburbs δtas can be calculated by the following equation 21 δ t u s 1 δ t

the cooling rate for all of n water bodies in the suburb area c min su represents the total area for main urban region and ss represents the total area for suburb region m2 2 3 trend attribution analysis 2 3 1 relative contribution of evaporation and temperature changes to the uhi effect trend the temporal variation of uhi effect is caused by the changes in urban microclimate for example an increase in the temperature may exacerbate the uhi effect while an increase in the evaporation cooling may alleviate the uhi effect determining the relative contribution of temperature and evaporation changes to the uhi effect is helpful to provide a deep understanding about the mechanism of uhi effect variations in the present study the one factor at a time method is used to quantify the relative contributions of temperature increase and evaporation increase to the trend of uhi effect during the period 1986 2015 wei et al 2013 ma and zhang 2022 it is mentioned that we assume the long term uhi variation is caused by a combination of rising air temperature induced by urbanization and enhanced cooling performance induced by e increase while the contribution of other factors to the uhi trend is ignored e g radiation ra and u this is due to the fact that the variations of ra and u has minimal impact on uhi effect the expression of the trend attribution analysis of uhi effect is shown in eq 23 23 u h i t u h i t am t am t u h i e m e m t δ where the tam and em represent the mean temperature and mean evaporation for the whole urban area uhi t tam t and em t represent the derivatives of uhi tam and em over time similar uhi tam and uhi em represent the derivatives of uhi over tam and em δ represents the error term 2 3 2 relative contribution of meteorological factors variations to the evaporative cooling trend the relative contribution of meteorological factors variations to the evaporative cooling trend is further investigated the difference between δtau and δtas for the two cities δt u s is firstly calculated the variable δt u s can reflect the mitigation of uhi effect induced by evaporative cooling then the differences in various meteorological factors between main urban areas and suburbs are further determined the trend of δt u s during the period 1986 2015 is attributed to temporal variations in differences in various meteorological factors between main urban areas and suburbs ta ra u and rh the expression of the trend attribution analysis of δt u s is shown in eq 24 24 δ t u s t δ t u s t a u s t a u s t δ t u s r a u s r a u s t δ t u s u u s u u s t δ t

different climatic regions are selected for the e analysis to comprehensively reveal the mitigation performance of urban e to uhi effect the first megacity is tianjin located in northern china and the northeastern part of the north china plain tianjin belongs to a semi humid monsoon climate in the warm temperate zone with an annual average temperature of 14 c july is the hottest month with a monthly average temperature of 28 c january is the coldest month with an average monthly temperature of 2 c the uhi effect caused the air temperature in the main urban area to be 0 4 2 1 c higher than that in the suburb area the average annual precipitation varies in the range of 360 970 mm the total number of water body within the tianjin is 205 where 95 water bodies in main urban area and 110 water bodies in suburban area the relative proportion of man made landscape water body river reservoir and pond areas to the total water surface area are 4 32 10 71 50 14 and 34 83 respectively the second megacity is shenzhen located in the southern coast of guangdong province in south china shenzhen belongs to a subtropical monsoon climate with significantly higher annual precipitation and temperature than tianjin the annual average temperature in shenzhen is 23 3 c the coldest month january is 15 7 c and the hottest month july august is 29 c the annual precipitation is 1932 9 mm and most of the precipitation is concentrated in the flood season april september the uhi effect cause the air temperature in the main urban area to be 0 6 2 4 c higher than that in the suburb area the total number of water body within the shenzhen is 139 where 65 water bodies in main urban area and 74 water bodies in suburban area the relative proportion of man made landscape water body river reservoir and pond areas to the total water surface area are 12 16 12 74 31 31 and 43 79 respectively the reasons for choosing these two cities as research areas include the following four aspects 1 the total water body area in the main urban region is close to the total water body area in the suburban region for these two cities therefore when comparing the evaporative cooling effect between main urban and suburban regions the varying evaporative cooling performance caused by different water surface areas for these two regions is avoided 2 the urbanization process has a small impact on the water surface area of the two cities resulting in a smaller range of changes in the water surface area of the two cities in the past 30 years 3 the water body evaporation of these two cities has long term field observations which ensure the model performance can be comprehensively evaluated 4 these two cities belong to different climatic conditions hence it helps to provide a deep understanding about the response of e to different climatic settings fig 1 shows the geographic locations and spatial distributions of water bodies in tianjin and shenzhen 2 5 data collection 2 5 1 field observations of e e over the two cities is measured using the evaporation pan and bowen ratio energy balance breb methods during the period 2016 2021 specifically a total of 12 water bodies in tianjin and 25 water bodies in shenzhen have long term evaporation pan observations these evaporation pan observations contain a variety of water surface evaporation i e rivers lakes ponds and a wide variation of water depth conditions therefore they are representative for evaluating of the model performance the diameter and depth of the evaporation pan are 2 m and 0 3 m respectively the daily e is determined based on the difference in the weight of the evaporation pan on the previous day and the next day anda et al 2018 moreover these evaporation pan also have meteorological variables measurements in addition to evaporation pan observations 3 open water bodies in tianjin and 2 open water bodies in shenzhen has long term breb based daily e observations the breb method calculates the bowen ratio br by observing the slope of the air temperature difference and the humidity difference between two heights above the water surface hicks et al 2020 the height difference is 1 2 m for the breb system the net radiation flux rn is measured using rebs united states the air temperature of the two heights is measured using pft 01 prede japan and the humidity of the two heights is measured using chs aps tdk japan the final e for the breb method is determined based on the energy balance theory hicks et al 2020 2 5 2 input data collection the model input data consist of meteorological forcing and satellite imagery for water bodies that have evaporation pan and breb observations the meteorological inputs including air temperature ta radiation ra relative humidity rh wind speed u and vapuor pressure deficit vpd are directly taken from the field data collection for water bodies without field observations various meteorological forcing is taken from the china meteorological sharing platform cmsp http www nmic cn data cdcindex cid 6d1b5efbdcbf9a58 html the meteorological factors provided by cmsp often has missed observations due to instrument failure as a supplement to cmsp meteorological forcing of the two cities are also downloaded from terraclimate at a spatial resolution of 1 24 abatzoglou et al 2018 the terraclimate dataset is also applied to obtain historical meteorological factors during the period 1986 2015 over the two cities the meteorological factors of different urban water bodies over the two cities are extracted from grid imagery of terraclimate according to their longitude and latitude moreover the water surface temperature wst is retrieved from the landsat thermal infrared band 10 6 12 51 μm it is worth mentioning that the landsat satellite images are affected by cloud cover especially for shenzhen which is often hit by typhoons to solve this issue we use the curve fitting approach to generate continuous spatial temporal wst images ding and elmore 2015 the area and shape of urban open water body over the two cities are extracted through landsat green band 0 525 0 600 μm and near infrared band 0 845 0 885 μm olthof rainville 2022 pickens et al 2020 to ensure that different data sources have the same spatial resolution the various meteorological forcing and satellite imagery is resampled to grid data with 30 m 30 m spatial resolution the validation with the ground in situ meteorological and wst record suggest that the terraclimate and landsat could provide reliable meteorological and wst observations the average mean absolute percentage error mapd over the two cities are 1 7 2 8 2 0 and 1 5 for ta ra u and rh respectively compared with the in situ meteorological observations the average mapd for landsat based wst retrieval over the two cities is 0 9 for each urban water bodies the temporal series meteorological data is obtained through averaging overlapping grid cells according to their shapefile this effectively reduces the uncertainty caused by the meteorological grid data and facilitate the extraction of all grid cells to assess the responses of es and eu to future climate change the future climate data is downloaded from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isi mip warszawski et al 2014 the isi mip is a global scale climate projection the ta ra u and rh under three representative concentration pathways rcp rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 are obtained over the two cities during the period 2023 2100 specifically when isi mip is applied to tianjin and shenzhen the future climate data is firstly extracted for the two cities based on their geographical locations then the extracted future climate data of the two cities is downscaled in a high spatial resolution 100 m 100 m finally the future climate data for a specific water body is extracted based on its latitude and longitude from the downscaled future climate dataset the statistical dynamical downscaling sdd method is applied to downscale the three rcp datasets to urban scale at 100 m spatial resolution roy et al 2021 duchêne et al 2020 2022 the sdd is a state of art downscaling method designed for urban region which coupled the regional climate model with the land surface model roy et al 2021 duchêne et al 2020 2022 the validation with urban historical meteorological record indicate that the sdd method successfully downscale the original isi mip data to the urban scale over the two megacities the average mapd over the two cities are 2 3 3 5 2 8 and 4 3 for the downscaling of ta ra u and rh respectively 2 6 model operation and evaluation as limited by available in situ urban e datasets the proposed ahf penman model is operated and verified from 2016 to 2021 at a daily scale the calculated urban water surface evaporation is divided into e from main urban areas eu and e from suburban areas es the simulated e in these two regions is verified independently using four conventional statistical parameters including root mean square error rmse determination coefficient r2 bias and mapd the cooling effect of e in the main urban area δtau and suburban area δtas are further separated to evaluate the responses of uhi effect to eu and es for the reconstruction of historical urban δtau and δtas variations the model is run on a monthly scale for the prediction of urban δtau and δtas in the next 78 years the model is run on a monthly scale and then average to a yearly scale due to the mismatch issue of the temporal resolution of various input data sets the mann kendall m k trend test is applied to test the historical and future trends of δtau and δtas at 95 confidence level güçlü 2020 hamed 2009 3 results and analysis 3 1 model performance evaluation the performance of the proposed ahf penman model is verified with the evaporation pan and breb observations across 42 water bodies within the two cities fig 2 a shows the scatterplot between the observed daily e and predicted daily e tables 1 and 2 present the specific statistics parameters generally the modified penman model that considers ahf improved the simulation accuracy of urban e compared with the original penman model the original penman model is defined as the penman model do not consider ahf the average r2 across 42 urban water bodies increased by 0 10 when coupled with ahf in the model framework the rmse and mapd values were reduced by 16 1 w m2 and 3 8 respectively according to the bias results the original penman model shows an underestimation of e in case of ahf is ignored average bias is 12 3 w m2 across 42 urban water bodies the underestimation of urban e in the original penman model also reflected in the monthly series of measured urban e and simulated urban e by original penman model refer to fig 3 the ahf penman model effectively alleviates the e underestimation issue even though the bias value is negative average bias is 2 2 w m2 for ahf penman model across 42 urban water bodies it is speculated that the issue of e underestimation in the original penman model is due to the fact that the ahf is not incorporated into the energy balance equation the model performance improvements for eu and es simulations are further analyzed fig 2 b c display the r2 and rmse distributions for simulations of eu and es when using both the original penman and ahf penman models for es simulation the r2 slightly increased by 0 04 and rmse slightly decreased by 6 5 w m2 compared with the original penman model in terms of eu simulation the r2 significantly increased by 0 20 and rmse significantly decreased by 26 6 w m2 compared with the original penman formula fig 4 present the spatial distribution of rmse obtained by the original penman model minus the rmse obtained by the ahf penman model δrmse clearly the δrmse is larger in main urban area and smaller in suburbs area over the two cities these verification results shows that the model performance improvements of e simulation in main urban areas are significantly higher than that in suburban areas when considering ahf in the energy balance equation which proves the effectiveness and necessity of fusion ahf for enhancing e simulation in main urban areas in essence the significant improvement of model accuracy for the main urban area in case of considering ahf can be explained by the abundant ahf sources in the main urban area according to the statistical results the average ahf value of the main urban area over the two cities can reach 90 8 w m2 while the average ahf value of the suburbs area over the two cities is only 22 4 w m2 therefore the model performance improvements when considering ahf will be benefit more from eu simulation and less from es simulation fig 5 provide the relative contributions of the three ahf components ahfb ahfv and ahfh to the total ahf over the two cities as envisaged in fig 5 the ahfb is the dominant part in the total ahf which account for 72 8 and 80 2 of the total ahf for tianjin and shenzhen respectively the ahfh has the smallest proportion in the total ahf with only 7 2 and 3 3 for tianjin and shenzhen respectively the relative contributions of the three components of ahf in tianjin and shenzhen is similar to previous study in beijing liu et al 2021 to evaluate the effect of g on e simulation improvement we further simulate e by ahf penman model without considering g it is pointed out here that ahf is considered in this case the verification results suggested that the r2 significantly decreased by 0 12 rmse and mapd significantly increased by 19 0 w m2 and 4 8 compared to the ahf penman model which proves that g is essential in the accurate simulation of urban e table 2 the e over the two cities is further divided into evaporation from shallow water bodies esh and evaporation from deep water bodies ede according to the depth of the water body the shallow water body is defined as the water depth 5 m while the deep water body is defined as the water depth larger than 5 m fig 2 d e presents the rmse and r2 distributions for esh and ede simulations using the ahf penman model and the ahf penman model that do not integrate g for esh simulation a slight decline in model accuracy is observed evidenced by the r2 only decreased by 0 05 and rmse only increased by 6 7 w m2 compared to the ahf penman model that considering g unfortunately significant model performance degradation appeared for the simulation of ede the r2 and rmse are 0 62 and 49 5 w m2 for ede simulation which decreased by 0 23 and increased by 33 3 w m2 respectively compared to the ahf penman model that considering g clearly the consideration of g is more effective in improving the e simulation performance of deep water bodies but less effective in improving the e simulations of shallow water bodies previous research also indicated that the influence of water heat storage on e is more significant in deep water than in shallow water bodies abtew 2001 linacre 1993 zhao and gao 2019 conclusively the above ground verification results demonstrate that the fusion of g and ahf in the classic penman formula both help to improve the simulation accuracy of water body evaporation in urban areas the consideration of ahf in the penman formula mainly enhances the e simulation for the main urban area while the consideration of g in the penman formula mainly enhances the e simulation for deep water bodies 3 2 response of the uhi effect on eu and es the estimated eu and es are further converted into air temperature decrease δta according to eqs 18 22 the temporal series of monthly average δtau and δtas of tianjin and shenzhen are presented in fig 6 as envisaged in fig 6 the monthly δtau and δtas exhibit significant seasonal variation during 2016 2021 which is higher in summer but lower in winter the seasonal characteristics of δtau and δtas are consistent with e radiation air temperature and potential evapotranspiration intercomparing δtau and δtas indicates that the δtau is always larger than δtas for the two cities the monthly average δtau range between 1 6 5 1 c with an average value of 3 3 c for tianjin 2 2 5 6 c with an average value of 3 9 c for shenzhen as a comparison the monthly average δtas range between 1 3 4 3 c with an average value of 2 8 c for tianjin 1 7 4 8 c with an average value of 3 2 c for shenzhen the δtau is higher than δtas over the two cities because the air temperature in the main urban area is higher than that in the suburbs which accelerates the evaporation of the water body and enhances its cooling effect it is mentioned that the water surface area of the suburb and the main urban area in these two cities are relatively close as a result the evaporative cooling performance of the main urban area is stronger than that of the suburb area due to the higher e value in addition δtau and δtas in shenzhen are higher than those in tianjin which could be attributed to the higher air temperature and radiation in shenzhen many previous studies have also reported that the potential evaporation and water evaporation rate in southern china are significant larger than those in northern china e g jin et al 2022 tian et al 2021 wang et al 2019 the uhi effect for the two cities is determined to evaluate the response of the uhi effect to eu and es variations the uhi effect is calculated as the spatial average air temperature in the main urban area minus spatial average air temperature in the suburban area fig 7 a shows the temporal series of the annual average uhi effect for the two cities the six years average uhi effect for tianjin and shenzhen is 1 2 c and 1 4 c during the period 2016 2021 where the uhi effect in these two cities is higher in summer and lower in winter to determine the response of uhi effect to eu and es a numerical experiment is conducted over the two cities specifically the uhi effect are evaluated in the case of completely removing water body evaporation in main urban and suburban areas respectively from fig 7b if all water bodies in the main urban areas of the two cities are removed the six year s average uhi effect will be significantly increased to 4 5 c and 5 3 c for tianjin and shenzhen respectively however suppose all water bodies in the suburban area of two cities are removed the six year average uhi effect will significantly decrease to 1 6 c and 1 8 c for tianjin and shenzhen respectively in this case the two cities exhibit an urban cold island effect rather than an urban heat island effect these results highlight the mitigation of the uhi effect benefits from the water body evaporation from main urban area rather than water body evaporation from suburban area the removal of water bodies in the main urban area or creating of a water body in the suburbs area will not alleviate the uhi effect but will aggravate the uhi effect 3 3 response of δtau δtas and uhi effect to urbanization the long term eu and es variations are reconstructed through the landsat observations and reanalysis meteorological dataset and then convert to δtau and δtas according to the landsat observations urbanization do not significantly change the water surface area of the two cities during the period 1986 to 2015 urbanization only led to a 1 1 decrease of the water body area in tianjin and 1 4 decrease of the water body area in shenzhen therefore the influence of water surface area variation that induced by urbanization on evaporative cooling change is minimal fig 8 presents the monthly δtau and δtas anomalies during the period 1986 2015 over the two cities the m k trend testing results suggest that the δtau acts to a significant upward trend during 1986 2015 for tianjin and shenzhen specifically δtau significantly increases at a rate of 0 008 c year p 0 05 corresponding to an 8 6 increase above the multi year average δtau for tianjin similarity δtau significantly increase at a rate of 0 011 c year p 0 05 corresponding to a 11 2 increase above the multi year average δtau for shenzhen the significant upward trend of δtau could be attributed to the rising temperatures in main urban area that induced by the combined effect of climate change and urbanization intercomparing the upward rate of δtau over the two cities indicates that the upward rate of δtau for shenzhen is higher than that of tianjin 0 008 c year and 8 6 for tianjin 0 011 c year and 11 2 for shenzhen the higher upward rate of δtau associated with shenzhen could be attribute to its faster urbanization than tianjin according to the landsat observation the fractional impervious surface coverage in shenzhen increased approximately 15 times during the period 1985 2020 while this number is only 4 times for tianjin apart from δtau δtas over the two cities does not show a consistent temporal trend pattern for tianjin the δtas slightly increase at a rate of 0 001 c year p 0 05 with no statistical significance corresponding to only a 1 1 increase above the multi year average δtas while the upward trend of δtas for shenzhen has a statistical significance evidenced by the average increase rate is 0 006 c year p 0 05 corresponding to a 5 8 increase above the multi year average δtas note that although the upward trend of δtas in shenzhen has been statistically significant during the 30 years analysis period the increase rate of δtas for both two cities is lower than the increase rate of δtau during the 30 years period this can be explained as urbanization causing the increasing magnitude of impervious areas and the population in the main urban area is higher than in the suburbs as a consequence the temperature increase rate in the main urban area induced by urbanization is significantly larger than that in the suburbs which in turn accelerates the water body evaporation and its cooling performance in the main urban area in contrast the δtas rise in suburban areas is mainly caused by the regional temperature increases induced by climate change rather than urbanization the response of uhi effect to urbanization is further analyzed as envisaged in fig 9 a the uhi effect of both two cities exhibit an upward trend with rapid urbanization the rising rate of the uhi effect in shenzhen is still larger than that of tianjin 0 03 c year and 145 for tianjin 0 04 c year and 172 for shenzhen which is consistent with the above findings of δtau and δtas trends as mentioned before the higher uhi effect in shenzhen can be explained by its faster urbanization process the long term δtau and δtas variations are further removed from the uhi time series to evaluate the uhi response in case of the absence of eu and es according to the analysis results two main findings are summarized below first the rate of the uhi effect increases significantly when δtau is removed the rising rate of uhi effect increases considerable to 0 13 c year for tianjin corresponding to a 672 increase above the multi year average uhi effect fig 9b similarly the rising rate of the uhi effect increases to 0 15 c year for shenzhen corresponding to a 723 increase above the multi year average uhi effect fig 9b second the uhi effect rate significantly decrease when δtas is removed the rising rate of uhi effect decreases considerable to 0 08 c year for tianjin corresponding to a 423 decrease above the multi year average uhi effect fig 9c similarly the rising rate of the uhi effect decreased to 0 09 c year for shenzhen corresponding to a 486 decrease above the multi year average uhi effect fig 9c the above simulation experiments emphasize the importance role of eu to mitigate the uhi effect during the urbanization process removing the water body in the main urban area will significantly increase the temperature of the main urban area which will lead to an uncontrollable uhi effect on the contrary the removal of the water body in the suburban area will mitigate the uhi effect to a large extent 3 4 relative contribution of e increase and temperature increase on the uhi effect according to the above results the average uhi effect for tianjin and shenzhen are 1 2 c and 1 4 c during the period 2016 2021 meanwhile rapid urbanization exacerbated the uhi effect while the elevated water body evaporation partially offset the uhi effect with urbanization the trend attribution results indicate that the relative contribution of the increase in tam and the increase in em to the uhi trend are 80 and 20 in tianjin 82 and 18 in shenzhen fig 10 b in other words the rise in temperature induced by urbanization has increased the uhi effect of tianjin and shenzhen by 1 19 c and 1 53 c respectively during the 30 years period fig 10a however the uhi effect has dropped by 0 29 c and 0 33 c in tianjin and shenzhen during the 30 years period due to increased water surface evaporation refer to fig 10a although the contribution of rising e to the uhi trend is significantly smaller than that of rising temperature the importance role of e in slowing the upward trend of the uhi effect cannot be ignored notice that these evaporative cooling performances are evaluated in tianjin and shenzhen where the water body volume over the two cities is relatively smaller it can be speculated that for cities with more water bodies in the main urban area such as venice italy the relative contribution of e to the slowing of upward trend of the uhi effect will further increase 3 5 relationship between urban water body evaporation and the uhi effect the above results confirm that eu can effectively mitigate the uhi effect while es aggravates the uhi effect essentially the cooling capacity of a given water body depends on several aspects include the evaporation rate water body area ws and water body depth wd the evaporation rate is controlled by meteorological elements their relationship has been well studied therefore we mainly focus on the relationship between ws wd and evaporation cooling performance fig 11 a b shows the correlation analysis between the ws wd and δta generally a larger ws leads to a higher δta value and vice versa the pearson correlation coefficient r reaches 0 91 p 0 05 and 0 96 p 0 05 between ws and δta for tianjin and shenzhen respectively while the relationship between the wd and δta has no statistical significance the r values are only 0 12 p 0 05 and 0 08 p 0 05 between wd and δta for tianjin and shenzhen respectively these correlation analysis results show that the water body area rather than water depth plays a dominant role in controlling e and its cooling effect which is consistent with numerous previous studies findings e g fuentes et al 2020 zhao and gao 2019 2020 guan et al 2022 to gain a deep understanding about the relationships between δtau δtas and uhi effect a simulation experiment is conducted to determine the impact of different water body that has different ws and wd on the uhi effect we randomly remove one urban water body in each simulation experiment and calculate δta and uhi values over the two cities as a consequence a total of 343 sets of simulation scenarios are generated and 343 groups of δta and uhi data sets are obtained the results presented in fig 11c suggest that the relationship between δtau and uhi is positive r of 0 65 and 0 71 p 0 05 for tianjin and shenzhen respectively on the contrary the relationship between δtas and uhi effect is negative fig 11d r of 0 68 and 0 62 p 0 05 for tianjin and shenzhen respectively therefore the larger size water body in the main urban area leads to more substantial evaporation and cooling effects thus enhancing the mitigation performance of the uhi effect however although the larger size water bodies in the suburban area lead to more substantial evaporation and cooling effects the mitigation performance of the uhi effect is greatly reduced in this case in addition to the area and location of water bodies the volume of water bodies is also an essential factor in affecting uhi mitigation performance we sequentially remove 1 n water bodies from the suburbs and main urban areas over the two cities and determine δta and uhi values for each simulation scenario the n is set to 95 for water bodies in the main urban area of tianjin 110 for the suburbs area of tianjin 65 for the main urban area of shenzhen and 74 for the suburbs area of shenzhen as envisaged in fig 12 the uhi gradually increases when n vary from 1 95 for the main urban area in tianjin and gradually increases when n vary from 1 65 for the main urban area in shenzhen while the uhi gradually decreases when n vary from 1 110 for suburbs area in tianjin and gradually decreases when n vary from 1 74 for suburban area in shenzhen to this end the mitigation of the uhi effect will benefit greatly from the increase in the number of water bodies in the main urban area or the decrease in the number of water bodies in the suburbs these results underscore the importance of massive construction of large area water bodies in main urban areas to better exert the function of water evaporation in alleviating the uhi effect which is entirely meaningful as it provides an excellent scientific basis for the planning of urban landscape water bodies 3 6 response of δtau and δtas to future climate change previous studies have shown that future climate change led to increases in co2 concentration and air temperature which in turn consequence an upward trend in global land surface evapotranspiration e g miralles et al 2014 dong and dai 2017 pascolini campbell et al 2021 ma et al 2021 however how future climate change affects water body evaporation especially in urban areas remains unclear assessing the impact of future climate change on urban e is of great significance as it contributes to better urban landscape water planning under the background of a warming climate the isi mip dataset is used to construct future climate change scenarios as mentioned in section 2 5 2 for the forecasting of urban e during the period 2023 2100 two assumptions are adopted 1 it is assumed that the urban water surface area remains unchanged during the period 2023 2100 2 since future ahf data is not available it is assume that ahf keeps linearly increasing with air temperature as a result the future ahf is estimated based on the current ahf value as a baseline and predicted as a linear relationship with air temperature figs 13 and 14 shows the annual changes of δtau and δtas over two cities during 2023 2100 clearly both the δtau and δtas for the two cities maintain an upward trend under future climate scenarios specifically δtau significantly increases at a rate of 0 007 c year p 0 05 0 015 c year p 0 05 and 0 029 c year p 0 05 under the climate scenarios of rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively for tianjin as a comparison the increase rate of δtas is slightly lower than δtau evidenced by the δtas increase at a rate of 0 004 c year p 0 05 0 011 c year p 0 05 and 0 022 c year p 0 05 under the climate scenarios of rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively for tianjin a similar phenomenon also occurred in shenzhen where the δtau significantly increase at a rate of 0 008 c year p 0 05 0 017 c year p 0 05 and 0 031 c year p 0 05 under the climate scenarios of rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively however the rate of increasing reduces to 0 004 c year p 0 05 0 012 c year p 0 05 and 0 023 c year p 0 05 under the climate scenarios of rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively for δtas generally the rising rate of δtau and δtas under rcp 8 5 scenario is higher than that of rcp 4 5 and rcp 2 6 scenarios which can be explained by the higher co2 emissions scenarios lead to a faster temperature rise rate thus the consequence of higher e and δt values moreover the rising rate of δta in main urban areas is higher than in the suburbs for the two cities which is quite similar to the findings in section 3 3 overall the above results emphasize that the cooling performance of urban water surface evaporation will be further enhanced under the future climate change which will gain the capability of urban e to offset the uhi effect 4 discussion 4 1 model performance evaluation and algorithm merits accurate estimation of urban water evaporation is challenging due to the multiple heat flux sources and complex turbulent transport processes in urban areas to our knowledge this is the first customized model to simulate water body evaporation in urban areas the model validation results indicate that considering ahf in the penman formula significantly improves the simulation accuracy of eu and considering the water heat storage change in the penman formula significantly improves the simulation accuracy of deep water bodies ground validation of the ahf penman model over two megacities yielded an rmse of 21 1 w m2 and an r2 of 0 82 which exhibit comparable and slight better performance than most previous studies conducted in natural water bodies e g guan et al 2022 fuentes et al 2020 tian et al 2021 mcjannet et al 2012 zhao and gao 2019 zhao et al 2020 chernet 2001 linacre 1993 the relatively better performance of the ahf penman model could be attributed to the following aspects 1 the ahf penman model avoids complex calculation of aerodynamic impedance parameters in the classic penman formula the greatest uncertainty lies in the calculation of the aerodynamic impedance parameters as its determination involves a series of complex thermodynamic and momentum roughness variables the proposed ahf penman model solved this problem by adding a wind function term f u see eq 4 in the model architecture which significantly reduces model complexity and uncertainty 2 the ahf not only integrated into the modified penman formula to estimate e but also integrated into the parametric scheme of g therefore the ahf penman model achieves a seamless and in depth coupling of ahf and classic penman model which ensures the surface energy balance equation can be implemented in urban areas 3 the landsat thermal infrared observation significantly reduces uncertainty of wst retrieval unlike previous studies in e simulation that extensively use moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis thermal infrared observations to retrieve wst this study use landsat thermal infrared band to retrieve wst due to its higher spatial resolution in urban areas the validation with in situ wst suggest that the rmse for wst retrieval by landsat thermal infrared sensors range between 0 9 1 5 k and the bias range between 0 3 0 4 k over the two cities this accuracy for wst retrieval is significantly higher than other thermal infrared satellite observations the rmse range between 1 2 3 6 k for modis and 1 4 2 5 k for ecostress over the two cities the reliable wst retrieval improves the simulation accuracy of longwave upward radiation as well as rn thus enhancing e simulation 4 the ahf penman model consider the effect of humidity change above the water body at the downwind direction through the integration of a wind fetch length function eq 4 this ensures that the ahf penman model has the ability to capture the decrease of e at downwind direction which caused by the increased air humidity to learn the effectiveness of wind fetch length function to improve the performance of urban e simulation we compare the urban e simulation accuracy by ahf penman model with the integration of f u and without the integration of f u fig 15 shows the distribution of wind direction of all water bodies over the two cities and the distribution of rmse for urban e simulation under the two simulation scenarios as envisaged in fig 15 when the ahf penman model do not integrate f u the error of the urban e simulation slightly increased the average rmse increase 3 8 w m2 and 4 5 w m2 for e simulation in tianjin and shenzhen respectively compared with the ahf penman model with the integration of f u this is solid evidence of the importance of considering the wind direction on the simulation of water body evaporation 4 2 impact of urbanization on urban e to mitigate uhi effect the results in section 3 3 demonstrate that the increase in δt u s enhances the mitigation capacity of urban e to uhi effect to gain further insight about the increased δt u s is caused by urbanization or other factors we conducted a trend attribution analysis of δt u s fig 16 a shows the results of the trend attribution analysis of δt u s over the two cities overall the ta u s is the dominant factor that control the trend of δtu s followed by ra u s u u s and rh u s for tianjin the relative contribution of the four meteorological elements to δt u s trend are 80 5 11 4 5 6 and 2 5 for ta u s ra u s u u s and rh u s respectively for shenzhen the relative contribution of the four meteorological elements to δt u s trend are 84 2 9 7 3 8 and 2 3 for ta u s ra u s u u s and rh u s respectively therefore the increased ta u s is the leading cause for the rise of δt u s during the 1986 2015 over the two cities in other words the increased temperature difference between the main urban and suburbs area uhi effect or ta u s is the main factor leading to the enhanced ability of e to mitigate the uhi effect the correlation between urbanization process with δt u s and uhi effect is further analyzed here the urbanization process is characterized as fractional impervious surface coverage fi which is retrieved from the satellite imagery as envisaged in fig 16 b the r reach 0 90 and 0 93 for the correlations between δt u s and fi in tianjin and shenzhen respectively indicate the urbanization process can explain more than 90 δt u s trend moreover the r reach 0 89 and 0 91 for the correlations between ta u s and fi in tianjin and shenzhen respectively indicate the urbanization process can explain approximately 90 uhi effect trend this is a solid evidence that the rise in temperature difference between main urban and suburbs areas uhi effect or ta u s induced by urbanization is the main reason for the enhanced ability of urban e to mitigate uhi effect according to the above results the urbanization process can explain approximately 90 of the enhanced ability of e to mitigate the uhi effect therefore although urbanization has accelerated the uhi effect this intensified uhi effect also enhances the mitigation ability of urban e to uhi effect to a certain extent 4 3 primary uncertainties and ways forward several sources of uncertainty contribute to the simulation errors of urban e include extraction of water surface area model mechanism and assumptions simulation of heat storage changes and ahf and various input datasets the first uncertainty comes from extracting the urban water body area from satellite imagery in this study the otsu thresholding method is applied to extract the water surface area of the two cities as suggested by zhao and gao 2020 however previous studies have shown that although the ostu thresholding method significantly improves the accuracy of water surface area extraction it will cause significant errors when applied to long term water body area extraction zhao and gao 2020 in addition compared with water bodies in natural ecosystems the size of water bodies in urban ecosystems is relatively smaller and their distributions are relatively scattered the landsat visible light imagery with 30 m spatial resolution may ignore part of small water surfaces e g the width of the water body smaller than 30 m which leads to inevitable errors in the estimation of e and its cooling performance therefore the mitigation effect of water surface evaporation on the uhi effect may be underestimated in the present study due to part of very small water bodies cannot be well captured moreover the relatively lower spatial resolution of the satellite images also has uncertainty for the accurate extraction of water body edges which further brings errors to the model results to this end it is recommended that follow up research use high spatial resolution satellite images for urban water surface extraction e g the spatial resolution higher than 10 m the second uncertainty could be attributed to the model algorithm and the determination of empirical parameters 1 although the ahf penman model takes into account the contribution of ahf to the energy balance other energy and water sources from the water body are not considered for example the validation results in section 3 1 shows that the ahf penman model tends to underestimate e due to the contribution of the horizontal laminar flow to the energy balance is ignored moreover the contributions of respiration and photosynthesis of aquatic plants aquatic organisms and birds to energy balance are also not considered in the revised model framework more importantly to improve water quality part of landscape water bodies has water inflow and outflow consequent the water volume is dynamic rather than static this dynamic process of the water body is also not parameterized in the model architecture 2 the empirical parameters involved in the ahf penman algorithm are set to constants which bring uncertainty to e simulation for instance simply setting the air εa and water specific emissivity εw to be constant increases model uncertainty in fact εa varied in a smaller range under a clear sky and cloudy conditions and εw is varied with the temperature change of the water body choi et al 2008 finch and hall 2001 similar uncertainty also exists in the settings of a and b in ahfv determination and the setting of k in g determination to this end the accuracy of the ahf penman model can be further improved if these empirical parameters are given physics expressions while this practice may further increase the model complexity the third uncertainty lies in the determination of the ahf and the heat storage change of the water body this study uses the statistical downscaling method to determine ahf from buildings the ahf from motor vehicles and human respiration are determined based on their densities and volumes however whether these statistics data can truly reflect heat flux emissions from buildings vehicles and humans require further investigation besides uncertainty also exists in the weight determination and regression of six building types in ahfb estimation regarding the simulation of water body heat storage a fundamental assumption in the equilibrium temperature method is that the water temperature remains unchanged vertically bruin 1982 however this assumption may produce large errors when applied to water bodies with sizeable vertical temperature variation in this case the temperature profile method is a good alternative to determine g moreover the simplified of longwave upward l and downward longwave radiation l in r n parametric scheme refer to eqs 10 11 also generate inevitable errors to g estimates zhao and gao 2019 finally although the proposed g parameterization scheme for urban water bodies has a strong physics basis the model framework is relatively complex and requires numerous meteorological inputs to reduce the complexity of the model architecture and the requirements for numerous input variables a simplified empirical regression method that considers ahf is highly expected in the subsequent research the last uncertainty comes from the meteorological driven dataset and field observations of e the results in section 2 5 2 indicate that there are systematic errors in the terraclimate meteorological data set these errors associate with various meteorological factors will be accumulated into the final e estimates through error propagation besides the uncertainty involved in the breb based e measurements cannot be ignored during the model validation it is assuming that the footprints of latent heat flux observed by the breb system are all from the water body area this assumption is perfectly applicable for large water body areas but there may be large errors for small water body areas because part of the observed flux footprints come from surrounding vegetation and impervious areas rather than water body areas to this end the flux trace based on the flux footprint approach for breb observations provides an opportunity for model performance further improvement 5 conclusions this study proposes an ahf penman model for simulation of water body evaporation e in urban areas the ahf penman model considers the contribution of anthropogenic heat flux ahf to the energy balance equation the ahf also integrated into the equilibrium temperature method to enhance the water heat storage g simulation the performance of the proposed ahf penman is validated in two megacities in china the urban water body evaporation and its cooling effects in main urban δtau and suburbs areas δtas are further evaluated using the ahf penman model the responses of uhi effect to eu and es in these two areas is revealed the long term historical δtau and δtas changes are reconstructed and the impact of urbanization on δtau δtas and uhi effects are assessed finally the responses of δtau and δtas to future climate change are evaluated the main conclusions and findings of this study are summarized as follows 1 considering ahf significantly improves the simulation accuracy of urban e especially for the simulation of e in the main urban area where the sources and magnitude of ahf are larger than in the suburban area the average r2 across 42 urban water bodies increased by 0 10 and the average rmse and mapd values reduced by 16 1 w m2 and 4 8 respectively compared to the original penman model in urban e simulation moreover the consideration of g in the penman formula is more effective for enhancing the model performance of deep water bodies than shallow water bodies for the simulation of e in shallow water bodies the r2 only increases by 0 05 and rmse only decreased by 6 7 w m2 compared to the penman model that do not consider g 2 the δtau is larger than δtas over the two cities due to the higher temperatures in the main urban areas consequence the evaporative cooling effect of the water body in the main urban area is larger than that in the suburbs in addition increasing e in the main urban area helps to alleviate the uhi while increasing e in the suburbs exacerbates the uhi the mitigation of the uhi effect mainly benefits from e in the main urban area rather than e in the suburban area 3 both of δtau δtas and uhi shows an upward trend with rapid urbanization the relative contribution of the increase in air temperature and the increase in water evaporation to the uhi trend is 80 and 20 for tianjin 82 and 18 for shenzhen the upward trend of δtau is slightly higher than that of δtas indicating that the contribution of evaporation cooling to uhi effect mitigation is increased with urbanization further analysis suggest the urbanization process can explain approximately 90 of the enhanced ability of e to mitigate the uhi effect the relatively higher increase rate associated with δtau could be attributed to the combined effect of climate change and urbanization while the lower increase rate of δtas is explained as its changes are only controlled by climate change 4 the cooling effect of water surface evaporation is dominated by the volume and area of the water body rather than the depth of the water body the large amount of large area water bodies in the main urban area helps to mitigate the uhi effect in contrast the large amount of large area water bodies in the suburbs accelerates the uhi effect 5 both δtau and δtas will increase under the future climate change the increase rate of δtau is larger than δtas suggesting the mitigation performance of urban e to uhi effect will be further enhanced with future climate change credit authorship contribution statement han chen data curation

1731,effective strategies for operating gates and pumping stations can help urban river systems to better control flooding however the computing cost of optimizing urban river systems prevents their application to large scale problems we propose a new simplified approach to urban river system optimization that allows a portion of the river network to be simulated while the remainder is represented by a simplified model consisting of multiple surrogate models the surrogate model reflects changes at the boundaries of the region of interest at prediction points within the system to verify the accuracy of the simplified model a numerical model based on storm water management model swmm is established the accuracy of the numerical model the surrogate model and the simplified model were tested by multiple precipitation events the average simulation time has been reduced by 574 times demonstrating that the simplified model has effectively replaced the urban river network this method is used to optimize multi objective flood control in coastal cities by adjusting the opening and closing state of 28 gates and pumping stations the water level of 4 observation sections is controlled the results show that 60 of the flood volume and 84 of the flood duration of the observed section are reduced indicating that this method can better control the flooding process of the section compared with the numerical model the calculation time is reduced by 184 times indicating that the proposed method can solve the problem of long calculation time for urban river system optimization this approach will reduce the risk of flooding in cities keywords urban river systems flooding optimization simplification of models computational time data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction as the global warming and urbanization process accelerate extreme rainfall and changing rainfall patterns will lead to more urban flooding and adversely affect existing urban infrastructure balistrocchi and grossi 2020 rubinato et al 2019 as the outlet of the city s stormwater network rivers are an important part of the city s drainage system ma et al 2022 during heavy rainfall rainwater quickly collects into the river through the surface or underground pipe network and the river water level rises rapidly potentially blocking the outlet of the pipe network and causing flooding it is of great significance to reduce flood risk by using reservoirs gates and pumping stations in urban river systems urs to reasonably control the river water level process deng et al 2022 kong et al 2021 flood mitigation plans need to consider several often conflicting goals complicating gate operation strategies seyedashraf et al 2021 some previous studies have solved some optimization problems using meta heuristic optimization algorithms coupled with simulation tools such as the storm water management model swmm or mike flood el ghazouli et al 2022 meneses et al 2018 wang et al 2019 however traditional river level simulations are often based on hydrological and hydrodynamic methods requiring the solution of differential equations that describe the entire runoff generation sink and river flow kaya et al 2019 kim et al 2012 this method requires basic data such as complete river sections lengths and reservoir characteristic capacities paiva et al 2011 practically it faces issues such as a lack of data furthermore the application of numerical models for flood optimization results often requires tens of thousands of simulations and takes time this will lead to a non useable and non urgent optimization solution to solve these problems a wide variety of machine learning ml methods have been used to describe the relationship between rainfall and flooding demir and yaseen 2023 tao et al 2022 wee et al 2021 yves et al 2017 established a similar relationship between rainfall events and flood patterns in the lille drainage system in france through a non linear autoregressive model narx with exogenous inputs zhu et al 2020a use two ml models feedforward neural network ffnn and deep learning dl to predict the monthly water level of the lake the results show that the traditional ml model can meet the precision requirements of forecasting lake water levels after appropriate training zeynoddin et al 2020 applied the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems anfis multilayer perceptron mlp gene expression programming gep support vector machine with fire fly algorithm svm ffa and artificial neural network ann to construct a water level prediction model for lake urmia respectively the results show that predictive results that meet precision requirements can be achieved by providing accurate correlation information in time series kim et al 2021 evaluated the potential for data driven ml models dmls e g artificial neural networks ann long short term memory lstm to replace process based hydrologic models phms e g sacramento coupled soil moisture accounting sac sma xinanjiang xaj coupled routing and excess storage crest the results show that the dmls fed with delayed input scenarios have great potential and have high simulation accuracy the dmls especially the ann outperformed other employed models under the rainfall runoff relationship with dominant rainfall in the bushkill watershed which has many rivers ann s3 and lstm s3 achieved the best validation indicators in the calibration and verification sets thus ann and lstm are efficient in replacing hydrologic models in these studies forecasts of urban flooding at intervals of 1 to 5 min were relatively uncommon the characteristics of urban areas and the shift in precipitation and the effect of valves on downstream water levels are not fully considered allen dumas et al 2021 examined the application of ml techniques to the water cycle and discussed possible applications to address the challenges posed by the multiple dangers of water in urban areas ml methods are effective in rainwater management and flood forecasting sannasi chakravarthy et al 2022 and zhu et al 2020b compared the advantages and disadvantages of 7 typical ml algorithms and concluded that long short term memory lstm is more efficient at predicting lake water levels with small time data scales lstm is a special recurring neural networks rnns that can make good use of the temporal features of time series data by introducing gate functions into the cellular structure sherstinsky 2020 yu et al 2019 kratzert et al 2018 compared the lstm model with the sac sma hydrological model used the lstm to predict the production flow in each catchment and explored the possibility of replacing the hydrological model with the lstm the results show that lstm can identify certain complex production flow mechanisms in the catchment area based on historical data and has a high potential for application liu et al 2021 used lstm to construct a real time roll prediction method for short term water levels in urban inland and outer rivers the city of fuzhou china was selected as the study area to analyze the forecast performance of lstm the results confirm the feasibility of lstm for real time water level prediction the highest rmse of the five sections in the study area was 0 149 and the lowest nse was 0 757 these studies demonstrate the effectiveness of lstm in predicting urban flooding furthermore they revealed that bp neural networks typical of anns were effective for predicting river water levels allen dumas et al 2021 feng and wang 2021 consequently bp and lstm were chosen to build alternative models for this study currently the research on the composition of different ml models as a replacement for urs is relatively scarce large urban river systems often contain multiple parts such as reservoirs lakes and rivers making it difficult to represent the entire river system with a single surrogate model wang et al 2016 how to combine the benefits of different substitution models in a simplified high precision model is an important question furthermore in the optimization of the urs the complexity of model simplification increases considerably as input variables increase we need a method that can apply optimization algorithms to subzones of major urs without having to solve the network dynamics of the whole system this frequently occurs because different regions have different control goals and control objects to address these issues this paper proposes a simplified modeling method based on the alternative optimization of the large scale urs this method requires only one part of the system to be decomposed and optimized the simplified model is used for optimizing the operation of gates and pumping stations in the region of interest surrogate models are utilized to reflect system dynamics in the simplified model numerical models provide the boundary conditions to facilitate the model over time this approach was applied to the urs in fuzhou city china the precision of the numerical model the surrogate model and the simplified model is checked by multiple precipitation proving that the simplified model is effective in replacing urs in the multi objective optimization of flood control in coastal cities the proposed method can solve the problem of long optimization calculation time of urs and can better control the flow process of the flood 2 methodology the proposed simplified method allows simplifying the region of interest of the urban river system urs reflecting the internal dynamics of the system with surrogate models without the need to simulate or simplify the entire urs first define reservoirs gates and pumping stations as boundary points in the region of interest determine forecast points within the region of interest that must reflect the dynamics within the system both boundary and prediction points are represented as ordinary manholes without shape to describe the inflow of a river channel or reservoir then at each boundary point a hifi high fidelity model is used to obtain the flood inflow in the study area for a period in the future as the input boundary condition of the simplified model finally the planned point obtains a forecast of the future moment in relation to the input flow of the boundary point when applied to river system optimization in a region of interest the simplified model must be able to predict dynamic changes within the system using boundary point inputs to reflect the degree to which boundary conditions change to this end various surrogate models are formed to represent the inflow and water level change processes of many predicted points training data can be simulated by numerical models in various precipitation scenarios to obtain the input flow and the boundary head process boundary inflow is time series data provided by the hifi model after a complete simulation this indicates that simulation and optimization are performed only within the region of interest simplified and surrogate models are not identical because they address different issues first a simplified model consists of several surrogate models which are the actual implementation of a machine learning ml method second the simplified model completely replaces the hifi model in the region of interest and the surrogate model is only a replacement for a certain prediction point or a certain hydrological or hydrodynamic process it may be a production flow process or a sink flow process finally the input to the surrogate model may be boundary inflow or internal system traffic the input of the simplified model is the boundary inflow outside the system and the output is the water level outside the system generally the simplified model composed of multiple surrogate models is the core of the calculation time reduction in this study and the surrogate model is the basis and support for the implementation of the research method in this work swmm was used to simulate urs and the water balance model and ml models e g bp neural network model long short term memory lstm model were coupled as surrogate models to evaluate the prediction of dynamic changes within the system the ml models are constructed using keras 2 3 1 and tensorflow gpu 2 1 0 and gpu acceleration is used to perform formation and prediction functions java and jna drive the swmm implementation to run and read the boundary inflow time series to pass to the simplified model see text s1 in supporting information si for more details therefore the surrogate model provides the water level change process of the observing section of the system for the real time control method of each control point assessed by the optimization algorithm drainage simulations are then performed only for the remaining areas and the boundary conditions of the simulations represent the interaction between the region of interest and the rest of the drainage network fig 1 shows a flow chart for the proposed optimization methodology based on simplification the proposed methodology is applied to optimization issues in order to optimize the gates and pumps strategy of the current river system 2 1 numerical drainage models numerical modeling is a very popular means of reflecting the flow and change of urban rivers kim et al 2012 the storm water management model swmm has become the most widely used model in the research and application of urban drainage pipe network design urban stormwater process simulation urban water pollution simulation and urban low impact development lid simulation dell et al 2021 feng et al 2023 sun et al 2020 swmm can accurately describe the process of generating and confluence of urban rainstorms and can also add timing rules for gates and pumps to simulate the process of changing the urban water system rossman et al 2022 swmm provides steady flow kinematic wave and dynamic wave for simulating the confluence process of rivers the latter model was used in this study because it can simulate the pressurized flow and return effects by solving for the one dimensional saint venant equations 1 a t q x 0 2 q t q 2 a x g a h x g a s f h l 0 where t is time x is distance g is the acceleration due to gravity and h is the hydraulic head a is the flow cross sectional area function of h q is the flow through the section s f is the friction slope and h l represents local energy loss per unit length of the conduit 2 2 surrogate models for internal dynamics 2 2 1 water balance in the study area reservoirs lakes and other water storage facilities the water balance equation is used as a surrogate model to predict the future system dynamics the formula for the water balance of a linear reservoir or lake is as follows 3 v k 1 v k δ t q k in q k out 4 q k out i 1 n q k i where k is time v k represents the volume of the reservoir m3 q k in indicates the inflow rate of the reservoir m3 s q k out indicates the flow rate of reservoir outflow m3 s reservoirs usually have several gates and pumping stations that control the flow of floodwater in the rivers connected to them for reservoirs controlled by gates q k out is equal to the sum of the q k i of each subsystem and n represents the number of gates and pumping stations in this study the swmm recommendation formula was used to calculate the flow q k i rossman et al 2022 5 q k i c w l δ h 3 2 q p o r 0 where c w is the flow coefficient of the weir and the value recommended by swmm is 1 84 cubic meters per second cms l is the length of the weir m δ h is the head difference of upstream water passing through the weir m q p is the working flow of the pumping station or 0 if the pumping station is turned off in this study when the control object is the gate the decision variable is the gate opening jafari 2018 2020 has conducted extensive research and verification on the optimal opening interval of the gate and believes that it is optimal to discretize the gate height at 0 1 m intervals therefore in this study the decision variables were discretized at 0 1 m intervals according to the gate height for example if the height of the reservoir gate h is 4 m the corresponding decision variables are 0 0 1 0 2 4 0 pumping stations have only two decision states on and off when the optimization model is running the decision variable is the combination of strategies composed of all gates and pumping stations this means that the greater number of considerations the more decision variables are involved in the calculation 2 2 2 bp neural network bp the bp is a multi layer forward network model based on the error backpropagation algorithm it was first proposed in 1986 by a team led by rumelhart and mcclelland sun and xu 2016 it can simulate the information transmission mode of human brain neurons perform nonlinear transformations and regression processing on complex information variables and obtain highly fitting operation results just like the transfer of information between neurons in the brain after the input variables are input to the input layer a linear combination of input variables is obtained according to the initial set weights as the weights are continuously modified so that the linear combination value exceeds the threshold the information is transmitted to the output layer yang et al 2017 the structure of a bp includes an input layer a hider layer and an output layer see text s2 in supporting information si for more details a large number of studies have shown that 3 layer bp neural networks can complete any nonlinear mapping from n dimensional to m dimensional which usually meets the requirements sun and xu 2016 therefore a 3 layer bp network is selected for river flow prediction 2 2 3 long short term memory lstm lstm is a recurrent neural networks rnns suitable for processing time series data yu et al 2019 proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber in 1997 to deal with long term dependencies it has been widely used in hydrological time series data forecasting lstm differs from rnns in that a processor is added to the algorithm to determine whether the information flow is useful and prevent model perturbation that may be caused by useless data thereby solving the problem of training long sequences and recurrent neural network gradients yang et al 2021 therefore lstm can make better use of the time varying nature of time series data compared to other neural networks the lstm has three gates called an input gate forget gate and the output gate when information enters the lstm network it is judged whether it is useful according to the rules only information that meets the algorithm authentication will be retained and information that does not meet will be forgotten through the forgetting gate the calculation formula for lstm structure and element is detailed in the literature yu et al 2019 and text s3 in supporting information si 2 3 optimization a multi objective optimization problem consists of a set of minimized or maximized objective functions as follows yang et al 2017 yang et al 2015 6 minimize l ϕ f l f 1 f 2 f n 0 where f l is the objective function vector representing the performance of the system l is the decision variable vector n 0 is the target number and ϕ is the decision space usually the solution of the above equation must satisfy a set of constraints which can usually be written as 7 c eq j l 0 j 1 n q 8 c in k l 0 k 1 n r where c eq j l c in k l are the decision variables in the function and the n q and n r are the numbers of equality constraints and inequality constraints respectively multi objective evolutionary algorithm moea is used to solve the objective function moea is an advanced optimization algorithm based on genetic principles that relies on various search algorithms to provide higher reliability heydari mofrad and yazdi 2022 moea has proven to perform well on multi objective optimization problems in urban drainage and sewer system design eckart et al 2018 wang et al 2018 yazdi et al 2017 the moea algorithm used in this study was developed and validated by the team of authors 3 application of the proposed approach 3 1 case study fuzhou is a famous historical and cultural city the capital of fujian province located on the southeast coast of china it is between 118 08 120 31 e and 25 15 26 29 n fuzhou is heavily affected by the typhoon each year and the mean number of direct typhoons per year is 2 typhoons bring strong rains in the short term causing flooding in mountainous and urban areas the types of flooding affecting the city of fuzhou primarily include heavy rainfall intensity distribution and typhoon furthermore tides can block river outflows causing urban flooding fuzhou is surrounded by mountains on three sides and the sea on the other and the town has a single river which drains the flood waters of the mountains as shown in fig 2 an urban hydrographic network of 78 38 km2 is in the fuzhou urban region the major problem is that urban fluvial networks regulate flooding in mountainous and urban areas heavy rains in the upper mountains lead to flooding as the inflow boundary and the level of minjiang river as an outlet point the study area has 5 large reservoirs 34 gates and pumping stations to regulate the flow through the nodes of these 28 are in good condition that can be used as decision variables to optimize the model each reservoir has several gates but only one is marked on the map see text s4 in supporting information si for more details using to the method of fig 1 the reservoir gate and pumping station are delineated and the orange area shown in the figure is divided as the region of interest the input flow at the boundary uses a numerical model to obtain flood inflow over a future period as the input boundary for the simplified model in this area four river cross sections need to be predicted namely p1 p2 p3 and p4 p1 and p2 are the water levels at the corresponding river fork points upstream of the gate which are used to calculate the flow rate through the gate p3 predicts the flow of lakes from multiple rivers and is used to calculate the water level in section 3 p4 predicts the water level in the lower reaches of the river and is used to calculate the flow through the gates and observe the flooding process to evaluate the accuracy of the model four control sections were selected namely section 1 section 2 section 3 and section 4 these four prediction points are critical for the study area there are two major research challenges in the field of study first the description of section 3 input hydraulic model is highly difficult and time consuming because it is formed by the confluence of several rivers as indicated in fig 2 there are five rivers upstreams second it is highly difficult and cumbersome to forecast water levels under section 4 because there are several upstream entry limits and several downstream water level limits as shown in fig 2 section 4 has 10 inflow boundaries and 3 water level boundaries therefore changing sections 3 and 4 to ml methods can maximize model accuracy and reduce computation time therefore p3 and p4 were selected as prediction points furthermore if a water balance model is built in section 2 it is determined by flow through g3 g5 g4 see text s5 in supporting information si for more details with g3 as an example the flow rate is calculated using equation 5 and upstream and downstream water levels should be known to calculate δ h the downstream water level of g3 is section 2 s water level and the upstream water level is p1 s water level when the upstream water level is greater than the downstream water level δ h is only related to the upstream water level in the g3 opening adjustment process the flow across door changes in the optimization model the flow rate of the jiefangxi river also changes making it difficult to find the p1 s water level using the existing formula therefore a surrogate model is necessary to predict the water level at p1 to more accurately determine the flow rate by g3 3 2 optimize the operation of urban river systems the proposed simplified method has been applied to the multi objective optimization of the urban river system urs the optimization object is the urs s flood and the decision variable is the opening statement of the corresponding gates and pumping stations there are two optimization goals in this case study namely minimizing flood volume and minimizing the average flood duration among them the smallest volume of flooding is the highest priority therefore the objective function of this study is 9 minimize f f floodv f floodd where f is the objective function in the case f floodv represents the flood volume of the system and f floodd represents the average flood duration of the observed section the system flood volume is calculated as follows 10 f floodv i 1 n f v i 11 f v i i 1 m m a x v i v w a r n h j h warn 0 h j h warn i 0 m the average duration of a flood is calculated as follows 12 f floodd i 1 n f d i n 13 f d i i 1 m δ t h j h warn 0 h j h warn where n is the number of observations m is total number of simulated periods the f v i is the flood volume of the observation section and the f d i is the flood duration of the observation section in this study flooding is considered to have occurred if the water level exceeds the warning level of the observation section h j is the water level the h warn is the warning level of the observation sections and vwarn is the volume of the reservior corresponding to the warning value q is the average flow rate of the observed section and δ t is the simulation interval time constraints 1 there are maximum and minimum values for the gate opening elevation 2 the pumping station status is only on or off 4 application of the proposed approach 4 1 analysis of numerical model accuracy in this study to evaluate the accuracy of different types of models the root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and correlation coefficient r are introduced to evaluate the performance of the model krause et al 2005 liu et al 2021 the calculation method is as follows 14 rmse i 1 n γ i obs γ i sim 2 n rmse is used to measure the deviation between the observed

the nse is close to 1 it means that the model quality is good and the model is reliable if the nse is close to 0 it means that the simulation result is close to the average of the observations the overall result is reliable but the process simulation error is large if the nse is well below 0 the model cannot be trusted 16 r cov γ i sim γ i obs var γ i sim var γ i obs the r value is between 0 and 1 and the r value is 1 to indicate a complete correlation where i is the current simulation time and n is the total number of simulations γ i obs is the observed value γ obs mean is the average of observations γ i sim is the simulated value and γ sim mean is the average of a simulated value cov and var represent the covariance and variance of the data respectively in the numerical model construction the hifi high fidelity model of urban river hydrology and hydrology is constructed based on swmm 5 1 from june 6 to 16 2022 a total of 10 days of rainfall were selected to verify the accuracy of the numerical model the position of the monitoring section is shown in fig 2 and the comparison between the monitored water level and the simulated water level is shown in fig 3 rmse nse and r were used to calculate the error between the cross sectional simulated value and the observed value respectively the results of the simulation error calculation are shown in table 1 from fig 3 and table 1 the rmse of the selected four sections is less than 0 1 nse is greater than 0 8 and r is greater than 0 9 during rainfall it can well reflect the process of rising and receding indicating that the swmm simulation model can better reflect the runoff formation of urban rainfall and the law of river water level change 4 2 analysis of surrogate model inputs before constructing the surrogate model the input and output variables of the surrogate model are analyzed successively in this study the correlation analysis of prediction points and boundary points was carried out using the correlation coefficient r and the results are shown in fig 4 the input variables are all flow sequences p1 and p2 are input for the associated 3 gate flows the input of the p3 is 6 gate flows upstream and 3 downstream flows which indicates that the p3 is affected by both upstream and downstream boundaries upstream inflows are due to poor elevation while downstream influences may be due to river levels the jin anhe river the main river in the study area has to little change in the elevation of the river bottom and the phenomenon of water level topping p3 often occurs the p4 is only affected by the flow of gates associated with the main river and has little correlation with the upstream boundary input the lake where p3 is located has a very large reservoir capacity which to some extent blocks the upstream and downstream hydraulic connection the study is split into two parts upstream the reservoir area and downstream the fluvial area in this case there will be some problems with building a complete surrogate model for example upstream boundary changes are difficult to quickly reflect at downstream prediction points because the existence of p3 leads to a weak correlation between upstream boundary points and p4 at the same time the full modeling will consider 11 inputs which will make the model network more complex resulting in more training and prediction time to better reflect the dynamics of each part of the system we adopt the method of block modeling and sub point prediction that is a surrogate model is built at each prediction point and eventually all the surrogate models are combined into a simplified model to replace the complete river system another detail that cannot be overlooked is that we predicted the water level in p4 in the input variable g10 is the total flow rate of gates and pumping stations calculated by equation 5 however the formula needs to know the upstream and downstream water levels the upstream guangminggang river is the largest in the city fig 3 section 4 shows that the water level changes very little at this point over a period of 10 days the maximum water level variation does not exceed 0 1 m therefore we assume that the water level at the end of time t 1 is equal to the initial water level at time t consequently the upstream water level of the g10 is determined the water level downstream is the level of the tide and was observed as explained earlier flow units are used when calculating the correlation between prediction points and boundary points but for the gate the opening can be faster and more intuitive to reflect the change of the gate therefore the p1 and p2 points with the best correlation are selected in fig 4 and the boundary conditions are changed to the g3 g4 and g5 gate opening processes the results of the new correlation are shown in table 2 table 2 shows a worse correlation than fig 4 but practically speaking the p1 point is at the boundary and is strongly correlated with the surrounding three gates see text s5 in supporting information si for more details therefore we believe that the flow process at the boundary can better reflect the process of predicting the point and can be used as an input to the surrogate model the last input and output variables of the ml model for this study are summarized in table 3 another consideration is the impact of different simulation time steps on prediction accuracy for urban river systems simulated time steps can reflect the process of water level changes if the time interval is too long the water level change process of some sections will be ignored resulting in the water level prediction becoming meaningless if the interval is too small it will increase the training effort of the surrogate model two surrogate models with stochastic initialization were used to analyze different prediction intervals and the results are shown in table 4 for the bp model nse has performed poorly at a time the interval of 5 min the rmse result was good with a minimum value of 0 051 and a data correlation coefficient of 0 952 the lstm results performed well in all three indicators of which 20 min was the best result in cities people generally want to be able to monitor the water level change process in a timelier manner to prevent overflow events therefore we choose a 5 min as the time interval for surrogate model training and prediction moreover the prediction results of the ml model in this article are continuous to avoid the accumulation of errors due to individual generation at one instant we generate all the water level sequences over the projection period 4 3 analysis of surrogate model accuracy in this study to better analyze the error distribution of the ml models the average error μ and the standard deviation of the error σ are introduced and the calculation formula is detailed in the following formula krause et al 2005 the character on the right side of the equal sign of the formula has the same meaning as the formula 14 17 μ 1 n i 1 n γ i sim γ i obs 2 18 σ 1 n i 1 n γ i sim γ i obs 2 ml models were applied to perform predictive analysis of the prediction points in the study area and the results are shown in table 5 the bp neural network applied to p1 and p2 points achieved a good prediction effect the application of lstm in p3 and p4 points has achieved good results this may be because p1 and p2 are located upstream of the study area near the boundary with 3 input variables and there is a very small time interval between input and output variables p3 and p4 were in the middle and lower reaches of the study area with 5 and 6 input variables the number of input variables is higher and the neural network structure is more complex it takes about 0 5 3 h from the start of rainfall to reach the predicted position from the flood and there is a certain degree of time lag due to the special gate structure lstm can retain or filter time related information and make fuller use of time series related information fig 5 compares the prediction results obtained by the method selected for the four positions with the swmm simulation results here the blue dots represent the ml model prediction results while the continuous black lines represent the swmm simulation results this figure shows that the correlation coefficient r of the simplified model prediction results is greater than 0 99 indicating that the predicted results are consistent with the swmm simulation results the distribution of error in the prediction results at different locations is shown in fig 6 where the height of each bar represents the number of predictions with similar errors in this case the closer the mean of the distribution is to 0 the better the average performance as can be seen from fig 6 most of the errors of the four prediction points are around 0 indicating that the selected prediction method has very good accuracy from the different prediction results of the four prediction points the predicted values of p1 p2 and p4 are all water levels but the figure shows that the average error distribution of p4 is 0 005 0 005 and the accuracy is significantly better than that of the bp results at p1 and p2 points this shows that lstm has very good accuracy in predicting water levels p3 predicts the total inflow rate and combined with the results in table 5 it can still be considered that lstm also has good accuracy in predicting node input flow fig 7 compares the p3 and p4 point bp and lstm predictions with swmm simulations for four different recurrence periods designed under rainfall in each case study as can be seen from the figure both surrogate models can estimate the time series of predicted values well but the predicted results of the lstm model are more accurate than the bp results meanwhile the magnitude of rainfall intensity has a great influence on the predicted results of the ml model when the rainfall return period is 5a the peak result of bp prediction is significantly larger than the swmm simulation value in the other reproduction periods 10a 20a and 50a the peak results predicted by bp result gradually approached the swmm analog values the lstm prediction peak is significantly better than bp when the swmm simulation value is small rainfall intensity the simulation results are unstable and show a large fluctuation trend however it gradually stabilized as the rainfall re emergence period increased this may be due to light rainfall which undergoes a phase of slow flooding accompanied by the influence of many reservoirs and lakes in the study area resulting in unstable simulation results these may be important reasons for the inaccurate prediction results of the bp neural network model during low intensity rainfall due to the special gate structure lstm selectively enters and forgets some information retains the most important rainfall information and adjusts the final forecast results in combination with a certain time interval therefore it is feasible to use bp and lstm models as surrogate models to reflect the internal dynamics of the system table 6 shows that compared to lstm the bp model is slower to train but faster to predict therefore the bp model was selected at p1 and p2 while the lstm model with better prediction accuracy was selected as the surrogate model at p3 and p4 to further validate the precision of the surrogate model this study was complemented by 16 heavy rain tests see text s6 in supporting information si for more details the above trained ml model is used as a virtual river channel to connect with the reservoir in the study area and the river channel relates to a sluice and pump to form a simplified model of the research area the resulting simplified model structure for region of interest substitution is shown in fig 8 table 7 calculates the comparison of the simplified model calculation results and the swmm simulation results under different rainfall recurrence periods the results show that the four sections have high accuracy under different rainfall intensities the average value of nse is greater than 0 8 and the average value of rmse is less than 0 6 indicating that the simplified model can well reflect the water level change results of each section taking the rainfall recurring period of 10a as an example fig 9 shows the comparison between the simplified model of four sections and the swmm simulation results during rainfall the simplified model can well reflect the rising and falling flow of water and the trend is consistent with the swmm results figs 5 and 6 present a few outliers from the predictive model that may have an impact on the prediction results this is because the training data includes events with less rainfall intensity as shown in fig 7 when the precipitation recurrence period is short there is a significant difference between the predictions and the simulation results to avoid this problem when using the ml model we chose a scene with a relatively heavy rain intensity meanwhile we believe that the results in fig 5 6 and table 5 show that the ml models are stable reliable and have low error depending on the existing indicators the accuracy of these alternate and simplified models also meets the minimum requirements fig 6 7 table 7 it is quite possible and efficient to change the hifi model to the region of interest s simplified model 4 4 analysis of flood control effect the simplified model is used to calculate the optimal control strategy of the gate and the flood control effect of the urban river system urs table 6 compares the calculation time of the simplified model and the swmm when simulating and solving optimization problems the simulations were run on a laboratory desktop computer asus with processor intel core i7 11700kf cpu 3 6 ghz and nvidia geforce gtx3080 10g gpu table 6 shows that when the simplified model is used for simulation the calculation time is only 262 ms which is about 1 574 of the swmm calculation time when used to optimize and solve the extreme values of the objective function the time taken to simplify the model is 53609 ms which is about 1 184 of the swmm optimization time it shows that the simplified model has a great computational advantage in both simulated values and optimization solving it should be noted that the test uses a population size is 100 the maximum iterative times is 500 generations and the maximum stable stop times is 100 generations the population single point crossing probability is 0 2 and the mutation probability is 0 3 table 8 and fig 10 show the comparison of the optimization model composed of the simplified model with the existing gate and pump station rule based control rbc model as can be seen from the plot the highest flood level controlled using the optimization model has decreased significantly of the 4 sections 3 were below the warning level and 1 was below the maximum level optimized model control reduced section 1 flood duration from 3 h to 1 2 h reducing the flood duration by about 60 the flood volume was reduced from 48613 9 m3 to 7577 2 m3 a reduction of 84 for section 3 the most important lake in the city the maximum water level was reduced by 1 06 m from 7 75 m to 6 69 m the duration and volume of floods have also been reduced to varying degrees section 4 directly avoids unsafe flooding and water levels above warning these show that the optimization model has a significantly better effect on flood control than rbc control from the perspective of a cross sectional water level process compared with rbc the optimization model has a better effect on controlling the water level section 1 and section 3 took significant water level drop measures before the peak flood flow providing more usable reservoir capacity for the incoming flood so that the maximum water level was in a safe state after the rainfall ends the water level drops below normal levels if there is rainfall behind it can provide more abundant usable storage capacity for subsequent floods however if there is no rainfall the daily water level will be low and the water source will need to be replenished to reach the landscape water level section 2 did not lower the water level before the rains began and were above normal after the rains ended this study aims to optimize all outcomes compared to the lake in section 2 the lake in section 3 has a greater capacity and a greater risk of flooding while the water level in section 2 exceeds the warning value the risk of flooding is low see text s7 in supporting information si for more details section 2 needs to regulate flood peaks in two adjacent rivers simultaneously and avoid increasing downstream section 3 flood risk before the peak of the flood the overall operation is conservative which is manifested in the slow rise of the water level because the limited storage capacity should be reserved for the most important peak flood flow after the rainfall it maintained its water level at 12 38 m for 17 h which was 0 86 m higher than the rbc s level this stores an additional 63 000 m3 of floodwater on the one hand the maximum peak flow of downstream section 3 can be reduced and on the other hand the discharge of floodwater in the direction of section 1 can be staggered this minimizes the maximum water level of section 3 to some extent it is precisely because the maximum water level of section 3 is lowered so that the discharge flow is reduced so that the maximum water level of section 4 does not exceed the warning value the rbc on its characteristics does not fully consider the downstream flood control safety and other river flow superposition problems resulting in a certain risk of the lake and river overflow the optimization results have a very good effect on flood control and rational distribution 5 conclusions this paper proposes a simplified modeling method based on alternative large scale urban river system urs optimization this method is suitable for problems that require the control of reservoirs gates and pumping stations in urs by decomposing the region of interest and using boundary points to represent the rest of the system the computational cost of simulating the dynamics of the entire system can be significantly reduced define the dynamic prediction points within the system and use the boundary input to make predictions to reflect the flood evolution process and the control effect of gates and pumping stations the region of interest consists of 3 models representing reservoirs and rivers they are the water balance model the bp neural network bp model and the long short term memory lstm model the predicted time of the bp model is very short and the prediction results are good for points with few input variables and in sensitive time due to the special gate structure lstm can selectively retain time related inputs and outputs which has a very good prediction effect on the water level in the lower reaches of the river therefore p1 and p2 chose the bp model to predict boundary head changes p3 and p4 choose lstm to predict the internal dynamics of the system the simplified model consisting of 7 surrogate models was validated with very high accuracy and less simulation time reducing the single simulation time by a factor of 574 compared to the numerical model this method is applied to coastal urban flood control problems including two optimization goals the control object was 4 water level observation sections in the study area and the decision variable was the opening state of 28 gates and pumping stations by adjusting the decision variables the flow through the sections are controlled in order to achieve the goal of controlling the target water level in this case study the optimization model built based on the simplified model can effectively control the flood flow process and the flood volume and flood duration of the three observation sections is reduced reducing the flood duration and 84 of the flood volume by up to 60 compared with the numerical model the calculation time is reduced by 184 times indicating that the simplified model constructed by the proposed method has a very good computational efficiency through this study it is proved that the simplified model has an alternative role in the optimization of the urs when using numerical models to simulate and optimize a region of interest facing time barriers building a simplified model using this method can greatly improve the calculation time this method can be widely used in urban drainage water resources distribution and real time control of urban gates and pumping stations composed of water conservancy engineering groups the model construction and optimization method like the one proposed in this work is used to reflect the internal flow rate and head changes in the region of interest however for the selection of specific surrogate models it is necessary to combine the actual situation and seek truth from facts to choose because the surrogate model used in this study has been well studied and validated future work is to divide urs into more areas of interest using simplified models combined with model predictive control methods to achieve real time operation of the entire urban river system credit

1731,effective strategies for operating gates and pumping stations can help urban river systems to better control flooding however the computing cost of optimizing urban river systems prevents their application to large scale problems we propose a new simplified approach to urban river system optimization that allows a portion of the river network to be simulated while the remainder is represented by a simplified model consisting of multiple surrogate models the surrogate model reflects changes at the boundaries of the region of interest at prediction points within the system to verify the accuracy of the simplified model a numerical model based on storm water management model swmm is established the accuracy of the numerical model the surrogate model and the simplified model were tested by multiple precipitation events the average simulation time has been reduced by 574 times demonstrating that the simplified model has effectively replaced the urban river network this method is used to optimize multi objective flood control in coastal cities by adjusting the opening and closing state of 28 gates and pumping stations the water level of 4 observation sections is controlled the results show that 60 of the flood volume and 84 of the flood duration of the observed section are reduced indicating that this method can better control the flooding process of the section compared with the numerical model the calculation time is reduced by 184 times indicating that the proposed method can solve the problem of long calculation time for urban river system optimization this approach will reduce the risk of flooding in cities keywords urban river systems flooding optimization simplification of models computational time data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction as the global warming and urbanization process accelerate extreme rainfall and changing rainfall patterns will lead to more urban flooding and adversely affect existing urban infrastructure balistrocchi and grossi 2020 rubinato et al 2019 as the outlet of the city s stormwater network rivers are an important part of the city s drainage system ma et al 2022 during heavy rainfall rainwater quickly collects into the river through the surface or underground pipe network and the river water level rises rapidly potentially blocking the outlet of the pipe network and causing flooding it is of great significance to reduce flood risk by using reservoirs gates and pumping stations in urban river systems urs to reasonably control the river water level process deng et al 2022 kong et al 2021 flood mitigation plans need to consider several often conflicting goals complicating gate operation strategies seyedashraf et al 2021 some previous studies have solved some optimization problems using meta heuristic optimization algorithms coupled with simulation tools such as the storm water management model swmm or mike flood el ghazouli et al 2022 meneses et al 2018 wang et al 2019 however traditional river level simulations are often based on hydrological and hydrodynamic methods requiring the solution of differential equations that describe the entire runoff generation sink and river flow kaya et al 2019 kim et al 2012 this method requires basic data such as complete river sections lengths and reservoir characteristic capacities paiva et al 2011 practically it faces issues such as a lack of data furthermore the application of numerical models for flood optimization results often requires tens of thousands of simulations and takes time this will lead to a non useable and non urgent optimization solution to solve these problems a wide variety of machine learning ml methods have been used to describe the relationship between rainfall and flooding demir and yaseen 2023 tao et al 2022 wee et al 2021 yves et al 2017 established a similar relationship between rainfall events and flood patterns in the lille drainage system in france through a non linear autoregressive model narx with exogenous inputs zhu et al 2020a use two ml models feedforward neural network ffnn and deep learning dl to predict the monthly water level of the lake the results show that the traditional ml model can meet the precision requirements of forecasting lake water levels after appropriate training zeynoddin et al 2020 applied the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems anfis multilayer perceptron mlp gene expression programming gep support vector machine with fire fly algorithm svm ffa and artificial neural network ann to construct a water level prediction model for lake urmia respectively the results show that predictive results that meet precision requirements can be achieved by providing accurate correlation information in time series kim et al 2021 evaluated the potential for data driven ml models dmls e g artificial neural networks ann long short term memory lstm to replace process based hydrologic models phms e g sacramento coupled soil moisture accounting sac sma xinanjiang xaj coupled routing and excess storage crest the results show that the dmls fed with delayed input scenarios have great potential and have high simulation accuracy the dmls especially the ann outperformed other employed models under the rainfall runoff relationship with dominant rainfall in the bushkill watershed which has many rivers ann s3 and lstm s3 achieved the best validation indicators in the calibration and verification sets thus ann and lstm are efficient in replacing hydrologic models in these studies forecasts of urban flooding at intervals of 1 to 5 min were relatively uncommon the characteristics of urban areas and the shift in precipitation and the effect of valves on downstream water levels are not fully considered allen dumas et al 2021 examined the application of ml techniques to the water cycle and discussed possible applications to address the challenges posed by the multiple dangers of water in urban areas ml methods are effective in rainwater management and flood forecasting sannasi chakravarthy et al 2022 and zhu et al 2020b compared the advantages and disadvantages of 7 typical ml algorithms and concluded that long short term memory lstm is more efficient at predicting lake water levels with small time data scales lstm is a special recurring neural networks rnns that can make good use of the temporal features of time series data by introducing gate functions into the cellular structure sherstinsky 2020 yu et al 2019 kratzert et al 2018 compared the lstm model with the sac sma hydrological model used the lstm to predict the production flow in each catchment and explored the possibility of replacing the hydrological model with the lstm the results show that lstm can identify certain complex production flow mechanisms in the catchment area based on historical data and has a high potential for application liu et al 2021 used lstm to construct a real time roll prediction method for short term water levels in urban inland and outer rivers the city of fuzhou china was selected as the study area to analyze the forecast performance of lstm the results confirm the feasibility of lstm for real time water level prediction the highest rmse of the five sections in the study area was 0 149 and the lowest nse was 0 757 these studies demonstrate the effectiveness of lstm in predicting urban flooding furthermore they revealed that bp neural networks typical of anns were effective for predicting river water levels allen dumas et al 2021 feng and wang 2021 consequently bp and lstm were chosen to build alternative models for this study currently the research on the composition of different ml models as a replacement for urs is relatively scarce large urban river systems often contain multiple parts such as reservoirs lakes and rivers making it difficult to represent the entire river system with a single surrogate model wang et al 2016 how to combine the benefits of different substitution models in a simplified high precision model is an important question furthermore in the optimization of the urs the complexity of model simplification increases considerably as input variables increase we need a method that can apply optimization algorithms to subzones of major urs without having to solve the network dynamics of the whole system this frequently occurs because different regions have different control goals and control objects to address these issues this paper proposes a simplified modeling method based on the alternative optimization of the large scale urs this method requires only one part of the system to be decomposed and optimized the simplified model is used for optimizing the operation of gates and pumping stations in the region of interest surrogate models are utilized to reflect system dynamics in the simplified model numerical models provide the boundary conditions to facilitate the model over time this approach was applied to the urs in fuzhou city china the precision of the numerical model the surrogate model and the simplified model is checked by multiple precipitation proving that the simplified model is effective in replacing urs in the multi objective optimization of flood control in coastal cities the proposed method can solve the problem of long optimization calculation time of urs and can better control the flow process of the flood 2 methodology the proposed simplified method allows simplifying the region of interest of the urban river system urs reflecting the internal dynamics of the system with surrogate models without the need to simulate or simplify the entire urs first define reservoirs gates and pumping stations as boundary points in the region of interest determine forecast points within the region of interest that must reflect the dynamics within the system both boundary and prediction points are represented as ordinary manholes without shape to describe the inflow of a river channel or reservoir then at each boundary point a hifi high fidelity model is used to obtain the flood inflow in the study area for a period in the future as the input boundary condition of the simplified model finally the planned point obtains a forecast of the future moment in relation to the input flow of the boundary point when applied to river system optimization in a region of interest the simplified model must be able to predict dynamic changes within the system using boundary point inputs to reflect the degree to which boundary conditions change to this end various surrogate models are formed to represent the inflow and water level change processes of many predicted points training data can be simulated by numerical models in various precipitation scenarios to obtain the input flow and the boundary head process boundary inflow is time series data provided by the hifi model after a complete simulation this indicates that simulation and optimization are performed only within the region of interest simplified and surrogate models are not identical because they address different issues first a simplified model consists of several surrogate models which are the actual implementation of a machine learning ml method second the simplified model completely replaces the hifi model in the region of interest and the surrogate model is only a replacement for a certain prediction point or a certain hydrological or hydrodynamic process it may be a production flow process or a sink flow process finally the input to the surrogate model may be boundary inflow or internal system traffic the input of the simplified model is the boundary inflow outside the system and the output is the water level outside the system generally the simplified model composed of multiple surrogate models is the core of the calculation time reduction in this study and the surrogate model is the basis and support for the implementation of the research method in this work swmm was used to simulate urs and the water balance model and ml models e g bp neural network model long short term memory lstm model were coupled as surrogate models to evaluate the prediction of dynamic changes within the system the ml models are constructed using keras 2 3 1 and tensorflow gpu 2 1 0 and gpu acceleration is used to perform formation and prediction functions java and jna drive the swmm implementation to run and read the boundary inflow time series to pass to the simplified model see text s1 in supporting information si for more details therefore the surrogate model provides the water level change process of the observing section of the system for the real time control method of each control point assessed by the optimization algorithm drainage simulations are then performed only for the remaining areas and the boundary conditions of the simulations represent the interaction between the region of interest and the rest of the drainage network fig 1 shows a flow chart for the proposed optimization methodology based on simplification the proposed methodology is applied to optimization issues in order to optimize the gates and pumps strategy of the current river system 2 1 numerical drainage models numerical modeling is a very popular means of reflecting the flow and change of urban rivers kim et al 2012 the storm water management model swmm has become the most widely used model in the research and application of urban drainage pipe network design urban stormwater process simulation urban water pollution simulation and urban low impact development lid simulation dell et al 2021 feng et al 2023 sun et al 2020 swmm can accurately describe the process of generating and confluence of urban rainstorms and can also add timing rules for gates and pumps to simulate the process of changing the urban water system rossman et al 2022 swmm provides steady flow kinematic wave and dynamic wave for simulating the confluence process of rivers the latter model was used in this study because it can simulate the pressurized flow and return effects by solving for the one dimensional saint venant equations 1 a t q x 0 2 q t q 2 a x g a h x g a s f h l 0 where t is time x is distance g is the acceleration due to gravity and h is the hydraulic head a is the flow cross sectional area function of h q is the flow through the section s f is the friction slope and h l represents local energy loss per unit length of the conduit 2 2 surrogate models for internal dynamics 2 2 1 water balance in the study area reservoirs lakes and other water storage facilities the water balance equation is used as a surrogate model to predict the future system dynamics the formula for the water balance of a linear reservoir or lake is as follows 3 v k 1 v k δ t q k in q k out 4 q k out i 1 n q k i where k is time v k represents the volume of the reservoir m3 q k in indicates the inflow rate of the reservoir m3 s q k out indicates the flow rate of reservoir outflow m3 s reservoirs usually have several gates and pumping stations that control the flow of floodwater in the rivers connected to them for reservoirs controlled by gates q k out is equal to the sum of the q k i of each subsystem and n represents the number of gates and pumping stations in this study the swmm recommendation formula was used to calculate the flow q k i rossman et al 2022 5 q k i c w l δ h 3 2 q p o r 0 where c w is the flow coefficient of the weir and the value recommended by swmm is 1 84 cubic meters per second cms l is the length of the weir m δ h is the head difference of upstream water passing through the weir m q p is the working flow of the pumping station or 0 if the pumping station is turned off in this study when the control object is the gate the decision variable is the gate opening jafari 2018 2020 has conducted extensive research and verification on the optimal opening interval of the gate and believes that it is optimal to discretize the gate height at 0 1 m intervals therefore in this study the decision variables were discretized at 0 1 m intervals according to the gate height for example if the height of the reservoir gate h is 4 m the corresponding decision variables are 0 0 1 0 2 4 0 pumping stations have only two decision states on and off when the optimization model is running the decision variable is the combination of strategies composed of all gates and pumping stations this means that the greater number of considerations the more decision variables are involved in the calculation 2 2 2 bp neural network bp the bp is a multi layer forward network model based on the error backpropagation algorithm it was first proposed in 1986 by a team led by rumelhart and mcclelland sun and xu 2016 it can simulate the information transmission mode of human brain neurons perform nonlinear transformations and regression processing on complex information variables and obtain highly fitting operation results just like the transfer of information between neurons in the brain after the input variables are input to the input layer a linear combination of input variables is obtained according to the initial set weights as the weights are continuously modified so that the linear combination value exceeds the threshold the information is transmitted to the output layer yang et al 2017 the structure of a bp includes an input layer a hider layer and an output layer see text s2 in supporting information si for more details a large number of studies have shown that 3 layer bp neural networks can complete any nonlinear mapping from n dimensional to m dimensional which usually meets the requirements sun and xu 2016 therefore a 3 layer bp network is selected for river flow prediction 2 2 3 long short term memory lstm lstm is a recurrent neural networks rnns suitable for processing time series data yu et al 2019 proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber in 1997 to deal with long term dependencies it has been widely used in hydrological time series data forecasting lstm differs from rnns in that a processor is added to the algorithm to determine whether the information flow is useful and prevent model perturbation that may be caused by useless data thereby solving the problem of training long sequences and recurrent neural network gradients yang et al 2021 therefore lstm can make better use of the time varying nature of time series data compared to other neural networks the lstm has three gates called an input gate forget gate and the output gate when information enters the lstm network it is judged whether it is useful according to the rules only information that meets the algorithm authentication will be retained and information that does not meet will be forgotten through the forgetting gate the calculation formula for lstm structure and element is detailed in the literature yu et al 2019 and text s3 in supporting information si 2 3 optimization a multi objective optimization problem consists of a set of minimized or maximized objective functions as follows yang et al 2017 yang et al 2015 6 minimize l ϕ f l f 1 f 2 f n 0 where f l is the objective function vector representing the performance of the system l is the decision variable vector n 0 is the target number and ϕ is the decision space usually the solution of the above equation must satisfy a set of constraints which can usually be written as 7 c eq j l 0 j 1 n q 8 c in k l 0 k 1 n r where c eq j l c in k l are the decision variables in the function and the n q and n r are the numbers of equality constraints and inequality constraints respectively multi objective evolutionary algorithm moea is used to solve the objective function moea is an advanced optimization algorithm based on genetic principles that relies on various search algorithms to provide higher reliability heydari mofrad and yazdi 2022 moea has proven to perform well on multi objective optimization problems in urban drainage and sewer system design eckart et al 2018 wang et al 2018 yazdi et al 2017 the moea algorithm used in this study was developed and validated by the team of authors 3 application of the proposed approach 3 1 case study fuzhou is a famous historical and cultural city the capital of fujian province located on the southeast coast of china it is between 118 08 120 31 e and 25 15 26 29 n fuzhou is heavily affected by the typhoon each year and the mean number of direct typhoons per year is 2 typhoons bring strong rains in the short term causing flooding in mountainous and urban areas the types of flooding affecting the city of fuzhou primarily include heavy rainfall intensity distribution and typhoon furthermore tides can block river outflows causing urban flooding fuzhou is surrounded by mountains on three sides and the sea on the other and the town has a single river which drains the flood waters of the mountains as shown in fig 2 an urban hydrographic network of 78 38 km2 is in the fuzhou urban region the major problem is that urban fluvial networks regulate flooding in mountainous and urban areas heavy rains in the upper mountains lead to flooding as the inflow boundary and the level of minjiang river as an outlet point the study area has 5 large reservoirs 34 gates and pumping stations to regulate the flow through the nodes of these 28 are in good condition that can be used as decision variables to optimize the model each reservoir has several gates but only one is marked on the map see text s4 in supporting information si for more details using to the method of fig 1 the reservoir gate and pumping station are delineated and the orange area shown in the figure is divided as the region of interest the input flow at the boundary uses a numerical model to obtain flood inflow over a future period as the input boundary for the simplified model in this area four river cross sections need to be predicted namely p1 p2 p3 and p4 p1 and p2 are the water levels at the corresponding river fork points upstream of the gate which are used to calculate the flow rate through the gate p3 predicts the flow of lakes from multiple rivers and is used to calculate the water level in section 3 p4 predicts the water level in the lower reaches of the river and is used to calculate the flow through the gates and observe the flooding process to evaluate the accuracy of the model four control sections were selected namely section 1 section 2 section 3 and section 4 these four prediction points are critical for the study area there are two major research challenges in the field of study first the description of section 3 input hydraulic model is highly difficult and time consuming because it is formed by the confluence of several rivers as indicated in fig 2 there are five rivers upstreams second it is highly difficult and cumbersome to forecast water levels under section 4 because there are several upstream entry limits and several downstream water level limits as shown in fig 2 section 4 has 10 inflow boundaries and 3 water level boundaries therefore changing sections 3 and 4 to ml methods can maximize model accuracy and reduce computation time therefore p3 and p4 were selected as prediction points furthermore if a water balance model is built in section 2 it is determined by flow through g3 g5 g4 see text s5 in supporting information si for more details with g3 as an example the flow rate is calculated using equation 5 and upstream and downstream water levels should be known to calculate δ h the downstream water level of g3 is section 2 s water level and the upstream water level is p1 s water level when the upstream water level is greater than the downstream water level δ h is only related to the upstream water level in the g3 opening adjustment process the flow across door changes in the optimization model the flow rate of the jiefangxi river also changes making it difficult to find the p1 s water level using the existing formula therefore a surrogate model is necessary to predict the water level at p1 to more accurately determine the flow rate by g3 3 2 optimize the operation of urban river systems the proposed simplified method has been applied to the multi objective optimization of the urban river system urs the optimization object is the urs s flood and the decision variable is the opening statement of the corresponding gates and pumping stations there are two optimization goals in this case study namely minimizing flood volume and minimizing the average flood duration among them the smallest volume of flooding is the highest priority therefore the objective function of this study is 9 minimize f f floodv f floodd where f is the objective function in the case f floodv represents the flood volume of the system and f floodd represents the average flood duration of the observed section the system flood volume is calculated as follows 10 f floodv i 1 n f v i 11 f v i i 1 m m a x v i v w a r n h j h warn 0 h j h warn i 0 m the average duration of a flood is calculated as follows 12 f floodd i 1 n f d i n 13 f d i i 1 m δ t h j h warn 0 h j h warn where n is the number of observations m is total number of simulated periods the f v i is the flood volume of the observation section and the f d i is the flood duration of the observation section in this study flooding is considered to have occurred if the water level exceeds the warning level of the observation section h j is the water level the h warn is the warning level of the observation sections and vwarn is the volume of the reservior corresponding to the warning value q is the average flow rate of the observed section and δ t is the simulation interval time constraints 1 there are maximum and minimum values for the gate opening elevation 2 the pumping station status is only on or off 4 application of the proposed approach 4 1 analysis of numerical model accuracy in this study to evaluate the accuracy of different types of models the root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and correlation coefficient r are introduced to evaluate the performance of the model krause et al 2005 liu et al 2021 the calculation method is as follows 14 rmse i 1 n γ i obs γ i sim 2 n rmse is used to measure the deviation between the observed value and the simulated value and the closer the value is to 0 the smaller the error 15 nse 1 i 1 n γ i obs γ i sim 2 i 1 n γ i obs γ obs mean 2 the value of nse ranges from negative infinity to 1 if the nse is close to 1 it means that the model quality is good and the model is reliable if the nse is close to 0 it means that the simulation result is close to the average of the observations the overall result is reliable but the process simulation error is large if the nse is well below 0 the model cannot be trusted 16 r cov γ i sim γ i obs var γ i sim var γ i obs the r value is between 0 and 1 and the r value is 1 to indicate a complete correlation where i is the current simulation time and n is the total number of simulations γ i obs is the observed value γ obs mean is the average of observations γ i sim is the simulated value and γ sim mean is the average of a simulated value cov and var represent the covariance and variance of the data respectively in the numerical model construction the hifi high fidelity model of urban river hydrology and hydrology is constructed based on swmm 5 1 from june 6 to 16 2022 a total of 10 days of rainfall were selected to verify the accuracy of the numerical model the position of the monitoring section is shown in fig 2 and the comparison between the monitored water level and the simulated water level is shown in fig 3 rmse nse and r were used to calculate the error between the cross sectional simulated value and the observed value respectively the results of the simulation error calculation are shown in table 1 from fig 3 and table 1 the rmse of the selected four sections is less than 0 1 nse is greater than 0 8 and r is greater than 0 9 during rainfall it can well reflect the process of rising and receding indicating that the swmm simulation model can better reflect the runoff formation of urban rainfall and the law of river water level change 4 2 analysis of surrogate model inputs before constructing the surrogate model the input and output variables of the surrogate model are analyzed successively in this study the correlation analysis of prediction points and boundary points was carried out using the correlation coefficient r and the results are shown in fig 4 the input variables are all flow sequences p1 and p2 are input for the associated 3 gate flows the input of the p3 is 6 gate flows upstream and 3 downstream flows which indicates that the p3 is affected by both upstream and downstream boundaries upstream inflows are due to poor elevation while downstream influences may be due to river levels the jin anhe river the main river in the study area has to little change in the elevation of the river bottom and the phenomenon of water level topping p3 often occurs the p4 is only affected by the flow of gates associated with the main river and has little correlation with the upstream boundary input the lake where p3 is located has a very large reservoir capacity which to some extent blocks the upstream and downstream hydraulic connection the study is split into two parts upstream the reservoir area and downstream the fluvial area in this case there will be some problems with building a complete surrogate model for example upstream boundary changes are difficult to quickly reflect at downstream prediction points because the existence of p3 leads to a weak correlation between upstream boundary points and p4 at the same time the full modeling will consider 11 inputs which will make the model network more complex resulting in more training and prediction time to better reflect the dynamics of each part of the system we adopt the method of block modeling and sub point prediction that is a surrogate model is built at each prediction point and eventually all the surrogate models are combined into a simplified model to replace the complete river system another detail that cannot be overlooked is that we predicted the water level in p4 in the input variable g10 is the total flow rate of gates and pumping stations calculated by equation 5 however the formula needs to know the upstream and downstream water levels the upstream guangminggang river is the largest in the city fig 3 section 4 shows that the water level changes very little at this point over a period of 10 days the maximum water level variation does not exceed 0 1 m therefore we assume that the water level at the end of time t 1 is equal to the initial water level at time t consequently the upstream water level of the g10 is determined the water level downstream is the level of the tide and was observed as explained earlier flow units are used when calculating the correlation between prediction points and boundary points but for the gate the opening can be faster and more intuitive to reflect the change of the gate therefore the p1 and p2 points with the best correlation are selected in fig 4 and the boundary conditions are changed to the g3 g4 and g5 gate opening processes the results of the new correlation are shown in table 2 table 2 shows a worse correlation than fig 4 but practically speaking the p1 point is at the boundary and is strongly correlated with the surrounding three gates see text s5 in supporting information si for more details therefore we believe that the flow process at the boundary can better reflect the process of predicting the point and can be used as an input to the surrogate model the last input and output variables of the ml model for this study are summarized in table 3 another consideration is the impact of different simulation time steps on prediction accuracy for urban river systems simulated time steps can reflect the process of water level changes if the time interval is too long the water level change process of some sections will be ignored resulting in the water level prediction becoming meaningless if the interval is too small it will increase the training effort of the surrogate model two surrogate models with stochastic initialization were used to analyze different prediction intervals and the results are shown in table 4 for the bp model nse has performed poorly at a time the interval of 5 min the rmse result was good with a minimum value of 0 051 and a data correlation coefficient of 0 952 the lstm results performed well in all three indicators of which 20 min was the best result in cities people generally want to be able to monitor the water level change process in a timelier manner to prevent overflow events therefore we choose a 5 min as the time interval for surrogate model training and prediction moreover the prediction results of the ml model in this article are continuous to avoid the accumulation of errors due to individual generation at one instant we generate all the water level sequences over the projection period 4 3 analysis of surrogate model accuracy in this study to better analyze the error distribution of the ml models the average error μ and the standard deviation of the error σ are introduced and the calculation formula is detailed in the following formula krause et al 2005 the character on the right side of the equal sign of the formula has the same meaning as the formula 14 17 μ 1 n i 1 n γ i sim γ i obs 2 18 σ 1 n i 1 n γ i sim γ i obs 2 ml models were applied to perform predictive analysis of the prediction points in the study area and the results are shown in table 5 the bp neural network applied to p1 and p2 points achieved a good prediction effect the application of lstm in p3 and p4 points has achieved good results this may be because p1 and p2 are located upstream of the study area near the boundary with 3 input variables and there is a very small time interval between input and output variables p3 and p4 were in the middle and lower reaches of the study area with 5 and 6 input variables the number of input variables is higher and the neural network structure is more complex it takes about 0 5 3 h from the start of rainfall to reach the predicted position from the flood and there is a certain degree of time lag due to the special gate structure lstm can retain or filter time related information and make fuller use of time series related information fig 5 compares the prediction results obtained by the method selected for the four positions with the swmm simulation results here the blue dots represent the ml model prediction results while the continuous black lines represent the swmm simulation results this figure shows that the correlation coefficient r of the simplified model prediction results is greater than 0 99 indicating that the predicted results are consistent with the swmm simulation results the distribution of error in the prediction results at different locations is shown in fig 6 where the height of each bar represents the number of predictions with similar errors in this case the closer the mean of the distribution is to 0 the better the average performance as can be seen from fig 6 most of the errors of the four prediction points are around 0 indicating that the selected prediction method has very good accuracy from the different prediction results of the four prediction points the predicted values of p1 p2 and p4 are all water levels but the figure shows that the average error distribution of p4 is 0 005 0 005 and the accuracy is significantly better than that of the bp results at p1 and p2 points this shows that lstm has very good accuracy in predicting water levels p3 predicts the total inflow rate and combined with the results in table 5 it can still be considered that lstm also has good accuracy in predicting node input flow fig 7 compares the p3 and p4 point bp and lstm predictions with swmm simulations for four different recurrence periods designed under rainfall in each case study as can be seen from the figure both surrogate models can estimate the time series of predicted values well but the predicted results of the lstm model are more accurate than the bp results meanwhile the magnitude of rainfall intensity has a great influence on the predicted results of the ml model when the rainfall return period is 5a the peak result of bp prediction is significantly larger than the swmm simulation value in the other reproduction periods 10a 20a and 50a the peak results predicted by bp result gradually approached the swmm analog values the lstm prediction peak is significantly better than bp when the swmm simulation value is small rainfall intensity the simulation results are unstable and show a large fluctuation trend however it gradually stabilized as the rainfall re emergence period increased this may be due to light rainfall which undergoes a phase of slow flooding accompanied by the influence of many reservoirs and lakes in the study area resulting in unstable simulation results these may be important reasons for the inaccurate prediction results of the bp neural network model during low intensity rainfall due to the special gate structure lstm selectively enters and forgets some information retains the most important rainfall information and adjusts the final forecast results in combination with a certain time interval therefore it is feasible to use bp and lstm models as surrogate models to reflect the internal dynamics of the system table 6 shows that compared to lstm the bp model is slower to train but faster to predict therefore the bp model was selected at p1 and p2 while the lstm model with better prediction accuracy was selected as the surrogate model at p3 and p4 to further validate the precision of the surrogate model this study was complemented by 16 heavy rain tests see text s6 in supporting information si for more details the above trained ml model is used as a virtual river channel to connect with the reservoir in the study area and the river channel relates to a sluice and pump to form a simplified model of the research area the resulting simplified model structure for region of interest substitution is shown in fig 8 table 7 calculates the comparison of the simplified model calculation results and the swmm simulation results under different rainfall recurrence periods the results show that the four sections have high accuracy under different rainfall intensities the average value of nse is greater than 0 8 and the average value of rmse is less than 0 6 indicating that the simplified model can well reflect the water level change results of each section taking the rainfall recurring period of 10a as an example fig 9 shows the comparison between the simplified model of four sections and the swmm simulation results during rainfall the simplified model can well reflect the rising and falling flow of water and the trend is consistent with the swmm results figs 5 and 6 present a few outliers from the predictive model that may have an impact on the prediction results this is because the training data includes events with less rainfall intensity as shown in fig 7 when the precipitation recurrence period is short there is a significant difference between the predictions and the simulation results to avoid this problem when using the ml model we chose a scene with a relatively heavy rain intensity meanwhile we believe that the results in fig 5 6 and table 5 show that the ml models are stable reliable and have low error depending on the existing indicators the accuracy of these alternate and simplified models also meets the minimum requirements fig 6 7 table 7 it is quite possible and efficient to change the hifi model to the region of interest s simplified model 4 4 analysis of flood control effect the simplified model is used to calculate the optimal control strategy of the gate and the flood control effect of the urban river system urs table 6 compares the calculation time of the simplified model and the swmm when simulating and solving optimization problems the simulations were run on a laboratory desktop computer asus with processor intel core i7 11700kf cpu 3 6 ghz and nvidia geforce gtx3080 10g gpu table 6 shows that when the simplified model is used for simulation the calculation time is only 262 ms which is about 1 574 of the swmm calculation time when used to optimize and solve the extreme values of the objective function the time taken to simplify the model is 53609 ms which is about 1 184 of the swmm optimization time it shows that the simplified model has a great computational advantage in both simulated values and optimization solving it should be noted that the test uses a population size is 100 the maximum iterative times is 500 generations and the maximum stable stop times is 100 generations the population single point crossing probability is 0 2 and the mutation probability is 0 3 table 8 and fig 10 show the comparison of the optimization model composed of the simplified model with the existing gate and pump station rule based control rbc model as can be seen from the plot the highest flood level controlled using the optimization model has decreased significantly of the 4 sections 3 were below the warning level and 1 was below the maximum level optimized model control reduced section 1 flood duration from 3 h to 1 2 h reducing the flood duration by about 60 the flood volume was reduced from 48613 9 m3 to 7577 2 m3 a reduction of 84 for section 3 the most important lake in the city the maximum water level was reduced by 1 06 m from 7 75 m to 6 69 m the duration and volume of floods have also been reduced to varying degrees section 4 directly avoids unsafe flooding and water levels above warning these show that the optimization model has a significantly better effect on flood control than rbc control from the perspective of a cross sectional water level process compared with rbc the optimization model has a better effect on controlling the water level section 1 and section 3 took significant water level drop measures before the peak flood flow providing more usable reservoir capacity for the incoming flood so that the maximum water level was in a safe state after the rainfall ends the water level drops below normal levels if there is rainfall behind it can provide more abundant usable storage capacity for subsequent floods however if there is no rainfall the daily water level will be low and the water source will need to be replenished to reach the landscape water level section 2 did not lower the water level before the rains began and were above normal after the rains ended this study aims to optimize all outcomes compared to the lake in section 2 the lake in section 3 has a greater capacity and a greater risk of flooding while the water level in section 2 exceeds the warning value the risk of flooding is low see text s7 in supporting information si for more details section 2 needs to regulate flood peaks in two adjacent rivers simultaneously and avoid increasing downstream section 3 flood risk before the peak of the flood the overall operation is conservative which is manifested in the slow rise of the water level because the limited storage capacity should be reserved for the most important peak flood flow after the rainfall it maintained its water level at 12 38 m for 17 h which was 0 86 m higher than the rbc s level this stores an additional 63 000 m3 of floodwater on the one hand the maximum peak flow of downstream section 3 can be reduced and on the other hand the discharge of floodwater in the direction of section 1 can be staggered this minimizes the maximum water level of section 3 to some extent it is precisely because the maximum water level of section 3 is lowered so that the discharge flow is reduced so that the maximum water level of section 4 does not exceed the warning value the rbc on its characteristics does not fully consider the downstream flood control safety and other river flow superposition problems resulting in a certain risk of the lake and river overflow the optimization results have a very good effect on flood control and rational distribution 5 conclusions this paper proposes a simplified modeling method based on alternative large scale urban river system urs optimization this method is suitable for problems that require the control of reservoirs gates and pumping stations in urs by decomposing the region of interest and using boundary points to represent the rest of the system the computational cost of simulating the dynamics of the entire system can be significantly reduced define the dynamic prediction points within the system and use the boundary input to make predictions to reflect the flood evolution process and the control effect of gates and pumping stations the region of interest consists of 3 models representing reservoirs and rivers they are the water balance model the bp neural network bp model and the long short term memory lstm model the predicted time of the bp model is very short and the prediction results are good for points with few input variables and in sensitive time due to the special gate structure lstm can selectively retain time related inputs and outputs which has a very good prediction effect on the water level in the lower reaches of the river therefore p1 and p2 chose the bp model to predict boundary head changes p3 and p4 choose lstm to predict the internal dynamics of the system the simplified model consisting of 7 surrogate models was validated with very high accuracy and less simulation time reducing the single simulation time by a factor of 574 compared to the numerical model this method is applied to coastal urban flood control problems including two optimization goals the control object was 4 water level observation sections in the study area and the decision variable was the opening state of 28 gates and pumping stations by adjusting the decision variables the flow through the sections are controlled in order to achieve the goal of controlling the target water level in this case study the optimization model built based on the simplified model can effectively control the flood flow process and the flood volume and flood duration of the three observation sections is reduced reducing the flood duration and 84 of the flood volume by up to 60 compared with the numerical model the calculation time is reduced by 184 times indicating that the simplified model constructed by the proposed method has a very good computational efficiency through this study it is proved that the simplified model has an alternative role in the optimization of the urs when using numerical models to simulate and optimize a region of interest facing time barriers building a simplified model using this method can greatly improve the calculation time this method can be widely used in urban drainage water resources distribution and real time control of urban gates and pumping stations composed of water conservancy engineering groups the model construction and optimization method like the one proposed in this work is used to reflect the internal flow rate and head changes in the region of interest however for the selection of specific surrogate models it is necessary to combine the actual situation and seek truth from facts to choose because the surrogate model used in this study has been well studied and validated future work is to divide urs into more areas of interest using simplified models combined with model predictive control methods to achieve real time operation of the entire urban river system credit

1732,the yangtze river the third largest river around the globe has been heavily engineered with a series of hydroelectric dams meanwhile it receives elevated organic matter and nutrient loads from its densely populated catchment subsequently altering dissolved greenhouse gas ghg concentrations along the river however the large scale longitudinal patterns and drivers of ghg concentrations in the yangtze river remain poorly understood using longitudinal sampling design in a 2400 km section we report dissolved carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide concentrations along the yangtze river at 145 sites we observe significant spatial clustering with higher carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide concentrations in the middle reach of the yangtze river the results of nonlinear regression reveal that riverine ghgs are high when wetland coverage is high and dissolved oxygen is low wetlands and oxygen not the three gorges dam and tributaries are the primary correlates of spatial variations of co2 and ch4 concentrations respectively n2o is surprisingly well predicted by co2 implying their common drivers or sources we strongly recommend that wetland contribution to ghg budgets and its sensitivity to environmental change be considered when estimating riverine ghgs in the yangtze river in light of our study future control of ghg emissions from large rivers may largely depend on how external inputs and internal metabolism are regulated by decreasing nutrient loading keywords greenhouse gases yangtze river dissolved concentrations spatial pattern wetland oxygen data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rivers are important players in the global budgets of long lived greenhouse gases ghgs acting as an active pipe responsible for a disproportionately large amount of carbon and nitrogen processing emission and export from land to ocean bernhardt et al 2022 cole et al 2007 kroeze et al 2005 stanley et al 2022 it is estimated that aquatic carbon can offset 12 590 of the terrestrial net ecosystem productivity among different types of ecosystems webb et al 2019 global rivers are estimated to produce 0 18 0 28 of the emitted n2o globally maavara et al 2019 with higher n2o emission fluxes in temperate and subtropical rivers hu et al 2016 omitting aquatic components in large scale ghg budgets may overestimate the magnitude of carbon and nitrogen storage in terrestrial ecosystems beaulieu et al 2011 crawford et al 2014 however the estimates of ghg emissions from rivers are extremely uncertain due to the highly skewed spatial distributions of the river datasets liu et al 2022 maavara et al 2019 stanley et al 2022 large rivers in sub tropical regions are recognized as important contributors of ghgs due to large surface area and higher rate of emissions per unit area compared to temperate ecosystems borges et al 2015b hu et al 2016 raymond et al 2013 these large rivers are however still under represented in global datasets particularly with respect to direct measurements of concentrations and fluxes borges et al 2015a raymond et al 2013 regnier et al 2013 rivers in agricultural and urban area generally have higher ghg emissions beaulieu et al 2011 borges et al 2018 hu et al 2016 wang et al 2017 given the great importance of sub tropical rivers in the global river surface area these rivers are presumably vital in the global ghg budgets but the origins and controls over the fate of these ghgs are still poorly understood the paucity of available data coupled with poor ecological understanding of the underlying processes precludes us from predicting ghg spatial variability across the large river scale bussmann et al 2022 crawford et al 2017a active gas transfer low solubility and elusive origins are responsible for the uncertainty of ghg concentrations and emissions from river networks marzadri et al 2021 stanley et al 2016 identifying the role of large rivers in regional and global ghg budgets necessitates an understanding of the linkages between riverine ghgs and catchment characteristics since the rivers are fueled by c production and stocks from upland terrestrial and wetland borges et al 2015b hotchkiss et al 2015 in particular given that approximately half of the global surface area of wetlands is located in the sub tropics rivera monroy et al 2011 mobilized nutrients and organic matter potentially enhance the breakdown of terrestrially derived organic carbon oc by heterotrophic river microbes ward et al 2016 meanwhile in a highly disturbed large river gross primary production gpp may exceed aerobic respiration leading to co2 deficient crawford et al 2016 ch4 is considered to be modulated by different biophysical controls than co2 rovelli et al 2022 although it is clear that excess n inputs from fertilizer and wastewater treatment plants clearly prompted n2o concentrations the controls of the biogeochemical processes producing n2o in lotic systems are still not well understood in this study we selected the yangtze river to investigate the large scale spatial patterns of dissolved ghgs along the river the yangtze river is the world s largest subtropical river confronting intensive human activities during recent decades it has received widespread attention with respect to ghgs in three gorges dam tgd at various spatial and temporal scales zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2013 and fluvial carbon export from the estuary wu et al 2007 zhang et al 2008 yet studies that addressed how hydrological and biological controls shift through the length of the yangtze river with consequences of ghg variations are lacking the river which flows from the tibetan plateau into the sea is characterized by a large gradient in hydromorphological and biogeochemical configuration which provides an ideal system to disentangle the mechanisms regulating large scale patterns accordingly we asked what are the patterns and controls of dissolved ghgs throughout the yangtze river to answer this we conducted a sampling campaign in the yangtze river to collect measurements of ghg concentrations and supporting water chemistry parameters and integrated the results with hydromorphological attributes across the upper middle and lower reaches we address our question by 1 generating a spatial dataset of dissolved ghg concentrations 2 examining the relationships between ghg concentrations and potential drivers to understand and predict spatial trends of ghgs and 3 gaining insights into the role of different sources of ghgs at the large river scale 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and sampling overview the yangtze changjiang river basin is located in a subtropical zone with an average annual precipitation of 1100 mm precipitation

conversion of land cover from forest to urban and grassland fig 1b major city clusters along water courses are chongqing wuhan and nanjing which are located in the upstream midstream and downstream of the yangtze river respectively fluvial export of water sediment carbon and dissolved solutes has been affected by human disturbance and climate change the discharge of yangtze river is monitored at 13 gauging stations by the yangtze river conservancy commission ministry of water resources china water discharge of large tributaries flowing into the yangtze river was also monitored at gauging stations our study was conducted in the mainstem and tributaries of the yangtze river the samples were taken downstream from october 17th to november 4th 2020 using a synoptic survey approach in which geomorphological characteristics land cover information and water physical and chemical parameters were acquired 145 samples were selected from the upper middle and lower reaches of yangtze river basin with 76 sites from the mainstem and 69 sites from tributaries the sampling locations were mainly accessed by bridges and boats otherwise by the shore in the situation of no bridge and cruise to examine the effect of tributaries the sample sites were assigned at the outlets of tributaries and up and downstream in the mainstem the downstream sampling sites were located where tributaries and mainstem were well mixed 2 2 water chemistry and gas concentration analysis in situ water temperature specific conductivity ph and dissolved oxygen were determined using a multi parameter portable meter hach h40d usa water samples were collected in duplicate and filtered on site using 0 45 μm filters in 50 ml polyprophylene bottles for laboratory measurement samples for nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 and dissolved total phosphorus dtp concentrations were stored at 4 c for later lab analysis alkalinity was determined by titrating 50 ml filtered water with 0 01 m h2so4 solution after sampling at a precision of 6 within 24 h no3 and nh4 were determined using the ion chromatography method dionex ics 900 dionex usa and the automated phenate method respectively calibration curves were produced using reference samples according to quality control standards and were then applied to evaluate data from each set of samples reagents procedural blanks and samples were measured twice in parallel with average values reported the relative standard deviations of replicates were calculated for all samples and found to be 5 0 no3 and nh4 concentrations were measured at precisions of 2 6 and 8 6 respectively dtp was determined by icp oes worsfold et al 2016 at precisions of 3 4 sample were analyzed at the center for physical and chemical analysis of the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research beijing china aquatic co2 ch4 and n2o concentrations were measured in duplicate using the headspace method 100 ml headspace was created with ambient air in a 250 ml glass reagent bottle filled with bubble free water headspace gas samples were then transferred to gas bag by a syringe and transported to our lab for measurement we analyzed our samples using cavity ring down spectroscopy crds picarro g2508 picarro usa certified calibration gases of 300 600 and 1000 ppm co2 in n2 were used for calibration for ch4 and n2o we used the purified n2 99 99 for zeroing check the replicate measurements were within 6 of the accepted standard for all three gases the co2 ch4 and n2o concentrations were measured at precisions of 300 ppb 7 ppb and 10 ppb respectively the detection limits of crds technology were reported by brannon et al 2016 using minimum detectable slopes the original ghg concentrations were then calculated according to the headspace ratio and equilibration temperature respectively we corrected co2 headspace results using measured alkalinity considering chemical equilibration of the carbonate system in the sample vials koschorreck et al 2021 details in si text s1 2 3 hydrology and geography delineation discharge q data for the study period were collected from the water resources monitoring report released by the yangtze river conservancy commission in october and november of 2021 elevation of the sampling sites was recorded with gps during sampling we delineated the basin boundary using the hydroatlas data linke et al 2019 sub basins at level of 7 were extracted to determine the variations of land covers along the yangtze river for the analyses of percentages of land covers we used the land cover information provided by the dataset of copernius global land service in 2019 https land copernicus eu global products lc land cover in our study area was classified into forest shrubs herbaceous vegetation cropland urban built up referred to as urban hereafter bare sparse vegetation inland water bodies and herbaceous wetland referred to as wetland hereafter the geodata maps were generated using qgis 3 18 qgis development team 2021 2 4 statistical techniques we firstly considered the spatial variability among upstream midstream and downstream by applying analysis of covariance anova to analyze the relationship between co2 and o2 saturation we calculated the excess saturation calculated from henry s law corrected for temperature with the rmr package moulton 2018 to assess whether the available set of variables offers reasonable predictions of ghgs we calculated linear correlations of ghg concentrations with water physiochemical variables as well as hydromorphological factors in the mainstream samples the generated predictors of ghg concentrations had significant multicollinearity figure s1 and such multicollinearity violates a key assumption of multiple regression models stepwise linear regressions were performed to identify key explanatory variables stepwise regressions can reduce the number of predictors to generate the most parsimonious linear regression models and avoid the effects of multicollinearity on model results log transformation was applied to the data to fulfill the requirement of normalized distribution in natural systems input predictors and outcome response are often nonlinearly correlated and predictors interact with each other resulting in weak explanation by simple linear regression to understand whether the potential nonlinear model can improve our ability to predict ghgs over linear regression in the yangtze river regression tree analysis of ghgs was performed with the rpart package therneau et al 2019 regression tree as a non linear regression method is able to explore the original data without prior assumption regression tree uses a tree like graph to map the observed predictor data to draw conclusions about the target response value the model iteratively divides data into two subgroups based on a threshold which distinctly makes two subgroups as different as possible by minimizing the variation sum of squares of the response variable within two groups de ath and fabricius 2000 we applied a 10 fold cross validation procedure to evaluate the performance on the datasets the most parsimonious regression tree was selected by pruning the tree when a split happens only if it decreases the error metric by a cost complexity factor of 0 001 we report the percent variation r square which was calculated as 1 minus the relative error venkiteswaran et al 2014 to describe the fit of the tree all statistical analyses were performed with r version 3 14 0 r core team 2021 the data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request 3 results 3 1 river characteristics the datasets contain a large range of flow distance the distance from estuary 0 2576 km and elevations 0 261 m fig 1 land covers changed remarkably with more urban land and less forest towards downstream most sub catchments have more than 40 of cropland the midstream reach had more wetlands than the other reaches table 1 water temperature during the sampling period averaged 19 4 with very limited variation 18 8 20 1 c specific conductivity ranged from 239 μs cm 1 in the lower reach corresponding to high discharge to 407 μs cm 1 in the upper reach corresponding to low discharge 85 of observations were undersaturated in o2 overall range 6 65 9 51 mg l 1 i e 76 105 of the saturation level o2 no3 and dtp concentrations have significant differences among three river reaches fig 2 with higher values in the lower reach of yangtze river due to relatively constant water temperature no significant correlation between water temperature and other water chemical parameters was found figure s1 3 2 ghgs and the spatial extent in the yangtze river and its tributaries we observed consistent supersaturation of three ghgs with respect to the atmosphere consequently the river was net sources of ghgs the median concentrations of dissolved co2 ch4 and n2o were 67 μmol l 1 0 25 μmol l 1 and 59 nmol l 1 respectively co2 and n2o varied among different river sections with higher values in the middle reach co2 and n2o shared similar spatial distributions such that upper and lower reaches had significant difference from the middle reach while there was no significant difference between the upper and lower reaches fig 3 for co2 and n2o the highest variability was found in the middle reaches in contrast ch4 variability was not significantly different between river reaches compared to the mainstem tributaries had higher ghg concentrations which fluctuated in a wider range fig 3 table s1 3 3 predictability of ghgs no significant correlations emerged between river lengths and ghg concentrations anova p 0 3 for all gases table s2 however the flow significantly predicted co2 and n2o at our sampling sites wetland and urban land among all land covers affected co2 and n2o with higher co2 and n2o concentrations in sub catchments that had higher percentages of wetland and urban areas o2 no3 and dtp were negatively correlated to co2 and n2o compared to co2 and n2o we only found ec and dtp as explanatory variables for ch4 with weak explanatory power co2 and o2 saturation varied considerably among different river sites all mainstream samples varied between over and under saturation of o2 with constant co2 supersaturation the river showed an offset relative to the 1 1 line fig 2 indicating that there was an external source of co2 uncoupled from o2 in the regression tree model the percentage of wetland coverage wetland was identified as the strongest predictor of co2 as wetland was the first and primary branch the tree has higher explanatory power r2 0 49 fig 4 a compared to stepwise linear regression with o2 no3 and wetland as predictors r2 0 32 p 0 001 table s3 extremely high co2 concentrations occurred when wetland exceeded 5 9 where sampling sites were mostly distributed in the middle reach wetland entered the regression tree a second time predicting higher co2 concentration at more than 2 2 of wetland percentage low wetland and low o2 had the lowest co2 concentrations ch4 concentrations were moderately predicted by o2 and co2 r2 0 31 fig 4b o2 explains much of the variability in ch4 which was high when o2 8 3 mg l 1 above 8 3 mg l 1 of o2 ch4 could be further split by co2 98 μmol l 1 in the tree regression model high ch4 was correlated with the combination of lower o2 8 3 mg l 1 and higher co2 98 μmol l 1 regression tree analysis improved the explanatory power compared to the multiple linear regression r2 0 19 p 0 001 table s3 co2 and dtp were chosen as predictors of n2o concentrations in the regression tree model which could explain 68 of the total variation fig 4c co2 marked the first and second split in the regression tree reflecting the important role of co2 on n2o here the performance of stepwise linear model is similar to the nonlinear regression table s3 in linear correlations n2o concentrations were significantly correlated to co2 with high explanatory power r2 0 59 p 0 001 table s3 4 discussion 4 1 spatial variation in ghg concentrations the magnitudes of our measured co2 concentrations are comparable to previous reported annual average ranges in the yangtze river 1235 and 1463 μatm from liu et al 2016 and ran et al 2017 which were calculated from alkalinity and ph those are also at the same magnitude as for high order rivers in the us and the global average estimate lauerwald et al 2015 liu and raymond 2018 observed ch4 and n2o concentrations were two and three orders of magnitude lower than co2 respectively ch4 concentrations in the mainstream were lower than the values reported by the small scale studies at the yangtze river estuary wang et al 2009 and three gorges reservoir bai et al 2022 likely due to stronger microbial activities at reservoirs and estuaries unlike other findings liu et al 2016 we did not observe a continuous gradient of increase or decrease of ghgs along the yangtze river in contrast co2 and n2o concentrations were higher in the middle reach than in the upper and lower reaches this is consistent with previous historical calculated co2 data which did not show a longitudinal trend along the mainstem of the yangtze river ran et al 2017 decline patterns of ghgs along rivers could be due to lower relative land water connection than a large volume of the downstream reach crawford et al 2013 hotchkiss et al 2015 higher co2 and n2o in fact are significantly linked to larger wetland coverage in the sub catchments of the middle reach of the yangtze river fig 4 the finding is in concert with many studies which concluded that riparian wetland is one of the major contributors of riverine ghgs borges et al 2019 leng et al 2021 mwanake et al 2019 teodoru et al 2015 gases from the upstream would have a limited effect on the downstream reach because ghg outgassing is usually fast compared to downstream transport crawford et al 2014 according to the gas transfer coefficient averaged k600 from chamber measurements of 9 1 m d 1 liu et al 2017 and channel hydraulic geometry averaged river depth of 5 2 m averaged flow velocity of 1 71 m s 1 in the yangtze river 95 of co2 in a given parcel of water would outgas within 84 km downstream with longer water residence time aquatic ch4 can be oxidized by methanotrophic bacteria leading to less ch4 downstream in large rivers the rapidly overturned water transport limited ch4 downstream due to outgassing and ch4 oxidation sawakuchi et al 2016 compared to other gases ch4 varied without clear large scale spatial patterns it is likely that ch4 is majorly derived from point sources that were subjected to strong localized control variance in ch4 at smaller spatial scales therefore may overwhelm any larger scale pattern crawford et al 2014 accordingly we could also infer that tgd is likely not the cause of higher ghgs in the middle reach since the effect of tgd can hardly be detected from the sites in the middle reach which are 40 790 km downstream figure s2 4 2 controls of spatial pattern of ghgs our results on ghgs concentrations from regression trees imply both nonlinear effects and complex interactions among variables in our case ghgs were better predicted using nonlinear regression trees than linear regressions fig 4 and table s3 suggesting the non linear model is capable of improving the predictive ability of the ghg concentrations land cover and dissolved oxygen appear to be key factors influencing spatial trends of dissolved ghgs in the yangtze river the regression tree of co2 concentrations shows that the prediction of co2 relies on the combination of wetland coverage and o2 high wetland coverage was clearly associated with highest co2 which suggests that direct or indirect inputs of co2 from adjacent wetland probably support a large part of riverine co2 abril et al 2013 good hydrologic connectivity of wetland therefore facilitates the contribution from terrestrial inputs during our sampling period the discharge was 1 25 times higher than the annual average discharge thus we assume that the river channel was well connected to riparian wetlands this is also supported by the positive correlation between co2 and discharge indicating high discharge promotes the inputs of ghgs although many studies have shown that agricultural land significantly contributes to aquatic ghgs due to elevated organic matter nutrients and sediments borges et al 2018 crawford et al 2017b peacock et al 2019 romeijn et al 2019 we did not observe the effect of agricultural land use on riverine ghgs it is likely due to relatively constant agricultural land use along the river table 1 given the evidence that urban land was positively correlated to ghgs we speculate that urban land contributes to riverine ghgs via increasing inputs from point sources no3 and dtp figure s1 previous studies suggest urban rivers have 2 4 times higher co2 fluxes and can be ch4 hotspots due to elevated sedimentation and nutrients wang et al 2018 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 oversaturated co2 in the yangtze river is sustained by not only external but also internal sources the negative relationships between co2 and o2 in the linear correlation analysis suggest control of riverine ghgs by metabolic linkage previous study found similar correlations which were primarily attributed to heterotrophic respiration of river organic carbon as an essential co2 contributor liu et al 2016 it should be noted however that the correlations do not necessarily imply in stream metabolic activity as external input derived from terrestrial soil respiration or groundwater can also provide the signal of low o2 and high co2 bernal et al 2022 while due to rapid gas exchange and modest contribution relative to huge river discharge the input from groundwater can rarely shape the co2 o2 correlations in large rivers independent of in stream metabolism liu et al 2021 vachon et al 2020 the contributions of internal production to riverine co2 varied among different studies liu et al 2016 stated that heterotrophic respiration constitutes 8 22 of excess pco2 in the yangtze river riverine internal respiration has been shown to account for 39 of the co2 emissions in large rivers of united states hotchkiss et al 2015 the strong negative relationship between o2 and co2 is indicative of the interaction between respiration and primary production that may occur in water column and adjacent wetland fig 4 borges et al 2015b hotchkiss et al 2015 the molar ratio 1 2 shown in fig 2 represents the expected relationship between o2 and co2 when aerobic reaction is responsible for much of the spatial variability in co2 concentrations our data generally fall to the right of this 1 1 line implying that there are additional sources of co2 beyond aerobic respiration this decoupling between co2 and o2 can be attributed to 1 the external co2 sources i e groundwater input and riparian wetland respiration bernal et al 2022 2 anaerobic processes for example denitrification and methanogenesis may also contribute to additional production of co2 aho et al 2021 chen et al 2015 crawford et al 2014 herreid et al 2021 and 3 carbonate buffering by conversion toward co2 from ionized forms hco3 and co3 2 stets et al 2017 our results show that o2 as a proxy of carbon processing and transporting is well representing co2 dynamics in rivers stets et al 2017 ch4 concentrations were surprisingly poorly predicted by water chemical variables and land covers even though ch4 was able to be split by o2 and co2 in the regression tree analysis fig 4b these proxies of internal production and external inputs had weak explanatory power suggesting a complex combination of factors governing ch4 however all the interactions between o2 and co2 in the nonlinear model fig 4b point to the conditions of ecosystem respiration er as a determinant of ch4 in the yangtze river the conditions that determine overall er including co2 production also determine ch4 production stanley et al 2016 another explanation for the unclear large scale spatial pattern is that fluctuation in ch4 concentrations can be subjected to strong localized control leng et al 2021 bussmann et al 2022 highlighted that river morphology and structures determine the variability of dissolved ch4 in large rivers besides this our data showed ch4 had no relationship with co2 or n2o positive correlations between co2 and ch4 would indicate both gases are largely controlled by organic matter degradation zhang et al 2021 positive correlation between ch4 and n2o was observed due to large inputs of untreated human waste zhang et al 2021 further negative correlation between both was reported in smith and böhlke 2019 because both gases respond differently to biogeochemical controls different response to no3 our results are perhaps not surprising as the contribution of anaerobic metabolism and biogeochemical controls shifts over space and time co2 derived from metabolism might probably happen in water column and surrounding wetland while ch4 production might be supported by fine organic matter rich sediments wilcock and sorrell 2008 nutrient enrichment can change the relative contributions of different respiratory pathways within fluvial systems as well as net ghg emissions resulting in unclear ratios among three gases stanley et al 2016 interestingly we found n2o concentrations were most strongly predicted by co2 in the mainstem of the yangtze river explaining 59 of its variation table s2 our positive relationship between co2 and n2o is in accordance with laini et al 2011 in lowland springs leng et al 2022 in the river network of the north china plain and venkiteswaran et al 2014 in agricultural streams but opposite to other studies that concluded with negative correlations teodoru et al 2015 the negative correlations were resulted from n2o removed by denitrification which was intensified by organic matter degradation in the sediments simultaneously producing co2 teodoru et al 2015 we infer our positive correlation between n2o and co2 is mainly due to processes favored by similar environmental conditions rather than the direct dependence of n2o on co2 the strong correlation of both gases is possibly the consequence of simultaneous transportation production and consumption of both gases both gases share common environmental predictors with similar explanatory power e g o2 wetland discharge in table s2 spatial patterns of co2 and n2o in rivers are believed to be attributed to the connectivity with wetlands borges et al 2019 one of the evidences is the dominance of wetlands in n2o variations when co2 is excluded from the predictors of n2o indicating wetlands are playing a significant role in regulating riverine n2o table s4 in addition to the wetland inputs the production of n2o as the same as co2 occurs in the hyporheic zone along groundwater flow paths and in the water column where o2 is low mwanake et al 2019 yang and lei 2018 respiration particularly at locations that receive large amounts of organic matter may deplete o2 and produce co2 facilitating denitrification in the hyporheic zone and contributing to the accumulation of excess ghgs in the water column similar relationships between co2 and n2o were observed in mwanake et al 2019 and dai et al 2008 being explained by nitrification via ammonium oxidizing bacteria producing co2 through h production it is reasonable that both nitrification and denitrification are contributing to n2o production through a coupled nitrification denitrification process which is favorable under suboxic conditions wrage et al 2001 in this process denitrifiers reduced no3 produced by aerobic nitrification leading to n2o production maavara et al 2019 quick et al 2019 in addition the optimum for a net n2o production by nitrification nitrifier denitrification and denitrification lies between a ph of 7 7 5 blum et al 2018 implying the net n2o production could be moderate in the river because of higher ph in our system table 1 we speculate there is no n limitation in our systems dissolved inorganic nitrogen no3 and nh4 was at high levels comparable to some agricultural rivers borges et al 2018 that could be the explanation for our weak negative correlation between n2o and no3 which is opposite to a series of studies that reported strong positive relationships between n2o and no3 beaulieu et al 2011 turner et al 2016 previous studies reported that n2o flux turner et al 2016 or yield silvennoinen et al 2008 increased with nitrate up to a certain point and then leveled off insignificant relationship between no3 and n2o was also observed in 9 of 12 african river borges et al 2015b and nitrogen enriched rivers in the chaohu lake basin yang and lei 2018 of note is that the model proposed by intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc which predicts riverine n2o flux by no3 with a single linear function is not sufficient the equation derived from average no3 n2o ratios default value of 0 0025 in shallow groundwater is widely applied to estimate the riverine n2o flux nevison 2000 syakila and kroeze 2011 thus we argue that the linear equation from the ipcc methodology to estimate riverine n2o needs to be applied with caution maavara et al 2019 venkiteswaran et al 2014 webb et al 2021 we recommend an improvement of the ipcc model by using a saturation model instead of flux model as the gas transfer process is not included apart from terrestrial inputs and in stream processing we considered tgd and tributaries had little effect on spatial patterns of ghgs in the mainstem of the yangtze river we have demonstrated that outgassing is a rapid process resulting in a profound effect limited to the vicinity of the reservoir figure s2 another evidence for the minor influence of the dam is the low relative importance of dam 6 28 table s4 on spatial variations of ghgs compared to other predictors wetlands and o2 from the results of nonlinear regressions ni et al 2022 reported the longitudinal variation before and after tgr with a finer spatial resolution where the ghg concentrations were increased by the reservoir itself and decreased by habitat modification downstream of the dam within tens of kilometers our closest sampling site downstream of tgd is 35 km away therefore tgd might have little impact from there on as a result the net change in ghg emissions directly caused by the tgr is unable to alter the overall ghg trends from the perspective of the entire yangtze river the dam has altered the riverine habitats downstream leading to essential changes in river topology and biogeochemical cycles the floodplain erosion is most potent after the three gorges dam and declines gradually downstream sun et al 2020 as a result the large wetland coverage in the middle reach could be an indirect effect of damming consequently the effect of damming on ghgs can be masked behind the information from wetland coverages the budgets of dissolved ghgs from tributaries were generally much lower than the budget of ghgs in the mainstem bussmann et al 2022 we modeled ghg budgets at the inflow of tributaries upstream and downstream across different river sections assuming conservative mixing text s2 and found the expected dilution of tributaries was lower than the measured budgets downstream figure s3 and table s5 it suggests that ghg import from tributaries is insufficient to remarkably affect the mainstream even though ghg concentrations in tributaries were higher considering lower relative discharge of the tributaries than that of the yangtze river tributaries only marginally affect the ghg concentrations the minor effect of tributaries to dissolved ghgs can also apply to other point sources with low volume high ghg inputs it also explains the unclear large scale pattern of ch4 since ch4 is mostly locally controlled 5 conclusions and implications our study provides the first systematic estimate of the longitudinal variability of greenhouse gases ghgs along the yangtze river and land cover and water biogeochemical impacts on three ghgs there are no continuous longitudinal gradients for ghgs the spatial trend of co2 was similar to that of n2o with higher values in the middle reach of yangtze river regression tree approach improves explanatory power over simple linear regression and is a step towards better integration and understanding of environmental predictors of riverine ghgs our results show that wetland and o2 drive the responses of co2 and ch4 meanwhile co2 is the best predictor of n2o concentration in the system which underscores the importance of identifying the correlations between ghgs and understanding the nature of such correlations for future prediction of ghgs we demonstrate that instead of the direct effect of three gorges dam and tributaries terrestrial influence and in stream metabolization dominate the spatial variations of ghgs the yangtze river is currently confronted by increase in precipitation and temperature birkinshaw et al 2017 with increased discharge and mobilization of oc in soils li et al 2018 these changes are altering the functioning of riverine ecosystems and appearing to have larger contribution of wetland ecosystem on co2 and n2o suggested by our study as suggested by richey et al 2002 that river and floodplain waters in the amazon basin maintain high co2 and constitute an important carbon loss we recommend to include wetland contribution in riverine ghg budgets and its response to environmental change eutrophication droughts etc for the estimates of riverine ghgs the yangtze river can play an important role of ch4 processes with more terrestrial inputs of organic carbon while the relationship between water temperature and ch4 concentration in streams and rivers is ambiguous stanley et al 2016 thus three gases may respond uniquely to global change and the variability needs to be captured in future studies by reduction of direct organic and nutrient inputs from wastewater treatment plants and farming management controlling eutrophication which is the key factor in regulating the organic matter cycling in the yangtze floodplain lakes zeng et al 2022 can help decrease aquatic ch4 and n2o emissions in such human dominated landscapes we acknowledge that our results are biased toward high flow conditions which may lead to an overestimation of dissolved ghg concentrations in the future repeated measurements over time time scale ranging from sub daily to seasonal are necessary to elucidate how spatial patterns in fluvial systems change it is a challenge to match the scales of observations to the scales of the drivers of ghg emissions the yangtze river is large and diverse with variations in c export and metabolism as such further detailed investigations on internal metabolism and gas transfer measurement are needed to capture the variability of multiple processes to obtain a more holistic understanding of ghg emissions in this important large river system we recommend to carefully account for the contribution of ghg emissions from large river systems considering the importance of large river feedback on climate change and the linkage of catchment land atmosphere and land ocean carbon exchange credit authorship contribution statement peifang leng conceptualization

1732,the yangtze river the third largest river around the globe has been heavily engineered with a series of hydroelectric dams meanwhile it receives elevated organic matter and nutrient loads from its densely populated catchment subsequently altering dissolved greenhouse gas ghg concentrations along the river however the large scale longitudinal patterns and drivers of ghg concentrations in the yangtze river remain poorly understood using longitudinal sampling design in a 2400 km section we report dissolved carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide concentrations along the yangtze river at 145 sites we observe significant spatial clustering with higher carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide concentrations in the middle reach of the yangtze river the results of nonlinear regression reveal that riverine ghgs are high when wetland coverage is high and dissolved oxygen is low wetlands and oxygen not the three gorges dam and tributaries are the primary correlates of spatial variations of co2 and ch4 concentrations respectively n2o is surprisingly well predicted by co2 implying their common drivers or sources we strongly recommend that wetland contribution to ghg budgets and its sensitivity to environmental change be considered when estimating riverine ghgs in the yangtze river in light of our study future control of ghg emissions from large rivers may largely depend on how external inputs and internal metabolism are regulated by decreasing nutrient loading keywords greenhouse gases yangtze river dissolved concentrations spatial pattern wetland oxygen data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rivers are important players in the global budgets of long lived greenhouse gases ghgs acting as an active pipe responsible for a disproportionately large amount of carbon and nitrogen processing emission and export from land to ocean bernhardt et al 2022 cole et al 2007 kroeze et al 2005 stanley et al 2022 it is estimated that aquatic carbon can offset 12 590 of the terrestrial net ecosystem productivity among different types of ecosystems webb et al 2019 global rivers are estimated to produce 0 18 0 28 of the emitted n2o globally maavara et al 2019 with higher n2o emission fluxes in temperate and subtropical rivers hu et al 2016 omitting aquatic components in large scale ghg budgets may overestimate the magnitude of carbon and nitrogen storage in terrestrial ecosystems beaulieu et al 2011 crawford et al 2014 however the estimates of ghg emissions from rivers are extremely uncertain due to the highly skewed spatial distributions of the river datasets liu et al 2022 maavara et al 2019 stanley et al 2022 large rivers in sub tropical regions are recognized as important contributors of ghgs due to large surface area and higher rate of emissions per unit area compared to temperate ecosystems borges et al 2015b hu et al 2016 raymond et al 2013 these large rivers are however still under represented in global datasets particularly with respect to direct measurements of concentrations and fluxes borges et al 2015a raymond et al 2013 regnier et al 2013 rivers in agricultural and urban area generally have higher ghg emissions beaulieu et al 2011 borges et al 2018 hu et al 2016 wang et al 2017 given the great importance of sub tropical rivers in the global river surface area these rivers are presumably vital in the global ghg budgets but the origins and controls over the fate of these ghgs are still poorly understood the paucity of available data coupled with poor ecological understanding of the underlying processes precludes us from predicting ghg spatial variability across the large river scale bussmann et al 2022 crawford et al 2017a active gas transfer low solubility and elusive origins are responsible for the uncertainty of ghg concentrations and emissions from river networks marzadri et al 2021 stanley et al 2016 identifying the role of large rivers in regional and global ghg budgets necessitates an understanding of the linkages between riverine ghgs and catchment characteristics since the rivers are fueled by c production and stocks from upland terrestrial and wetland borges et al 2015b hotchkiss et al 2015 in particular given that approximately half of the global surface area of wetlands is located in the sub tropics rivera monroy et al 2011 mobilized nutrients and organic matter potentially enhance the breakdown of terrestrially derived organic carbon oc by heterotrophic river microbes ward et al 2016 meanwhile in a highly disturbed large river gross primary production gpp may exceed aerobic respiration leading to co2 deficient crawford et al 2016 ch4 is considered to be modulated by different biophysical controls than co2 rovelli et al 2022 although it is clear that excess n inputs from fertilizer and wastewater treatment plants clearly prompted n2o concentrations the controls of the biogeochemical processes producing n2o in lotic systems are still not well understood in this study we selected the yangtze river to investigate the large scale spatial patterns of dissolved ghgs along the river the yangtze river is the world s largest subtropical river confronting intensive human activities during recent decades it has received widespread attention with respect to ghgs in three gorges dam tgd at various spatial and temporal scales zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2013 and fluvial carbon export from the estuary wu et al 2007 zhang et al 2008 yet studies that addressed how hydrological and biological controls shift through the length of the yangtze river with consequences of ghg variations are lacking the river which flows from the tibetan plateau into the sea is characterized by a large gradient in hydromorphological and biogeochemical configuration which provides an ideal system to disentangle the mechanisms regulating large scale patterns accordingly we asked what are the patterns and controls of dissolved ghgs throughout the yangtze river to answer this we conducted a sampling campaign in the yangtze river to collect measurements of ghg concentrations and supporting water chemistry parameters and integrated the results with hydromorphological attributes across the upper middle and lower reaches we address our question by 1 generating a spatial dataset of dissolved ghg concentrations 2 examining the relationships between ghg concentrations and potential drivers to understand and predict spatial trends of ghgs and 3 gaining insights into the role of different sources of ghgs at the large river scale 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and sampling overview the yangtze changjiang river basin is located in a subtropical zone with an average annual precipitation of 1100 mm precipitation between may and october accounts for 70 90 of the annual total the yangtze river is a large river that rises in the qinghai tibetan plateau and flows through the sichuan basin the three gorges reservoir and the middle lower yangtze plains into the east china sea total length 6300 km catchment area 1 8 106 km2 average annual discharge 960 km3 yr 1 entering the sea according to the topographic settings the mainstem of the yangtze river can be divided into three reaches the reach upstream of yichang the reach between yichang and hukou and the reach downstream of hukou flowing through the low gradient yangtze plain fig 1 a the catchment is densely populated and the river serves as the water resource for one third of china s population throughout the catchment there is a conversion of land cover from forest to urban and grassland fig 1b major city clusters along water courses are chongqing wuhan and nanjing which are located in the upstream midstream and downstream of the yangtze river respectively fluvial export of water sediment carbon and dissolved solutes has been affected by human disturbance and climate change the discharge of yangtze river is monitored at 13 gauging stations by the yangtze river conservancy commission ministry of water resources china water discharge of large tributaries flowing into the yangtze river was also monitored at gauging stations our study was conducted in the mainstem and tributaries of the yangtze river the samples were taken downstream from october 17th to november 4th 2020 using a synoptic survey approach in which geomorphological characteristics land cover information and water physical and chemical parameters were acquired 145 samples were selected from the upper middle and lower reaches of yangtze river basin with 76 sites from the mainstem and 69 sites from tributaries the sampling locations were mainly accessed by bridges and boats otherwise by the shore in the situation of no bridge and cruise to examine the effect of tributaries the sample sites were assigned at the outlets of tributaries and up and downstream in the mainstem the downstream sampling sites were located where tributaries and mainstem were well mixed 2 2 water chemistry and gas concentration analysis in situ water temperature specific conductivity ph and dissolved oxygen were determined using a multi parameter portable meter hach h40d usa water samples were collected in duplicate and filtered on site using 0 45 μm filters in 50 ml polyprophylene bottles for laboratory measurement samples for nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 and dissolved total phosphorus dtp concentrations were stored at 4 c for later lab analysis alkalinity was determined by titrating 50 ml filtered water with 0 01 m h2so4 solution after sampling at a precision of 6 within 24 h no3 and nh4 were determined using the ion chromatography method dionex ics 900 dionex usa and the automated phenate method respectively calibration curves were produced using reference samples according to quality control standards and were then applied to evaluate data from each set of samples reagents procedural blanks and samples were measured twice in parallel with average values reported the relative standard deviations of replicates were calculated for all samples and found to be 5 0 no3 and nh4 concentrations were measured at precisions of 2 6 and 8 6 respectively dtp was determined by icp oes worsfold et al 2016 at precisions of 3 4 sample were analyzed at the center for physical and chemical analysis of the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research beijing china aquatic co2 ch4 and n2o concentrations were measured in duplicate using the headspace method 100 ml headspace was created with ambient air in a 250 ml glass reagent bottle filled with bubble free water headspace gas samples were then transferred to gas bag by a syringe and transported to our lab for measurement we analyzed our samples using cavity ring down spectroscopy crds picarro g2508 picarro usa certified calibration gases of 300 600 and 1000 ppm co2 in n2 were used for calibration for ch4 and n2o we used the purified n2 99 99 for zeroing check the replicate measurements were within 6 of the accepted standard for all three gases the co2 ch4 and n2o concentrations were measured at precisions of 300 ppb 7 ppb and 10 ppb respectively the detection limits of crds technology were reported by brannon et al 2016 using minimum detectable slopes the original ghg concentrations were then calculated according to the headspace ratio and equilibration temperature respectively we corrected co2 headspace results using measured alkalinity considering chemical equilibration of the carbonate system in the sample vials koschorreck et al 2021 details in si text s1 2 3 hydrology and geography delineation discharge q data for the study period were collected from the water resources monitoring report released by the yangtze river conservancy commission in october and november of 2021 elevation of the sampling sites was recorded with gps during sampling we delineated the basin boundary using the hydroatlas data linke et al 2019 sub basins at level of 7 were extracted to determine the variations of land covers along the yangtze river for the analyses of percentages of land covers we used the land cover information provided by the dataset of copernius global land service in 2019 https land copernicus eu global products lc land cover in our study area was classified into forest shrubs herbaceous vegetation cropland urban built up referred to as urban hereafter bare sparse vegetation inland water bodies and herbaceous wetland referred to as wetland hereafter the geodata maps were generated using qgis 3 18 qgis development team 2021 2 4 statistical techniques we firstly considered the spatial variability among upstream midstream and downstream by applying analysis of covariance anova to analyze the relationship between co2 and o2 saturation we calculated the excess saturation calculated from henry s law corrected for temperature with the rmr package moulton 2018 to assess whether the available set of variables offers reasonable predictions of ghgs we calculated linear correlations of ghg concentrations with water physiochemical variables as well as hydromorphological factors in the mainstream samples the generated predictors of ghg concentrations had significant multicollinearity figure s1 and such multicollinearity violates a key assumption of multiple regression models stepwise linear regressions were performed to identify key explanatory variables stepwise regressions can reduce the number of predictors to generate the most parsimonious linear regression models and avoid the effects of multicollinearity on model results log transformation was applied to the data to fulfill the requirement of normalized distribution in natural systems input predictors and outcome response are often nonlinearly correlated and predictors interact with each other resulting in weak explanation by simple linear regression to understand whether the potential nonlinear model can improve our ability to predict ghgs over linear regression in the yangtze river regression tree analysis of ghgs was performed with the rpart package therneau et al 2019 regression tree as a non linear regression method is able to explore the original data without prior assumption regression tree uses a tree like graph to map the observed predictor data to draw conclusions about the target response value the model iteratively divides data into two subgroups based on a threshold which distinctly makes two subgroups as different as possible by minimizing the variation sum of squares of the response variable within two groups de ath and fabricius 2000 we applied a 10 fold cross validation procedure to evaluate the performance on the datasets the most parsimonious regression tree was selected by pruning the tree when a split happens only if it decreases the error metric by a cost complexity factor of 0 001 we report the percent variation r square which was calculated as 1 minus the relative error venkiteswaran et al 2014 to describe the fit of the tree all statistical analyses were performed with r version 3 14 0 r core team 2021 the data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request 3 results 3 1 river characteristics the datasets contain a large range of flow distance the distance from estuary 0 2576 km and elevations 0 261 m fig 1 land covers changed remarkably with more urban land and less forest towards downstream most sub catchments have more than 40 of cropland the midstream reach had more wetlands than the other reaches table 1 water temperature during the sampling period averaged 19 4 with very limited variation 18 8 20 1 c specific conductivity ranged from 239 μs cm 1 in the lower reach corresponding to high discharge to 407 μs cm 1 in the upper reach corresponding to low discharge 85 of observations were undersaturated in o2 overall range 6 65 9 51 mg l 1 i e 76 105 of the saturation level o2 no3 and dtp concentrations have significant differences among three river reaches fig 2 with higher values in the lower reach of yangtze river due to relatively constant water temperature no significant correlation between water temperature and other water chemical parameters was found figure s1 3 2 ghgs and the spatial extent in the yangtze river and its tributaries we observed consistent supersaturation of three ghgs with respect to the atmosphere consequently the river was net sources of ghgs the median concentrations of dissolved co2 ch4 and n2o were 67 μmol l 1 0 25 μmol l 1 and 59 nmol l 1 respectively co2 and n2o varied among different river sections with higher values in the middle reach co2 and n2o shared similar spatial distributions such that upper and lower reaches had significant difference from the middle reach while there was no significant difference between the upper and lower reaches fig 3 for co2 and n2o the highest variability was found in the middle reaches in contrast ch4 variability was not significantly different between river reaches compared to the mainstem tributaries had higher ghg concentrations which fluctuated in a wider range fig 3 table s1 3 3 predictability of ghgs no significant correlations emerged between river lengths and ghg concentrations anova p 0 3 for all gases table s2 however the flow significantly predicted co2 and n2o at our sampling sites wetland and urban land among all land covers affected co2 and n2o with higher co2 and n2o concentrations in sub catchments that had higher percentages of wetland and urban areas o2 no3 and dtp were negatively correlated to co2 and n2o compared to co2 and n2o we only found ec and dtp as explanatory variables for ch4 with weak explanatory power co2 and o2 saturation varied considerably among different river sites all mainstream samples varied between over and under saturation of o2 with constant co2 supersaturation the river showed an offset relative to the 1 1 line fig 2 indicating that there was an external source of co2 uncoupled from o2 in the regression tree model the percentage of wetland coverage wetland was identified as the strongest predictor of co2 as wetland was the first and primary branch the tree has higher explanatory power r2 0 49 fig 4 a compared to stepwise linear regression with o2 no3 and wetland as predictors r2 0 32 p 0 001 table s3 extremely high co2 concentrations occurred when wetland exceeded 5 9 where sampling sites were mostly distributed in the middle reach wetland entered the regression tree a second time predicting higher co2 concentration at more than 2 2 of wetland percentage low wetland and low o2 had the lowest co2 concentrations ch4 concentrations were moderately predicted by o2 and co2 r2 0 31 fig 4b o2 explains much of the variability in ch4 which was high when o2 8 3 mg l 1 above 8 3 mg l 1 of o2 ch4 could be further split by co2 98 μmol l 1 in the tree regression model high ch4 was correlated with the combination of lower o2 8 3 mg l 1 and higher co2 98 μmol l 1 regression tree analysis improved the explanatory power compared to the multiple linear regression r2 0 19 p 0 001 table s3 co2 and dtp were chosen as predictors of n2o concentrations in the regression tree model which could explain 68 of the total variation fig 4c co2 marked the first and second split in the regression tree reflecting the important role of co2 on n2o here the performance of stepwise linear model is similar to the nonlinear regression table s3 in linear correlations n2o concentrations were significantly correlated to co2 with high explanatory power r2 0 59 p 0 001 table s3 4 discussion 4 1 spatial variation in ghg concentrations the magnitudes of our measured co2 concentrations are comparable to previous reported annual average ranges in the yangtze river 1235 and 1463 μatm from liu et al 2016 and ran et al 2017 which were calculated from alkalinity and ph those are also at the same magnitude as for high order rivers in the us and the global average estimate lauerwald et al 2015 liu and raymond 2018 observed ch4 and n2o concentrations were two and three orders of magnitude lower than co2 respectively ch4 concentrations in the mainstream were lower than the values reported by the small scale studies at the yangtze river estuary wang et al 2009 and three gorges reservoir bai et al 2022 likely due to stronger microbial activities at reservoirs and estuaries unlike other findings liu et al 2016 we did not observe a continuous gradient of increase or decrease of ghgs along the yangtze river in contrast co2 and n2o concentrations were higher in the middle reach than in the upper and lower reaches this is consistent with previous historical calculated co2 data which did not show a longitudinal trend along the mainstem of the yangtze river ran et al 2017 decline patterns of ghgs along rivers could be due to lower relative land water connection than a large volume of the downstream reach crawford et al 2013 hotchkiss et al 2015 higher co2 and n2o in fact are significantly linked to larger wetland coverage in the sub catchments of the middle reach of the yangtze river fig 4 the finding is in concert with many studies which concluded that riparian wetland is one of the major contributors of riverine ghgs borges et al 2019 leng et al 2021 mwanake et al 2019 teodoru et al 2015 gases from the upstream would have a limited effect on the downstream reach because ghg outgassing is usually fast compared to downstream transport crawford et al 2014 according to the gas transfer coefficient averaged k600 from chamber measurements of 9 1 m d 1 liu et al 2017 and channel hydraulic geometry averaged river depth of 5 2 m averaged flow velocity of 1 71 m s 1 in the yangtze river 95 of co2 in a given parcel of water would outgas within 84 km downstream with longer water residence time aquatic ch4 can be oxidized by methanotrophic bacteria leading to less ch4 downstream in large rivers the rapidly overturned water transport limited ch4 downstream due to outgassing and ch4 oxidation sawakuchi et al 2016 compared to other gases ch4 varied without clear large scale spatial patterns it is likely that ch4 is majorly derived from point sources that were subjected to strong localized control variance in ch4 at smaller spatial scales therefore may overwhelm any larger scale pattern crawford et al 2014 accordingly we could also infer that tgd is likely not the cause of higher ghgs in the middle reach since the effect of tgd can hardly be detected from the sites in the middle reach which are 40 790 km downstream figure s2 4 2 controls of spatial pattern of ghgs our results on ghgs concentrations from regression trees imply both nonlinear effects and complex interactions among variables in our case ghgs were better predicted using nonlinear regression trees than linear regressions fig 4 and table s3 suggesting the non linear model is capable of improving the predictive ability of the ghg concentrations land cover and dissolved oxygen appear to be key factors influencing spatial trends of dissolved ghgs in the yangtze river the regression tree of co2 concentrations shows that the prediction of co2 relies on the combination of wetland coverage and o2 high wetland coverage was clearly associated with highest co2 which suggests that direct or indirect inputs of co2 from adjacent wetland probably support a large part of riverine co2 abril et al 2013 good hydrologic connectivity of wetland therefore facilitates the contribution from terrestrial inputs during our sampling period the discharge was 1 25 times higher than the annual average discharge thus we assume that the river channel was well connected to riparian wetlands this is also supported by the positive correlation between co2 and discharge indicating high discharge promotes the inputs of ghgs although many studies have shown that agricultural land significantly contributes to aquatic ghgs due to elevated organic matter nutrients and sediments borges et al 2018 crawford et al 2017b peacock et al 2019 romeijn et al 2019 we did not observe the effect of agricultural land use on riverine ghgs it is likely due to relatively constant agricultural land use along the river table 1 given the evidence that urban land was positively correlated to ghgs we speculate that urban land contributes to riverine ghgs via increasing inputs from point sources no3 and dtp figure s1 previous studies suggest urban rivers have 2 4 times higher co2 fluxes and can be ch4 hotspots due to elevated sedimentation and nutrients wang et al 2018 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 oversaturated co2 in the yangtze river is sustained by not only external but also internal sources the negative relationships between co2 and o2 in the linear correlation analysis suggest control of riverine ghgs by metabolic linkage previous study found similar correlations which were primarily attributed to heterotrophic respiration of river organic carbon as an essential co2 contributor liu et al 2016 it should be noted however that the correlations do not necessarily imply in stream metabolic activity as external input derived from terrestrial soil respiration or groundwater can also provide the signal of low o2 and high co2 bernal et al 2022 while due to rapid gas exchange and modest contribution relative to huge river discharge the input from groundwater can rarely shape the co2 o2 correlations in large rivers independent of in stream metabolism liu et al 2021 vachon et al 2020 the contributions of internal production to riverine co2 varied among different studies liu et al 2016 stated that heterotrophic respiration constitutes 8 22 of excess pco2 in the yangtze river riverine internal respiration has been shown to account for 39 of the co2 emissions in large rivers of united states hotchkiss et al 2015 the strong negative relationship between o2 and co2 is indicative of the interaction between respiration and primary production that may occur in water column and adjacent wetland fig 4 borges et al 2015b hotchkiss et al 2015 the molar ratio 1 2 shown in fig 2 represents the expected relationship between o2 and co2 when aerobic reaction is responsible for much of the spatial variability in co2 concentrations our data generally fall to the right of this 1 1 line implying that there are additional sources of co2 beyond aerobic respiration this decoupling between co2 and o2 can be attributed to 1 the external co2 sources i e groundwater input and riparian wetland respiration bernal et al 2022 2 anaerobic processes for example denitrification and methanogenesis may also contribute to additional production of co2 aho et al 2021 chen et al 2015 crawford et al 2014 herreid et al 2021 and 3 carbonate buffering by conversion toward co2 from ionized forms hco3 and co3 2 stets et al 2017 our results show that o2 as a proxy of carbon processing and transporting is well representing co2 dynamics in rivers stets et al 2017 ch4 concentrations were surprisingly poorly predicted by water chemical variables and land covers even though ch4 was able to be split by o2 and co2 in the regression tree analysis fig 4b these proxies of internal production and external inputs had weak explanatory power suggesting a complex combination of factors governing ch4 however all the interactions between o2 and co2 in the nonlinear model fig 4b point to the conditions of ecosystem respiration er as a determinant of ch4 in the yangtze river the conditions that determine overall er including co2 production also determine ch4 production stanley et al 2016 another explanation for the unclear large scale spatial pattern is that fluctuation in ch4 concentrations can be subjected to strong localized control leng et al 2021 bussmann et al 2022 highlighted that river morphology and structures determine the variability of dissolved ch4 in large rivers besides this our data showed ch4 had no relationship with co2 or n2o positive correlations between co2 and ch4 would indicate both gases are largely controlled by organic matter degradation zhang et al 2021 positive correlation between ch4 and n2o was observed due to large inputs of untreated human waste zhang et al 2021 further negative correlation between both was reported in smith and böhlke 2019 because both gases respond differently to biogeochemical controls different response to no3 our results are perhaps not surprising as the contribution of anaerobic metabolism and biogeochemical controls shifts over space and time co2 derived from metabolism might probably happen in water column and surrounding wetland while ch4 production might be supported by fine organic matter rich sediments wilcock and sorrell 2008 nutrient enrichment can change the relative contributions of different respiratory pathways within fluvial systems as well as net ghg emissions resulting in unclear ratios among three gases stanley et al 2016 interestingly we found n2o concentrations were most strongly predicted by co2 in the mainstem of the yangtze river explaining 59 of its variation table s2 our positive relationship between co2 and n2o is in accordance with laini et al 2011 in lowland springs leng et al 2022 in the river network of the north china plain and venkiteswaran et al 2014 in agricultural streams but opposite to other studies that concluded with negative correlations teodoru et al 2015 the negative correlations were resulted from n2o removed by denitrification which was intensified by organic matter degradation in the sediments simultaneously producing co2 teodoru et al 2015 we infer our positive correlation between n2o and co2 is mainly due to processes favored by similar environmental conditions rather than the direct dependence of n2o on co2 the strong correlation of both gases is possibly the consequence of simultaneous transportation production and consumption of both gases both gases share common environmental predictors with similar explanatory power e g o2 wetland discharge in table s2 spatial patterns of co2 and n2o in rivers are believed to be attributed to the connectivity with wetlands borges et al 2019 one of the evidences is the dominance of wetlands in n2o variations when co2 is excluded from the predictors of n2o indicating wetlands are playing a significant role in regulating riverine n2o table s4 in addition to the wetland inputs the production of n2o as the same as co2 occurs in the hyporheic zone along groundwater flow paths and in the water column where o2 is low mwanake et al 2019 yang and lei 2018 respiration particularly at locations that receive large amounts of organic matter may deplete o2 and produce co2 facilitating denitrification in the hyporheic zone and contributing to the accumulation of excess ghgs in the water column similar relationships between co2 and n2o were observed in mwanake et al 2019 and dai et al 2008 being explained by nitrification via ammonium oxidizing bacteria producing co2 through h production it is reasonable that both nitrification and denitrification are contributing to n2o production through a coupled nitrification denitrification process which is favorable under suboxic conditions wrage et al 2001 in this process denitrifiers reduced no3 produced by aerobic nitrification leading to n2o production maavara et al 2019 quick et al 2019 in addition the optimum for a net n2o production by nitrification nitrifier denitrification and denitrification lies between a ph of 7 7 5 blum et al 2018 implying the net n2o production could be moderate in the river because of higher ph in our system table 1 we speculate there is no n limitation in our systems dissolved inorganic nitrogen no3 and nh4 was at high levels comparable to some agricultural rivers borges et al 2018 that could be the explanation for our weak negative correlation between n2o and no3 which is opposite to a series of studies that reported strong positive relationships between n2o and no3 beaulieu et al 2011 turner et al 2016 previous studies reported that n2o flux turner et al 2016 or yield silvennoinen et al 2008 increased with nitrate up to a certain point and then leveled off insignificant relationship between no3 and n2o was also observed in 9 of 12 african river borges et al 2015b and nitrogen enriched rivers in the chaohu lake basin yang and lei 2018 of note is that the model proposed by intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc which predicts riverine n2o flux by no3 with a single linear function is not sufficient the equation derived from average no3 n2o ratios default value of 0 0025 in shallow groundwater is widely applied to estimate the riverine n2o flux nevison 2000 syakila and kroeze 2011 thus we argue that the linear equation from the ipcc methodology to estimate riverine n2o needs to be applied with caution maavara et al 2019 venkiteswaran et al 2014 webb et al 2021 we recommend an improvement of the ipcc model by using a saturation model instead of flux model as the gas transfer process is not included apart from terrestrial inputs and in stream processing we considered tgd and tributaries had little effect on spatial patterns of ghgs in the mainstem of the yangtze river we have demonstrated that outgassing is a rapid process resulting in a profound effect limited to the vicinity of the reservoir figure s2 another evidence for the minor influence of the dam is the low relative importance of dam 6 28 table s4 on spatial variations of ghgs compared to other predictors wetlands and o2 from the results of nonlinear regressions ni et al 2022 reported the longitudinal variation before and after tgr with a finer spatial resolution where the ghg concentrations were increased by the reservoir itself and decreased by habitat modification downstream of the dam within tens of kilometers our closest sampling site downstream of tgd is 35 km away therefore tgd might have little impact from there on as a result the net change in ghg emissions directly caused by the tgr is unable to alter the overall ghg trends from the perspective of the entire yangtze river the dam has altered the riverine habitats downstream leading to essential changes in river topology and biogeochemical cycles the floodplain erosion is most potent after the three gorges dam and declines gradually downstream sun et al 2020 as a result the large wetland coverage in the middle reach could be an indirect effect of damming consequently the effect of damming on ghgs can be masked behind the information from wetland coverages the budgets of dissolved ghgs from tributaries were generally much lower than the budget of ghgs in the mainstem bussmann et al 2022 we modeled ghg budgets at the inflow of tributaries upstream and downstream across different river sections assuming conservative mixing text s2 and found the expected dilution of tributaries was lower than the measured budgets downstream figure s3 and table s5 it suggests that ghg import from tributaries is insufficient to remarkably affect the mainstream even though ghg concentrations in tributaries were higher considering lower relative discharge of the tributaries than that of the yangtze river tributaries only marginally affect the ghg concentrations the minor effect of tributaries to dissolved ghgs can also apply to other point sources with low volume high ghg inputs it also explains the unclear large scale pattern of ch4 since ch4 is mostly locally controlled 5 conclusions and implications our study provides the first systematic estimate of the longitudinal variability of greenhouse gases ghgs along the yangtze river and land cover and water biogeochemical impacts on three ghgs there are no continuous longitudinal gradients for ghgs the spatial trend of co2 was similar to that of n2o with higher values in the middle reach of yangtze river regression tree approach improves explanatory power over simple linear regression and is a step towards better integration and understanding of environmental predictors of riverine ghgs our results show that wetland and o2 drive the responses of co2 and ch4 meanwhile co2 is the best predictor of n2o concentration in the system which underscores the importance of identifying the correlations between ghgs and understanding the nature of such correlations for future prediction of ghgs we demonstrate that instead of the direct effect of three gorges dam and tributaries terrestrial influence and in stream metabolization dominate the spatial variations of ghgs the yangtze river is currently confronted by increase in precipitation and temperature birkinshaw et al 2017 with increased discharge and mobilization of oc in soils li et al 2018 these changes are altering the functioning of riverine ecosystems and appearing to have larger contribution of wetland ecosystem on co2 and n2o suggested by our study as suggested by richey et al 2002 that river and floodplain waters in the amazon basin maintain high co2 and constitute an important carbon loss we recommend to include wetland contribution in riverine ghg budgets and its response to environmental change eutrophication droughts etc for the estimates of riverine ghgs the yangtze river can play an important role of ch4 processes with more terrestrial inputs of organic carbon while the relationship between water temperature and ch4 concentration in streams and rivers is ambiguous stanley et al 2016 thus three gases may respond uniquely to global change and the variability needs to be captured in future studies by reduction of direct organic and nutrient inputs from wastewater treatment plants and farming management controlling eutrophication which is the key factor in regulating the organic matter cycling in the yangtze floodplain lakes zeng et al 2022 can help decrease aquatic ch4 and n2o emissions in such human dominated landscapes we acknowledge that our results are biased toward high flow conditions which may lead to an overestimation of dissolved ghg concentrations in the future repeated measurements over time time scale ranging from sub daily to seasonal are necessary to elucidate how spatial patterns in fluvial systems change it is a challenge to match the scales of observations to the scales of the drivers of ghg emissions the yangtze river is large and diverse with variations in c export and metabolism as such further detailed investigations on internal metabolism and gas transfer measurement are needed to capture the variability of multiple processes to obtain a more holistic understanding of ghg emissions in this important large river system we recommend to carefully account for the contribution of ghg emissions from large river systems considering the importance of large river feedback on climate change and the linkage of catchment land atmosphere and land ocean carbon exchange credit authorship contribution statement peifang leng conceptualization

1733,carbonate aquifers are critical for the health and well being of human communities despite considerable efforts on the structure of karst aquifers the variable and invisible flow paths or the vertical and spatial heterogeneity of karst systems remain too complex to be fully understood an artificially constructed small limestone aquifer with an extensive network of observation wells in the miyako island japan provides a unique opportunity to illustrate the vertical and spatial hydrological connectivity for water movement and storage water chemical data at two different depths over six years including electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do oxidation reduction potential orp major ions na k ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 δ18o and δ2h capture water mixing processes during groundwater recharge in the aquifer influenced by irrigation pumping and recharge by precipitations throughout drying and wetting cycles results suggest that the intensive weathering of coral limestone under the impact of agricultural fertilization as indicated by high ec values and high concentrations of ca2 and hco3 the high do and low orp values imply a lack of organic decomposition activity which is typical in the karst groundwater condition more importantly groundwater recharge in the small aquifer was found to be influenced by following three processes spatially both cl and no3 n indicate the large heterogeneity of water mixing as rainfall or drainage water percolates differently to various parts of the aquifer vertically there are apparent differences in the concentration of cl and no3 n between the top and bottom layers in several wells suggesting that even within a single well the vertical profile can be weakly connected between the top and the bottom layers the bottom layer should have been recharged by lateral water inflow from fractures or conduits and thirdly the even distribution of cl over the long precipitation season from october 2016 and march 2021 and another nearly even distribution of no3 n in the low fertilization season in march 2021 demonstrate that the aquifer system is basically connected and porous in summary the insights gained from our study reveal that 1 coral limestone can be treated as a well developed porous aquifer and 2 the hydrological connectivity is highly heterogeneous and influenced by rock properties including formation structure degree of weathering and clay content such findings are essential for understanding the hydrogeological properties of coral limestone aquifers globally keywords artificial aquifer percolation surface water

understanding the hydrogeological structure and hydraulic heterogeneity of karst systems is important not only for water resources management dausse et al 2019 dreiss 1989 but also for pollutant contamination control kalhor et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 geo engineering applications jiang et al 2022 wang et al 2021 and carbon capture and storage ccs yang et al 2020 in spite of the efforts made to understand the structure and heterogeneity of karst aquifers flows in the matrices fractures and minute conduits are still too difficult to characterize in the natural subsurface due to challenges with direct observations and measurements barbel périneau et al 2019 there are some emerging methods used in recent researches in observing the structure of karst aquifers for example by yang et al 2020 using x ray microtomography in direct detection and lukač reberski et al 2022 using eocs as new tracers in understanding karst structures however these methods still have certain limitations in terms of research scale and popularity on the other hand there have been many different traditional methods including geophysical techniques hydrometric monitoring environmental tracers and hydrochemicals can still be effective in monitoring groundwater recharge processes in establishing how recharge and water percolation are taking place in the internal structure of the karst systems chen et al 2018 gonzález ramón et al 2020 leopold et al 2021 and in determining the connections of the sub units through the widely distributed conduits and fractures after flooding or recession stage jódar et al 2020 joshi et al 2018 poulain et al 2018 zhao and wang 2021 for instance geophysical techniques such as ground penetrating radar gpr abotalib et al 2019 mount and comas 2014 and electrical resistivity tomography ert leopold et al 2021 meyerhoff et al 2014 torrese 2020 are being used to image the spatial variability of porosity and geological structure in a karst aquifer in detail gpr is a promising technology that uses pulses of electromagnetic waves to image the subsurface and identify aquifer water and ert is a technique to image the belowground subsurface structure using differences in measured electrical resistivity at the surface however these surface geophysical methods often have certain limitations on site conditions and are susceptible to the complexity of underground topography ducut et al 2022 they often face challenges in exploration depth because residual clays attenuate the electromagnetic signal close to the surface leopold et al 2021 and the spatial resolution decreases with the depth of the investigation tsourlos et al 2011 while geophysical methods show their high potential in physically analyzing the structure including connectivity conduits and fractures of the karst system traditional water chemical methods such as natural chemicals and stable water isotopes can still provide reliable tools in understanding the karst structures by tracing sources of the water flow and the mixing processes qin et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 for instance as a natural chemical tracer cl is generally stable in aqueous solutions and readily infiltrates from the surface into the subsurface or migrates in aquifers lax et al 2017 can be used to trace the water mixing pathways chen et al 2020 another chemical tracer no3 could be considered as relative stable in karst aquifers perrin et al 2007 since unsaturated zones in karst aquifers can be viewed as oxidative systems ford and williams 2007 and denitrification processes require reducing conditions mudarra et al 2014 moreover the denitrification process is generally weak as groundwater flows rapidly from recharge to discharge areas howard 1985 on the other hand no3 is not released during rock weathering chen et al 2020 stable isotopes δ18o δ2h of fresh groundwater can reflect the mixing process of earlier and new water in catchments chen et al 2018 owing to the condensation of isotopes in the evaporation processes isotope studies also substantially increased our understanding on detailed hydrological flow paths and mixing processes in the critical zone ala aho et al 2018 these methods provide valuable potentials in detecting the connectivity and heterogeneity of karst system considering all this the utilization of natural chemical tracers together with stable isotopes could potentially help us to understand the infiltration percolation and mixing processes to further facilitate the characterization of the complex structure in the karst aquifers 1 2 objective in this study a continuous 7 years field survey was conducted to investigate and monitor the subsurface hydrological characteristics and karst aquifer structure in an artificially built aquifer or groundwater pool in miyako island of japan water chemistry in combination with δ2h and δ18o isotopes were used to improve the hydrogeological understanding of karst aquifers for better aquifer management unlike earlier studies which were either located in large mountainous areas or laboratory testing sites our study in a catchment as small as 7 2 km2 with a dense 42 wells provides a unique and valuable possibility for the observation of the detailed percolation and mixing processes of rainwater and groundwater in different aquifer layers and to explain the horizontal and vertical heterogeneities of the karst system from timely cycle of water chemicals thus the objective of the study is to visualize the structure of the karst aquifer by analyzing changes in water chemistry and stable isotopes during drying and wetting processes of the aquifer under irrigation and heavy rainfall results has potential implications for deepening our understanding of hydrogeological properties of the limestone aquifers globally 2 site description and methods 2 1 site description the study was carried out in miyako island 24 47 6 n 125 16 7 e in the western pacific ocean japan it has a subtropical marine climate with a mean annual temperature of 23 3 c and precipitation of 2105 4 mm the precipitation mostly falls from may to september many parallel geological faults are distributed in the island from the northwest to the southeast and the geological structure shows cuesta inclined toward the west ishida et al 2003 nishigaki et al 2004 the bedrock forms underground valley shaped structures between faults and groundwater flow can be easily restricted by constructing cut off wall in these valleys ishida et al 2015 the study was done in sunagawa catchment of the island with an area of 7 2 km2 fig 1 it is a natural catchment where the hills of both sides of the catchment allows outflow of water at only the mouth to the sea at the bottom of the valley the porous coral deposit creates a water rich aquifer beneath the shallow lateritic clay soil layer 0 3 1 m for agriculture in 1993 an artificial subsurface dam of 1677 m long was constructed to slow down the rapid discharge of groundwater to the sea and to form a groundwater pool or artificial aquifer in the porous coral limestone on the top of the impermeable mudstone bedrock the concrete body of the dam is 50 m in height but since some of the concrete body is buried in the impermeably mudstone rock groundwater exceeding 31 m in elevation will cause water overflow from the top of the dam in an earlier geological study on the island nakamori 1982 classified limestone rock profile into three categories coral limestone on the top coral algal ball limestone in the middle and detrital limestone in the bottom layer the ryukyu limestone has a good water permeability with an average hydraulic conductivity of 3 54 10 3 m s imaizumi et al 1988 still where the lateritic clays have flowed into the pores of the limestone its permeability is decreased ishida et al 2003 groundwater wells were drilled to pump water from the aquifer for agricultural irrigation the texture of the aquifer is highly variable even in the same sample column as shown in fig 1 c the strong heterogeneity in the rock cores is easily observable years of weathering have also resulted in the formation of conduits and fractures except for crop evapotranspiration especially sugarcane most of the rainwater penetrates underground into the aquifer thus surface runoff or streams are rarely observable noma 1992 miyakojima city office 2014 the fluctuation of water table is driven by irrigation water abstraction in the dry season and precipitation recharge in the wet season this makes it possible to observe heterogenetic recharge processes and coral deposition structure through analysis of water level and chemical content in the horizontal and vertical directions the land use map in fig 1 b showed that 75 1 of the study area is farmland of which more than 80 is sugar cane in an earlier study fujiie et al 2008 confirmed that nitrate in the aquifer mainly comes from leaching of ammonium fertilizers and manure which are not fully absorbable by crops ishida et al 2006 since the unsaturated soil is highly permeable and has a strong aerobic environment denitrification is unlikely to affect the nitrogen concentration in groundwater nakanishi et al 2001 the spatial distribution of pollution from agricultural non point sources is uneven making the effect of nitrogen from fertilizers on groundwater vary across different locations fig 2 shows the conceptual illustration of the sunagawa subsurface dam when irrigation is needed water from subsurface dams is pumped up through wells and once stored in farm ponds at the hills and then irrigated to farmland by sprinkler when the groundwater storage exceeds the capacity of the subsurface dam or when the water table exceeds 31 m groundwater will flow out to the sea for hydrochemical when groundwater pool is not full or water table is lower than the dam in dry periods ions can gradually accumulate but when groundwater pool is full water will flow over the dam and discharge into the sea and ion concentrations in the groundwater pool can be diluted 2 2 precipitation and water table data monthly rainfall data were collected in gusukube metrological station in miyako island from 2014 to 2021 managed by the japan meteorological agency website https www data jma go jp obd stats etrn index php for the same 2014 2021 period continuous water table data managed by the local land transformation office was collected in well s22 near the dam wall in each survey groundwater depth was also measured on site by water level gauge wl 100a alfa 2 3 groundwater sampling and analysis a total of 42 intensively distributed wells were used for groundwater sampling to determine geophysical variations of the karst aquifer through the differences in water chemical changes spatiotemporally along water table change groundwater surveys were carried out in november 2015 june and october 2016 june and october 2017 june and november 2018 and march 2021 water samples were taken at 5 m and 20 m depths below the water table using a reusable acrylic baler designed especially for groundwater sampling it was hard to get 20 m water sample from some of the wells because of the natural changes in topography among them sixteen wells from t1 to t15 and l3 were selected along a 3 3 km transect as a a transect in fig 1b of the catchment from upstream to downstream and used to determine the difference in groundwater recharge within the transect and between the top and bottom layers of the aquifer electrical conductivity ec was measured by a portable meter d 54 horiba dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured using a portable dissolved oxygen meter do 24p dkk toa and a handheld portable orp meter d 25 horiba all the water samples were taken back to laboratory in chiba university and filtered through the 0 2 μm filter before analysis major ions na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and no3 were analyzed by ion chromatography lc 10a series shimadzu japan total alkalinity hco3 was measured with alkalinity titration method on site using 0 01 n h2so4 since nitrate nitrogen can not only be used as a chemical tracer but also as an essential indicator of water pollution no3 was converted to nitrate nitrogen no3 n water stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h from 2017 to 2018 were simultaneously analyzed using a laser absorption water vapor isotope analyzer picarro l2130 i ca usa in the laboratory in sun yat sen university the reported accuracies for the instrument were respectively 0 5 and 0 1 for δ2h and δ18o international standard reference samples vsmow2 gisp and slap2 obtained from the international atomic energy agency iaea were used for calibration for spatial and vertical variability maps of the distribution of groundwater chemicals and isotopes ordinary kriging method was used to build the grid in surfer 16 software 2 4 long term observation wells to further clarify the difference in groundwater recharge water chemicals major elements are regularly monitored in 4 typical monitoring wells l1 to l4 at an interval of every two months from 2014 to 2020 groundwater samples were collected 5 m below the water table while rainwater samples near the typical wells were collected during the same period stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h both from groundwater and rainwater were tested from march 2016 to july 2018 the total phosphorus tp was measured by the molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method using a spectrophotometer tu1810 beijing persee 2 5 percolation theory and hydrological connectivity the theory of percolation was developed to deal with disordered solid variations in connectivity with isolated subunits or wells with surrounding subunits deutscher et al 1983 in this study degree of variation of ions and isotopes δ18o and δ2h influenced by the condensation or enrichment of irrigation water return and dilution of natural rainfall was used to illustrate the degree of connectivity between groundwater and surface water in a specific well and heterogeneity of connectivity in the karst aquifers for example in case of quick groundwater dilution from rainfall in a specific well or at a specific depth it thus indicates a strong connectivity or percolation in the specific well or depth with surface rainfall and on the other hand when groundwater is less influenced by rainfall or condensed water from irrigation water return the connectivity or percolation of the specific well with surface water is weak 2 6 data analysis descriptive statistics such as maximum minimum median and mean and standard deviation are used to provide a summary of the data the pearson correlation analysis was employed using spss to determine the relationship between ions 3 results 3 1 groundwater in response to precipitation and the dry wet cycle water table change in the artificial aquifer was mainly associated with irrigation water demand for crops such as sugarcane in the dry periods and rainfall recharge especially rainstorm during the frequent typhoons in the island based on the long term meteorological data for miyako island annual rainfalls for 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 were respectively 1557 1906 2751 5 1780 2395 2393 and 2695 5 mm with an annual average of 2 049 mm therefore 2014 2015 and 2017 were relatively dry years as in fig 3 there were 3 dry periods with strong groundwater depletion respectively in june 2014 to september 2015 january 2017 to august 2017 and march 2018 to june 2018 coincidentally our first survey was done in november 2015 near the lowest water table since then some 7 months of continuous rich rainfall caused rapid recovery of the water table to the height of the artificial dam before june 2016 although the water table dropped slightly due to summer irrigation it again reached full level at the time of the third survey as there was sufficient precipitation throughout the year due to low precipitation in 2017 the water table continued to decline in the first half of 2017 with a drop of 6 53 m after that period the water table was driven by typhoon and rose continuously to full level in 2018 the following year changes in precipitation and water table were similar the water table then stabilized after the end of 2018 till march 2021 thus analysis of the changes in the water chemistry specially focused on water declining and recovery processes before november 2018 the isopotential maps of the water table in each survey from november 2015 to march 2021 have been depicted in fig 4 the topographical changes of the impermeable stratum situated at the basement of the subsurface dam exhibit a gentle slope from the upstream in the eastern part to the downstream in the western sector fig 1b thus in low water table periods the groundwater primarily accumulates in the western reaches or the middle and downstream catchment regions in november 2015 the water table was the lowest in the entire field survey period and then it rose above 31 m cut off wall in june 2016 from june 2017 to june 2018 the water table was again below the dam it rebounded and remained at full capacity from november 2018 onwards 3 2 characteristics of groundwater chemicals the chemical characteristics of karst groundwater are not only controlled by factors such as geological conditions and hydrometeorological conditions in the region but also by human activities the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater can well preserve and retrieve such complicated influences the findings from a field survey as analyzed and depicted in fig 5 reveal the water chemistry including electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do oxidation reduction potential orp and major ions na k ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 it is apparent that the ec value surpasses that of the most natural water bodies in subtropical and humid region and indicates the intensive weathering of coral limestone under the impact of agricultural fertilization the ec values are negatively affected by precipitation displaying a peak value of 625 μs cm in november 2015 and a minimum value of 517 μs cm in november 2018 do and orp can be indicative for biological decomposition in water it can be observed that the do value in most periods were higher than 5 0 mg l and was sufficient for respiration of microorganisms in the groundwater the high do value suggests the missing of organic decomposition activity which is very natural in the karst groundwater condition similarly orp values were positive in all the survies and higher than 100 0 mv these results show that the aquifer is in aerobic rather than anaerobic environment among the major ions ca2 and hco3 are the two dominant ions in the groundwater strongly resulting from the weathering of coral limestone while ca2 varies from 13 0 to 118 9 mg l hco3 changes from 45 8 to 353 8 mg l 3 3 indication from difference of groundwater recharging in 4 typical wells 3 3 1 response of groundwater isotope to rainfall using groundwater wells l1 l2 l3 and l4 as example the difference in groundwater recharge in the karst aquifer was analyzed using δ18o and δ2h isotopes the calculated local meteoric water line lmwl from local rainwater is δ2h 9 2 δ18o 20 5 and its slope and intercept are both greater than those of the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 reflecting the warm and humid climate dai et al 2020 the analysis showed that the value of stable isotopes in four groundwater wells ranged within 6 0 to 3 0 for δ18o mean value of 4 9 and 34 6 to 4 3 for δ2h mean value of 26 4 fig 6 these values are very close to the lmwl however among the four groundwater wells l4 was very different firstly stable isotopes in wells l1 l2 and l3 were below lmwl or had slightly heavier than those in rainwater this showed that evapotranspiration slightly influenced the well water the stable isotopes in well l4 were much closer to lmwl or the local rainwater suggesting a much stronger influence or response to surface or rainwater next stable isotopes in wells l1 l2 and l3 especially l2 and l3 were very close showing low water exchange over the dry wet cycle and low responses or connectivity with surface water then stable isotopes in well l4 or even well l1 were scattered indicating strong rainwater influence these signals suggested that well l4 had the strongest groundwater and rainfall connectivity it has been demonstrated that stable isotopes are sensitive tracers to understand the degree of connectivity between groundwater and surface water and to determine spatial heterogeneity of groundwater recharge 3 3 2 response of groundwater chemicals to rainfall to further clarify the difference in groundwater recharge cl from l1 l2 l3 and l4 were again selected to see the concentration changes caused by the evaporative condensation over the dry season and dilution in the wet season from fig 7 a cl concentration in the well l1 remained high and with a small fluctuation within 26 7 41 7 mg l it did not vary greatly over the dry wet cycle in l2 cl concentration was in similar range of 22 1 41 5 mg l like stable isotopes the degree of fluctuation of cl concentration in l3 was small indicating low interaction with surface rainwater the characteristics of groundwater recharge to the three wells were similar driven by both evaporation in the dry season and rainfall in the wet season like δ18o and δ2h isotopes cl concentration in l4 was totally different from those in the other wells and much closer to local rainwater varying from 6 7 to 41 6 mg l it had been clearly illustrated that cl concentration in l4 had been fluctuating along with the condensation processes during the dry season and the dilution processes during the wet season again it suggested the strongest connectivity between surface water and groundwater in l4 fig 7 b shows seasonal dynamics of no3 n concentration in 4 wells in comparison with that in rainfall it can be observed that no3 n in rainfall is very low and hardly detectable in half of the monitoring period not like cl no3 n concentration variation is a little complex and driven by 3 processes including the fertilizer leaching effect from cropland the dilution effect of precipitation and the evaporative condensation from drainage water through irrigation the concentrations of no3 n in wells l1 l2 and l3 had similar trend with water table dynamics for the observation period although the concentrations of no3 n in the dry season were not so different from the other three wells well l4 had exactly the same trend of no3 n dilution over the wet season it again confirmed that the connection of l4 with surface rainfall was much stronger than the other wells like the performance of stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h no3 n concentration in l1 suggested that their connectivity with surface activities for instance fertilization is stronger than l2 and l3 3 3 3 water chemical characteristics in 4 typical wells table 1 lists the analyzed results of water chemicals including ec total phosphorus tp and major ions na k ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 from the field surveys the mean and standard deviation of the ions can again indicate the sensitive of groundwater to precipitation similar to cl and no3 n almost all the mean values of ions in well l4 are smaller than those of other wells especially ec ca2 and hco3 indicating that their strong connectivity with surface rainfall in addition the standard deviations of l4 are larger than those of the other wells further implying the non uniformity of groundwater recharge in the 4 wells like no3 n so4 2 in groundwater comes mainly from fertilizers it can be observed that mean value of so4 2 in well l1 l2 and l3 are respectively 20 8 19 1 and 22 6 mg l higher than that of 16 2 mg l in well l4 it is indicated that even though fertilizer leaching is the main source of so4 2 the effect of precipitation dilution can still be reflected in the ion concentration phosphorus a source from the mineralization of artificially added fertilizer often accumulates in the soil during the fertilization sharma et al 2013 however from the table 1 the tp in groundwater of sunagawa catchment is nearly zero indicating that groundwater has not been affected by the mineralization of organic phosphorus 3 4 heterogeneity from hydrochemical and isotope changes along the transection the lateral and vertical distribution of c1 concentration along the a a transect is potted in fig 8 after the first long dry spell that started in june 2014 c1 concentration peaked in november 2015 varied heterogeneously from upstream to downstream withing 30 2 59 2 mg l the maximum concentration 59 2 mg l occurred at the depth of 20 m in t8 in comparison well t5 had a lower c1 concentration than the surrounding wells then in june 2016 the transect c1 concentration was within 10 3 40 2 mg l this indicated that there was a rapid dilution across the entire transect compared with that in november 2015 for example a minimum of 10 3 mg l was observed at the 5 m depth in observation well t11 which was in the top layer also at the bottom of t5 and t8 there was a rapid groundwater recharge driven by both precipitation and irrigation a strong connectivity between surface water and the bottom layer rather than infiltrating through the top layer is suggested in october 2016 the c1 concentration in the transect was generally diluted and evenly distributed within the range of 21 1 31 0 mg l due to the low rainfall during the first 8 months of 2017 the mean c1 concentration increased from 26 9 mg l in october 2016 to 34 7 mg l in june 2017 the concentrations at two depths in well t9 were similar but lower than those in the other wells indicating that the vertical infiltration process may be faster than the lateral movement in the following two surveys the mean c1 concentrations across the transect in october 2017 and june 2018 were respectively 34 8 mg l and 35 0 mg l respectively similar to that for june 2017 likewise the cl concentration in well t9 in october 2017 has also been close to the rainfall on september 26 fig 8a note that for the survey periods with low precipitation cl concentrations in the midstream and downstream were lower than that in the upstream it suggested that the aquifers in the midstream and downstream had relatively fast recharge and strong connectivity with surface driven by rich precipitation since june 2018 the water table returned to its full level in august 2018 in november 2018 except for t14 and t15 with relative high cl concentration near the dam cl concentration along the transect was uniformly distributed in march 2021 the water table kept full while an extremely uniformed distribution of cl concentration with a mean value of 25 7 mg l can be observed fig 9 shows the lateral and vertical distributions of no3 n concentration along the a a transect through the local survey it was noted that chemical fertilizers mainly nh4 2so4 were irregularly but more frequently applied during the period from october to december in the catchment ishida et al 2015 nakanishi 2001 thus unlike cl changes in no3 n concentration were driven not only by natural dilution and evaporative processes but also by fertilizer application the range of lateral and vertical distributions of no3 n concentration was at 4 7 7 2 mg l and the mean value for november 2015 was 6 0 mg l this relatively high concentration had been caused by low precipitation recharge to groundwater during the dry period since june 2014 the maximum no3 n concentration of 7 2 mg l occurred at 5 m below the water table in an observation well t15 which is near the dam wall in june 2016 the range of no3 n concentration was 1 6 7 7 mg l with an average of 5 0 mg l compared with november 2015 it did not change much in the upstream and midstream but dropped significantly in the downstream it then suggested that there was dilution under high precipitation recharge for instance the minimum no3 n concentration of 1 59 mg l was 5 m below the observation well t11 like the case for cl it suggested that strong precipitation recharge existed and there was a good surface water connection with rainfall at that point in october 2016 no3 n concentration was distributed within 2 3 8 0 mg l with an average of 4 8 mg l there were low concentrations in wells t9 and t11 the mean no3 n concentration increased to 5 5 mg l in june 2017 and further to 5 8 mg l in october 2017 after over two years of the wet season mean no3 n concentration dropped to 4 2 mg l in march 2021 also the low fertilizer season overall in october 2016 there was strong groundwater recharge in well t9 t11 in june 2017 and in june and november 2018 both in june 2016 and october 2017 there was seemingly over 1 5 mg l difference in no3 n concentrations between the top and bottom layers in wells t5 and t11 showing a low connectivity between the top and bottom layers like what has been observed in cl concentration fig 10 shows the lateral and vertical distributions of δ18o and δ2h along the a a transect the value of δ18o in june 2017 october 2017 and june 2018 are 4 5 4 7 and 4 9 respectively equally the value of δ2h are respectively 22 4 24 7 and 25 3 showing a decreasing trend similar to c1 the value of δ18o and δ2h isotopes in well t9 in june 2017 are heavier than that of other surrounding wells which are close to the earlier rainfall event before the survey later in september 2017 the δ18o and δ2h values in rainfall are 9 6 and 70 0 respectively by comparison it can be found that the values in well t4 in october 2017 are lighter than that of other wells indicating high interaction with surface rainwater in well t4 3 5 heterogeneity of hydrochemical and isotope changes from spatio temporal analysis fig 11 shows the spatial distribution of cl in sunagawa catchment from november 2015 to march 2021 in november 2015 cl concentration was within 11 0 62 5 mg l and was mostly in the range of 30 0 40 0 mg l from november 2015 to october 2016 the mean concentration of cl declined from 37 7 mg l to 25 1 mg l with most wells falling below 30 0 mg l the minimum concentration was 8 0 mg l well s12 close to the rainwater concentration suggesting a very strong recharge in the wet season then it increased to 33 2 mg l in june 2017 indicating a mix with irrigation leaching water after evaporative condensation in the next three surveys the values of cl concentration gradually declined on average from 34 7 mg l to 26 6 mg l as presented in fig 11 there were several wells with different trends in groundwater recharge firstly the area near wells s6 and s7 in the midstream of the catchment had low cl concentration in november 2015 and october 2017 secondly the area around wells l4 t11 and s13 had extremely strong dilution in june 2016 specifically well l4 had significant dilution characteristics in october 2016 june 2017 and november 2018 then well s3 showed strong permeability to groundwater recharge in november 2018 in both october 2016 and march 2021 well s12 had much lower concentrations than other parts of the catchment and shown a strong influence from surface water rainfall and irrigation water leaching again like vertical change in cl concentration spatial variations in cl concentration suggested that wells near the dam or in the downstream area had much stronger recharge conditions irrespectively spatial variations in groundwater recharge in the small catchment of an area of 7 2 km2 were large and spatially heterogeneous very similar to cl concentration no3 n concentration decreased from 5 8 mg l in november 2015 to 4 3 mg l in october 2016 and then rose to 4 8 mg l in june 2017 and 5 3 mg l in october 2017 fig 12 after that it continued to decline from 5 3 mg l in june 2018 to 3 9 mg l in march 2021 through the rich precipitation period in comparison with cl no3 n concentration has been less regular indicating the strong effect from fertilizer application in general the average no3 n concentration was high due to leaching of over use of fertilizer especially during the dry season and can be diluted due to strong precipitation in the wet season at some special locations in well s6 a strong no3 n concentration was noted in most of the surveys except for the periods november 2015 and march 2021 also wells s13 s14 s17 s19 t4 t6 t14 t15 and s3 in the midstream region of the catchment had high no3 n concentration suggesting some effect of fertilizer application similar to cl several wells such as l4 t11 s13 in the downstream t9 in the midstream and s11 12 in the east were highly influenced by rainfall recharge all these wells suggested good connectivity with surface water systems fig 13 shows the spatial distribution of δ18o and δ2h in sunagawa catchment from june 2017 to june 2018 in june 2017 the value of stable isotopes ranged within 7 2 to 4 2 for δ18o and 47 1 to 9 5 for δ2h from june 2017 to june 2018 the average value of stable isotopes dropped from 5 0 to 5 4 and 26 7 to 29 4 for δ18o and δ2h respectively and then two values were increased to 5 1 for δ18o and 26 7 for δ2h in general δ18o and δ2h showed similar tendency in spatial compared to cl and no3 n the heterogeneity in isotopes was also observed in well s18 s19 well t8 and well l4 in june 2017 also several wells such as t1 s4 s12 and s18 had lighter isotope values than the other wells in october 2017 in general stable isotopes had a very similar distribution pattern to cl illustrating that these wells strongly correlate with surface rainwater 4 discussions 4 1 mixing and infiltration characteristics of karst aquifer from 4 typical wells the comparison of groundwater chemicals with isotopes from four wells l1 to l4 helped to clarify the mixing and infiltration characteristics for karst aquifer with different degrees of weathering the absence of correlation between stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h and cl suggests that evaporation has not been affecting the change of cl concentration in well l1 l2 and l3 fig 14 a and b therefore such low variation in stable isotopes and cl concentration shall be attributed to the slowly mixing of groundwater indicating that there is connectivity even not as strong as l4 in the wells the reason for the higher cl concentration is caused by the evapotranspiration effect when light rains or irrigated water evaporates from the land surface stanger 1986 then during heavier rain events the salt from previous light rain or irrigated water will re dissolve and infiltrated into the groundwater weyhenmeyer et al 2002 such repeated evapotranspiration precipitation cycles will result in the high cl concentrations in wells l1 l2 and l3 in comparison with rainwater on the other hand isotopic composition in groundwater is basically a slow mixing process of isotopes of a series of rain events since transpiration dominates in most of the sugarcane growth period and evaporation loss which cause heavier stable water isotopes is low jasechko et al 2013 such differences in condensation of cl concentration and mix of water isotopes partially explain the observed differences in chloride and stable isotopes in rainwater versus groundwater fig 14 in contrast in groundwater from well l4 the distribution of isotopes and cl is very similar to distribution of rain samples which clearly suggest the rapid infiltration of surface rainwater and the sensitive influence of rain events the groundwater nitrogen inputs in the sunagawa catchment may be derived from agricultural nitrogen leaching and condensed concentration from repeatedly use of irrigation water like cl for instance previous studies shown that groundwater nitrate levels were significantly affected by the amount of fertilization applied to the farmland fujiie et al 2008 ishida et al 2017 and nitrogen leaching from sugarcane land mainly occurred in the rainy season from april to june okamoto et al 2020 and fertilizer application season from october to december nakanishi 2001 the results in groundwater wells l1 to l3 showed no correlation between no3 n and isotopic composition fig 14c and d in fig 7b there is no significant seasonal variation found both of the two figures indicated that the slow mixing of no3 n in wells l1 to l3 with surface water owing to their poor weathering property and low hydrological conductivity in contrast in well l4 the similar distribution between isotopes and no3 n in groundwater and rainwater fig 14c and d suggest nitrate in l4 is strong recharged by either high no3 n water after fertilization application or rainwater ishida et al 2006 also reported that water with a low concentration of nitrate nitrogen penetrates into the ground during heavy rain caused by passing typhoons etc and dilution causes a temporary decrease in the concentration of nitrate nitrogen in the groundwater in general the different behaviors at well l4 compared with those at wells l1 l2 and l3 were due to the strong infiltration properties of the surrounding coral rocks the observed correlation between no3 n and cl fig 14e and f can provide information to distinguish the effect of mixing and dilution process on nitrate as a conservative ion in aquifer environments cl can be used as an indicator in most settings to determine surface water and groundwater mixing coluccio and morgan 2019 and nitrate are often used to assess the impact of agricultural activities on groundwater henson et al 2017 in this study the sources of cl and no3 n are the same as mentioned above cl comes from rainfall while no3 n mainly comes from fertilizer in the water samples studied here there was a generally positive correlation spearman s ρ 0 83 in well l4 which indicates that the change in no3 n concentration is mainly driven by dilution process or rapid infiltration however in other wells l1 to l3 although no3 n showed a trend of increasing with the increase of cl the correlation between the two is very small indicating that no3 n in these wells is mainly affected by agricultural activities and groundwater mixing process and secondary by dilution process 4 2 groundwater connectivity indicated from spatial and vertical observations karst aquifers are the most complex groundwater systems due to their high degree of heterogeneity ford and williams 2007 worthington and ford 2009 and thus required a better understanding of the karst structure wang et al 2022 hydrochemical and stable isotopes have been proven to be effective in investigating the heterogeneity of the karst medium and groundwater flow systems qin et al 2017 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b to evaluate these unsolved points water sampling from intensive distributed groundwater wells is needed however in many countries long term groundwater monitoring networks in such conditions is lack jasechko and perrone 2021 fortunately in our study 42 intensively distributed wells in a 7 2 km2 small catchment were taken to investigate and understand the differentiations on the hydrological properties of the subsurface karst system the spatial and temporal variations of water chemistry along with rainfall recharge and evaporation condensation processes nearly visibly illustrate the connectivity of groundwater with rainwater drainage water and fertilizer use and help us intuitively understand the complexity of the karst system in the a a transect 16 wells in 3 3 km at two depths vertically demonstrated the heterogeneity of groundwater recharge or degree of connectivity between groundwater and surface from fig 8 wells t5 and t9 t11 were in the zone which is highly influenced or connected with rainwater and drainage water percolation a similar quick percolation zone is depicted in fig 9 next cl and no3 n concentrations in the top and the bottom layers of well t5 and t11 were different for instance cl and no3 n concentration in t5 in june 2016 and october 2017 in the bottom layer was lower than that in the top layer it is therefore suggested that there is a weak connectivity between the two layers and possibly a direct percolation path fracture flow from the soil surface to the bottom layer on the other hand the recharge rate of the top layer of well t11 was higher than that of the bottom layer suggesting weak connectivity from the top to the bottom layer spatial changes in cl and no3 n also suggested the sensible wells to chemical changes and having good connectivity with surface water these wells were t5 s6 s7 l4 t11 s13 and s12 figs 11 and 12 since the chemical concentration of rainwater was lower than that of groundwater cl concentration clearly showed gradual dilution and then condensation along the wet dry cycle however the concentration of no3 n suggested a different trend while changes in no3 n in wells t5 s6 s7 l4 t11 s13 and s12 remained sensitive to rainfall the effect of fertilizer use in agriculture on no3 n was obvious for instance for well s6 no3 n concentration changed from low in november 2015 to relatively high over the observation period suggesting a strong effect of fertilize application in sugarcane plantation ishida et al 2017 overall comparing with no3 n chloride is a better tracer in understanding the processes of percolation kirchner et al 2000 neal and rosier 1990 schmidt et al 2013 since it is only influenced by natural hydrological cycle such as dilution from precipitation and condensation from evaporation temporal analysis of water isotopes δ18o δ2h cl and no3 n also suggested strong connectivity of surface water with groundwater in l4 evident in effects of rainfall and fertilize use on the water quality well l4 was also close to wells t11 and s13 suggesting strong connectivity with surface water 4 3 percolation theory and heterogeneity of karst system in coral limestone the theory of percolation was first introduced to describe the penetration of fluids in porous media berkowitz and balberg 1993 or in amorphous solids in the field of physics and not in hydrology if a fluid flows through a medium which is itself in some sense disordered or random the flow through the system may be described as a so called percolation process with changes in connectivity under isolated subunits deutscher et al 1983 in the case of sunagawa catchment it is like the changes in connectivity between different wells and different well depth with surrounding units the first lesson that can be learned from our study is that the coral limestone is a disordered porous system the even distribution of cl on october 2016 and march 2021 and nearly even distribution of no3 n in the low fertilizer season in march 2021 show that the whole aquifer system is connected and water in the aquifer has the potential to be well mixed even in a slow rate like l2 and l3 the coral limestone aquifer can be explained as a kind of porous media following percolation theory with percolation from surface to groundwater and from strong connectivity parts to low connectivity parts past studies have shown that the porosity of coral reef limestone is much higher than that of carbonate rocks like limestone and dolomite zhenget al 2020 similarly larson and mylroie 2018 mentioned that eogenetic carbonate rocks retain much of their original depositional porosity in the oil industry carbonate rocks formed mainly in biotic or in the shallow marine environment with less geological burial similar to miyako island are porous and good for the storage of oil and gases dasgupta and mukherjee 2020 in other word the structure of coral limestone is porous which is very different from continent limestone with water flow mainly through conduits or holes the second lesson learn from our study is the strong heterogeneity of the connectivity or hydrological conductivity in the aquifer system in our study the large difference in water quality between the top and the bottom layer in wells t5 and t11 indicated the low or impermeability of the two layers it is inferred that there exists preferential flow through fractures or conduits from the neighboring units or rather than the top layer in fig 1c the difference for water permeability in different rocks should very variable for instance the detrital limestone should have much stronger permeability to determine places for highly productive wells mori et al 1997 studied the rock properties in the catchment and noted that clay content in the pore spaces of coral limestone strongly influenced the hydraulic conductivity and water yield of the wells therefore there exists a strong heterogeneity both spatially and vertically depending on at least clay content and carbonic rock properties from porous permeable and well connected rocks to less or impermeable rocks recent studies in chalk aquifers similar to coral limestone by cao et al 2020 and chen et al 2019 through water and solute migration also exhibit strong heterogeneity in the distribution of matrix flow fracture flow and conduit flow formed through the long historical water weathering process vialle et al 2014 in summary it can be seen that the coral limestone aquifer is much like a soil body rather than continent limestone with a strong spatial and vertical heterogeneity or a mixture of sandy parts with high water percolation and clay parts with weak water percolation but still hydraulically connected with the surrounding units 5 conclusions in summary this study shows that coral limestone is different from most carbonate rocks which is highly dependent on the hardly predictable dilution conduits as a water flow path coral limestone with less historical and geological burial is basically a porous and well permeable aquifer system like detrital limestone it is also highly heterogeneous and influenced for instance by the low connective units formed in rock property content of carbonate mud formed in the dead green algae dasgupta and mukherjee 2020 and intrusion of clay particles from soil and by highly connected units or preferential pathways such as conduit fractures highly porous units and gravels in general groundwater recharge in coral limestone aquifers follows percolation theory such a finding shall be important in deepening our understanding of the hydrogeological structure of coral limestone aquifers globally it is also worthwhile to mention that with proper human interference such as dam construction like what has been done in sunagawa catchment highly productive and porous carbonate rock systems can provide a perfect aquifer media for rainwater harvesting and groundwater storage in large number of remote islands facing the growing challenge of island water supplies under climate change leoni et al 2021 thomas et al 2020 studies on the geological structure of the island limestone system to increase its

1733,carbonate aquifers are critical for the health and well being of human communities despite considerable efforts on the structure of karst aquifers the variable and invisible flow paths or the vertical and spatial heterogeneity of karst systems remain too complex to be fully understood an artificially constructed small limestone aquifer with an extensive network of observation wells in the miyako island japan provides a unique opportunity to illustrate the vertical and spatial hydrological connectivity for water movement and storage water chemical data at two different depths over six years including electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do oxidation reduction potential orp major ions na k ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 δ18o and δ2h capture water mixing processes during groundwater recharge in the aquifer influenced by irrigation pumping and recharge by precipitations throughout drying and wetting cycles results suggest that the intensive weathering of coral limestone under the impact of agricultural fertilization as indicated by high ec values and high concentrations of ca2 and hco3 the high do and low orp values imply a lack of organic decomposition activity which is typical in the karst groundwater condition more importantly groundwater recharge in the small aquifer was found to be influenced by following three processes spatially both cl and no3 n indicate the large heterogeneity of water mixing as rainfall or drainage water percolates differently to various parts of the aquifer vertically there are apparent differences in the concentration of cl and no3 n between the top and bottom layers in several wells suggesting that even within a single well the vertical profile can be weakly connected between the top and the bottom layers the bottom layer should have been recharged by lateral water inflow from fractures or conduits and thirdly the even distribution of cl over the long precipitation season from october 2016 and march 2021 and another nearly even distribution of no3 n in the low fertilization season in march 2021 demonstrate that the aquifer system is basically connected and porous in summary the insights gained from our study reveal that 1 coral limestone can be treated as a well developed porous aquifer and 2 the hydrological connectivity is highly heterogeneous and influenced by rock properties including formation structure degree of weathering and clay content such findings are essential for understanding the hydrogeological properties of coral limestone aquifers globally keywords artificial aquifer percolation surface water groundwater connection heterogeneity water chemistry data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction 1 1 background groundwater resources in carbonate aquifers are critical to the health and well being of current and future island communities beal et al 2019 han et al 2015 karst aquifers are heterogeneous with pore spaces of different sizes geometries and connections murad et al 2020 and differ from other forms of aquifer by the complexity of geological structure hydrodynamic behavior and hydro chemical condition chang et al 2017 lorette et al 2018 understanding the hydrogeological structure and hydraulic heterogeneity of karst systems is important not only for water resources management dausse et al 2019 dreiss 1989 but also for pollutant contamination control kalhor et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 geo engineering applications jiang et al 2022 wang et al 2021 and carbon capture and storage ccs yang et al 2020 in spite of the efforts made to understand the structure and heterogeneity of karst aquifers flows in the matrices fractures and minute conduits are still too difficult to characterize in the natural subsurface due to challenges with direct observations and measurements barbel périneau et al 2019 there are some emerging methods used in recent researches in observing the structure of karst aquifers for example by yang et al 2020 using x ray microtomography in direct detection and lukač reberski et al 2022 using eocs as new tracers in understanding karst structures however these methods still have certain limitations in terms of research scale and popularity on the other hand there have been many different traditional methods including geophysical techniques hydrometric monitoring environmental tracers and hydrochemicals can still be effective in monitoring groundwater recharge processes in establishing how recharge and water percolation are taking place in the internal structure of the karst systems chen et al 2018 gonzález ramón et al 2020 leopold et al 2021 and in determining the connections of the sub units through the widely distributed conduits and fractures after flooding or recession stage jódar et al 2020 joshi et al 2018 poulain et al 2018 zhao and wang 2021 for instance geophysical techniques such as ground penetrating radar gpr abotalib et al 2019 mount and comas 2014 and electrical resistivity tomography ert leopold et al 2021 meyerhoff et al 2014 torrese 2020 are being used to image the spatial variability of porosity and geological structure in a karst aquifer in detail gpr is a promising technology that uses pulses of electromagnetic waves to image the subsurface and identify aquifer water and ert is a technique to image the belowground subsurface structure using differences in measured electrical resistivity at the surface however these surface geophysical methods often have certain limitations on site conditions and are susceptible to the complexity of underground topography ducut et al 2022 they often face challenges in exploration depth because residual clays attenuate the electromagnetic signal close to the surface leopold et al 2021 and the spatial resolution decreases with the depth of the investigation tsourlos et al 2011 while geophysical methods show their high potential in physically analyzing the structure including connectivity conduits and fractures of the karst system traditional water chemical methods such as natural chemicals and stable water isotopes can still provide reliable tools in understanding the karst structures by tracing sources of the water flow and the mixing processes qin et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 for instance as a natural chemical tracer cl is generally stable in aqueous solutions and readily infiltrates from the surface into the subsurface or migrates in aquifers lax et al 2017 can be used to trace the water mixing pathways chen et al 2020 another chemical tracer no3 could be considered as relative stable in karst aquifers perrin et al 2007 since unsaturated zones in karst aquifers can be viewed as oxidative systems ford and williams 2007 and denitrification processes require reducing conditions mudarra et al 2014 moreover the denitrification process is generally weak as groundwater flows rapidly from recharge to discharge areas howard 1985 on the other hand no3 is not released during rock weathering chen et al 2020 stable isotopes δ18o δ2h of fresh groundwater can reflect the mixing process of earlier and new water in catchments chen et al 2018 owing to the condensation of isotopes in the evaporation processes isotope studies also substantially increased our understanding on detailed hydrological flow paths and mixing processes in the critical zone ala aho et al 2018 these methods provide valuable potentials in detecting the connectivity and heterogeneity of karst system considering all this the utilization of natural chemical tracers together with stable isotopes could potentially help us to understand the infiltration percolation and mixing processes to further facilitate the characterization of the complex structure in the karst aquifers 1 2 objective in this study a continuous 7 years field survey was conducted to investigate and monitor the subsurface hydrological characteristics and karst aquifer structure in an artificially built aquifer or groundwater pool in miyako island of japan water chemistry in combination with δ2h and δ18o isotopes were used to improve the hydrogeological understanding of karst aquifers for better aquifer management unlike earlier studies which were either located in large mountainous areas or laboratory testing sites our study in a catchment as small as 7 2 km2 with a dense 42 wells provides a unique and valuable possibility for the observation of the detailed percolation and mixing processes of rainwater and groundwater in different aquifer layers and to explain the horizontal and vertical heterogeneities of the karst system from timely cycle of water chemicals thus the objective of the study is to visualize the structure of the karst aquifer by analyzing changes in water chemistry and stable isotopes during drying and wetting processes of the aquifer under irrigation and heavy rainfall results has potential implications for deepening our understanding of hydrogeological properties of the limestone aquifers globally 2 site description and methods 2 1 site description the study was carried out in miyako island 24 47 6 n 125 16 7 e in the western pacific ocean japan it has a subtropical marine climate with a mean annual temperature of 23 3 c and precipitation of 2105 4 mm the precipitation mostly falls from may to september many parallel geological faults are distributed in the island from the northwest to the southeast and the geological structure shows cuesta inclined toward the west ishida et al 2003 nishigaki et al 2004 the bedrock forms underground valley shaped structures between faults and groundwater flow can be easily restricted by constructing cut off wall in these valleys ishida et al 2015 the study was done in sunagawa catchment of the island with an area of 7 2 km2 fig 1 it is a natural catchment where the hills of both sides of the catchment allows outflow of water at only the mouth to the sea at the bottom of the valley the porous coral deposit creates a water rich aquifer beneath the shallow lateritic clay soil layer 0 3 1 m for agriculture in 1993 an artificial subsurface dam of 1677 m long was constructed to slow down the rapid discharge of groundwater to the sea and to form a groundwater pool or artificial aquifer in the porous coral limestone on the top of the impermeable mudstone bedrock the concrete body of the dam is 50 m in height but since some of the concrete body is buried in the impermeably mudstone rock groundwater exceeding 31 m in elevation will cause water overflow from the top of the dam in an earlier geological study on the island nakamori 1982 classified limestone rock profile into three categories coral limestone on the top coral algal ball limestone in the middle and detrital limestone in the bottom layer the ryukyu limestone has a good water permeability with an average hydraulic conductivity of 3 54 10 3 m s imaizumi et al 1988 still where the lateritic clays have flowed into the pores of the limestone its permeability is decreased ishida et al 2003 groundwater wells were drilled to pump water from the aquifer for agricultural irrigation the texture of the aquifer is highly variable even in the same sample column as shown in fig 1 c the strong heterogeneity in the rock cores is easily observable years of weathering have also resulted in the formation of conduits and fractures except for crop evapotranspiration especially sugarcane most of the rainwater penetrates underground into the aquifer thus surface runoff or streams are rarely observable noma 1992 miyakojima city office 2014 the fluctuation of water table is driven by irrigation water abstraction in the dry season and precipitation recharge in the wet season this makes it possible to observe heterogenetic recharge processes and coral deposition structure through analysis of water level and chemical content in the horizontal and vertical directions the land use map in fig 1 b showed that 75 1 of the study area is farmland of which more than 80 is sugar cane in an earlier study fujiie et al 2008 confirmed that nitrate in the aquifer mainly comes from leaching of ammonium fertilizers and manure which are not fully absorbable by crops ishida et al 2006 since the unsaturated soil is highly permeable and has a strong aerobic environment denitrification is unlikely to affect the nitrogen concentration in groundwater nakanishi et al 2001 the spatial distribution of pollution from agricultural non point sources is uneven making the effect of nitrogen from fertilizers on groundwater vary across different locations fig 2 shows the conceptual illustration of the sunagawa subsurface dam when irrigation is needed water from subsurface dams is pumped up through wells and once stored in farm ponds at the hills and then irrigated to farmland by sprinkler when the groundwater storage exceeds the capacity of the subsurface dam or when the water table exceeds 31 m groundwater will flow out to the sea for hydrochemical when groundwater pool is not full or water table is lower than the dam in dry periods ions can gradually accumulate but when groundwater pool is full water will flow over the dam and discharge into the sea and ion concentrations in the groundwater pool can be diluted 2 2 precipitation and water table data monthly rainfall data were collected in gusukube metrological station in miyako island from 2014 to 2021 managed by the japan meteorological agency website https www data jma go jp obd stats etrn index php for the same 2014 2021 period continuous water table data managed by the local land transformation office was collected in well s22 near the dam wall in each survey groundwater depth was also measured on site by water level gauge wl 100a alfa 2 3 groundwater sampling and analysis a total of 42 intensively distributed wells were used for groundwater sampling to determine geophysical variations of the karst aquifer through the differences in water chemical changes spatiotemporally along water table change groundwater surveys were carried out in november 2015 june and october 2016 june and october 2017 june and november 2018 and march 2021 water samples were taken at 5 m and 20 m depths below the water table using a reusable acrylic baler designed especially for groundwater sampling it was hard to get 20 m water sample from some of the wells because of the natural changes in topography among them sixteen wells from t1 to t15 and l3 were selected along a 3 3 km transect as a a transect in fig 1b of the catchment from upstream to downstream and used to determine the difference in groundwater recharge within the transect and between the top and bottom layers of the aquifer electrical conductivity ec was measured by a portable meter d 54 horiba dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured using a portable dissolved oxygen meter do 24p dkk toa and a handheld portable orp meter d 25 horiba all the water samples were taken back to laboratory in chiba university and filtered through the 0 2 μm filter before analysis major ions na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and no3 were analyzed by ion chromatography lc 10a series shimadzu japan total alkalinity hco3 was measured with alkalinity titration method on site using 0 01 n h2so4 since nitrate nitrogen can not only be used as a chemical tracer but also as an essential indicator of water pollution no3 was converted to nitrate nitrogen no3 n water stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h from 2017 to 2018 were simultaneously analyzed using a laser absorption water vapor isotope analyzer picarro l2130 i ca usa in the laboratory in sun yat sen university the reported accuracies for the instrument were respectively 0 5 and 0 1 for δ2h and δ18o international standard reference samples vsmow2 gisp and slap2 obtained from the international atomic energy agency iaea were used for calibration for spatial and vertical variability maps of the distribution of groundwater chemicals and isotopes ordinary kriging method was used to build the grid in surfer 16 software 2 4 long term observation wells to further clarify the difference in groundwater recharge water chemicals major elements are regularly monitored in 4 typical monitoring wells l1 to l4 at an interval of every two months from 2014 to 2020 groundwater samples were collected 5 m below the water table while rainwater samples near the typical wells were collected during the same period stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h both from groundwater and rainwater were tested from march 2016 to july 2018 the total phosphorus tp was measured by the molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method using a spectrophotometer tu1810 beijing persee 2 5 percolation theory and hydrological connectivity the theory of percolation was developed to deal with disordered solid variations in connectivity with isolated subunits or wells with surrounding subunits deutscher et al 1983 in this study degree of variation of ions and isotopes δ18o and δ2h influenced by the condensation or enrichment of irrigation water return and dilution of natural rainfall was used to illustrate the degree of connectivity between groundwater and surface water in a specific well and heterogeneity of connectivity in the karst aquifers for example in case of quick groundwater dilution from rainfall in a specific well or at a specific depth it thus indicates a strong connectivity or percolation in the specific well or depth with surface rainfall and on the other hand when groundwater is less influenced by rainfall or condensed water from irrigation water return the connectivity or percolation of the specific well with surface water is weak 2 6 data analysis descriptive statistics such as maximum minimum median and mean and standard deviation are used to provide a summary of the data the pearson correlation analysis was employed using spss to determine the relationship between ions 3 results 3 1 groundwater in response to precipitation and the dry wet cycle water table change in the artificial aquifer was mainly associated with irrigation water demand for crops such as sugarcane in the dry periods and rainfall recharge especially rainstorm during the frequent typhoons in the island based on the long term meteorological data for miyako island annual rainfalls for 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 were respectively 1557 1906 2751 5 1780 2395 2393 and 2695 5 mm with an annual average of 2 049 mm therefore 2014 2015 and 2017 were relatively dry years as in fig 3 there were 3 dry periods with strong groundwater depletion respectively in june 2014 to september 2015 january 2017 to august 2017 and march 2018 to june 2018 coincidentally our first survey was done in november 2015 near the lowest water table since then some 7 months of continuous rich rainfall caused rapid recovery of the water table to the height of the artificial dam before june 2016 although the water table dropped slightly due to summer irrigation it again reached full level at the time of the third survey as there was sufficient precipitation throughout the year due to low precipitation in 2017 the water table continued to decline in the first half of 2017 with a drop of 6 53 m after that period the water table was driven by typhoon and rose continuously to full level in 2018 the following year changes in precipitation and water table were similar the water table then stabilized after the end of 2018 till march 2021 thus analysis of the changes in the water chemistry specially focused on water declining and recovery processes before november 2018 the isopotential maps of the water table in each survey from november 2015 to march 2021 have been depicted in fig 4 the topographical changes of the impermeable stratum situated at the basement of the subsurface dam exhibit a gentle slope from the upstream in the eastern part to the downstream in the western sector fig 1b thus in low water table periods the groundwater primarily accumulates in the western reaches or the middle and downstream catchment regions in november 2015 the water table was the lowest in the entire field survey period and then it rose above 31 m cut off wall in june 2016 from june 2017 to june 2018 the water table was again below the dam it rebounded and remained at full capacity from november 2018 onwards 3 2 characteristics of groundwater chemicals the chemical characteristics of karst groundwater are not only controlled by factors such as geological conditions and hydrometeorological conditions in the region but also by human activities the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater can well preserve and retrieve such complicated influences the findings from a field survey as analyzed and depicted in fig 5 reveal the water chemistry including electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do oxidation reduction potential orp and major ions na k ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 it is apparent that the ec value surpasses that of the most natural water bodies in subtropical and humid region and indicates the intensive weathering of coral limestone under the impact of agricultural fertilization the ec values are negatively affected by precipitation displaying a peak value of 625 μs cm in november 2015 and a minimum value of 517 μs cm in november 2018 do and orp can be indicative for biological decomposition in water it can be observed that the do value in most periods were higher than 5 0 mg l and was sufficient for respiration of microorganisms in the groundwater the high do value suggests the missing of organic decomposition activity which is very natural in the karst groundwater condition similarly orp values were positive in all the survies and higher than 100 0 mv these results show that the aquifer is in aerobic rather than anaerobic environment among the major ions ca2 and hco3 are the two dominant ions in the groundwater strongly resulting from the weathering of coral limestone while ca2 varies from 13 0 to 118 9 mg l hco3 changes from 45 8 to 353 8 mg l 3 3 indication from difference of groundwater recharging in 4 typical wells 3 3 1 response of groundwater isotope to rainfall using groundwater wells l1 l2 l3 and l4 as example the difference in groundwater recharge in the karst aquifer was analyzed using δ18o and δ2h isotopes the calculated local meteoric water line lmwl from local rainwater is δ2h 9 2 δ18o 20 5 and its slope and intercept are both greater than those of the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 reflecting the warm and humid climate dai et al 2020 the analysis showed that the value of stable isotopes in four groundwater wells ranged within 6 0 to 3 0 for δ18o mean value of 4 9 and 34 6 to 4 3 for δ2h mean value of 26 4 fig 6 these values are very close to the lmwl however among the four groundwater wells l4 was very different firstly stable isotopes in wells l1 l2 and l3 were below lmwl or had slightly heavier than those in rainwater this showed that evapotranspiration slightly influenced the well water the stable isotopes in well l4 were much closer to lmwl or the local rainwater suggesting a much stronger influence or response to surface or rainwater next stable isotopes in wells l1 l2 and l3 especially l2 and l3 were very close showing low water exchange over the dry wet cycle and low responses or connectivity with surface water then stable isotopes in well l4 or even well l1 were scattered indicating strong rainwater influence these signals suggested that well l4 had the strongest groundwater and rainfall connectivity it has been demonstrated that stable isotopes are sensitive tracers to understand the degree of connectivity between groundwater and surface water and to determine spatial heterogeneity of groundwater recharge 3 3 2 response of groundwater chemicals to rainfall to further clarify the difference in groundwater recharge cl from l1 l2 l3 and l4 were again selected to see the concentration changes caused by the evaporative condensation over the dry season and dilution in the wet season from fig 7 a cl concentration in the well l1 remained high and with a small fluctuation within 26 7 41 7 mg l it did not vary greatly over the dry wet cycle in l2 cl concentration was in similar range of 22 1 41 5 mg l like stable isotopes the degree of fluctuation of cl concentration in l3 was small indicating low interaction with surface rainwater the characteristics of groundwater recharge to the three wells were similar driven by both evaporation in the dry season and rainfall in the wet season like δ18o and δ2h isotopes cl concentration in l4 was totally different from those in the other wells and much closer to local rainwater varying from 6 7 to 41 6 mg l it had been clearly illustrated that cl concentration in l4 had been fluctuating along with the condensation processes during the dry season and the dilution processes during the wet season again it suggested the strongest connectivity between surface water and groundwater in l4 fig 7 b shows seasonal dynamics of no3 n concentration in 4 wells in comparison with that in rainfall it can be observed that no3 n in rainfall is very low and hardly detectable in half of the monitoring period not like cl no3 n concentration variation is a little complex and driven by 3 processes including the fertilizer leaching effect from cropland the dilution effect of precipitation and the evaporative condensation from drainage water through irrigation the concentrations of no3 n in wells l1 l2 and l3 had similar trend with water table dynamics for the observation period although the concentrations of no3 n in the dry season were not so different from the other three wells well l4 had exactly the same trend of no3 n dilution over the wet season it again confirmed that the connection of l4 with surface rainfall was much stronger than the other wells like the performance of stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h no3 n concentration in l1 suggested that their connectivity with surface activities for instance fertilization is stronger than l2 and l3 3 3 3 water chemical characteristics in 4 typical wells table 1 lists the analyzed results of water chemicals including ec total phosphorus tp and major ions na k ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 from the field surveys the mean and standard deviation of the ions can again indicate the sensitive of groundwater to precipitation similar to cl and no3 n almost all the mean values of ions in well l4 are smaller than those of other wells especially ec ca2 and hco3 indicating that their strong connectivity with surface rainfall in addition the standard deviations of l4 are larger than those of the other wells further implying the non uniformity of groundwater recharge in the 4 wells like no3 n so4 2 in groundwater comes mainly from fertilizers it can be observed that mean value of so4 2 in well l1 l2 and l3 are respectively 20 8 19 1 and 22 6 mg l higher than that of 16 2 mg l in well l4 it is indicated that even though fertilizer leaching is the main source of so4 2 the effect of precipitation dilution can still be reflected in the ion concentration phosphorus a source from the mineralization of artificially added fertilizer often accumulates in the soil during the fertilization sharma et al 2013 however from the table 1 the tp in groundwater of sunagawa catchment is nearly zero indicating that groundwater has not been affected by the mineralization of organic phosphorus 3 4 heterogeneity from hydrochemical and isotope changes along the transection the lateral and vertical distribution of c1 concentration along the a a transect is potted in fig 8 after the first long dry spell that started in june 2014 c1 concentration peaked in november 2015 varied heterogeneously from upstream to downstream withing 30 2 59 2 mg l the maximum concentration 59 2 mg l occurred at the depth of 20 m in t8 in comparison well t5 had a lower c1 concentration than the surrounding wells then in june 2016 the transect c1 concentration was within 10 3 40 2 mg l this indicated that there was a rapid dilution across the entire transect compared with that in november 2015 for example a minimum of 10 3 mg l was observed at the 5 m depth in observation well t11 which was in the top layer also at the bottom of t5 and t8 there was a rapid groundwater recharge driven by both precipitation and irrigation a strong connectivity between surface water and the bottom layer rather than infiltrating through the top layer is suggested in october 2016 the c1 concentration in the transect was generally diluted and evenly distributed within the range of 21 1 31 0 mg l due to the low rainfall during the first 8 months of 2017 the mean c1 concentration increased from 26 9 mg l in october 2016 to 34 7 mg l in june 2017 the concentrations at two depths in well t9 were similar but lower than those in the other wells indicating that the vertical infiltration process may be faster than the lateral movement in the following two surveys the mean c1 concentrations across the transect in october 2017 and june 2018 were respectively 34 8 mg l and 35 0 mg l respectively similar to that for june 2017 likewise the cl concentration in well t9 in october 2017 has also been close to the rainfall on september 26 fig 8a note that for the survey periods with low precipitation cl concentrations in the midstream and downstream were lower than that in the upstream it suggested that the aquifers in the midstream and downstream had relatively fast recharge and strong connectivity with surface driven by rich precipitation since june 2018 the water table returned to its full level in august 2018 in november 2018 except for t14 and t15 with relative high cl concentration near the dam cl concentration along the transect was uniformly distributed in march 2021 the water table kept full while an extremely uniformed distribution of cl concentration with a mean value of 25 7 mg l can be observed fig 9 shows the lateral and vertical distributions of no3 n concentration along the a a transect through the local survey it was noted that chemical fertilizers mainly nh4 2so4 were irregularly but more frequently applied during the period from october to december in the catchment ishida et al 2015 nakanishi 2001 thus unlike cl changes in no3 n concentration were driven not only by natural dilution and evaporative processes but also by fertilizer application the range of lateral and vertical distributions of no3 n concentration was at 4 7 7 2 mg l and the mean value for november 2015 was 6 0 mg l this relatively high concentration had been caused by low precipitation recharge to groundwater during the dry period since june 2014 the maximum no3 n concentration of 7 2 mg l occurred at 5 m below the water table in an observation well t15 which is near the dam wall in june 2016 the range of no3 n concentration was 1 6 7 7 mg l with an average of 5 0 mg l compared with november 2015 it did not change much in the upstream and midstream but dropped significantly in the downstream it then suggested that there was dilution under high precipitation recharge for instance the minimum no3 n concentration of 1 59 mg l was 5 m below the observation well t11 like the case for cl it suggested that strong precipitation recharge existed and there was a good surface water connection with rainfall at that point in october 2016 no3 n concentration was distributed within 2 3 8 0 mg l with an average of 4 8 mg l there were low concentrations in wells t9 and t11 the mean no3 n concentration increased to 5 5 mg l in june 2017 and further to 5 8 mg l in october 2017 after over two years of the wet season mean no3 n concentration dropped to 4 2 mg l in march 2021 also the low fertilizer season overall in october 2016 there was strong groundwater recharge in well t9 t11 in june 2017 and in june and november 2018 both in june 2016 and october 2017 there was seemingly over 1 5 mg l difference in no3 n concentrations between the top and bottom layers in wells t5 and t11 showing a low connectivity between the top and bottom layers like what has been observed in cl concentration fig 10 shows the lateral and vertical distributions of δ18o and δ2h along the a a transect the value of δ18o in june 2017 october 2017 and june 2018 are 4 5 4 7 and 4 9 respectively equally the value of δ2h are respectively 22 4 24 7 and 25 3 showing a decreasing trend similar to c1 the value of δ18o and δ2h isotopes in well t9 in june 2017 are heavier than that of other surrounding wells which are close to the earlier rainfall event before the survey later in september 2017 the δ18o and δ2h values in rainfall are 9 6 and 70 0 respectively by comparison it can be found that the values in well t4 in october 2017 are lighter than that of other wells indicating high interaction with surface rainwater in well t4 3 5 heterogeneity of hydrochemical and isotope changes from spatio temporal analysis fig 11 shows the spatial distribution of cl in sunagawa catchment from november 2015 to march 2021 in november 2015 cl concentration was within 11 0 62 5 mg l and was mostly in the range of 30 0 40 0 mg l from november 2015 to october 2016 the mean concentration of cl declined from 37 7 mg l to 25 1 mg l with most wells falling below 30 0 mg l the minimum concentration was 8 0 mg l well s12 close to the rainwater concentration suggesting a very strong recharge in the wet season then it increased to 33 2 mg l in june 2017 indicating a mix with irrigation leaching water after evaporative condensation in the next three surveys the values of cl concentration gradually declined on average from 34 7 mg l to 26 6 mg l as presented in fig 11 there were several wells with different trends in groundwater recharge firstly the area near wells s6 and s7 in the midstream of the catchment had low cl concentration in november 2015 and october 2017 secondly the area around wells l4 t11 and s13 had extremely strong dilution in june 2016 specifically well l4 had significant dilution characteristics in october 2016 june 2017 and november 2018 then well s3 showed strong permeability to groundwater recharge in november 2018 in both october 2016 and march 2021 well s12 had much lower concentrations than other parts of the catchment and shown a strong influence from surface water rainfall and irrigation water leaching again like vertical change in cl concentration spatial variations in cl concentration suggested that wells near the dam or in the downstream area had much stronger recharge conditions irrespectively spatial variations in groundwater recharge in the small catchment of an area of 7 2 km2 were large and spatially heterogeneous very similar to cl concentration no3 n concentration decreased from 5 8 mg l in november 2015 to 4 3 mg l in october 2016 and then rose to 4 8 mg l in june 2017 and 5 3 mg l in october 2017 fig 12 after that it continued to decline from 5 3 mg l in june 2018 to 3 9 mg l in march 2021 through the rich precipitation period in comparison with cl no3 n concentration has been less regular indicating the strong effect from fertilizer application in general the average no3 n concentration was high due to leaching of over use of fertilizer especially during the dry season and can be diluted due to strong precipitation in the wet season at some special locations in well s6 a strong no3 n concentration was noted in most of the surveys except for the periods november 2015 and march 2021 also wells s13 s14 s17 s19 t4 t6 t14 t15 and s3 in the midstream region of the catchment had high no3 n concentration suggesting some effect of fertilizer application similar to cl several wells such as l4 t11 s13 in the downstream t9 in the midstream and s11 12 in the east were highly influenced by rainfall recharge all these wells suggested good connectivity with surface water systems fig 13 shows the spatial distribution of δ18o and δ2h in sunagawa catchment from june 2017 to june 2018 in june 2017 the value of stable isotopes ranged within 7 2 to 4 2 for δ18o and 47 1 to 9 5 for δ2h from june 2017 to june 2018 the average value of stable isotopes dropped from 5 0 to 5 4 and 26 7 to 29 4 for δ18o and δ2h respectively and then two values were increased to 5 1 for δ18o and 26 7 for δ2h in general δ18o and δ2h showed similar tendency in spatial compared to cl and no3 n the heterogeneity in isotopes was also observed in well s18 s19 well t8 and well l4 in june 2017 also several wells such as t1 s4 s12 and s18 had lighter isotope values than the other wells in october 2017 in general stable isotopes had a very similar distribution pattern to cl illustrating that these wells strongly correlate with surface rainwater 4 discussions 4 1 mixing and infiltration characteristics of karst aquifer from 4 typical wells the comparison of groundwater chemicals with isotopes from four wells l1 to l4 helped to clarify the mixing and infiltration characteristics for karst aquifer with different degrees of weathering the absence of correlation between stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h and cl suggests that evaporation has not been affecting the change of cl concentration in well l1 l2 and l3 fig 14 a and b therefore such low variation in stable isotopes and cl concentration shall be attributed to the slowly mixing of groundwater indicating that there is connectivity even not as strong as l4 in the wells the reason for the higher cl concentration is caused by the evapotranspiration effect when light rains or irrigated water evaporates from the land surface stanger 1986 then during heavier rain events the salt from previous light rain or irrigated water will re dissolve and infiltrated into the groundwater weyhenmeyer et al 2002 such repeated evapotranspiration precipitation cycles will result in the high cl concentrations in wells l1 l2 and l3 in comparison with rainwater on the other hand isotopic composition in groundwater is basically a slow mixing process of isotopes of a series of rain events since transpiration dominates in most of the sugarcane growth period and evaporation loss which cause heavier stable water isotopes is low jasechko et al 2013 such differences in condensation of cl concentration and mix of water isotopes partially explain the observed differences in chloride and stable isotopes in rainwater versus groundwater fig 14 in contrast in groundwater from well l4 the distribution of isotopes and cl is very similar to distribution of rain samples which clearly suggest the rapid infiltration of surface rainwater and the sensitive influence of rain events the groundwater nitrogen inputs in the sunagawa catchment may be derived from agricultural nitrogen leaching and condensed concentration from repeatedly use of irrigation water like cl for instance previous studies shown that groundwater nitrate levels were significantly affected by the amount of fertilization applied to the farmland fujiie et al 2008 ishida et al 2017 and nitrogen leaching from sugarcane land mainly occurred in the rainy season from april to june okamoto et al 2020 and fertilizer application season from october to december nakanishi 2001 the results in groundwater wells l1 to l3 showed no correlation between no3 n and isotopic composition fig 14c and d in fig 7b there is no significant seasonal variation found both of the two figures indicated that the slow mixing of no3 n in wells l1 to l3 with surface water owing to their poor weathering property and low hydrological conductivity in contrast in well l4 the similar distribution between isotopes and no3 n in groundwater and rainwater fig 14c and d suggest nitrate in l4 is strong recharged by either high no3 n water after fertilization application or rainwater ishida et al 2006 also reported that water with a low concentration of nitrate nitrogen penetrates into the ground during heavy rain caused by passing typhoons etc and dilution causes a temporary decrease in the concentration of nitrate nitrogen in the groundwater in general the different behaviors at well l4 compared with those at wells l1 l2 and l3 were due to the strong infiltration properties of the surrounding coral rocks the observed correlation between no3 n and cl fig 14e and f can provide information to distinguish the effect of mixing and dilution process on nitrate as a conservative ion in aquifer environments cl can be used as an indicator in most settings to determine surface water and groundwater mixing coluccio and morgan 2019 and nitrate are often used to assess the impact of agricultural activities on groundwater henson et al 2017 in this study the sources of cl and no3 n are the same as mentioned above cl comes from rainfall while no3 n mainly comes from fertilizer in the water samples studied here there was a generally positive correlation spearman s ρ 0 83 in well l4 which indicates that the change in no3 n concentration is mainly driven by dilution process or rapid infiltration however in other wells l1 to l3 although no3 n showed a trend of increasing with the increase of cl the correlation between the two is very small indicating that no3 n in these wells is mainly affected by agricultural activities and groundwater mixing process and secondary by dilution process 4 2 groundwater connectivity indicated from spatial and vertical observations karst aquifers are the most complex groundwater systems due to their high degree of heterogeneity ford and williams 2007 worthington and ford 2009 and thus required a better understanding of the karst structure wang et al 2022 hydrochemical and stable isotopes have been proven to be effective in investigating the heterogeneity of the karst medium and groundwater flow systems qin et al 2017 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b to evaluate these unsolved points water sampling from intensive distributed groundwater wells is needed however in many countries long term groundwater monitoring networks in such conditions is lack jasechko and perrone 2021 fortunately in our study 42 intensively distributed wells in a 7 2 km2 small catchment were taken to investigate and understand the differentiations on the hydrological properties of the subsurface karst system the spatial and temporal variations of water chemistry along with rainfall recharge and evaporation condensation processes nearly visibly illustrate the connectivity of groundwater with rainwater drainage water and fertilizer use and help us intuitively understand the complexity of the karst system in the a a transect 16 wells in 3 3 km at two depths vertically demonstrated the heterogeneity of groundwater recharge or degree of connectivity between groundwater and surface from fig 8 wells t5 and t9 t11 were in the zone which is highly influenced or connected with rainwater and drainage water percolation a similar quick percolation zone is depicted in fig 9 next cl and no3 n concentrations in the top and the bottom layers of well t5 and t11 were different for instance cl and no3 n concentration in t5 in june 2016 and october 2017 in the bottom layer was lower than that in the top layer it is therefore suggested that there is a weak connectivity between the two layers and possibly a direct percolation path fracture flow from the soil surface to the bottom layer on the other hand the recharge rate of the top layer of well t11 was higher than that of the bottom layer suggesting weak connectivity from the top to the bottom layer spatial changes in cl and no3 n also suggested the sensible wells to chemical changes and having good connectivity with surface water these wells were t5 s6 s7 l4 t11 s13 and s12 figs 11 and 12 since the chemical concentration of rainwater was lower than that of groundwater cl concentration clearly showed gradual dilution and then condensation along the wet dry cycle however the concentration of no3 n suggested a different trend while changes in no3 n in wells t5 s6 s7 l4 t11 s13 and s12 remained sensitive to rainfall the effect of fertilizer use in agriculture on no3 n was obvious for instance for well s6 no3 n concentration changed from low in november 2015 to relatively high over the observation period suggesting a strong effect of fertilize application in sugarcane plantation ishida et al 2017 overall comparing with no3 n chloride is a better tracer in understanding the processes of percolation kirchner et al 2000 neal and rosier 1990 schmidt et al 2013 since it is only influenced by natural hydrological cycle such as dilution from precipitation and condensation from evaporation temporal analysis of water isotopes δ18o δ2h cl and no3 n also suggested strong connectivity of surface water with groundwater in l4 evident in effects of rainfall and fertilize use on the water quality well l4 was also close to wells t11 and s13 suggesting strong connectivity with surface water 4 3 percolation theory and heterogeneity of karst system in coral limestone the theory of percolation was first introduced to describe the penetration of fluids in porous media berkowitz and balberg 1993 or in amorphous solids in the field of physics and not in hydrology if a fluid flows through a medium which is itself in some sense disordered or random the flow through the system may be described as a so called percolation process with changes in connectivity under isolated subunits deutscher et al 1983 in the case of sunagawa catchment it is like the changes in connectivity between different wells and different well depth with surrounding units the first lesson that can be learned from our study is that the coral limestone is a disordered porous system the even distribution of cl on october 2016 and march 2021 and nearly even distribution of no3 n in the low fertilizer season in march 2021 show that the whole aquifer system is connected and water in the aquifer has the potential to be well mixed even in a slow rate like l2 and l3 the coral limestone aquifer can be explained as a kind of porous media following percolation theory with percolation from surface to groundwater and from strong connectivity parts to low connectivity parts past studies have shown that the porosity of coral reef limestone is much higher than that of carbonate rocks like limestone and dolomite zhenget al 2020 similarly larson and mylroie 2018 mentioned that eogenetic carbonate rocks retain much of their original depositional porosity in the oil industry carbonate rocks formed mainly in biotic or in the shallow marine environment with less geological burial similar to miyako island are porous and good for the storage of oil and gases dasgupta and mukherjee 2020 in other word the structure of coral limestone is porous which is very different from continent limestone with water flow mainly through conduits or holes the second lesson learn from our study is the strong heterogeneity of the connectivity or hydrological conductivity in the aquifer system in our study the large difference in water quality between the top and the bottom layer in wells t5 and t11 indicated the low or impermeability of the two layers it is inferred that there exists preferential flow through fractures or conduits from the neighboring units or rather than the top layer in fig 1c the difference for water permeability in different rocks should very variable for instance the detrital limestone should have much stronger permeability to determine places for highly productive wells mori et al 1997 studied the rock properties in the catchment and noted that clay content in the pore spaces of coral limestone strongly influenced the hydraulic conductivity and water yield of the wells therefore there exists a strong heterogeneity both spatially and vertically depending on at least clay content and carbonic rock properties from porous permeable and well connected rocks to less or impermeable rocks recent studies in chalk aquifers similar to coral limestone by cao et al 2020 and chen et al 2019 through water and solute migration also exhibit strong heterogeneity in the distribution of matrix flow fracture flow and conduit flow formed through the long historical water weathering process vialle et al 2014 in summary it can be seen that the coral limestone aquifer is much like a soil body rather than continent limestone with a strong spatial and vertical heterogeneity or a mixture of sandy parts with high water percolation and clay parts with weak water percolation but still hydraulically connected with the surrounding units 5 conclusions in summary this study shows that coral limestone is different from most carbonate rocks which is highly dependent on the hardly predictable dilution conduits as a water flow path coral limestone with less historical and geological burial is basically a porous and well permeable aquifer system like detrital limestone it is also highly heterogeneous and influenced for instance by the low connective units formed in rock property content of carbonate mud formed in the dead green algae dasgupta and mukherjee 2020 and intrusion of clay particles from soil and by highly connected units or preferential pathways such as conduit fractures highly porous units and gravels in general groundwater recharge in coral limestone aquifers follows percolation theory such a finding shall be important in deepening our understanding of the hydrogeological structure of coral limestone aquifers globally it is also worthwhile to mention that with proper human interference such as dam construction like what has been done in sunagawa catchment highly productive and porous carbonate rock systems can provide a perfect aquifer media for rainwater harvesting and groundwater storage in large number of remote islands facing the growing challenge of island water supplies under climate change leoni et al 2021 thomas et al 2020 studies on the geological structure of the island limestone system to increase its

1734,bioretention systems are effective stormwater treatment systems many studies have been conducted on the nitrogen regulation effects of bioretention systems however few studies had investigated the variation of nitrogen concentration in the submerged zone during dry periods and evaluated the effect of the submerged zone on nitrogen removal efficiency under dry wet alterations furthermore existing models cannot fully consider the impact of the submerged zone on nitrogen removal this paper presents the validation prediction uncertainty parameter sensitivity analysis and scenario simulations with different submerged zone depths of a proposed model we conducted 13 consecutive rainfall events for model validation under dry wet alternations in a mesocosm bioretention system with a submerged zone the collected data mainly includes outflow rates outflow nitrogen concentrations nh4 n no3 n and tn in wet periods and submerged zone nitrogen concentrations nh4 n no3 n and tn in dry periods the results show that 1 the nash efficiency coefficients in the wet and dry periods were all above 0 5 during calibration and validation phases 2 the prediction uncertainty of outflow submerged zone nitrogen concentration nh4 n no3 n and tn can be significantly reduced by using nse values of the wet and dry periods as likelihood objective functions than only using nse values of the wet periods 3 the sensitivity analysis shows that outflow nitrogen concentrations nh4 n no3 n or tn are sensitive to most of nitrogen module parameters in the submerged zone 4 in the long term dry wet alterations simulation the increase of submerged zone depth can improve the annual average nitrogen removal rate while it does not always improve nitrogen removal rates in single rainfall event if a rainfall event with a short antecedent dry period 1 5 d and the inflow nitrogen concentration in the current event is less than that in the previous event the increase of the submerged zone depth will even reduce the nitrogen removal rate keywords bioretention nitrogen dry wet alterations modelling submerged zone data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction runoff pollution is one of the main reasons for water quality deterioration in urban water bodies yang and lusk 2018 bioretention systems are important facilities for alleviating runoff pollution liu et al 2014 skorobogatov et al 2020 removal efficiencies of bioretention systems on some runoff pollutants e g tss cod heavy metals and some pathogenic bacteria are more stable than that of nitrogen davis et al 2003 hunt et al 2006 parker et al 2017 trowsdale and simcock 2011 the nitrogen removal rate reached more than 80 in some studies while other studies observed low and fluctuating nitrogen removal rates goh et al 2019 liu et al 2014 for example field sampling on three bioretention systems found that high annual no3 n mass removal rates varied between 13 and 75 hunt et al 2006 nitrogen removal rates of nh4 n no3 n and tn in bioretention systems are mainly affected by microbiological processes wang et al 2021 the presence or absence of the submerged zone and its depth søberg et al 2021 wang et al 2018 and other factors e g antecedent dry period adp inflow volume and nitrogen concentration nabiul afrooz and boehm 2017 rahman et al 2020 he et al 2022 rahman et al 2020 microbiological processes play a key role in nitrogen removal organic nitrogen is converted to ammonia through ammonification ammonia nitrogen is converted to nitrate through nitrification nitrate and nitrite are converted to nitrogen through denitrification wang et al 2021 many studies have focused on the impact of these above factors on nitrogen removal rates during wet periods however few studies have paid attention to the impact of nitrogen concentration changes in the submerged zone on nitrogen removal during dry periods note that the wet period is the period from the beginning of rainfall to the end of outflow the dry period is the period from the end of the outflow to the beginning of the next rainfall he et al 2020 investigated the variation of nitrogen concentration in the submerged zone under 17 consecutive cycles of dry wet alternations rainfall events the results show that the contribution of nitrogen decrease in the submerged zone during dry periods to nh4 n and no3 n removal accounted for 12 and 92 respectively it indicates that it is very necessary to understand nitrogen changes in the submerged zone during dry periods changes in nitrogen concentration in the submerged zone during dry periods can not only deduce the nitrogen transformation rate but also have a significant impact on the nitrogen outflow concentration during wet periods which is helpful to explain the nitrogen removal ability of the bioretention system under the dry wet alternative environment some models can simulate nitrogen removal in bioretention systems including swmm sustain hydrus and drainmod n low impact development lid module in swmm can simulate pollutant removal caused by runoff retention best management practices bmp module can simulate pollutants removal effect of bmp facilities by setting a value of removal factor rossman and huber 2016 for example tang et al 2021 simulated changes in outflow nh4 n and tn in lid facilities including a bioretention system during 37 rainfall events through the bmp module in swmm the bmp module of sustain does not use a constant i e removal factor to simulate pollutants removal but sets several pollutants removal methods for selection including the first order attenuation model and kadlec knight s k c model shoemaker and tech 2009 gao et al 2015 used sustain to compare the pollution removal effects with or without bmp facilities from july to october 2011 and the results showed that adding bmp facilities could reduce tn load by 57 hydrus model uses zero order or first order reaction equations to simulate pollutants transformation chen et al 2022 tanmoy et al 2022 li et al 2020a analyzed the nitrogen regulation effect of bioretention systems under different depths of a submerged zone in the three month simulation by using the hydrus 1d the results showed that when a submerged zone depth was 150 mm the average load reduction rates of no3 n and tn were higher than those reported in a system without a submerged zone drainmod n has been applied to nitrogen simulation of bioretention systems because it can consider transformations among nh4 n no3 n and tn li et al 2020b negma et al 2014 li et al 2020b used drainmod n to simulate the effect of submerged zone depth on nitrogen removal from 2016 to 2017 the results showed that the removal rate of no3 n load increased with the increase of submerged zone depth generally swmm and sustain can build bioretention systems with a submerged zone but do not consider transformations between nitrogen hydrus can simulate transformations of nitrogen however it can not simulate the situation that water in the submerged zone flows out of the system after reaching a certain depth drainmod n can simulate water accumulation in the submerged zone brevé et al 1997 however drainmod n does not take into account the effect of dissolved oxygen do on denitrification under the situation of ponding in the submerged zone besides wang et al 2021 provided a reaction based model to predict the dynamics of nitrogen in the bioretention system and used mean effluent concentration values in the calibration and validation events for parameter validation experimental studies have shown that the submerged zone has an obvious effect on nitrogen removal in bioretention systems he et al 2020 while existing models lack process based nitorgen removal formulations for bioretention systems wang et al 2021 especially lack concerns with nitrogen changes under alternate dry wet simulation therefore the aims of the study are to 1 build a layered bioretention system model that considers nitrogen transformation processes in the submerged zone under alternate dry wet conditions 2 analyze the prediction uncertainty and parameters sensitivity 3 analyze the effect of the submerged zone on the nitrogen removal process and removal rate under short and long term alternate dry wet conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description the bioretention system model consists of two modules the hydrological and nitrogen modules it includes three layers the ponding layer soil layer and submerged zone 2 1 1 hydrological module the hydrological module describes major flow processes in bioretention systems it was adapted from the lid module of swmm model rossman and huber 2016 the hydrological module generalizes three layers of a bioretention system as water tanks in series and considers water balance within each layer and water fluxes exchange between layers 1 the ponding layer a temporary pond on the top of the filter media 2 the soil layer the unsaturated or saturated filter media and 3 the submerged zone consistently saturated part of a bioretention system fig 1 the equations and parameters meanings in the hydrological module are listed in table 1 and table 3 respectively in the ponding layer the water depth d1 is governed by input water volume from surface inflow and rainfall qinp the infiltration into the soil layer qinf the overflow out of the system qover and ponding evaporation epond eq 1 4 in the soil layer the soil moisture θ is governed by the infiltration from the ponding layer qinf the percolation into the submerged zone qper evapotranspiration out of the soil layer eet and evaporation from the submerged zone estor eq 3 5 7 10 in the submerged zone the water depth d3 is governed by water volume from the soil layer qper the outflow out of the system qout and evaporation into the soil layer epond eq 6 8 10 2 1 2 nitrogen module in the nitrogen module it can mainly simulate the migration of nh4 n no3 n and on between layers and transformation processes within each layer during wet periods and dry periods in addition this model considers changes in do and its impact on nitrification and denitrification fig 1 in the ponding layer the model considers the mass balance of nitrogen nh4 n no3 n and on and do cause by inflow infiltration and overflow in the soil layer and submerged zone for nh4 n the model simulates mineralization nitrification assimilation volatilization and sorption desorption for no3 n the model simulates nitrification denitrification and assimilation for on the model simulates nitrogen pool decomposition mineralization and assimilation for do the model simulates do consumption of biochemical reaction reaeration from the air and do consumption of nitrification it should be noted that due to the obvious difference between the media and microbial communities in the soil layer and the submerged zone li et al 2022 the same reaction rate may be quite different in these two layers to accurately simulate the characteristics of the biochemical reaction in each layer of the bioretention system the rates of the same reaction in each layer are different for example the submerged zone is prone to an anoxic environment thus the denitrification reaction rate of the submerged zone will be significantly higher than that of the soil layer the equations and parameters meanings in the nitrogen module are listed in table 2 and table 3 respectively 2 2 data used for model testing 2 2 1 experimental facility the mesocosm bioretention system was established at peking university shenzhen graduate school shenzhen china in 2016 the system was placed in a pvc cylinder with an inner diameter of 500 mm it was composed of the ponding layer soil layer and submerged zone from top to bottom fig 2 the ponding layer can store up to 150 mm deep runoff before overflowing the soil layer was 500 mm thick and consisted of a mixture of native sandy loam and fine sand it was planted with phragmites australis the submerged zone was 300 mm thick and consisted of sand and gravel a perforated pipe was set at the bottom of the system which extended outward and vertically risen a depth of 300 mm to form a submerged zone a detailed introduction to the system was shown in a previous study he et al 2020 2 2 2 experimental design shenzhen is located on the southeast coast of china with a humid subtropical climate the annual average temperature is 22 and the annual average rainfall is 1770 mm the rainfall is characterized by high intensity short duration and short adp of 2 3 d on average in rainy seasons from april to september most of the rainfall events in shenzhen occur during rainy seasons he et al 2020 a total of 13 rainfall events were carried out from july 24 to august 28 in 2018 the temperature fluctuated between 26 7 and 31 1 based on the properties of rainfall characteristics in the study area these rainfall events were designed to have rainfall ranging from 20 mm to 40 mm rainfall intensity ranging from 30 mm h to 65 mm h and adp ranging from 1 d to 5 d it was assumed that the catchment area of the bioretention system was 20 times its surface area the synthetic runoff was prepared to mimic local urban runoff he et al 2020 event mean concentration emc ranges of inflow nh4 n no3 n and on are 1 0 4 8 mg n l 2 8 8 0 mg n l and 0 1 3 5 mg n l respectively the details of designed rainfall events are shown in table a1 the column was watered with 70 l synthetic runoff every 3 days for 2 months to allow for a stable state of the bioretention systems before the experiment 2 2 3 sampling and analysis the wet period was from the beginning of rainfall to the end of outflow the dry period was the period from the end of the outflow to the beginning of the next rainfall during each wet period water samples were collected at valve b fig 2 at intervals of 5 20 min in the first hour and then at intervals of 30 60 min until there was no water flowing out each sampling time was 1 min outflow rates were calculated according to the water volume collected within 1 min of each sampling during each dry period water samples in the submerged zone were collected at valve c fig 2 at intervals of 3 12 h in the first 48 h and then at intervals of 24 h until the next wet period all water samples were immediately filtered through 0 22 µm membrane filters and then frozen as soon as possible before further analysis the concentration of nh4 n no3 n and tn were determined by using the salicylic acid spectrophotometry method hj 536 2009 the hydrazine sulfate reduction method gb t5750 5 2006 and the alkaline potassium persulphate digestion uv spectrophotometric method hj 636 2012 respectively 2 3 data processing 2 3 1 methods of model

respectively nsedry nh4 n nsedry no3 n and nsedry tn were calculated by using nh4 n no3 n and tn concentration data in the submerged zone during the dry periods respectively if values of these nse i e nsewet nh4 n nsewet no3 n nsewet tn nsedry nh4 n nsedry no3 n and nerdist in the calibration and validation were all greater than 0 5 the corresponding nitrogen module parameters set was determined as

by randomly sampled parameter sets throughout the monte carlo simulations the parameter ranges were listed in table 3 20 000 parameter sets were retained in the study the nse was chosen as the likelihood objective function a threshold of the likelihood objective function was set to 0 5 to demonstrate whether additional monitoring of nitrogen concentration in the submerged zone during the dry periods can reduce prediction uncertainty or not in addition to monitoring outflow nitrogen concentration during wet periods we compared the difference in prediction uncertainty between the two settings setting 1 using nse values in wet and dry periods as likelihood objective functions i e nsewet nh4 n nsewet no3 n nsewet tn nsedry nh4 n nsedry no3 n and nsedry tn setting 2 only using nse values in wet periods as likelihood objective functions i e nsewet nh4 n nsewet no3 n nsewet tn in each setting only when the likelihood objective functions in the calibration and validation periods were all greater than 0 5 the corresponding parameter sets were divided into behavioral parameter sets the outflow or submerged zone concentrations of nh4 n no3 n and tn at each time step calculated by the behavioral parameter sets were arranged in descending order respectively and the quantiles of 95 and 5 were taken as the upper and lower limits of 90 confidence interval respectively the average bandwidth of 90 confidence interval was used to evaluate the difference in prediction uncertainty between the two likelihood objective function s settings the average bandwidth was calculated

sensitivity analysis we used the modified morris screening method for the sensitivity analysis of the hydrological and nitrogen modules parameters in the submerged zone the analysis period was the calibration and validation periods when one of the parameters was chosen to perform sensitivity analysis the other parameters remained unchanged the parameter was perturbed by a fixed step size of 10

evaluate the nitrogen regulation effect of the bioretention system nitrogen load removal rates nh4 n no3 n and tn of bioretention systems were calculated as follows 23 re m o v a l r a t e k n in n out n in 100 k n h 4 n n o 3 n o r t n where removal ratek k nh4 n no3 n or tn means the load removal rate of nh4 n no3 n or tn respectively nin and nout are the inflow and outflow nitrogen load respectively 2 4 scenarios design simulations of short term alternate dry wet conditions depths of the submerged zone were designed as ranges from 0 mm to 500 mm according to the technical guide for comprehensive utilization of rainwater for low impact development szdb z 145 2015 the vertically lifting height of the outlet elbow is consistent with the depth of the submerged zone which means we increase the depth of the submerged zone under the soil layer the simulation duration was 60 days adp was 3 days rainfall intensity and duration in each rainfall event were 20 mm h and 1 h respectively the air temperature was 28 the confluence ratio was 20 1 inflow concentrations of nh4 n no3 n and on were all set as 3 mg n l the depths of the ponding layer and soil layer were 150 mm and 500 mm respectively the initial value of soil moisture was the wilting point water depth in the submerged zone and nitrogen concentration in the system were zero the time step was 1 min simulations of long term alternate dry wet conditions depths of the submerged zone were designed as ranges from 0 mm to 500 mm the simulation duration was one year we used the measured air temperature rainfall and inflow rates of shenzhen in 2020 as the input data the input data of nh4 n inflow concentration was calculated according to pollutant build up and wash off equations in the transportation area chen et al 2019 according to the measured nitrogen data in the relevant literature ding et al 2022 the no3 n and on inflow concentrations were set to be 2 times and 6 times nh4 n inflow concentration respectively time adjacent rainfall events were differentiated according to the adp that was more than 6 h apart other settings were the same as scenario group 1 the details of each rainfall event temperature adp and nitrogen inflow concentration in 2020 were shown in table a2 3 results and discussion 3 1 model evaluation 3 1 1 model calibration and validation for outflow rates nsewet q during the wet period in the calibration and validation are 0 9 and 0 8 respectively fig 3 a for outflow concentrations of nitrogen nsewet nh4 n nsewet no3 n nsewet tn during the wet periods in the calibration and validation are all greater than 0 5 for nitrogen concentrations of the submerged zone nsedry nh4 n nsedry no3 n and nsedry tn during the dry periods in the calibration and validation are all greater than 0 6 fig 3 b d the above results mean that the proposed model can simulate not only processes of outflow rates and outflow nitrogen concentration during the wet periods but also nitrogen transformation of the submerged zone during the dry periods therefore we used the model to simulate the effect of the submerged zone on the nitrogen removal efficiency of a layered bioretention system the calibrated values of hydrological and nitrogen modules parameters are shown in table 3 3 1 2 prediction uncertainty average bandwidths of 90 confidence intervals in outflow sz nh4 n no3 n and tn obtained by using nse values in wet and dry periods as likelihood objective functions i e setting 1 are 0 35 mg n l 1 39 mg n l and 1 77 mg n l respectively while average bandwidths of outflow sz nh4 n no3 n and tn obtained by using only nse values in wet periods as likelihood objective functions i e setting 2 are 0 48 mg n l 1 94 mg n l and 2 11 mg n l respectively the average bandwidths of outflow sz nh4 n no3 n and tn in using nse values in setting 1 are 27 1 28 4 and 16 1 less than that of setting 2 respectively outflow sz nh4 n no3 n and tn means nh4 n no3 n and tn concentration during the outflow process or in the submerged zone this result shows that prediction uncertainties of outflow sz nh4 n no3 n and tn can be significantly reduced by using nse values of the wet and dry periods as likelihood objective function than only using nse values of the wet periods the result indicates that in addition to monitoring outflow nitrogen concentration during the wet periods monitoring nitrogen concentration in the submerged zone during the dry periods is also necessary especially when we want to reduce prediction uncertainty 3 1 3 parameters sensitivity analysis for outflow nh4 n emc no3 n emc or tn emc in wet periods hydrological module parameters in the submerged zone with at least moderate sensitivity s 0 05 are η and ф3 most of the nitrogen module parameters in the submerged zone are at least moderately sensitive for outflow nh4 n emc no3 n emc or tn emc fig 4 the results show the η and ф3 have an obvious impact on the nitrogen simulations therefore it is recommended to obtain the value of η and ф3 through experiment tests before simulating outflow nitrogen concentrations of layered bioretention systems with the submerged zone moreover the results indicate that it is essential to consider the nitrogen transformation processes e g mineralization nitrification and denitrification in the submerged zone for example although the mineralization rate in the submerged zone was not fast it could still have moderate sensitivity to the effluent nh4 n emc at about a month scale note the emc of nitrogen i e nh4 n no3 n and tn for sensitivity analysis referred to the average effluent nitrogen i e nh4 n no3 n and tn concentrations over 13 rainfall events during calibration and validation periods parameters sensitivity results related to the soil layer are shown in fig a1 3 2 effect of submerged zone on nitrogen removal efficiency 3 2 1 effect of submerged zone depth on nitrogen removal efficiency under short term alternate dry wet conditions we aimed to analyze the effects of different submerged zone depths on one rainfall event s nitrogen removal performance in order to avoid the impact of the initial nitrogen concentration value on the nitrogen removal performance of single rainfall event we designed short term simulations i e the duration of the short term simulation was 60 d and adp was 3 d the last rainfall event during the short term simulation was selected for analysis nh4 n removal rates of the last rainfall event during the short term simulation are 46 57 67 73 78 and 81 with the submerged zone depth of 0 100 mm 200 mm 300 mm 400 mm and 500 mm respectively the corresponding no3 n removal rates are 13 18 31 41 49 and 55 respectively the corresponding tn removal rates are 29 38 46 53 58 and 61 respectively fig 5 a the results show that removal rates of nh4 n no3 n and tn all increase with the increase of the depth of the submerged zone the results indicate that the thicker the submerged zone is the more water will be stored in the submerged zone more nitrogen nh4 n no3 n and on will be removed in the dry period and then the inflow nitrogen concentration will be diluted in the next rainfall in the wet period the initial outflow concentrations refer to the last rainfall event s concentrations during the short term simulation of nh4 n no3 n and tn in the system without a submerged zone are 1 71 mg n l 2 23 mg n l and 5 47 mg n l respectively the initial outflow concentrations of nh4 n no3 n and tn in the system with a submerged zone of 100 500 mm are about 0 08 mg n l 0 23 mg n l and 1 66 mg n l respectively fig 5 b1 b2 and b3 the results reveal two things on the one hand the initial outflow concentration of the system with a submerged zone is significantly lower than that of the system without a submerged zone because compared to the system without a submerged zone the system with a submerged zone not only removes nitrogen in the soil layer but also carries out mineralization nitrification and denitrification in the submerged zone to remove on nh4 n and no3 n respectively on the other hand we found that the increase in the submerged zone depth would not affect the initial outflow concentrations of nh4 n no3 n and tn due to the low exchange rate between inflow water and water stored in the submerged zone before the beginning of the outflow the initial outflow concentration is basically equal to the nitrogen concentration in the submerged zone moreover we found that nearly 3 days of the dry period is enough to reduce the nitrogen concentration in the submerged zone to a very low level fig 5 this result may suggest that a 72 hour retention period in the bioretention systems design is reasonable besides although the nitrogen concentrations of different submerged zone depths were basically the same at the 72nd hour the increase of submerged zone depths could promote the increase of nitrogen removal rate when the next rainfall event comes fig 5 a by increasing water storage space and diluting the inflow nitrogen concentration the peak nitrogen concentration of the last rainfall event during the short term simulation gradually decreases with the increase of the submerged zone depth fig 5 b1 b2 and b3 the exchange rate between inflow volume and water storage in the submerged zone during the wet period accounts for the results the thicker the depth of the submerged zone the lower the exchange rate between the inflow volume and the submerged zone s water furthermore we found that the peak concentration of no3 n appeared within a few hours after the end of the wet period fig 5 b2 this result indicates that the nitrification rate is greater than the denitrification rate in the first one or two hours of the dry period and the concentration of no3 n in the submerged zone will continue to rise however with the proceeding of nitrification the concentration of do and nh4 n decreases making the denitrification rate gradually increase until it is greater than the nitrification rate and then the concentration of no3 n decreases 3 2 2 effect of submerged zone depth on nitrogen removal efficiency under long term alternate dry wet conditions the annual rainfall was 1284 mm in 2020 and the annual average daily temperature was 23 9 rainfall events 1 mm in 2020 were divided into 35 rainfall events with adps less than 1 5 d and 21 rainfall events with adps more than 1 5 d emc ranges of inflow nh4 n no3 n and tn were 0 4 1 17 mg n l 0 81 2 35 mg n l and 3 64 10 55 mg n l respectively the annual tn removal rates of the bioretention system with the different submerged zone depths 36 5 48 3 are significantly higher than that of the system without the submerged zone 31 the average nitrogen removal rates nh4 n no3 n and tn for rainfall events in the bioretention system with the submerged zone are significantly higher than that of the system without the submerged zone fig 6 adding a submerged zone can increase removal rates by storing more runoff more importantly a submerged zone can increase the amount of nitrogen removed during the dry period especially by promoting denitrification to remove no3 n for example the average no3 n removal rate for the rainfall events in the year without a submerged zone is negative 12 6 while the no3 n removal rate increases by 14 2 with a 100 mm submerged zone besides compared with bioretention systems without submerged zones adding an elbow to create a submerged zone will restrict outflow rates and extend outflow duration on one hand it indicates that bioretention systems with submerged zones are prone to flooding on the other hand it also indicates that the systems with submerged zones will improve the ability to delay peak outflow rates the average nitrogen removal rate nh4 n no3 n and tn for the rainfall events in the year gradually increases as the depth of the submerged zone increases generally speaking the increase of submerged zone depth helps to remove more nitrogen in dry periods due to the storage volume of the submerged zone increases when the next rainfall comes the larger the storage volume of the submerged zone the more inflow of nitrogen can be diluted thereby improving the nitrogen removal rate however we found that changes in the submerged zone depth had almost no impact on the no3 n and tn removal rates in several rainfall events i e outliers in fig 6 b and c the adps of these rainfall events were short less than 1 5 d so that there was not enough time for nitrogen to be removed in the submerged zone and the concentration of inflow nitrogen no3 n and tn from the current rainfall was smaller than that of the previous rainfall making the nitrogen concentration entering into the submerged zone smaller than the nitrogen concentration of the submerged zone itself therefore nitrogen leaching would occur during these rainfall events and with the increase of submerged zone depth the dilution effect of inflow nitrogen on the submerged zone nitrogen attenuated leading to a greater outflow nitrogen concentration consequently an increase in the submerged zone depth even harmed the nitrogen removal rate of these events in addition the relationship between adps and the nitrogen removal rates was analyzed the result of bioretention system with 300 mm sz was taken as an example for rainfall events with adp less than 3 d the nitrogen removal rate fluctuated widely and the removal rates of nh4 n no3 n and tn ranged from 0 01 to 86 6 154 1 to 80 7 and 10 6 to 75 9 respectively fig 7 rainfall events with adp less than 3 days had a wide range of rainfall 1 53 2 mm and the variations of effluent nh4 n no3 n and tn loads were also wide which resulted in large fluctuation of nitrogen removal rates for rainfall events with adp greater than 3 d the removal rates of nh4 n no3 n and tn were greater than 41 7 20 7 and 47 2 respectively fig 7 the inflow volume of rainfall events the rainfall less than 10 mm was completely retained by the system and the corresponding nitrogen removal rates were all 100 4 conclusion based on the hydrological and nitrogen monitoring data of the bioretention system during the wet and dry periods this paper proposed a layered bioretention system model that can simulate the nitrogen transformation processes under dry wet alternations the model simulated well in outflow nitrogen concentration nh4 n no3 n and tn during wet periods and the nitrogen concentration of the submerged zone during dry periods nse 0 5 the results of uncertainty analysis demonstrated the importance of monitoring the change of nitrogen concentration in the submerged zone during dry periods the prediction uncertainty results show that the prediction uncertainty of outflow submerged zone nitrogen concentration nh4 n no3 n and tn can be significantly reduced by using nse values of the wet and dry periods as likelihood objective function than only using nse values of the wet periods furthermore the sensitivity analysis results reinforced the significance of the nitrogen transformation processes in the submerged zone we found that outflow nitrogen concentration nh4 n no3 n or tn is sensitive to most of the nitrogen module parameters in the submerged zone e g knitw 3 kden 3 kmin 3 and cdomax the simulation of short term dry wet alterations reveals that the bioretention system with a submerged zone can significantly reduce the initial outflow nitrogen concentration in the next rainfall by removing nitrogen from the submerged zone during the dry period more importantly we found that in the long term dry wet alterations simulation the increase of submerged zone depth can improve the annual average nitrogen removal rate however it does not always improve nitrogen removal rates in rainfall events if a rainfall event with short adp 1 5 d and the inflow nitrogen concentration in the current event is less than that in the previous event nitrogen leaching is prone to occur and an increase of the submerged zone depth will even reduce the nitrogen removal rate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

1734,bioretention systems are effective stormwater treatment systems many studies have been conducted on the nitrogen regulation effects of bioretention systems however few studies had investigated the variation of nitrogen concentration in the submerged zone during dry periods and evaluated the effect of the submerged zone on nitrogen removal efficiency under dry wet alterations furthermore existing models cannot fully consider the impact of the submerged zone on nitrogen removal this paper presents the validation prediction uncertainty parameter sensitivity analysis and scenario simulations with different submerged zone depths of a proposed model we conducted 13 consecutive rainfall events for model validation under dry wet alternations in a mesocosm bioretention system with a submerged zone the collected data mainly includes outflow rates outflow nitrogen concentrations nh4 n no3 n and tn in wet periods and submerged zone nitrogen concentrations nh4 n no3 n and tn in dry periods the results show that 1 the nash efficiency coefficients in the wet and dry periods were all above 0 5 during calibration and validation phases 2 the prediction uncertainty of outflow submerged zone nitrogen concentration nh4 n no3 n and tn can be significantly reduced by using nse values of the wet and dry periods as likelihood objective functions than only using nse values of the wet periods 3 the sensitivity analysis shows that outflow nitrogen concentrations nh4 n no3 n or tn are sensitive to most of nitrogen module parameters in the submerged zone 4 in the long term dry wet alterations simulation the increase of submerged zone depth can improve the annual average nitrogen removal rate while it does not always improve nitrogen removal rates in single rainfall event if a rainfall event with a short antecedent dry period 1 5 d and the inflow nitrogen concentration in the current event is less than that in the previous event the increase of the submerged zone depth will even reduce the nitrogen removal rate keywords bioretention nitrogen dry wet alterations modelling submerged zone data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction runoff pollution is one of the main reasons for water quality deterioration in urban water bodies yang and lusk 2018 bioretention systems are important facilities for alleviating runoff pollution liu et al 2014 skorobogatov et al 2020 removal efficiencies of bioretention systems on some runoff pollutants e g tss cod heavy metals and some pathogenic bacteria are more stable than that of nitrogen davis et al 2003 hunt et al 2006 parker et al 2017 trowsdale and simcock 2011 the nitrogen removal rate reached more than 80 in some studies while other studies observed low and fluctuating nitrogen removal rates goh et al 2019 liu et al 2014 for example field sampling on three bioretention systems found that high annual no3 n mass removal rates varied between 13 and 75 hunt et al 2006 nitrogen removal rates of nh4 n no3 n and tn in bioretention systems are mainly affected by microbiological processes wang et al 2021 the presence or absence of the submerged zone and its depth søberg et al 2021 wang et al 2018 and other factors e g antecedent dry period adp inflow volume and nitrogen concentration nabiul afrooz and boehm 2017 rahman et al 2020 he et al 2022 rahman et al 2020 microbiological processes play a key role in nitrogen removal organic nitrogen is converted to ammonia through ammonification ammonia nitrogen is converted to nitrate through nitrification nitrate and nitrite are converted to nitrogen through denitrification wang et al 2021 many studies have focused on the impact of these above factors on nitrogen removal rates during wet periods however few studies have paid attention to the impact of nitrogen concentration changes in the submerged zone on nitrogen removal during dry periods note that the wet period is the period from the beginning of rainfall to the end of outflow the dry period is the period from the end of the outflow to the beginning of the next rainfall he et al 2020 investigated the variation of nitrogen concentration in the submerged zone under 17 consecutive cycles of dry wet alternations rainfall events the results show that the contribution of nitrogen decrease in the submerged zone during dry periods to nh4 n and no3 n removal accounted for 12 and 92 respectively it indicates that it is very necessary to understand nitrogen changes in the submerged zone during dry periods changes in nitrogen concentration in the submerged zone during dry periods can not only deduce the nitrogen transformation rate but also have a significant impact on the nitrogen outflow concentration during wet periods which is helpful to explain the nitrogen removal ability of the bioretention system under the dry wet alternative environment some models can simulate nitrogen removal in bioretention systems including swmm sustain hydrus and drainmod n low impact development lid module in swmm can simulate pollutant removal caused by runoff retention best management practices bmp module can simulate pollutants removal effect of bmp facilities by setting a value of removal factor rossman and huber 2016 for example tang et al 2021 simulated changes in outflow nh4 n and tn in lid facilities including a bioretention system during 37 rainfall events through the bmp module in swmm the bmp module of sustain does not use a constant i e removal factor to simulate pollutants removal but sets several pollutants removal methods for selection including the first order attenuation model and kadlec knight s k c model shoemaker and tech 2009 gao et al 2015 used sustain to compare the pollution removal effects with or without bmp facilities from july to october 2011 and the results showed that adding bmp facilities could reduce tn load by 57 hydrus model uses zero order or first order reaction equations to simulate pollutants transformation chen et al 2022 tanmoy et al 2022 li et al 2020a analyzed the nitrogen regulation effect of bioretention systems under different depths of a submerged zone in the three month simulation by using the hydrus 1d the results showed that when a submerged zone depth was 150 mm the average load reduction rates of no3 n and tn were higher than those reported in a system without a submerged zone drainmod n has been applied to nitrogen simulation of bioretention systems because it can consider transformations among nh4 n no3 n and tn li et al 2020b negma et al 2014 li et al 2020b used drainmod n to simulate the effect of submerged zone depth on nitrogen removal from 2016 to 2017 the results showed that the removal rate of no3 n load increased with the increase of submerged zone depth generally swmm and sustain can build bioretention systems with a submerged zone but do not consider transformations between nitrogen hydrus can simulate transformations of nitrogen however it can not simulate the situation that water in the submerged zone flows out of the system after reaching a certain depth drainmod n can simulate water accumulation in the submerged zone brevé et al 1997 however drainmod n does not take into account the effect of dissolved oxygen do on denitrification under the situation of ponding in the submerged zone besides wang et al 2021 provided a reaction based model to predict the dynamics of nitrogen in the bioretention system and used mean effluent concentration values in the calibration and validation events for parameter validation experimental studies have shown that the submerged zone has an obvious effect on nitrogen removal in bioretention systems he et al 2020 while existing models lack process based nitorgen removal formulations for bioretention systems wang et al 2021 especially lack concerns with nitrogen changes under alternate dry wet simulation therefore the aims of the study are to 1 build a layered bioretention system model that considers nitrogen transformation processes in the submerged zone under alternate dry wet conditions 2 analyze the prediction uncertainty and parameters sensitivity 3 analyze the effect of the submerged zone on the nitrogen removal process and removal rate under short and long term alternate dry wet conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description the bioretention system model consists of two modules the hydrological and nitrogen modules it includes three layers the ponding layer soil layer and submerged zone 2 1 1 hydrological module the hydrological module describes major flow processes in bioretention systems it was adapted from the lid module of swmm model rossman and huber 2016 the hydrological module generalizes three layers of a bioretention system as water tanks in series and considers water balance within each layer and water fluxes exchange between layers 1 the ponding layer a temporary pond on the top of the filter media 2 the soil layer the unsaturated or saturated filter media and 3 the submerged zone consistently saturated part of a bioretention system fig 1 the equations and parameters meanings in the hydrological module are listed in table 1 and table 3

layers and transformation processes within each layer during wet periods and dry periods in addition this model considers changes in do and its impact on nitrification and denitrification fig 1 in the ponding layer the model considers the mass balance of nitrogen nh4 n no3 n and on and do cause by inflow infiltration and overflow in the soil layer and submerged zone for nh4 n the model simulates mineralization nitrification assimilation volatilization and sorption desorption for no3 n the model simulates nitrification denitrification and assimilation for on the model simulates nitrogen pool decomposition mineralization and assimilation for do the model simulates do consumption of biochemical reaction reaeration from the air and do consumption of nitrification it should be noted that due to the obvious difference between the media and microbial communities in the soil layer and the submerged zone li et al 2022 the same reaction rate may be quite different in these two layers to accurately simulate the characteristics of the biochemical reaction in each layer of the bioretention system the rates of the same reaction in each layer are different for example the submerged zone is prone to an anoxic environment thus the denitrification reaction rate of the submerged zone will be significantly higher than that of the soil layer the equations and parameters meanings in the nitrogen module are listed in table 2 and table 3 respectively 2 2 data used for model testing 2 2 1 experimental facility the mesocosm bioretention system was established at peking university shenzhen graduate school shenzhen china in 2016 the system was placed in a pvc cylinder with an inner diameter of 500 mm it was composed of the ponding layer soil layer and submerged zone from top to bottom fig 2 the ponding layer can store up to 150 mm deep runoff before overflowing the soil layer was 500 mm thick and consisted of a mixture of native sandy loam and fine sand it was planted with phragmites australis the submerged zone was 300 mm thick and consisted of sand and gravel a perforated pipe was set at the bottom of the system which extended outward and vertically risen a depth of 300 mm to form a submerged zone a detailed introduction to the system was shown in a previous study he et al 2020 2 2 2 experimental design shenzhen is located on the southeast coast of china with a humid subtropical climate the annual average temperature is 22 and the annual average rainfall is 1770 mm the rainfall is characterized by high intensity short duration and short adp of 2 3 d on average in rainy seasons from april to september most of the rainfall events in shenzhen occur during rainy seasons he et al 2020 a total of 13 rainfall events were carried out from july 24 to august 28 in 2018 the temperature fluctuated between 26 7 and 31 1 based on the properties of rainfall characteristics in the study area these rainfall events were designed to have rainfall ranging from 20 mm to 40 mm rainfall intensity ranging from 30 mm h to 65 mm h and adp ranging from 1 d to 5 d it was assumed that the catchment area of the bioretention system was 20 times its surface area the synthetic runoff was prepared to mimic local urban runoff he et al 2020 event mean concentration emc ranges of inflow nh4 n no3 n and on are 1 0 4 8 mg n l 2 8 8 0 mg n l and 0 1 3 5 mg n l respectively the details of designed rainfall events are shown in table a1 the column was watered with 70 l synthetic runoff every 3 days for 2 months to allow for a stable state of the bioretention systems before the experiment 2 2 3 sampling and analysis the wet period was from the beginning of rainfall to the end of outflow the dry period was the period from the end of the outflow to the beginning of the next rainfall during each wet period water samples were collected at valve b fig 2 at intervals of 5 20 min in the first hour and then at intervals of 30 60 min until there was no water flowing out each sampling time was 1 min outflow rates were calculated according to the water volume collected within 1 min of each sampling during each dry period water samples in the submerged zone were collected at valve c fig 2 at intervals of 3 12 h in the first 48 h and then at intervals of 24 h until the next wet period all water samples were immediately filtered through 0 22 µm membrane filters and then frozen as soon as possible before further analysis the concentration of nh4 n no3 n and tn were determined by using the salicylic acid spectrophotometry method hj 536 2009 the hydrazine sulfate reduction method gb t5750 5 2006 and the alkaline potassium persulphate digestion uv spectrophotometric method hj 636 2012 respectively 2 3 data processing 2 3 1 methods of model evaluation 1 method of model verification the measured data of outflow rates and the concentration of nh4 n no3 n and tn from july 24 to august 7 in 2018 were used for calibration and the measured

respectively nsedry nh4 n nsedry no3 n and nsedry tn were calculated by using nh4 n no3 n and tn concentration data in the submerged zone during the dry periods respectively if values of these nse i e nsewet nh4 n nsewet no3 n nsewet tn nsedry nh4 n nsedry no3 n and nerdist in the calibration and validation were all greater than 0 5 the corresponding nitrogen module parameters set was determined as

by randomly sampled parameter sets throughout the monte carlo simulations the parameter ranges were listed in table 3 20 000 parameter sets were retained in the study the nse was chosen as the likelihood objective function a threshold of the likelihood objective function was set to 0 5 to demonstrate whether additional monitoring of nitrogen concentration in the submerged zone during the dry periods can reduce prediction uncertainty or not in addition to monitoring outflow nitrogen concentration during wet periods we compared the difference in prediction uncertainty between the two settings setting 1 using nse values in wet and dry periods as likelihood objective functions i e nsewet nh4 n nsewet no3 n nsewet tn nsedry nh4 n nsedry no3 n and nsedry tn setting 2 only using nse values in wet periods as likelihood objective functions i e nsewet nh4 n nsewet no3 n nsewet tn in each setting only when the likelihood objective functions in the calibration and validation periods were all greater than 0 5 the corresponding parameter sets were divided into behavioral parameter sets the outflow or submerged zone concentrations of nh4 n no3 n and tn at each time step calculated by the behavioral parameter sets were arranged in descending order respectively and the quantiles of 95 and 5 were taken as the upper and lower limits of 90 confidence interval respectively the average bandwidth of 90 confidence interval was used to evaluate the difference in prediction uncertainty between the two likelihood objective function s settings the average bandwidth was calculated as follows 21 average b a n d w i d t h k i 1 n c up i c low i n k n h 4 n n o 3 n o r t n where average bandwidthk k nh4 n no3 n or tn means the average bandwidth of outflow or submerged zone nh4 n

sensitivity analysis we used the modified morris screening method for the sensitivity analysis of the hydrological and nitrogen modules parameters in the submerged zone the analysis period was the calibration and validation periods when one of the parameters was chosen to perform sensitivity analysis the other parameters remained unchanged the parameter was perturbed by a fixed step size of 10 the disturbance ranges were as follows 50 40 30 20 10 0 10 20 30 40 and 50 the initial value of each parameter was chosen as the value after calibration table 3 the model was run once for each parameter s one disturbance change and the disturbance and simulation of the other parameters were performed in sequence the output values i e outflow nh4 n emc no3 n emc and tn emc during the calibration and validation periods were used as the basis for sensitivity analysis respectively the average value of the elementary effect s was used to evaluate the sensitivity of parameters as follows 22 s k 0 m 1 y y 1 y y y 0 p y 1 p p m 1 k n h 4 n n o 3 n o r t n where sk k nh4 n no3 n or tn means the average value of the elementary effect of outflow nh4 n emc outflow no3 n emc or

out n in 100 k n h 4 n n o 3 n o r t n where removal ratek k nh4 n no3 n or tn means the load removal rate of nh4 n no3 n or tn respectively nin and nout are the inflow and outflow nitrogen load respectively 2 4 scenarios design simulations of short term alternate dry wet conditions depths of the submerged zone were designed as ranges from 0 mm to 500 mm according to the technical guide for comprehensive utilization of rainwater for low impact development szdb z 145 2015 the vertically lifting height of the outlet elbow is consistent with the depth of the submerged zone which means we increase the depth of the submerged zone under the soil layer the simulation duration was 60 days adp was 3 days rainfall intensity and duration in each rainfall event were 20 mm h and 1 h respectively the air temperature was 28 the confluence ratio was 20 1 inflow concentrations of nh4 n no3 n and on were all set as 3 mg n l the depths of the ponding layer and soil layer were 150 mm and 500 mm respectively the initial value of soil moisture was the wilting point water depth in the submerged zone and nitrogen concentration in the system were zero the time step was 1 min simulations of long term alternate dry wet conditions depths of the submerged zone were designed as ranges from 0 mm to 500 mm the simulation duration was one year we used the measured air temperature rainfall and inflow rates of shenzhen in 2020 as the input data the input data of nh4 n inflow concentration was calculated according to pollutant build up and wash off equations in the transportation area chen et al 2019 according to the measured nitrogen data in the relevant literature ding et al 2022 the no3 n and on inflow concentrations were set to be 2 times and 6 times nh4 n inflow concentration respectively time adjacent rainfall events were differentiated according to the adp that was more than 6 h apart other settings were the same as scenario group 1 the details of each rainfall event temperature adp and nitrogen inflow concentration in 2020 were shown in table a2 3 results and discussion 3 1 model evaluation 3 1 1 model calibration and validation for outflow rates nsewet q during the wet period in the calibration and validation are 0 9 and 0 8 respectively fig 3 a for outflow concentrations of nitrogen nsewet nh4 n nsewet no3 n nsewet tn during the wet periods in the calibration and validation are all greater than 0 5 for nitrogen concentrations of the submerged zone nsedry nh4 n nsedry no3 n and nsedry tn during the dry periods in the calibration and validation are all greater than 0 6 fig 3 b d the above results mean that the proposed model can simulate not only processes of outflow rates and outflow nitrogen concentration during the wet periods but also nitrogen transformation of the submerged zone during the dry periods therefore we used the model to simulate the effect of the submerged zone on the nitrogen removal efficiency of a layered bioretention system the calibrated values of hydrological and nitrogen modules parameters are shown in table 3 3 1 2 prediction uncertainty average bandwidths of 90 confidence intervals in outflow sz nh4 n no3 n and tn obtained by using nse values in wet and dry periods as likelihood objective functions i e setting 1 are 0 35 mg n l 1 39 mg n l and 1 77 mg n l respectively while average bandwidths of outflow sz nh4 n no3 n and tn obtained by using only nse values in wet periods as likelihood objective functions i e setting 2 are 0 48 mg n l 1 94 mg n l and 2 11 mg n l respectively the average bandwidths of outflow sz nh4 n no3 n and tn in using nse values in setting 1 are 27 1 28 4 and 16 1 less than that of setting 2 respectively outflow sz nh4 n no3 n and tn means nh4 n no3 n and tn concentration during the outflow process or in the submerged zone this result shows that prediction uncertainties of outflow sz nh4 n no3 n and tn can be significantly reduced by using nse values of the wet and dry periods as likelihood objective function than only using nse values of the wet periods the result indicates that in addition to monitoring outflow nitrogen concentration during the wet periods monitoring nitrogen concentration in the submerged zone during the dry periods is also necessary especially when we want to reduce prediction uncertainty 3 1 3 parameters sensitivity analysis for outflow nh4 n emc no3 n emc or tn emc in wet periods hydrological module parameters in the submerged zone with at least moderate sensitivity s 0 05 are η and ф3 most of the nitrogen module parameters in the submerged zone are at least moderately sensitive for outflow nh4 n emc no3 n emc or tn emc fig 4 the results show the η and ф3 have an obvious impact on the nitrogen simulations therefore it is recommended to obtain the value of η and ф3 through experiment tests before simulating outflow nitrogen concentrations of layered bioretention systems with the submerged zone moreover the results indicate that it is essential to consider the nitrogen transformation processes e g mineralization nitrification and denitrification in the submerged zone for example although the mineralization rate in the submerged zone was not fast it could still have moderate sensitivity to the effluent nh4 n emc at about a month scale note the emc of nitrogen i e nh4 n no3 n and tn for sensitivity analysis referred to the average effluent nitrogen i e nh4 n no3 n and tn concentrations over 13 rainfall events during calibration and validation periods parameters sensitivity results related to the soil layer are shown in fig a1 3 2 effect of submerged zone on nitrogen removal efficiency 3 2 1 effect of submerged zone depth on nitrogen removal efficiency under short term alternate dry wet conditions we aimed to analyze the effects of different submerged zone depths on one rainfall event s nitrogen removal performance in order to avoid the impact of the initial nitrogen concentration value on the nitrogen removal performance of single rainfall event we designed short term simulations i e the duration of the short term simulation was 60 d and adp was 3 d the last rainfall event during the short term simulation was selected for analysis nh4 n removal rates of the last rainfall event during the short term simulation are 46 57 67 73 78 and 81 with the submerged zone depth of 0 100 mm 200 mm 300 mm 400 mm and 500 mm respectively the corresponding no3 n removal rates are 13 18 31 41 49 and 55 respectively the corresponding tn removal rates are 29 38 46 53 58 and 61 respectively fig 5 a the results show that removal rates of nh4 n no3 n and tn all increase with the increase of the depth of the submerged zone the results indicate that the thicker the submerged zone is the more water will be stored in the submerged zone more nitrogen nh4 n no3 n and on will be removed in the dry period and then the inflow nitrogen concentration will be diluted in the next rainfall in the wet period the initial outflow concentrations refer to the last rainfall event s concentrations during the short term simulation of nh4 n no3 n and tn in the system without a submerged zone are 1 71 mg n l 2 23 mg n l and 5 47 mg n l respectively the initial outflow concentrations of nh4 n no3 n and tn in the system with a submerged zone of 100 500 mm are about 0 08 mg n l 0 23 mg n l and 1 66 mg n l respectively fig 5 b1 b2 and b3 the results reveal two things on the one hand the initial outflow concentration of the system with a submerged zone is significantly lower than that of the system without a submerged zone because compared to the system without a submerged zone the system with a submerged zone not only removes nitrogen in the soil layer but also carries out mineralization nitrification and denitrification in the submerged zone to remove on nh4 n and no3 n respectively on the other hand we found that the increase in the submerged zone depth would not affect the initial outflow concentrations of nh4 n no3 n and tn due to the low exchange rate between inflow water and water stored in the submerged zone before the beginning of the outflow the initial outflow concentration is basically equal to the nitrogen concentration in the submerged zone moreover we found that nearly 3 days of the dry period is enough to reduce the nitrogen concentration in the submerged zone to a very low level fig 5 this result may suggest that a 72 hour retention period in the bioretention systems design is reasonable besides although the nitrogen concentrations of different submerged zone depths were basically the same at the 72nd hour the increase of submerged zone depths could promote the increase of nitrogen removal rate when the next rainfall event comes fig 5 a by increasing water storage space and diluting the inflow nitrogen concentration the peak nitrogen concentration of the last rainfall event during the short term simulation gradually decreases with the increase of the submerged zone depth fig 5 b1 b2 and b3 the exchange rate between inflow volume and water storage in the submerged zone during the wet period accounts for the results the thicker the depth of the submerged zone the lower the exchange rate between the inflow volume and the submerged zone s water furthermore we found that the peak concentration of no3 n appeared within a few hours after the end of the wet period fig 5 b2 this result indicates that the nitrification rate is greater than the denitrification rate in the first one or two hours of the dry period and the concentration of no3 n in the submerged zone will continue to rise however with the proceeding of nitrification the concentration of do and nh4 n decreases making the denitrification rate gradually increase until it is greater than the nitrification rate and then the concentration of no3 n decreases 3 2 2 effect of submerged zone depth on nitrogen removal efficiency under long term alternate dry wet conditions the annual rainfall was 1284 mm in 2020 and the annual average daily temperature was 23 9 rainfall events 1 mm in 2020 were divided into 35 rainfall events with adps less than 1 5 d and 21 rainfall events with adps more than 1 5 d emc ranges of inflow nh4 n no3 n and tn were 0 4 1 17 mg n l 0 81 2 35 mg n l and 3 64 10 55 mg n l respectively the annual tn removal rates of the bioretention system with the different submerged zone depths 36 5 48 3 are significantly higher than that of the system without the submerged zone 31 the average nitrogen removal rates nh4 n no3 n and tn for rainfall events in the bioretention system with the submerged zone are significantly higher than that of the system without the submerged zone fig 6 adding a submerged zone can increase removal rates by storing more runoff more importantly a submerged zone can increase the amount of nitrogen removed during the dry period especially by promoting denitrification to remove no3 n for example the average no3 n removal rate for the rainfall events in the year without a submerged zone is negative 12 6 while the no3 n removal rate increases by 14 2 with a 100 mm submerged zone besides compared with bioretention systems without submerged zones adding an elbow to create a submerged zone will restrict outflow rates and extend outflow duration on one hand it indicates that bioretention systems with submerged zones are prone to flooding on the other hand it also indicates that the systems with submerged zones will improve the ability to delay peak outflow rates the average nitrogen removal rate nh4 n no3 n and tn for the rainfall events in the year gradually increases as the depth of the submerged zone increases generally speaking the increase of submerged zone depth helps to remove more nitrogen in dry periods due to the storage volume of the submerged zone increases when the next rainfall comes the larger the storage volume of the submerged zone the more inflow of nitrogen can be diluted thereby improving the nitrogen removal rate however we found that changes in the submerged zone depth had almost no impact on the no3 n and tn removal rates in several rainfall events i e outliers in fig 6 b and c the adps of these rainfall events were short less than 1 5 d so that there was not enough time for nitrogen to be removed in the submerged zone and the concentration of inflow nitrogen no3 n and tn from the current rainfall was smaller than that of the previous rainfall making the nitrogen concentration entering into the submerged zone smaller than the nitrogen concentration of the submerged zone itself therefore nitrogen leaching would occur during these rainfall events and with the increase of submerged zone depth the dilution effect of inflow nitrogen on the submerged zone nitrogen attenuated leading to a greater outflow nitrogen concentration consequently an increase in the submerged zone depth even harmed the nitrogen removal rate of these events in addition the relationship between adps and the nitrogen removal rates was analyzed the result of bioretention system with 300 mm sz was taken as an example for rainfall events with adp less than 3 d the nitrogen removal rate fluctuated widely and the removal rates of nh4 n no3 n and tn ranged from 0 01 to 86 6 154 1 to 80 7 and 10 6 to 75 9 respectively fig 7 rainfall events with adp less than 3 days had a wide range of rainfall 1 53 2 mm and the variations of effluent nh4 n no3 n and tn loads were also wide which resulted in large fluctuation of nitrogen removal rates for rainfall events with adp greater than 3 d the removal rates of nh4 n no3 n and tn were greater than 41 7 20 7 and 47 2 respectively fig 7 the inflow volume of rainfall events the rainfall less than 10 mm was completely retained by the system and the corresponding nitrogen removal rates were all 100 4 conclusion based on the hydrological and nitrogen monitoring data of the bioretention system during the wet and dry periods this paper proposed a layered bioretention system model that can simulate the nitrogen transformation processes under dry wet alternations the model simulated well in outflow nitrogen concentration nh4 n no3 n and tn during wet periods and the nitrogen concentration of the submerged zone during dry periods nse 0 5 the results of uncertainty analysis demonstrated the importance of monitoring the change of nitrogen concentration in the submerged zone during dry periods the prediction uncertainty results show that the prediction uncertainty of outflow submerged zone nitrogen concentration nh4 n no3 n and tn can be significantly reduced by using nse values of the wet and dry periods as likelihood objective function than only using nse values of the wet periods furthermore the sensitivity analysis results reinforced the significance of the nitrogen transformation processes in the submerged zone we found that outflow nitrogen concentration nh4 n no3 n or tn is sensitive to most of the nitrogen module parameters in the submerged zone e g knitw 3 kden 3 kmin 3 and cdomax the simulation of short term dry wet alterations reveals that the bioretention system with a submerged zone can significantly reduce the initial outflow nitrogen concentration in the next rainfall by removing nitrogen from the submerged zone during the dry period more importantly we found that in the long term dry wet alterations simulation the increase of submerged zone depth can improve the annual average nitrogen removal rate however it does not always improve nitrogen removal rates in rainfall events if a rainfall event with short adp 1 5 d and the inflow nitrogen concentration in the current event is less than that in the previous event nitrogen leaching is prone to occur and an increase of the submerged zone depth will even reduce the nitrogen removal rate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
