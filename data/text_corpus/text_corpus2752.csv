then the important influential factors for the demulsification such as the demulsiﬁer concentration standing time and the emulsions salinity were investigated standing for 120 min at room temperature the transmittance of the separated water could reach 91 5 by adding 50 mg l of ptc demulsifier it showed much lower demulsification temperature and higher demulsification efficiency than previously reported demulsifers the coalescence process of oil droplets in emulsions can be clearly understood by microscopic images and droplets size distribution further surface tensions dynamic interfacial tensions and zeta potential provided corresponding clues to the possible demulsification mechanism it can be concluded that the hyperbranched demulsifier has potential application for the treatment of wastewater and the current work may be helpful to explore the demulsiﬁcation mechanism keywords dendrimer based demulsifier demulsification mechanism oil water emulsions 1 introduction with the development of crude oil exploration technology major oilfields have successively entered the tertiary oil recovery phase and petroleum resources have been gradually reduced 1 2 the crude oil produced in oil field has been transformed from incipient water in oil emulsions to oil in water emulsions these oil containing emulsions must be treated thoroughly because of the requirement of the transportation and refinement 3 however surface active substances in the emulsions make it fairly stable 4 5 it is difficult to separate the oil from the emulsions if there is no additional means at present there are many methods of demulsification such as centrifugation 6 microwave and heat treatment 7 8 membrane separation 9 10 flocculation 11 chemical demulsification 12 14 biotechnology 15 17 and so on the demulsifiers can destroy the interficial film by substituting the interfacial active substances or altering the surface wettability of the particles at the interface to rapidly induce the merging of the droplets 18 19 compared with other methods chemical demulsification is more convenient and effective hyperbranched polymers as demulsifiers have many unique properties compared to other demulsifiers for example the hyperbranched polymers have unique three dimensional topological structure a small hydrodynamic radius of rotation and the molecular chain is less entangled therefore the increase in relative molecular mass has a little impact on viscosity also the molecules have large amounts of reactive functional groups at the terminal molecular chains so the hyperbranched polymers are easily modified to obtain new functional materials 20 21 there the application of hyperbranched polymers in demulsification has received great attention wang et al 22 synthesized the broom molecules with dodecylamine and methyl acrylate as raw materials by using the michael addition method with the concentration of 20 mg l its demulsification efficiency reached 73 09 at 50 for 120 min although the demulsification concentration is very low the demulsification efficiency needs to be improved li et al 23 synthesized a novel branched polyether with 1 1 2 2 tetrakis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane as central core the results showed that the higher the ppo peo ratio the stronger the demulsification ability of w o emulsions when 50 mg l of demulsifier was used in a low viscosity crude oil emulsions at 65 for 60 min the dehydration rate could reach more than 90 zhang et al 24 25 successfully synthesized the hyperbranched poly amido amine demulsifiers using a simple one pot method and it effectively avoided the tedious and time consuming preparation process the demulsifier had better demulsification efficiency with lower dosage in a short time but its optimal demulsification temperature is 60 in our previous work 26 4 4 diaminodiphenyl methane was used as the initial core to prepare a hyperbranched demulsifier although the demulsifier had excellent demulsification performance in diesel water emulsions it still needed high demulsification temperature of 60 it is reported that generations branch structure terminal groups and central core of hydrobranched molecules could greatly affect the demulsification performance 27 bi et al 28 synthesized two polyamidoamine based hyperbranched molecules for the oil in water emulsions the central core with rigid benzyl or flexible octyl as hydrophobic tails was used in their research it was found that the hydrophobic tails of the core greatly influence the demulsification performance although there are many studies for the synthesis of hyperbranched demusifers most of them used the hydrophilic central core a few of them discussed the effect of the hydrophobicity of central core on the demulsification moreover it is difficult for them to efficiently break the oil water emulsions at room temperature the demulsification at room temperature can simplify the operational process and increase security thereby ultimately reduce energy consumption and costs therefore the room temperature is an ideal condition for the emulsions treatment in industry in this paper a simple one pot method was used to prepare the hyperbranched poly amidoamine ptc with trimethyl citrate as central core especially a hydrophilic hydroxyl was attached to the central core the ptc demulsifier has potential application in petroleum industry due to its excellent performance at room temperature 2 experimental 2 1 materials trimethyl citrate ethylenediamine and methyl acrylate were supplied by sinopharm chemical reagent limited corporation span 80 and tween 80 were provided by qingdao usolf chemical technology co ltd methanol and ethyl ether were purchased from shanghai aladdin bio chem technology co ltd commercial diesel 0 ρ25 0 83 g cm 3 η25 5 41 mpa s was provided by china petroleum gas station all chemicals were of analytical purity and used directly without further puriﬁcation 2 2 synthesis of ptc the ptc demulsifier was synthesized with trimethyl citrate as the initial core ethylenediamine and methyl acrylate as the internal skeleton by the one pot method 21 the synthesis process mainly consists of three steps first trimethyl citrate 0 01 mol was dissolved into 30 ml of methanol and transferred to the flask 0 03 mol of ethylenediamine was slowly dropped into the mixed solution the reaction was performed at ambient temperature for 24 h then methyl acrylate 0 18 mol and ethylenediamine 0 15 mol were added into the flask and the reaction continued to remain for 24 h finally the following treatments were performed in a vacuum 60 for 1 h 80 for 1 h 100 for 2 h and 120 for 2 h the final product was obtained and the yield of ptc was 81 87 the simple synthesis route is displayed in fig 1 2 3 characterizations of ptc the 1h nmr spectra of synthesized ptc was performed through a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer bruker advanc iii 400 deuterium oxide was used as the solvent and operating at 400 mhz the nicolet 6700 spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa was employed to measure the ft ir spectra at a temperature ranged from 30 to 600 and scanning rate of 10 min the thermos stability was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis tga gel permeation chromatography gpc trsec model302 was performed to measure the molecular weight of ptc the dynamic interfacial tensions of ptc aqueous solutions with different concentrations were measured at room temperature using the pendant drop method with a digital tensiometer kruss germany also an interfacial tensiometer kruss germany was used to measure its surface tensions at different temperatures 2 4 preparation of the emulsions span 80 0 09 g tween 80 0 9 g diesel 50 g and distilled water 450 ml were successively added to the mixing cup and stirred at 11000 r min for 20 min using a homogenizer fj 200 shanghai the resulting emulsions was typical oil in water and kept stable at least 24 h in which diesel content was 10 wt 2 5 bottle test the demulsification ability of the ptc demulsifier was evaluated by the bottle test the diesel emulsions 19 ml and ptc aqueous solutions 1 ml with different dosages were added into different bottles and thoroughly mixed by shaking the mixture about 200 times then these bottles were placed at room temperature after that the light transmittance of separated water at different standing times was measured to estimate the demulsification capability of ptc 2 6 thermodynamic calculation the critical micelle concentration cmc and related thermodynamic parameters were discussed according to surface tensions of different concentrations of demulsifiers at different temperatures the calculation formula is as follows the reduction of surface tensions πcmc mn m is given by 1 π cmc γ 0 γ cmc the maximum adsorption capacity гmax mol m2 is given by 2 γ max 10 7 1 rt dγ dlnc t the minimum area per molecule amin nm2 is given by 3 a min 10 16 γ max n a the free energy of micellization δgmic kj mol and adsorption δgads kj mol are given by 4 δ g mic rtln x cmc 5 δ g ads δ g mic 0 6023 π cmc a min where γ0 is the surface tensions of pure water γcmc is the surface tensions at cmc r and na are the molar gas constant and avogadro s constant respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the ptc demulsifier the obtained 1h nmr spectra of ptc is shown in fig 2 the 1h chemical shifts are as follows f and j are at 2 29 e is at 2 49 i is at 2 58 d h and l are at 2 71 c g and k are at 3 22 b and a are at 3 58 and 5 25 respectively the chemical shift at 4 71 ppm is the oh peak of d2o it is reported that the characteristic chemical shifts of hyperbranched molecules are located at 2 50 3 50 ppm and the signals of ch2 are usually located at 2 50 3 00 ppm 26 because the protons on different parts of the ptc demulsifier molecule have similar positions they have the same chemical shift for example d h and l are located at 2 71 ppm the average molecular weight of ptc was acquired by gpc the molar mass of number average and weigh average are 3639 and 11463 respectively the polydispersity index is 3 15 the fourier transform infrared ft ir spectrum obtained to identify the organic functional groups on ptc is shown in fig 3 it is obvious that the peak located at 3289 75 cm 1 is nh2 vibration bands the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of ch2 are located at around 2924 22 cm 1 and 2851 17 cm 1 respectively the peak at 1638 81 cm 1 is ascribed to the c o stretching the peak at 1555 97 cm 1 is associated with the coupling band of n h bending and c n stretching the two peaks can confirm the existence of conh groups a typical c n vibration in n ch2 can be seen at 1250 63 cm 1 the peaks at 3094 13 cm 1 and 1435 35 cm 1 are the stretching vibration and plane bending vibration band of oh respectively the peak at 1114 67 cm 1 is the stretching vibration band of c o as mentioned above the ft ir spectra combined with 1h nmr spectra confirm that the target product has been successfully synthesized 3 2 thermogravimetric analysis the thermal stability of the ptc demulsifier was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis tga under n2 atmosphere as shown in fig 4 the weight loss is about 12 below 200 the weight loss occurring at lower temperatures can be divided into two parts the one is unreacted monomers and solvents which remained in the cavity formed by the special three dimensional structure of the demulsifier molecule the other is the water molecules in the air adsorbed by abundant terminal amino groups of the demulsifier molecules as the temperature continues to rise the dtg curve shows a significant peak at 270 indicating that the demulsifier sample is rapidly losing weight which is attributed to the breaking of the chemical bond in the demulsifier molecules the weight loss is approximately 65 between 215 500 and the residual char is about 20 the result of thermogravimetric analysis shows that the ptc demulsifier has a good thermal stability 3 3 surface tensions and thermodynamic calculation the surface tensions of ptc with different concentrations at different temperatures are shown in fig 5 at room temperature the surface tensions of pure water is about 72 5 mn m and that of 100 mg l ptc solution is 51 41 mn m it indicates that ptc molecules can effectively reduce the surface tensions of water however it is obvious that the surface tension at different temperatures initially decreases with increasing demulsifier concentration and then an apparent turning point appears almost reaching a constant value this turning point is referred to critical micelle concentration cmc at this point the demulsifier molecules assemble into micelles one by one and the interactions between these molecules are in equilibrium therefore the surface tensions approaches a constant value with the increase of the concentration 29 the formation of the ptc micelles is driven mainly by weak intermolecular non covalent interactions such as van der waals forces hydrogen bonds hydrophobic interactions electrostatic interactions and π π interactions 30 the related surface active and thermodynamic parameters values of the ptc demulsifier at different temperature are listed in table 1 obviously the minimum surface area per molecule amin decreases with the increase of temperature it reflects that the ptc molecules form a more compact micelle 31 probably it is due to the decrease of hydrophilicity of the ptc molecules therefore the maximum surface excess concentration γmax is correspondingly increased although the difference of δgmic and δgads is not very obvious δgmic is always higher than δgads at all temperatures it demonstrates that ptc tends to transfer to the oil water interface instead of micellization moreover δgmic and δgads decrease with the increase of temperature indicating that the temperature can promote demulsifier molecules to form micelles or adsorb at the interface especially it is beneficial to the adsorption process of the demulsifier molecules 3 4 interfacial tensions the dynamic interfacial tensions can help to understand the adsorption kinetics of demulsifier molecules at the interface also it can reflect the capacity of the demulsifier molecules to destroy the interfacial film 12 32 to investigate the effect of interfacial activity on demulsification efficiency the interfacial tensions of ptc in diesel was examined as shown in fig 6 the oil water interfacial tensions can be effectively reduced by ptc in a short time it shows that the demulsifier molecules can quickly penetrate into interfacial film moreover the interfacial tensions decreases with the increase of the ptc concentration which is consistent with the demulsification performance the interfacial tensions is inclined to remain unchanged when the time extends to more than 1000s which shows that the interaction between the demulsifier molecules and the original interfacial active surfactants reaches a dynamic equilibrium at the oil water interface it can be concluded that ptc can quickly migrate to the interface and replace the original surfactant thus reduce the interfacial tensions due to the special three dimensional structure and abundant terminal amino groups on demulsifier molecules 25 3 5 zeta potential to explore the demulsification mechanism zeta potentials of the emulsions before and after demulsification were measured the ph values of the emulsions and separated water are about 6 5 as shown in fig 7 a zeta potential of fresh oil water emulsions is 38 13 mv which means that the oil droplets have large electrostatic repulsion it implies that the coalescence between oil droplets will be impossible under the action of electrostatic repulsion 28 however when the emulsions are treated with 50 mg l of demulsifier for 10 min at 25 zeta potential of the separated waster increases sharply to 2 7 mv the change in zeta potential reflects the charge neutralization in the system which is favorable for the oil water separation in emulsions fig 7b shows the effect of different ptc concentrations on zeta potential of the separated water after demulsifying for 1 h at 25 although the demulsifier can effectively increase zeta potential the increase of the concentration has little effect on it when the concentration of the demulsifier is 50 mg l the zeta potential has the largest value which is consistent with the demulsification efficiency as a result it can be concluded that ptc reduce the electrostatic repulsion barrier in emulsions increasing the possibility of the oil droplets to coalesce each other 33 3 6 demulsification performance for the purpose of demonstrating the demulsification capacity of ptc several important influence factors such as demulsifier concentration standing time and salinity were systematically investigated fig 8 a shows the effect of the ptc concentrations on the transmittance of the separated water standing for different times at 25 the blank test shows that as prepared emulsions are very stable within a relatively long period time because the transmittance is still 0 at 120 min the demulsifier concentration in emulsions was set from 10 mg l to 50 mg l it is clear that the transmittance of aqueous phase increases with the increase of the demulsifier concentration and standing time after standing for 30 min the transmittance of the separated water with 50 mg l of ptc is only 31 3 however when the standing time is prolonged to 120 min the transmittance of the separated water with different ptc concentrations is 60 9 73 1 82 5 87 3 and 91 5 respectively also the photographs of the samples are shown in fig 8b it can be seen that the separated water is very clear particularly the water phase is not significantly different from the distilled water in appearance when the concentration is 50 mg l it demonstrates that ptc with low dosage has distinguished demulsification capacity at room temperature the performance of the ptc demulsifier is obviously superior to that of the traditional hyperbranched demulsifier which may be due to the following two aspects first the central core can provide three initial branches due to three ester groups of trimethyl citrate so the hyperbranched molecules with the same radius have more terminal amine groups therefore the interaction between hyperbranched molecules and surfactants is enhanced making the emulsions unstable in addition the charged branches of demulsifier molecules would be opened to form hollow interior under the action of the electrostatic interactions in emulsions 34 the active substances at the interface can be adsorbed bridged and dissolved by the nano cages formed with demulsifier molecules 35 when the nano cages adsorbed on the oil droplets the stability of the oil water interface is easily destroyed in this process the hydrophilicity of the hydroxyl groups on the central core may be play an important role it can assist in the dissolution of the surfactants and improve the destabilization of the emulsions 28 36 therefore the oil droplets can easily coalesce each other and result in the oil separation from the emulsions since oily wastewater produced during crude oil extraction usually contains various amounts of electrolyte salts 37 38 therefore the demulsification performance of ptc demulsifier in emulsions with different dosages of nacl was investigated and the separated water transmittance after demulsifying with 50 mg l of ptc is displayed in fig 9 it is observed that a small amount of salts may promote the demulsification effect which may be because the salinity of the emulsions can increase the hydrophilic lipophilic deviation of the demulsifier thereby enhancing the demulsification effect 39 then the demulsification efficiency decreases gradually with the increase of the salinity of the emulsions the possible reason is that higher salinity changed the interfacial properties of the emulsions 40 however the demulsification efficiency of ptc demulsifier in the emulsions containing 1000 mg l salt merely decreases by 11 1 compared with the original emulsion when the standing time is 120 min the results show that ptc demulsifier has a relatively good salt tolerance 3 7 effect of standing time on size distribution of oil droplets the average oil droplets size and its distribution versus standing time are displayed in fig 10 the concentration of the ptc demulsifier is 50 mg l it can be seen from fig 10a that the average droplets size of original emulsions is about 2 5 μm it is consistent with the micrograph of the original emulsions it is reported that these emulsions containing ultrafine oil droplets is extremely difficult to treat 35 when the ptc demulsifier is added into the emulsions the average oil droplets size increases at first and then decreases gradually as shown in fig 10b the larger oil droplets increase significantly after demulsifying for 10 min and then the larger oil droplets gradually disappear with the increase of demulsification time coalescence of large oil droplets induce the formation of oil clusters and then the oil clusters float up to the top of the emulsions under the action of the gravity as a result the large size of oil droplets in emulsions will become less and less the demulsification process is shown in fig 11 due to its special multi branched structure and abundant amine terminated groups the ptc molecules can quickly migrate to the interface and destroy the interface film subsequently the coalescence of oil droplets is triggered 41 the average particle size reached a maximum at 10 minutes and the oil water separation occurred under the action of gravity as shown in fig 11b c the large oil droplets move to the upper layer and there are a few oil droplets in the separated water therefore it is concluded that the ptc demulsifiers can efficiently flocculate and coalesce oil droplets to achieve the oil water separation in emulsions 3 8 micro examination of the demulsification process for the purpose of understanding the demulsification process of ptc demulsifier in oil water emulsions microscopic images were observed with a polarizing microscope in the micrograph the dispersed phase is oil and the continuous phase is water as shown in fig 12 oil cluster 1 and 2 approached in the direction of the arrows however the oil clusters did not merge together quickly due to the presence of the interface film then the oil clusters 2 enlarged gradually so that the contact area also increased eventually the interface film fracture appeared in the white circle in fig 12c and the two oil clusters coalesced together to form a larger oil cluster combined with fig 11 the process mainly includes two steps first the ptc molecules can easily migrate to the interface due to its special three dimensional structure and plentiful terminal amino groups second it replace the original interfacial active substance in the interface film 42 it reduces the strength of the interface film and promotes the droplets coalescence furthermore the low interfacial tension of the demulsifier can increase the droplets size and improves the droplets rearrangement in emulsions finally leading to the demulsification 13 4 conclusions the dendrimer based demulsifier with trimethyl citrate as initial core was synthesized using a simple one pot method at room temperature the light transmittance of separated water reached 91 5 when 50 mg l of ptc demulsifier was used in diesel oil in water emulsions for 120 min it showed lower demulsification temperature and higher demulsification efficiency than previously reported demulsifers microscopic images and particles size distribution can clearly understand the change of oil droplets in water phase after demulsification surface tensions dynamic interfacial tensions and zeta potential were measured to better understand the possible demulsification mechanism the analysis of dynamic interfacial tensions and zeta potential showed that the displacement and electrostatic neutralization of ptc played a key roles in the process of oil water separation moreover thermodynamic parameters was calculated by the measured surface tensions for the explanation of the demulsificaton the hyperbranched demulsifiers have a good application prospect for the oil water separation of the emulsions author

rapidly losing weight which is attributed to the breaking of the chemical bond in the demulsifier molecules the weight loss is approximately 65 between 215 500 and the residual char is about 20 the result of thermogravimetric analysis shows that the ptc demulsifier has a good thermal stability 3 3 surface tensions and thermodynamic calculation the surface tensions of ptc with different concentrations at different temperatures are shown in fig 5 at room temperature the surface tensions of pure water is about 72 5 mn m and that of 100 mg l ptc solution is 51 41 mn m it indicates that ptc molecules can effectively reduce the surface tensions of water however it is obvious that the surface tension at different temperatures initially decreases with increasing demulsifier concentration and then an apparent turning point appears almost reaching a constant value this turning point is referred to critical micelle concentration cmc at this point the demulsifier molecules assemble into micelles one by one and the interactions between these molecules are in equilibrium therefore the surface tensions approaches a constant value with the increase of the concentration 29 the formation of the ptc micelles is driven mainly by weak intermolecular non covalent interactions such as van der waals forces hydrogen bonds hydrophobic interactions electrostatic interactions and π π interactions 30 the related surface active and thermodynamic parameters values of the ptc demulsifier at different temperature are listed in table 1 obviously the minimum surface area per molecule amin decreases with the increase of temperature it reflects that the ptc molecules form a more compact micelle 31 probably it is due to the decrease of hydrophilicity of the ptc molecules therefore the maximum surface excess concentration γmax is correspondingly increased although the difference of δgmic and δgads is not very obvious δgmic is always higher than δgads at all temperatures it demonstrates that ptc tends to transfer to the oil water interface instead of micellization moreover δgmic and δgads decrease with the increase of temperature indicating that the temperature can promote demulsifier molecules to form micelles or adsorb at the interface especially it is beneficial to the adsorption process of the demulsifier molecules 3 4 interfacial tensions the dynamic interfacial tensions can help to understand the adsorption kinetics of demulsifier molecules at the interface also it can reflect the capacity of the demulsifier molecules to destroy the interfacial film 12 32 to investigate the effect of interfacial activity on demulsification efficiency the interfacial tensions of ptc in diesel was examined as shown in fig 6 the oil water interfacial tensions can be effectively reduced by ptc in a short time it shows that the demulsifier molecules can quickly penetrate into interfacial film moreover the interfacial tensions decreases with the increase of the ptc concentration which is consistent with the demulsification performance the interfacial tensions is inclined to remain unchanged when the time extends to more than 1000s which shows that the interaction between the demulsifier molecules and the original interfacial active surfactants reaches a dynamic equilibrium at the oil water interface it can be concluded that ptc can quickly migrate to the interface and replace the original surfactant thus reduce the interfacial tensions due to the special three dimensional structure and abundant terminal amino groups on demulsifier molecules 25 3 5 zeta potential to explore the demulsification mechanism zeta potentials of the emulsions before and after demulsification were measured the ph values of the emulsions and separated water are about 6 5 as shown in fig 7 a zeta potential of fresh oil water emulsions is 38 13 mv which means that the oil droplets have large electrostatic repulsion it implies that the coalescence between oil droplets will be impossible under the action of electrostatic repulsion 28 however when the emulsions are treated with 50 mg l of demulsifier for 10 min at 25 zeta potential of the separated waster increases sharply to 2 7 mv the change in zeta potential reflects the charge neutralization in the system which is favorable for the oil water separation in emulsions fig 7b shows the effect of different ptc concentrations on zeta potential of the separated water after demulsifying for 1 h at 25 although the demulsifier can effectively increase zeta potential the increase of the concentration has little effect on it when the concentration of the demulsifier is 50 mg l the zeta potential has the largest value which is consistent with the demulsification efficiency as a result it can be concluded that ptc reduce the electrostatic repulsion barrier in emulsions increasing the possibility of the oil droplets to coalesce each other 33 3 6 demulsification performance for the purpose of demonstrating the demulsification capacity of ptc several important influence factors such as demulsifier concentration standing time and salinity were systematically investigated fig 8 a shows the effect of the ptc concentrations on the transmittance of the separated water standing for different times at 25 the blank test shows that as prepared emulsions are very stable within a relatively long period time because the transmittance is still 0 at 120 min the demulsifier concentration in emulsions was set from 10 mg l to 50 mg l it is clear that the transmittance of aqueous phase increases with the increase of the demulsifier concentration and standing time after standing for 30 min the transmittance of the separated water with 50 mg l of ptc is only 31 3 however when the standing time is prolonged to 120 min the transmittance of the separated water with different ptc concentrations is 60 9 73 1 82 5 87 3 and 91 5 respectively also the photographs of the samples are shown in fig 8b it can be seen that the separated water is very clear particularly the water phase is not significantly different from the distilled water in appearance when the concentration is 50 mg l it demonstrates that ptc with low dosage has distinguished demulsification capacity at room temperature the performance of the ptc demulsifier is obviously superior to that of the traditional hyperbranched demulsifier which may be due to the following two aspects first the central core can provide three initial branches due to three ester groups of trimethyl citrate so the hyperbranched molecules with the same radius have more terminal amine groups therefore the interaction between hyperbranched molecules and surfactants is enhanced making the emulsions unstable in addition the charged branches of demulsifier molecules would be opened to form hollow interior under the action of the electrostatic interactions in emulsions 34 the active substances at the interface can be adsorbed bridged and dissolved by the nano cages formed with demulsifier molecules 35 when the nano cages adsorbed on the oil droplets the stability of the oil water interface is easily destroyed in this process the hydrophilicity of the hydroxyl groups on the central core may be play an important role it can assist in the dissolution of the surfactants and improve the destabilization of the emulsions 28 36 therefore the oil droplets can easily coalesce each other and result in the oil separation from the emulsions since oily wastewater produced during crude oil extraction usually contains various amounts of electrolyte salts 37 38 therefore the demulsification performance of ptc demulsifier in emulsions with different dosages of nacl was investigated and the separated water transmittance after demulsifying with 50 mg l of ptc is displayed in fig 9 it is observed that a small amount of salts may promote the demulsification effect which may be because the salinity of the emulsions can increase the hydrophilic lipophilic deviation of the demulsifier thereby enhancing the demulsification effect 39 then the demulsification efficiency decreases gradually with the increase of the salinity of the emulsions the possible reason is that higher salinity changed the interfacial properties of the emulsions 40 however the demulsification efficiency of ptc demulsifier in the emulsions containing 1000 mg l salt merely decreases by 11 1 compared with the original emulsion when the standing time is 120 min the results show that ptc demulsifier has a relatively good salt tolerance 3 7 effect of standing time on size distribution of oil droplets the average oil droplets size and its distribution versus standing time are displayed in fig 10 the concentration of the ptc demulsifier is 50 mg l it can be seen from fig 10a that the average droplets size of original emulsions is about 2 5 μm it is consistent with the micrograph of the original emulsions it is reported that these emulsions containing ultrafine oil droplets is extremely difficult to treat 35 when the ptc demulsifier is added into the emulsions the average oil droplets size increases at first and then decreases gradually as shown in fig 10b the larger oil droplets increase significantly after demulsifying for 10 min and then the larger oil droplets gradually disappear with the increase of demulsification time coalescence of large oil droplets induce the formation of oil clusters and then the oil clusters float up to the top of the emulsions under the action of the gravity as a result the large size of oil droplets in emulsions will become less and less the demulsification process is shown in fig 11 due to its special multi branched structure and abundant amine terminated groups the ptc molecules can quickly migrate to the interface and destroy the interface film subsequently the coalescence of oil droplets is triggered 41 the average particle size reached a maximum at 10 minutes and the oil water separation occurred under the action of gravity as shown in fig 11b c the large oil droplets move to the upper layer and there are a few oil droplets in the separated water therefore it is concluded that the ptc demulsifiers can efficiently flocculate and coalesce oil droplets to achieve the oil water separation in emulsions 3 8 micro examination of the demulsification process for the purpose of understanding the demulsification process of ptc demulsifier in oil water emulsions microscopic images were observed with a polarizing microscope in the micrograph the dispersed phase is oil and the continuous phase is water as shown in fig 12 oil cluster 1 and 2 approached in the direction of the arrows however the oil clusters did not merge together quickly due to the presence of the interface film then the oil clusters 2 enlarged gradually so that the contact area also increased eventually the interface film fracture appeared in the white circle in fig 12c and the two oil clusters coalesced together to form a larger oil cluster combined with fig 11 the process mainly includes two steps first the ptc molecules can easily migrate to the interface due to its special three dimensional structure and plentiful terminal amino groups second it replace the original interfacial active substance in the interface film 42 it reduces the strength of the interface film and promotes the droplets coalescence furthermore the low interfacial tension of the demulsifier can increase the droplets size and improves the droplets rearrangement in emulsions finally leading to the demulsification 13 4 conclusions the dendrimer based demulsifier with trimethyl citrate as initial core was synthesized using a simple one pot method at room temperature the light transmittance of separated water reached 91 5 when 50 mg l of ptc demulsifier was used in diesel oil in water emulsions for 120 min it showed lower demulsification temperature and higher demulsification efficiency than previously reported demulsifers microscopic images and particles size distribution can clearly understand the change of oil droplets in water phase after demulsification surface tensions dynamic interfacial tensions and zeta potential were measured to better understand the possible demulsification mechanism the analysis of dynamic interfacial tensions and zeta potential showed that the displacement and electrostatic neutralization of ptc played a key roles in the process of oil water separation moreover thermodynamic parameters was calculated by the measured surface tensions for the explanation of the demulsificaton the hyperbranched demulsifiers have a good application prospect for the oil water separation of the emulsions author

13761,as an important water resource brackish water has been extensively utilized in the industry however there are few cases of municipal potable water treatment plants that use low chloride content brackish water as the source in this paper the brackish water treatment efficiency of ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf dual membrane process was evaluated in a municipal potable water treatment plant combining with a pilot optimization experiment results showed that uf guaranteed the inlet water quality of nf and nf could efficiently reject organics and salts with a chloride removal over 95 pilot experiment showed that the uf membrane flux decreased only 12 after continuously 30 days operation under the optimized uf operation conditions effectively extending the chemical cleaning interval response surface method was adopted in the nf removal efficiency and energy consumption optimization with the increase of feed water conductivity the influences of pressure and recovery on the removal efficiency were strengthened and the removal efficiency could be regulated over a wider range when the conductivity was less than 3500 μs cm nf could perform high treatment efficiency under the operation pressure of 0 65 0 85 mpa and recovery of 55 70 besides as feed conductivity increased it was necessary to increase the pressure and reduce the recovery within this range to maintain efficient operation this paper will provide a guidance for the uf nf dual membrane process design and operational optimization keywords brackish water nf uf dual membrane process potable water treatment response surface method municipal water plant 1 introduction desalination of brackish water has received a significant attention as brackish water accounts for more than a half of underground water resources 1 3 in china brackish water resources are mainly distributed in the arid areas of northwest and the coastal areas of southeast 4 in coastal areas the excess of chloride content in water source is mainly attributed to the backflow of seawater 5 7 in order to utilize such unconventional water resource it is very important to develop effective desalination technologies among various desalination technologyies electrodialysis reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf are the main technologies used to desalination of brackish water 8 10 the treatment cost and recovery of electrodialysis in low salinity water desalination are better than other technologies 11 12 however the application in desalination of brackish water is still limited due to the complex ion species and microbial communities in the raw water which will greatly affect the treatment performance of electrodialysis 13 therefore it is difficult to ensure the effluent quality ro is the most widely used desalination technology 14 16 which has been developed and applied in china for nearly 50 years among the common technologies ro can remove almost all soluble salts microorganisms and organic matter in the raw water which has the highest stability to the changes of environmental conditions 17 however because of the excessively high driving pressure and rejection performance the power consumption and membrane fouling of ro are relatively high 18 20 additionally the requirements of ro pretreatment and chemical cleaning are very strict and almost all beneficial elements in the effluent were removed so it cannot be directly used as potable water 18 in recent years the emerging nf technology has two remarkable characteristics including i the molecular weight cutoff is between ultrafiltration uf and ro significantly reducing the operation pressure compared to ro thus saving nearly 50 of power 19 and ii the donnan effect will occur during the nf treatment process which can selectively intercept different ions and retain indispensable trace elements 20 22 therefore nf is a more efficient and cost effective desalination technology for low salinity brackish water treatment in order to study the nf desalination performance of brackish water zhao et al used simulated brackish water as the feed water in laboratory and the rejection efficiency after nf treatment process without pretreatment was about 98 23 ryabehikov and khaled investigated the nf desalination performance with different salinities and the rejection efficiency of nf incresed with the increment of operation pressure 24 this was attributed to the dilution effect since water flux increased directly as a result of pressure increasement 25 since 1999 the first large scale nf system was built in the mery sur oise water plant in paris france nf technology had been applied to the advanced treatment of potable water for more than 20 years in the world 26 the united states has the largest number of nf equipment and the total water production scale has exceeded 1 000 000 m3 d according to the performance tracking reports of these large potable water plants the effluent quality of nf was stable and the operation cost was low during long term use however compared with the traditional desalination process and ro the application experience of large scale nf project was not yet refined especially in china although nf technology has prominent advantages in desalination of brackish water nf technology is barely designed as the core part of the municipal potable water plants and the correlational research on nf operational improvement is scarce due to tidal change along the coast of southeastern china the brackish water conductivity fluctuates greatly which brings many challenges to the design and application of nf technology besides the effects of pretreatment method and operation conditions on nf treatment performance are also unclear therefore it is necessary to investigate the contribution of each part of the entire treatment process in large scale projects and to find out the influence rule of various operation parameters in nf thus to provide guidance for the design of nf technology the response surface optimization method rsm has been widely used in various research fields which can provide the best solution according to the expectation of users in the pilot tests amin maher and e alventosa delara 27 used response surface method to evaluate the treatment efficiency of nf on specific pollutants and gave the optimal operation scheme sung and wang also used the rsm method to evaluate the impact of different uf chemical cleaning parameters on the process performance in the pilot tests and then proposed the corresponding cleaning schemes 28 according to our knowledge in this type of research the main focus is the chemical cleaning of nf under the laboratory simulation although clarifying the above can directly provide assistances for the operation improvement of existing brackish water treatment projects there are few reports focused on the interaction of basic operation conditions and the multi objective optimization of commercial nf membrane especially for a uf nf dual membrane process in this paper brackish water treatment efficiency of the uf nf dual membrane process in a municipal potable water treatment plant was evaluated in order to provide operation guidance and giving optimization steps the optimization of uf and nf operation was carried out on the pilot equipment and the best plan was determined the purpose of this paper was to provide guidance for the design of uf nf dual membrane process with high efficiency and low energy consumption in the potable water treatment plant 2 materials and methods 2 1 background of the municipal potable water treatment plant with the dual membrane process the municipal potable water treatment plant with the uf nf dual membrane process was located in changle district eastern fujian province china and situated in the tidal zone of the minriver the raw water was taken from the mount yan near the confluence of min river and wulong river therefore the chloride content of raw water was too high due to the seawater backflow and the statistical proportion of chloride content is shown in table 1 the construction of the dual membrane advanced treatment process in this plant was completed in 2018 and the water treatment process was divided into two parts as shown in fig 1 the front part was the conventional treatment process and the water supply capacity was about 110 000 m3 d poly aluminium chloride pacl was first added into the raw water followed by flocculation and advection precipitation and finally filtered by the v type filter to make the effluent met the inlet water quality requirements of uf the other part was the dual membrane process and the total water production scale was 100 000 m3 d in the dual membrane process the filtered water was pressurized into uf for treatment followed by first stage nf and the output of the two steps was about 110 000 m3 d and 88 000 m3 d respectively and about 22 000 m3 d of nf brine was produced the brine was further treated by secondary nf and ro to increase the water production with anoutput of 12 000 m3 d the process control of the dual membrane treatment was carried out using programmable logic controllers plc with touch screen human machine interface hmi and real time produce and supervisory control system rpc to achieve 24 hs uninterrupted automated operation all major equipment power supplies valves and pumps and instruments pressure sensors flow meters and conductivity indicators were controlled and recorded by plc of the general control center and each unit in the automatic operation mode important operation parameters such as pressure flow and conductivity were monitored to ensure that the equipment performed filtration and cleaning within the predetermined conditions if a unit had abnormal parameters an alarm would be issued in time to remind the staff performed inspection and maintenance uf was designed as a pretreatment for nf which removed impurities such as suspended solids colloids chroma turbidity and organic matter in the filtered water to protect nf operation 41 the uf system was composed of 12 modules shown in fig 2 a each of which contained 80 duf p0880i suzhou doyum environmental technology co ltd uf membrane elements the membrane elements were made of polysulfone with an effective membrane surface area of 37 m2 an outer diameter was 1 8 mm an inner diameter was 1 2 mm and an expected filtration accuracy of 0 02 to 0 03 μm the cleaning of uf membrane included physical cleaning and chemical cleaning 42 the nf system had 10 modules shown in fig 2b and each set of 72 tmn20h 400 toray bluestar membrane co ltd nf membrane elements was arranged in a section 48 in section one and 24 in section two where the pressure between the two sections was 0 5 mpa the nf membrane elements were made of polyamide with an effective membrane surface area of 37 m2 an operating flux was less than 20 l m2 h and the expected rejection efficiency was 95 furthermore the ro system for treating nf brine was composed of 4 modules with a total of 104 tml20n 400 toray bluestar membrane co ltd ro membrane elements and the recovery efficiency of nf brine was higher than 50 2 2 the dual membrane pilot equipment the pilot equipment consisted of two separate sets uf and nf combined to perform the tests at the water plant site the schematic diagram of the pilot equipment was shown in fig 3 raw water was drawn from the outlet of desilter and diluted to simulate different conductivity conditions followed by uf and nf treatment the pilot equipment was controlled by a plc system for the feed pump and backwash pump and was allocated with parameter monitoring equipment such as the flow meter the online conductivity meter the pressure sensor and the fault processing module the designed water yield of the pilot was 8 m3 h and the uf membrane module was developed by fuzhou fulong membrane technology development co ltd made of polysulfone with a length of 2160 mm an effective membrane area of 37 m2 an outer diameter of 1 8 mm and an inner diameter of 1 2 mm the nf membrane module was made of polyamide and was developed by toray bluestar membrane co ltd with an effective membrane surface area of 37 m2 and length 1016 mm 2 3 analytical methods the turbidity and ammonia nitrogen in water samples were determined by the desktop turbidimeter 2100n hach usa and the nessler s reagent spectrophotometry hj 535 2009 respectively 43 the conductivity meter sx751 sanxin china and the silver nitrate titration method in this paper were used to determine conductivity and chloride content respectively the detection index of organic content such as codmn toc uv254 and fluorescent organic compounds determined by the permanganate index method the toc analyzer toc l shimadzu japan the ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer t6 pgeneral china and the three dimensional fluorescence spectrometer fs5 edinburgh instruments uk respectively the fluorescence regional integration fri was a method of dividing regions formed by different excitation and emission wavelengths into 5 parts which represented different organic components 44 calculating the integrated volume φ i of a specific region by integration to obtain the standard volume φ i n of the integrated area of the specific region thereby inferring the relative content of the specific organic matter represented by a certain area φ i n and φ t n were given by 29 1 φ i n m f i φ i m f i i λ ex λ em d λ ex d λ em 2 φ t n i 1 5 φ i n where φ i n was the integral standard volume of fluorescent region i au nm2 φ i was the integral volume of fluorescent region i au nm2 φ t n was the integral standard volume of total fluorescent region au nm2 λ ex was the excitation wavelength nm λ em was the emission wavelength nm i λ ex λ em was the fluorescence intensity of corresponding excitation emission wavelength au and m f i was the multiplication factor which was expressed as the inverse of the ratio of the projected area of the fluorescent region i to that of the total fluorescent region the removal of pollutant was given by 3 removal c in c out c in 100 where c in was the pollutant content in inlet and c out was the pollutant content in effluent the recovery of trans membrane pressure tmp was defined as follows 4 recover y tmp tm p u tm p f tm p u 100 where tm p u was the tmp without cleaned and tm p f was the tmp after cleaning the attenuation of flux was defined as follows 5 attenuation f p f c f c 100 where f c was the previous flux and f p was the current flux 2 4 nf operation conditions optimization in order to study the effects of pressure and recovery on nf removal efficiency and power consumption the pilot test was assisted by design expert 8 0 including experimental design regression equation determination response surface analysis and multiple response surface optimization the central composite design ccd was used to design experiments randomly with two independent variables pressure and recovery were considered then the response value was fitted to a quadratic model by the following quadratic polynomial equation 30 31 6 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i 1 k β i i x i 2 i j k β i j x i x j ε where y was the response variable x i and x j were the input factors k was the number of factors β 0 was the constant coefﬁcient β 1 was the linear coefﬁcients β ii was the quadratic coefﬁcients and β ij was the interaction coefﬁcients and ε was the error to test the validity of the determined regression models analysis of variance anova lack of ﬁt test and residual analysis were conducted the desirability function was used to reduce the multi criteria problems to a single criterion problem and can standardize the result by converting the results into values between 0 and 1 32 in this paper the desirability function method was used to optimize the combined results of pressure and recovery 3 results and discussion 3 1 operational performance evaluation of the dual membrane potable water treatment plant due to the seawater backflow and salt tide the raw water contained high chloride content table 1 and the quality index for 5 consecutive days is shown in table 2 the treatment efficiency and advantages of the dual membrane process for brackish water were compared with the conventional process by detecting the accumulated removal efficiency of main structures desilter filter uf nf and ro for normal pollutants the results were shown in fig 4 after conventional treatment precipitation and filtration the turbidity decreased to below 1 ntu with an average of 0 15 ntu compared with the conventional process uf could remove turbidity more stably and the turbidity of uf effluent was below 0 1 ntu which meant that uf could effectively remove particles and provide critical protection for the nf operation although the average content of ammonia nitrogen in the raw water was only 0 310 mg l the toxicity would increase with the increase of alkaline 33 thus ammonia nitrogen was still an important evaluation indicator in this paper after precipitation and filtration the ammonia nitrogen content decreased by only 34 8 whereas the removal efficiency was doubled after the dual membrane process treatment and the average content of nf effluent was only 0 089 mg l the conductivity could reflect the content of inorganic ions in the water therefore the conductivity was used as the real time monitoring index of chloride content during the operation of this plant and the comparison of them was shown in fig 4a after coagulation and precipitation the conductivity had increased slightly indicating a negative removal efficiency of inorganic salt ions this might be due to the coagulation of pacl which was easily ionized after dissolving in water leading to an increase in ion content through filtration the conductivity and chloride content were almost unchanged and the removal efficiency were only 4 81 and 17 62 respectively similarly after uf treatment the accumulated removal efficiency of conductivity and chloride content were 9 59 and 22 78 respectively and the chloride content was still over 470 mg l in the entire water treatment process the removal of inorganic salts was mainly attributed to nf the average chloride content of nf effluent was reduced to 23 54 mg l and the removal efficiency was 96 15 moreover the removal efficiency of conductivity was 93 40 which was similar to the removal efficiency of chloride content proved the rationality of using conductivity as the monitoring index of chloride content in this plant in water treatment codmn and toc were both indicators of organic matter and they had significant correlation under specific circumstances 34 uv254 absorption value reflected the content of humus macromolecular organic matter and aromatic compounds with c c and c o as shown in fig 4b the removal efficiency of codmn and toc were approximate indicating that there might be had a certain correlation between them after conventional treating and dual membrane treating the codmn content decreased by 44 16 and 83 16 and the toc content decreased by 48 07 and 89 21 respectively in the filtered water the codmn and toc content were 2 07 mg l and 2 491 mg l below the limit of potable water respectively with reference to the change in uv254 absorption value estimated the reason for the decrease might be that the macromolecular organic matter and the humus substance were coagulated which could be removed by precipitation and filtration 35 compared with the filtered water the codmn and toc content of uf effluent only decreased by 0 138 mg l and 0 145 mg l respectively but the uv254 absorption value decreased by nearly 20 similar to the inorganic salt removal process the removal of organic matters was mainly attribute to nf and the codmn and toc content of nf effluent were only 0 638 mg l and 0 487 mg l respectively moreover the same tests were performed on the nf brine and ro permeate obviously the indexes of the nf brine had decreased sharply and similar to nf effluent shown in table 3 indicated the brine had been completely purified by the ro treatment which reflected the important role of ro in maintaining and improving the production scale of the plant the removal effeicency of the conventional process and dual membrane process on different types of organics was further studied by using the 3 d fluorescence technology and the results are shown in fig 5 according to the division of fluorescence regions the representative substances in regions i and ii in raw water were aromatic proteins while those in regions iii iv and v were fulvic acids microbial metabolites and humic acids respectively 36 37 referring to the characteristics of fluorescent substances represented by each region region i and ii representing aromatic proteins and region iii and v representing humus were merged respectively through fri analysis shown in fig 5g and h the main fluorescent organics in raw water were concentrated in area i ii and area iii v accounting for 44 63 and 42 07 of the total standard volume respectively after precipitation and filtration the total fluorescence integral volume decreased by 22 66 and the main part of the decrease was area iii v with a decrease of 39 59 which was similar to the change of uv254 in fig 4b proved the authenticity of the previous speculation the total fluorescence integral volume of uf permeate was only 7 08 lower than that of the filtered water which showed that as the pretreatment part of the dual membrane process uf had no significant effect on the removal of organic matters however after nf treatment all types of organics were effectively removed without obvious fluorescence response the fluorescence volume of area i ii area iii v and area iv decreased by 96 94 98 75 and 95 16 respectively in addition the ro process for the treatment of nf brine could also completely remove the fluorescent pollutants in summary the dual membrane process could effectively solve the problem of excessive chloride content in coastal brackish water compared with the conventional process the uf nf dual membrane process improved the water quality more significantly of which nf was the main contributor and uf was an critical pretreatment 3 2 operation optimization of pilot uf uf was a pretreatment part of the dual membrane process although uf was not able to remove chloride content it was critical for maintaining the stability of nf by rejecting the pollutants such as particle colloid and organics therefore the determination of uf membrane critical flux and the optimization of operation parameters could significantly improve the uf nf dual membrane process 3 2 1 determination of uf membrane critical flux generally the critical flux is defined as the operation flux when the membrane flux does not decline with time increase which is the optimal operation flux 38 when the uf operation flux is set as the critical flux the tmp does not change much 39 and the membrane fouling is very slight which can significantly improve the treatment performance and sevice life of uf membrane critical flux was determined by a stepwise increasing method 40 firstly initial flux was designed to determine whether the tmp had changed significantly within a specified time if the change obviously illustrated that the current flux was higher than the critical flux otherwise the current flux was lower than the critical flux then increased or decreased flux on the basis of the current flux and repeat this step several times in succession until a sudden change occurred tmp change range greater than 10 and finally the average of the current flux and the previous flux was determined as the critical flux in this paper the uf test time was 15 min the initial flux was 10 l m2 h the initial tmp was 20 kpa and the flux change was 5 l m2 h as the test results were shown in s1 the change of tmp was less than 2 when the flux was lower than 30 l m2 h which indicated that membrane fouling had hardly occurred in this range subsequently the change of tmp caused by the raise in flux gradually became apparent the tmp was 36 67 kpa when the flux reached 50 l m2 h and the growth ratio was 11 97 10 thereby determining the critical flux was 47 5 l m2 h 3 2 2 physical cleaning parameters optimization efficient and reasonable physical cleaning process could significantly reduce membrane fouling and chemical cleaning frequency thereby improving treatment efficiency and reducing operation cost at the determined critical flux 47 5 l m2 h physical cleaning optimization test was carried out with tmp recovery as the index and the result is shown in fig 6 before water backwashing gas washing process was added which removed pollutants deposited on the surface of uf membrane and improved the cleaning efficiency as shown in fig 6a the preset water backwashing time was 30 s and flushing time was 30 s the increase of gas washing time would enhance the tmp recovery when the time lasted 20 s the tmp recovery was only 62 34 while after prolonging the time to 40 s the recovery rose significantly to 88 63 however as the further increase of the time the tmp recovery was hardly increased which indicated that simply increasing the gas washing time could no longer obtain a better cleaning effect besides excessive execution time might cause the destruction of membrane structure the effect of the water backwashing process after gas wash on the tmp recovery was shown in fig 6b the determined gas washing time was 40 s and preset flushing time was 30 s the results showed that as the increase of water backwashing time the tmp recovery was enhanced significantly rose from 88 72 to 95 66 within 40 s and then stabilized the effect of flushing time on the tmp recovery was similar to that of gas washing and water backwashing process shown in fig 6c at the conditions of gas wash 40 s and backwash 45 s the tmp recovery reached 97 42 when the flush time was 40 s in summary the uf physical cleaning parameters for maintaining efficient and stable operation should be all set to 40 s and the tmp recovery at this condition would exceed 97 3 2 3 evaluation of long term operation flux change and three stage attenuation fitting equation of continuously 30 days operation at the determined optimal operation design the critical flux was 47 5 l m2 h the gas washing time water backwashing time and flushing time were all 40 s were shown in fig 7 the flux remained stable within the first 5 days only decreased by 0 12 l m2 h and the linear decrease rate was triple of before 0 34 l m2 h in the next 5 days after that until the end of the test the flux exponentially decreased with an average attenuation rate of 0 23 l m2 h d and the final flux was 42 20 l m2 h this could be attributed to that there was no irreversible membrane fouling in the first stage then in the subsequent second stage due to physical cleaning could not completely remove the fouling any more the irreversible membrane fouling accumulated slowly finally in the third stage the physical cleaning was difficult to cope with the intensification of the irreversible membrane fouling and chemical cleaning must be performed immediately in addition it should be emphasized that during this continuously operation the turbidity of uf effluent could be stabilized below 0 1 ntu indicated that uf could completely guarantee the water quality of nf inlet 3 3 operation optimization of pilot nf the water production and pollutant removal of nf would be affected by operation pressure water recovery ph and temperature since the ph value and temperature of raw water varied little and was difficult to control only the influence of pressure and recovery on nf was examined in this paper and operation parameters were optimized by response surface method rsm 3 3 1 model establishment and sensitivity analysis the monitoring index of nf operation in the potable water treatment plant was the water conductivity which was in the range of 2000 3500 μs cm in most cases furthermore according to the actual operation conditions of the water plant and the stable operation requirements of the pilot nf the test pressure and recovery range were selected as 0 4 0 9 mpa and 50 90 respectively therefore design expert 8 0 was used to study the influence of pressure x1 0 4 0 9 mpa and recovery x2 50 90 on the two response values of removal efficiency r and power consumption c under different feed water conductivity ranges 2000 2500 μs cm 2500 3000 μs cm and 3000 3500 μs cm refferring to the salinity of 450 600 mg l 600 750 mg l and 750 1000 mg l respectively through ccd design and statistical analysis of response value results the regression equation was established as follows 7 r 1 78 79793 31 23409 x 1 0 042480 x 2 17 28600 x 1 2 1 03844 10 3 x 2 2 8 c 1 6 40093 6 02366 x 1 0 097857 x 2 3 5 10 3 x 1 x 2 4 12200 x 1 2 6 81563 10 4 x 2 2 9 r 2 79 90540 32 37374 x 1 0 012552 x 2 17 96200 x 1 2 8 25313 10 4 x 2 2 10 c 2 6 30017 6 73007 x 1 0 088702 x 2 7 0 10 3 x 1 x 2 4 42600 x 1 2 6 35313 10 4 x 2 2 11 r 3 81 16469 26 03615 x 1 0 051386 x 2 13 14200 x 1 2 1 09719 10 3 x 2 2 12 c 3 6 34255 6 65271 x 1 0 091583 x 2 0 021 x 1 x 2 3 656 x 1 2 5 837500 10 4 x 2 2 where r1 r2 and r3 were the removal efficiency of 2000 2500 μs cm 2500 3000 μs cm and 3000 3500 μs cm raw water conductivity respectively c1 c2 and c3 were the power consumption of 2000 2500 μs cm 2500 3000 μs cm and 3000 3500 μs cm raw water conductivity respectively x1 was pressure x2 was recovery the regression models were analyzed by anova and the results are shown in table 4 the p value for lack of fit of these fitting equations were all greater than 0 05 and the f value range was 20 06 84 10 showed that the fitting equations were significant the r 2 statistic was 0 9836 at maximum and 0 9093 at minimum illustrated that more than 90 of the actual results were consistent with the model and the predicted value were close to the actual one shown in fig 8 in r1 r2 and r3 the p value of x1 x2 and x1 2 were 0 05 indicated that they were all significant parameters of the model while in c1 c2 and c3 there were 3 4 and 5 significant influence parameters and the importance of x1x2 increased gradually this illustrated that under low conductivity the main effect on power consumption was pressure and as the increase of raw water conductivity the interaction between pressure and recovery had a greater effect on power consumption these observations implied that the models were well ﬁtted to the experimental actual results and they were able to be applied in the analysis and prediction of the removal efﬁciency and power consumption 3 3 2 influence of factors on nf operation the 3 d response surfaces and contour plots of pressure and recovery under different feed water conductivity are shown in figs 9 11 respectively a combination of 3 d response surfaces and contour plots were employed to assess the effects of pressure and recovery interaction on removal efficiency and power consumption the contour plots of figs 9a 11 a all had an incomplete ellipse region with a darker color represented the best removal effect and the overall removal efficiency was more than 92 moreover the range of these regions gradually expanded with the increase of feed water conductivity the pressure ranges three regions were 0 72 0 90 mpa 0 66 0 90 mpa 0 59 0 90 mpa and the recovery ranges were 50 0 54 5 50 0 62 0 50 0 74 0 respectively this showed that with the increase of raw water conductivity nf could remain efficient removal efficiency over a wider range of operation regulation observation of the response surfaces the removal efficiency increased with the increasing pressure or decreasing recovery and both at a similar rate furthermore the surface slopes would also gradually greater with the increase of feed water conductivity indicated that the influences of pressure and recovery on the removal efficiency were strengthened which was consistent with the anova results of r1 r2 and r3 among the 3 d response surfaces and contour plots shown in figs 9b 11 b the water production efficiency of nf were high in the dark blue ellipse regions and the power consumption were below 1 00 kw h m3 which decreased first and then increased with the pressure or recovery increased the explanation was that when the pressure or recovery was low the insufficient production potential would lead to inefficient water production process in contrast when the pressure or recovery was too high the energy lost excessively also led to inefficient in addition the magnitude of the surfaces slope change indicated that pressure was still a more significant factor than recovery but the gap was not large as the feed water conductivity increased the elliptical eccentricity of contour plots would be greater illustrated that the interaction between pressure and recovery was enhanced which was consistent with the anova results of c1 c2 and c3 3 3 3 optimization of nf operation conditions increasing nf operation pressure would increase membrane flux and pollutant removal efficiency but the concentration polarization and membrane fouling would be intensified and the excessive pressure was also diseconomy by increasing the operation recovery energy comsumption for water intaking and brine disposal would be decreased but the effluent quality would be impacted and the power consumption for driven nf would be intensifed therefore there was a optimal nf operation pressure and recovery range for achieving the high removal efficiency and energy saving design expert 8 0 was utilized by using the desirability function method to optimize nf operation parameters when pressure and recovery were set equally important and the selected response value had the maximize removal efficiency and the minimize power consumption as shown in fig 12 when the feed water conductivity was 2000 2500 μs cm the efficient operation was 0 64 0 85 mpa for the pressure and 57 40 73 87 for the recovery when conductivity was 2500 3000 μs cm nf efficiently performed under the pressure was 0 67 0 86 mpa and the recovery was 51 11 68 09 when conductivity was 3000 3500 μs cm the optimum range was 0 71 0 90 mpa and 50 41 66 63 these optimal operation conditions were used for actual tests and the operation conditions corresponding response variable values predicted and actual values are shown in table 5 where the errors were all within 5 indicating that the optimal operation conditions were feasible overall when the feed water conductivity was within 3500 μs cm nf could perform high treatment efficiency under the operation range was 0 65 0 85 mpa and 55 70 and with the increase of conductivity it was necessary to gradually increase the pressure and reduce the recovery in this optimum range to maintain the efficient operation 4 conclusion in this work brackish water treatment performance in a municipal potable water treatment plant with the dual membrane process was evaluated and the operation was optimized through a pilot test the results showed that the dual membrane process was effective for the treatment of brackish water and the optimization steps used was available for practical implementation in the water plant in the plant the conventional treatment process and uf were effective to decrease turbidity and ammonia nitrogen but ineffective to remove conductivity chloride content and organic matter the conductivity and chloride content of uf effluent was remained at 90 and 80 respectively after nf treatment all the above pollutants could be removed significantly especially the chloride content reduced to 5 of the raw water indicating that nf played a main role in the dual membrane process in the pilot test the critical flux of uf was determined as 47 5 l m2 h and the tmp recovery gradually increased with the cleaning time prolonged but it stabilized when the time extended to a certain duration the optimum physical cleaning condition was that the duriation of gas wash water backwash and flush were all set to 40 s moreover there were three stages throughout the process of flux attenuation during the continuously 30 days operation with the attenuation rate of each stage gradully increased and the initial flux decreased from 47 5 l m2 h to 42 2 l m2 h when the feed water conductivity was fluctuant nf performed the high removal efficiency over a wider range of operation regulation with the increase of conductivity and as the pressure or recovery increased the power consumption would first decrease and then increase the effect of pressure and recovery on removal efficiency was more significant at high conductivity and mainly attribute to the pressure furthermore the optimum nf operation range was obtained by using mrsm and as the feed conductivity increased it was necessary to increase the pressure and reduce the recovery in this optimum range to maintain the efficient

13761,as an important water resource brackish water has been extensively utilized in the industry however there are few cases of municipal potable water treatment plants that use low chloride content brackish water as the source in this paper the brackish water treatment efficiency of ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf dual membrane process was evaluated in a municipal potable water treatment plant combining with a pilot optimization experiment results showed that uf guaranteed the inlet water quality of nf and nf could efficiently reject organics and salts with a chloride removal over 95 pilot experiment showed that the uf membrane flux decreased only 12 after continuously 30 days operation under the optimized uf operation conditions effectively extending the chemical cleaning interval response surface method was adopted in the nf removal efficiency and energy consumption optimization with the increase of feed water conductivity the influences of pressure and recovery on the removal efficiency were strengthened and the removal efficiency could be regulated over a wider range when the conductivity was less than 3500 μs cm nf could perform high treatment efficiency under the operation pressure of 0 65 0 85 mpa and recovery of 55 70 besides as feed conductivity increased it was necessary to increase the pressure and reduce the recovery within this range to maintain efficient operation this paper will provide a guidance for the uf nf dual membrane process design and operational optimization keywords brackish water nf uf dual membrane process potable water treatment response surface method municipal water plant 1 introduction desalination of brackish water has received a significant attention as brackish water accounts for more than a half of underground water resources 1 3 in china brackish water resources are mainly distributed in the arid areas of northwest and the coastal areas of southeast 4 in coastal areas the excess of chloride content in water source is mainly attributed to the backflow of seawater 5 7 in order to utilize such unconventional water resource it is very important to develop effective desalination technologies among various desalination technologyies electrodialysis reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf are the main technologies used to desalination of brackish water 8 10 the treatment cost and recovery of electrodialysis in low salinity water desalination are better than other technologies 11 12 however the application in desalination of brackish water is still limited due to the complex ion species and microbial communities in the raw water which will greatly affect the treatment performance of electrodialysis 13 therefore it is difficult to ensure the effluent quality ro is the most widely used desalination technology 14 16 which has been developed and applied in china for nearly 50 years among the common technologies ro can remove almost all soluble salts microorganisms and organic matter in the raw water which has the highest stability to the changes of environmental conditions 17 however because of the excessively high driving pressure and rejection performance the power consumption and membrane fouling of ro are relatively high 18 20 additionally the requirements of ro pretreatment and chemical cleaning are very strict and almost all beneficial elements in the effluent were removed so it cannot be directly used as potable water 18 in recent years the emerging nf technology has two remarkable characteristics including i the molecular weight cutoff is between ultrafiltration uf and ro significantly reducing the operation pressure compared to ro thus saving nearly 50 of power 19 and ii the donnan effect will occur during the nf treatment process which can selectively intercept different ions and retain indispensable trace elements 20 22 therefore nf is a more efficient and cost effective desalination technology for low salinity brackish water treatment in order to study the nf desalination performance of brackish water zhao et al used simulated brackish water as the feed water in laboratory and the rejection efficiency after nf treatment process without pretreatment was about 98 23 ryabehikov and khaled investigated the nf desalination performance with different salinities and the rejection efficiency of nf incresed with the increment of operation pressure 24 this was attributed to the dilution effect since water flux increased directly as a result of pressure increasement 25 since 1999 the first large scale nf system was built in the mery sur oise water plant in paris france nf technology had been applied to the advanced treatment of potable water for more than 20 years in the world 26 the united states has the largest number of nf equipment and the total water production scale has exceeded 1 000 000 m3 d according to the performance tracking reports of these large potable water plants the effluent quality of nf was stable and the operation cost was low during long term use however compared with the traditional desalination process and ro the application experience of large scale nf project was not yet refined especially in china although nf technology has prominent advantages in desalination of brackish water nf technology is barely designed as the core part of the municipal potable water plants and the correlational research on nf operational improvement is scarce due to tidal change along the coast of southeastern china the brackish water conductivity fluctuates greatly which brings many challenges to the design and application of nf technology besides the effects of pretreatment method and operation conditions on nf treatment performance are also unclear therefore it is necessary to investigate the contribution of each part of the entire treatment process in large scale projects and to find out the influence rule of various operation parameters in nf thus to provide guidance for the design of nf technology the response surface optimization method rsm has been widely used in various research fields which can provide the best solution according to the expectation of users in the pilot tests amin maher and e alventosa delara 27 used response surface method to evaluate the treatment efficiency of nf on specific pollutants and gave the optimal operation scheme sung and wang also used the rsm method to evaluate the impact of different uf chemical cleaning parameters on the process performance in the pilot tests and then proposed the corresponding cleaning schemes 28 according to our knowledge in this type of research the main focus is the chemical cleaning of nf under the laboratory simulation although clarifying the above can directly provide assistances for the operation improvement of existing brackish water treatment projects there are few reports focused on the interaction of basic operation conditions and the multi objective optimization of commercial nf membrane especially for a uf nf dual membrane process in this paper brackish water treatment efficiency of the uf nf dual membrane process in a municipal potable water treatment plant was evaluated in order to provide operation guidance and giving optimization steps the optimization of uf and nf operation was carried out on the pilot equipment and the best plan was determined the purpose of this paper was to provide guidance for the design of uf nf dual membrane process with high efficiency and low energy consumption in the potable water treatment plant 2 materials and methods 2 1 background of the municipal potable water treatment plant with the dual membrane process the municipal potable water treatment plant with the uf nf dual membrane process was located in changle district eastern fujian province china and situated in the tidal zone of the minriver the raw water was taken from the mount yan near the confluence of min river and wulong river therefore the chloride content of raw water was too high due to the seawater backflow and the statistical proportion of chloride content is shown in table 1 the construction of the dual membrane advanced treatment process in this plant was completed in 2018 and the water treatment process was divided into two parts as shown in fig 1 the front part was the conventional treatment process and the water supply capacity was about 110 000 m3 d poly aluminium chloride pacl was first added into the raw water followed by flocculation and advection precipitation and finally filtered by the v type filter to make the effluent met the inlet water quality requirements of uf the other part was the dual membrane process and the total water production scale was 100 000 m3 d in the dual membrane process the filtered water was pressurized into uf for treatment followed by first stage nf and the output of the two steps was about 110 000 m3 d and 88 000 m3 d respectively and about 22 000 m3 d of nf brine was produced the brine was further treated by secondary nf and ro to increase the water production with anoutput of 12 000 m3 d the process control of the dual membrane treatment was carried out using programmable logic controllers plc with touch screen human machine interface hmi and real time produce and supervisory control system rpc to achieve 24 hs uninterrupted automated operation all major equipment power supplies valves and pumps and instruments pressure sensors flow meters and conductivity indicators were controlled and recorded by plc of the general control center and each unit in the automatic operation mode important operation parameters such as pressure flow and conductivity were monitored to ensure that the equipment performed filtration and cleaning within the predetermined conditions if a unit had abnormal parameters an alarm would be issued in time to remind the staff performed inspection and maintenance uf was designed as a pretreatment for nf which removed impurities such as suspended solids colloids chroma turbidity and organic matter in the filtered water to protect nf operation 41 the uf system was composed of 12 modules shown in fig 2 a each of which contained 80 duf p0880i suzhou doyum environmental technology co ltd uf membrane elements the membrane elements were made of polysulfone with an effective membrane surface area of 37 m2 an outer diameter was 1 8 mm an inner diameter was 1 2 mm and an expected filtration accuracy of 0 02 to 0 03 μm the cleaning of uf membrane included physical cleaning and chemical cleaning 42 the nf system had 10 modules shown in fig 2b and each set of 72 tmn20h 400 toray bluestar membrane co ltd nf membrane elements was arranged in a section 48 in section one and 24 in section two where the pressure between the two sections was 0 5 mpa the nf membrane elements were made of polyamide with an effective membrane surface area of 37 m2 an operating flux was less than 20 l m2 h and the expected rejection efficiency was 95 furthermore the ro system for treating nf brine was composed of 4 modules with a total of 104 tml20n 400 toray bluestar membrane co ltd ro membrane elements and the recovery efficiency of nf brine was higher than 50 2 2 the dual membrane pilot equipment the pilot equipment consisted of two separate sets uf and nf combined to perform the tests at the water plant site the schematic diagram of the pilot equipment was shown in fig 3 raw water was drawn from the outlet of desilter and diluted to simulate different conductivity conditions followed by uf and nf treatment the pilot equipment was controlled by a plc system for the feed pump and backwash pump and was allocated with parameter monitoring equipment such as the flow meter the online conductivity meter the pressure sensor and the fault processing module the designed water yield of the pilot was 8 m3 h and the uf membrane module was developed by fuzhou fulong membrane technology development co ltd made of polysulfone with a length of 2160 mm an effective membrane area of 37 m2 an outer diameter of 1 8 mm and an inner diameter of 1 2 mm the nf membrane module was made of polyamide and was developed by toray bluestar membrane co ltd with an effective membrane surface area of 37 m2 and length 1016 mm 2 3 analytical methods the turbidity and ammonia nitrogen in water samples were determined by the desktop turbidimeter 2100n hach usa and the nessler s reagent spectrophotometry hj 535 2009 respectively 43 the conductivity meter sx751 sanxin china and the silver nitrate titration method in this paper were used to determine conductivity and chloride content respectively the detection index of organic content such as codmn toc uv254 and fluorescent organic compounds determined by the permanganate index method the toc analyzer toc l shimadzu japan the ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer t6 pgeneral china and the three dimensional fluorescence spectrometer fs5 edinburgh instruments uk respectively the fluorescence regional integration fri was a method of dividing regions formed by different excitation and emission wavelengths into 5 parts which represented different organic components 44 calculating the integrated volume φ i of a specific region by integration to obtain the standard volume φ i n of the integrated area of the specific region thereby inferring the relative content of the specific organic matter represented by a certain area φ i n and φ t n were given by 29 1 φ i n m f i φ i m f i i λ ex λ em d λ ex d λ em 2 φ t n i 1 5 φ i n where φ i n was the integral standard volume of fluorescent region i au nm2 φ i was the integral volume of fluorescent region i au nm2 φ t n was the integral standard volume of total fluorescent region au nm2 λ ex was the excitation wavelength nm λ em was the emission wavelength nm i λ ex λ em was the fluorescence intensity of corresponding excitation emission wavelength au and m f i was the multiplication factor which was expressed as the inverse of the ratio of the projected area of the fluorescent region i to that of the total fluorescent region the removal of pollutant was given by 3 removal c in c out c in 100 where c in was the pollutant content in inlet and c out was the pollutant content in effluent the recovery of trans membrane pressure tmp was defined as follows 4 recover y tmp tm p u tm p f tm p u 100 where tm p u was the tmp without cleaned and tm p f was the tmp after cleaning the attenuation of flux was defined as follows 5 attenuation f p f c f c 100 where f c was the previous flux and f p was the current flux 2 4 nf operation conditions optimization in order to study the effects of pressure and recovery on nf removal efficiency and power consumption the pilot test was assisted by design expert 8 0 including experimental design regression equation determination response surface analysis and multiple response surface optimization the central composite design ccd was used to design experiments randomly with two independent variables pressure and recovery were considered then the response value was fitted to a quadratic model by the following quadratic polynomial equation 30 31 6 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i 1 k β i i x i 2 i j k β i j x i x j ε where y was the response variable x i and x j were the input factors k was the number of factors β 0 was the constant coefﬁcient β 1 was the linear coefﬁcients β ii was the quadratic coefﬁcients and β ij was the interaction coefﬁcients and ε was the error to test the validity of the determined regression models analysis of variance anova lack of ﬁt test and residual analysis were conducted the desirability function was used to reduce the multi criteria problems to a single criterion problem and can standardize the result by converting the results into values between 0 and 1 32 in this paper the desirability function method was used to optimize the combined results of pressure and recovery 3 results and discussion 3 1 operational performance evaluation of the dual membrane potable water treatment plant due to the seawater backflow and salt tide the raw water contained high chloride content table 1 and the quality index for 5 consecutive days is shown in table 2 the treatment efficiency and advantages of the dual membrane process for brackish water were compared with the conventional process by detecting the accumulated removal efficiency of main structures desilter filter uf nf and ro for normal pollutants the results were shown in fig 4 after conventional treatment precipitation and filtration the turbidity decreased to below 1 ntu with an average of 0 15 ntu compared with the conventional process uf could remove turbidity more stably and the turbidity of uf effluent was below 0 1 ntu which meant that uf could effectively remove particles and provide critical protection for the nf operation although the average content of ammonia nitrogen in the raw water was only 0 310 mg l the toxicity would increase with the increase of alkaline 33 thus ammonia nitrogen was still an important evaluation indicator in this paper after precipitation and filtration the ammonia nitrogen content decreased by only 34 8 whereas the removal efficiency was doubled after the dual membrane process treatment and the average content of nf effluent was only 0 089 mg l the conductivity could reflect the content of inorganic ions in the water therefore the conductivity was used as the real time monitoring index of chloride content during the operation of this plant and the comparison of them was shown in fig 4a after coagulation and precipitation the conductivity had increased slightly indicating a negative removal efficiency of inorganic salt ions this might be due to the coagulation of pacl which was easily ionized after dissolving in water leading to an increase in ion content through filtration the conductivity and chloride content were almost unchanged and the removal efficiency were only 4 81 and 17 62 respectively similarly after uf treatment the accumulated removal efficiency of conductivity and chloride content were 9 59 and 22 78 respectively and the chloride content was still over 470 mg l in the entire water treatment process the removal of inorganic salts was mainly attributed to nf the average chloride content of nf effluent was reduced to 23 54 mg l and the removal efficiency was 96 15 moreover the removal efficiency of conductivity was 93 40 which was similar to the removal efficiency of chloride content proved the rationality of using conductivity as the monitoring index of chloride content in this plant in water treatment codmn and toc were both indicators of organic matter and they had significant correlation under specific circumstances 34 uv254 absorption value reflected the content of humus macromolecular organic matter and aromatic compounds with c c and c o as shown in fig 4b the removal efficiency of codmn and toc were approximate indicating that there might be had a certain correlation between them after conventional treating and dual membrane treating the codmn content decreased by 44 16 and 83 16 and the toc content decreased by 48 07 and 89 21 respectively in the filtered water the codmn and toc content were 2 07 mg l and 2 491 mg l below the limit of potable water respectively with reference to the change in uv254 absorption value estimated the reason for the decrease might be that the macromolecular organic matter and the humus substance were coagulated which could be removed by precipitation and filtration 35 compared with the filtered water the codmn and toc content of uf effluent only decreased by 0 138 mg l and 0 145 mg l respectively but the uv254 absorption value decreased by nearly 20 similar to the inorganic salt removal process the removal of organic matters was mainly attribute to nf and the codmn and toc content of nf effluent were only 0 638 mg l and 0 487 mg l respectively moreover the same tests were performed on the nf brine and ro permeate obviously the indexes of the nf brine had decreased sharply and similar to nf effluent shown in table 3 indicated the brine had been completely purified by the ro treatment which reflected the important role of ro in maintaining and improving the production scale of the plant the removal effeicency of the conventional process and dual membrane process on different types of organics was further studied by using the 3 d fluorescence technology and the results are shown in fig 5 according to the division of fluorescence regions the representative substances in regions i and ii in raw water were aromatic proteins while those in regions iii iv and v were fulvic acids microbial metabolites and humic acids respectively 36 37 referring to the characteristics of fluorescent substances represented by each region region i and ii representing aromatic proteins and region iii and v representing humus were merged respectively through fri analysis shown in fig 5g and h the main fluorescent organics in raw water were concentrated in area i ii and area iii v accounting for 44 63 and 42 07 of the total standard volume respectively after precipitation and filtration the total fluorescence integral volume decreased by 22 66 and the main part of the decrease was area iii v with a decrease of 39 59 which was similar to the change of uv254 in fig 4b proved the authenticity of the previous speculation the total fluorescence integral volume of uf permeate was only 7 08 lower than that of the filtered water which showed that as the pretreatment part of the dual membrane process uf had no significant effect on the removal of organic matters however after nf treatment all types of organics were effectively removed without obvious fluorescence response the fluorescence volume of area i ii area iii v and area iv decreased by 96 94 98 75 and 95 16 respectively in addition the ro process for the treatment of nf brine could also completely remove the fluorescent pollutants in summary the dual membrane process could effectively solve the problem of excessive chloride content in coastal brackish water compared with the conventional process the uf nf dual membrane process improved the water quality more significantly of which nf was the main contributor and uf was an critical pretreatment 3 2 operation optimization of pilot uf uf was a pretreatment part of the dual membrane process although uf was not able to remove chloride content it was critical for maintaining the stability of nf by rejecting the pollutants such as particle colloid and organics therefore the determination of uf membrane critical flux and the optimization of operation parameters could significantly improve the uf nf dual membrane process 3 2 1 determination of uf membrane critical flux generally the critical flux is defined as the operation flux when the membrane flux does not decline with time increase which is the optimal operation flux 38 when the uf operation flux is set as the critical flux the tmp does not change much 39 and the membrane fouling is very slight which can significantly improve the treatment performance and sevice life of uf membrane critical flux was determined by a stepwise increasing method 40 firstly initial flux was designed to determine whether the tmp had changed significantly within a specified time if the change obviously illustrated that the current flux was higher than the critical flux otherwise the current flux was lower than the critical flux then increased or decreased flux on the basis of the current flux and repeat this step several times in succession until a sudden change occurred tmp change range greater than 10 and finally the average of the current flux and the previous flux was determined as the critical flux in this paper the uf test time was 15 min the initial flux was 10 l m2 h the initial tmp was 20 kpa and the flux change was 5 l m2 h as the test results were shown in s1 the change of tmp was less than 2 when the flux was lower than 30 l m2 h which indicated that membrane fouling had hardly occurred in this range subsequently the change of tmp caused by the raise in flux gradually became apparent the tmp was 36 67 kpa when the flux reached 50 l m2 h and the growth ratio was 11 97 10 thereby determining the critical flux was 47 5 l m2 h 3 2 2 physical cleaning parameters optimization efficient and reasonable physical cleaning process could significantly reduce membrane fouling and chemical cleaning frequency thereby improving treatment efficiency and reducing operation cost at the determined critical flux 47 5 l m2 h physical cleaning optimization test was carried out with tmp recovery as the index and the result is shown in fig 6 before water backwashing gas washing process was added which removed pollutants deposited on the surface of uf membrane and improved the cleaning efficiency as shown in fig 6a the preset water backwashing time was 30 s and flushing time was 30 s the increase of gas washing time would enhance the tmp recovery when the time lasted 20 s the tmp recovery was only 62 34 while after prolonging the time to 40 s the recovery rose significantly to 88 63 however as the further increase of the time the tmp recovery was hardly increased which indicated that simply increasing the gas washing time could no longer obtain a better cleaning effect besides excessive execution time might cause the destruction of membrane structure the effect of the water backwashing process after gas wash on the tmp recovery was shown in fig 6b the determined gas washing time was 40 s and preset flushing time was 30 s the results showed that as the increase of water backwashing time the tmp recovery was enhanced significantly rose from 88 72 to 95 66 within 40 s and then stabilized the effect of flushing time on the tmp recovery was similar to that of gas washing and water backwashing process shown in fig 6c at the conditions of gas wash 40 s and backwash 45 s the tmp recovery reached 97 42 when the flush time was 40 s in summary the uf physical cleaning parameters for maintaining efficient and stable operation should be all set to 40 s and the tmp recovery at this condition would exceed 97 3 2 3 evaluation of long term operation flux change and three stage attenuation fitting equation of continuously 30 days operation at the determined optimal operation design the critical flux was 47 5 l m2 h the gas washing time water backwashing time and flushing time were all 40 s were shown in fig 7 the flux remained stable within the first 5 days only decreased by 0 12 l m2 h and the linear decrease rate was triple of before 0 34 l m2 h in the next 5 days after that until the end of the test the flux exponentially decreased with an average attenuation rate of 0 23 l m2 h d and the final flux was 42 20 l m2 h this could be attributed to that there was no irreversible membrane fouling in the first stage then in the subsequent second stage due to physical cleaning could not completely remove the fouling any more the irreversible membrane fouling accumulated slowly finally in the third stage the physical cleaning was difficult to cope with the intensification of the irreversible membrane fouling and chemical cleaning must be performed immediately in addition it should be emphasized that during this continuously operation the turbidity of uf effluent could be stabilized below 0 1 ntu indicated that uf could completely guarantee the water quality of nf inlet 3 3 operation optimization of pilot nf the water production and pollutant removal of nf would be affected by operation pressure water recovery ph and temperature since the ph value and temperature of raw water varied little and was difficult to control only the influence of pressure and recovery on nf was examined in this paper and operation parameters were optimized by response surface method rsm 3 3 1 model establishment and sensitivity analysis the monitoring index of nf operation in the potable water treatment plant was the water conductivity which was in the range of 2000 3500 μs cm in most cases furthermore according to the actual operation conditions of the water plant and the stable operation requirements of the pilot nf the test pressure and recovery range were selected as 0 4 0 9 mpa and 50 90 respectively therefore design expert 8 0 was used to study the influence of pressure x1 0 4 0 9 mpa and recovery x2 50 90 on the two response values of removal efficiency r and power consumption c under different feed water conductivity ranges 2000 2500 μs cm 2500 3000 μs cm and 3000 3500 μs cm refferring to the salinity of 450 600 mg l 600 750 mg l and 750 1000 mg l respectively through ccd design and statistical analysis of response value results the regression equation was established as follows 7 r 1 78 79793 31 23409 x 1 0 042480 x 2 17 28600 x 1 2 1 03844 10 3 x 2 2 8 c 1 6 40093 6 02366 x 1 0 097857 x 2 3 5 10 3 x 1 x 2 4 12200 x 1 2 6 81563 10 4 x 2 2 9 r 2 79 90540 32 37374 x 1 0 012552 x 2 17 96200 x 1 2 8 25313 10 4 x 2 2 10 c 2 6 30017 6 73007 x 1 0 088702 x 2 7 0 10 3 x 1 x 2 4 42600 x 1 2 6 35313 10 4 x 2 2 11 r 3 81 16469 26 03615 x 1 0 051386 x 2 13 14200 x 1 2 1 09719 10 3 x 2 2 12 c 3 6 34255 6 65271 x 1 0 091583 x 2 0 021 x 1 x 2 3 656 x 1 2 5 837500 10 4 x 2 2 where r1 r2 and r3 were the removal efficiency of 2000 2500 μs cm 2500 3000 μs cm and 3000 3500 μs cm raw water conductivity respectively c1 c2 and c3 were the power consumption of 2000 2500 μs cm 2500 3000 μs cm and 3000 3500 μs cm raw water conductivity respectively x1 was pressure x2 was recovery the regression models were analyzed by anova and the results are shown in table 4 the p value for lack of fit of these fitting equations were all greater than 0 05 and the f value range was 20 06 84 10 showed that the fitting equations were significant the r 2 statistic was 0 9836 at maximum and 0 9093 at minimum illustrated that more than 90 of the actual results were consistent with the model and the predicted value were close to the actual one shown in fig 8 in r1 r2 and r3 the p value of x1 x2 and x1 2 were 0 05 indicated that they were all significant parameters of the model while in c1 c2 and c3 there were 3 4 and 5 significant influence parameters and the importance of x1x2 increased gradually this illustrated that under low conductivity the main effect on power consumption was pressure and as the increase of raw water conductivity the interaction between pressure and recovery had a greater effect on power consumption these observations implied that the models were well ﬁtted to the experimental actual results and they were able to be applied in the analysis and prediction of the removal efﬁciency and power consumption 3 3 2 influence of factors on nf operation the 3 d response surfaces and contour plots of pressure and recovery under different feed water conductivity are shown in figs 9 11 respectively a combination of 3 d response surfaces and contour plots were employed to assess the effects of pressure and recovery interaction on removal efficiency and power consumption the contour plots of figs 9a 11 a all had an incomplete ellipse region with a darker color represented the best removal effect and the overall removal efficiency was more than 92 moreover the range of these regions gradually expanded with the increase of feed water conductivity the pressure ranges three regions were 0 72 0 90 mpa 0 66 0 90 mpa 0 59 0 90 mpa and the recovery ranges were 50 0 54 5 50 0 62 0 50 0 74 0 respectively this showed that with the increase of raw water conductivity nf could remain efficient removal efficiency over a wider range of operation regulation observation of the response surfaces the removal efficiency increased with the increasing pressure or decreasing recovery and both at a similar rate furthermore the surface slopes would also gradually greater with the increase of feed water conductivity indicated that the influences of pressure and recovery on the removal efficiency were strengthened which was consistent with the anova results of r1 r2 and r3 among the 3 d response surfaces and contour plots shown in figs 9b 11 b the water production efficiency of nf were high in the dark blue ellipse regions and the power consumption were below 1 00 kw h m3 which decreased first and then increased with the pressure or recovery increased the explanation was that when the pressure or recovery was low the insufficient production potential would lead to inefficient water production process in contrast when the pressure or recovery was too high the energy lost excessively also led to inefficient in addition the magnitude of the surfaces slope change indicated that pressure was still a more significant factor than recovery but the gap was not large as the feed water conductivity increased the elliptical eccentricity of contour plots would be greater illustrated that the interaction between pressure and recovery was enhanced which was consistent with the anova results of c1 c2 and c3 3 3 3 optimization of nf operation conditions increasing nf operation pressure would increase membrane flux and pollutant removal efficiency but the concentration polarization and membrane fouling would be intensified and the excessive pressure was also diseconomy by increasing the operation recovery energy comsumption for water intaking and brine disposal would be decreased but the effluent quality would be impacted and the power consumption for driven nf would be intensifed therefore there was a optimal nf operation pressure and recovery range for achieving the high removal efficiency and energy saving design expert 8 0 was utilized by using the desirability function method to optimize nf operation parameters when pressure and recovery were set equally important and the selected response value had the maximize removal efficiency and the minimize power consumption as shown in fig 12 when the feed water conductivity was 2000 2500 μs cm the efficient operation was 0 64 0 85 mpa for the pressure and 57 40 73 87 for the recovery when conductivity was 2500 3000 μs cm nf efficiently performed under the pressure was 0 67 0 86 mpa and the recovery was 51 11 68 09 when conductivity was 3000 3500 μs cm the optimum range was 0 71 0 90 mpa and 50 41 66 63 these optimal operation conditions were used for actual tests and the operation conditions corresponding response variable values predicted and actual values are shown in table 5 where the errors were all within 5 indicating that the optimal operation conditions were feasible overall when the feed water conductivity was within 3500 μs cm nf could perform high treatment efficiency under the operation range was 0 65 0 85 mpa and 55 70 and with the increase of conductivity it was necessary to gradually increase the pressure and reduce the recovery in this optimum range to maintain the efficient operation 4 conclusion in this work brackish water treatment performance in a municipal potable water treatment plant with the dual membrane process was evaluated and the operation was optimized through a pilot test the results showed that the dual membrane process was effective for the treatment of brackish water and the optimization steps used was available for practical implementation in the water plant in the plant the conventional treatment process and uf were effective to decrease turbidity and ammonia nitrogen but ineffective to remove conductivity chloride content and organic matter the conductivity and chloride content of uf effluent was remained at 90 and 80 respectively after nf treatment all the above pollutants could be removed significantly especially the chloride content reduced to 5 of the raw water indicating that nf played a main role in the dual membrane process in the pilot test the critical flux of uf was determined as 47 5 l m2 h and the tmp recovery gradually increased with the cleaning time prolonged but it stabilized when the time extended to a certain duration the optimum physical cleaning condition was that the duriation of gas wash water backwash and flush were all set to 40 s moreover there were three stages throughout the process of flux attenuation during the continuously 30 days operation with the attenuation rate of each stage gradully increased and the initial flux decreased from 47 5 l m2 h to 42 2 l m2 h when the feed water conductivity was fluctuant nf performed the high removal efficiency over a wider range of operation regulation with the increase of conductivity and as the pressure or recovery increased the power consumption would first decrease and then increase the effect of pressure and recovery on removal efficiency was more significant at high conductivity and mainly attribute to the pressure furthermore the optimum nf operation range was obtained by using mrsm and as the feed conductivity increased it was necessary to increase the pressure and reduce the recovery in this optimum range to maintain the efficient

13762,recently the region of winsor ii has been used to treat produced water to decrease heavy metals amount and oils and greases contents ogc however it usually demands high temperature and the interaction effect of the process factors have not yet been investigated this study has the objective of treating synthetic and real produced water using the region of winsor iv microemulsions to reduce the oil and grease content and also the salinity besides we also statistically investigated the effect of temperature time and microemulsion amount synthetic produced water spw treatment was studied through the experimental design with combinations for three variables time 30 90 min temperature 25 45 c and microemulsion percentage 10 50 the conditions established for the treatment of real produced water rpw were 30 min 35 c and 50 of the microemulsion it was observed that on the treatment of spw the ogc reduction ranged from 69 98 to 97 98 and the salinity from 18 74 to 34 66 regarding the treatment of rpw the ogc reduction was 86 23 from 146 56 mg l 1 to 20 18 mg l 1 and the reduction of salinity was 11 86 from 35 090 20 mg l 1 to 30 928 50 mg l 1 we concluded that the treatments of spw and rpw using microemulsion to reduce ogc and salinity were efficient abbreviations c s co surfactant surfactant ratio df degree of freedom m microemulsion ogc oil and grease content pw

produced water treatment microemulsion oil and grease content salinity 1 introduction oil has been the world s leading exploration resource used for power generation since the 20th century 1 one of the primary effluents from the process of the oil and gas extraction is the production of large volumes of produced water which can reach almost 98 of the total volume of extracted oil when mature fields are at the end of their useful life 2 3 depending on the geological conditions and field positioning the produced water pw may have a complex composition like organic and inorganic compounds dissolved solids and dissolved gases with a high oil and grease content ogc as well as high salinity which is the main characteristic of pw in the oil industry 2 4 5 pw is seen as a waste that causes a significant impact to the environment and human health and one that even causes operational damage since it is discarded in seawater or soil or is reused by reinjection therefore it can generate several penalties and high costs for corrective actions 6 most of the environmental agencies that deal with effluent disposal focus on the presence of oils and greases content of the produced water as the brazilian environmental agency national environment council conama 7 the u s environmental protection agency u s epa 8 and the convention for the protection and conserving the nort east atlantic ospar commission 9 the conama and u s epa have the same standards for the maximum concentration of ogc for disposal at sea which is 29 mg l 1 for simple monthly arithmetic mean with a maximum daily amount of 42 mg l 1 4 7 8 the rules of the ospar commission stipulate that the maximum monthly limit for the disposal of pw is 30 mg l 1 of ogc 8 however the salt content is also important especially in onshore activities since if the water is reinjected it could cause operational damage 10 treatment of the produced water before its final disposal is urgently required as when discarded the high ogc and salinity affect drinking water and groundwater resources endangering human health as well as flora and fauna additionally high salinity can cause clogging corrosion and fouling of the production system 11 thereby different treatments are being studied to reduce ogc and salinity of the produced water such as physical biological membranes and chemical treatments 12 14 regarding physical treatments the most common are hydrocyclones induced air flotation and dissolved gas flotation the hydrocyclones have a simple structure are compact and have low support and maintenance costs however there are some disadvantages to using this method such as the possibility of encrustation and clogging it is not suitable for heavy oil and stable emulsion and requires pressurized inlets 15 16 the treatment with induced air flotation iaf is compact compared to gravity settling tanks the adhesion of fine particles such as suspended solids and oil to the air bubbles forms lighter agglomerates that can be easily floated and removed from the surface 15 nevertheless the generation of sludge from this treatment must also be considered as it implies a significant operational cost 10 another flotation treatment is called dissolved gas flotation dgf which has good results but requires a saturation system with high cost 15 biological treatments are used to remove biodegradable compounds from the produced water through the growth of microorganisms there are two types of biological treatments suspended growth and attached growth the most used process of suspended growth is called activated sludge 17 although biological treatments present good results they have some limitations as the combination of water oil and salt can affect the metabolism of microorganisms and lead to cellular dehydration also as water enters and exits the reactor sudden volume changes occur which can seriously affect the reactor s biological balance 15 membranes treatment is a technology that offers an efficient and effective separation for pw it can be used for pw reinjection purposes in a reservoir with more restrictive characteristics the most common types of membranes used in the treatment of produced water are microfiltration mf nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro and ultrafiltration uf the membrane treatment use equipment that enables offshore use they have high robustness and ease of scaling however the membranes are subject to clogging of oils and greases and biological contents additionally polymeric type membranes are sensitive to temperature with the degradation of the membrane material at temperatures above 50 c 15 chemical treatments add products to treat pw among chemical treatments demulsification and microemulsion can be mentioned treatment with demulsifiers consists of adding a surfactant to the pw this method achieves excellent results for the reduction of ogc but presents a high cost 10 18 microemulsions have an outstanding performance in phase separation because it reduces the interface tension between water and oil and promotes an interfacial transfer area between the phases allowing the extraction of the phase that is dissolved in this case the oil 19 microemulsions were first studied by hoar and schulman 20 they can be defined as dispersed translucent thermodynamically stable systems formed by two immiscible liquids one polar and the other nonpolar in the presence of surfactant 21 there are few studies in the literature exploring the use of microemulsions in the treatment of produced water such as castro dantas et al 22 23 that studied the extraction of heavy metals from produced water and silva et al 5 that studied removal ogc from produced water from our knowledge up to this moment only silva et al 5 have used microemulsion focused on the removal of ogc the microemulsion was composed by pw as aqueous phase kerosene as oily phase isoamyl alcohol as co surfactant and dissolvan or lipesa as a surfactant using c s co surfactant surfactant ratio 9 time of 25 min temperatures of 50 60 c and a region of winsor ii as can be noticed high temperatures were applied and the authors did not investigate the effect of temperature time and percentage of the microemulsion as well as the interactions of these factors however low temperatures can also provide good removal of ogc from the produced water at a lower cost 22 23 besides it is known that the treatment variables do not act in isolation for reducing the ogc that is one influence the other this study proposed the treatment of synthetic and real produced water from the recôncavo basin in bahia brazil using the response surface methodology rsm and milder temperatures to reduce the oil and grease content and also salinity generally rsm is used to evaluate the influence of several factors independent variables on a group of responses dependent variables also the interaction of these factors is as important as the factors themselves because they overlap individual effects acting together to affect the responses 24 thus in this work an experimental design was used to investigate the influence of time temperature and microemulsion percentage on the reduction of response variables the experimental results were modeled by multiple regression to obtain a mathematical model that expresses a response variable as a function of more than one independent variable 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of synthetic produced water two batches of synthetic produced water spw were prepared with quite similar ogc and salinity values one for the selection of the microemulsion diagram point and another for the experimental planning for the preparation of the synthetic produced water it was used crude oil from the recôncavo basin in bahia brazil from tangará field fluidity point of 24 c api gravity of 12 78 the relative density of 0 9807 and viscosity of 1298 5 cp at 25 c as it was fluid at room temperature 25 c the real produced water was from mata de são joão field fluidity point of 36 c api gravity of 35 09 the relative density of 0 8494 and viscosity of 941 cp at 25 c to prepare the synthetic produced water initially approximately 1 g of crude oil and 2 5056 g of nacl dynamic 99 were weighed into a 1000 ml beaker and 500 ml of distilled water was added the beaker was taken to a tecnal brand mechanical agitator model te 139 at a speed of 2600 rpm for 120 min to solubilize the oil in the water it was observed that there would be a significant loss of oil in the beaker the amount of oil used for the preparation of spw was much higher than the desired ogc in the range of 2 565 mg l 1 cited by piemonte et al 25 similar to amounts found in produced water the amount of nacl placed was to obtain a salinity exceeding 3000 mg l cited by xu et al 26 as values found in produced water the procedure was performed ten times and the samples were stored in a single 10 l cylinder and homogenized in total 5 l of spw were prepared 2 2 determination of the oil and grease content the ogc needs to be assessed before and after treatment with the microemulsion using a biospectro visible uv spectrophotometer model sp 220 the experimental procedure was done applying the adapted two step experimental procedure from costa et al 27 which consists of the construction of the calibration curve using n hexane as the solvent and the extraction of the oil from produced water for the preparation of the calibration curve ten known oil concentrations were chosen the first being the stock solution of 420 mg l 1 and those known as standard solutions were made from dilutions after preparation the solutions were analyzed one by one on the uv vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 244 nm and the absorbance corresponding to each solution was read with the absorbance results a graph was plotted concentration x absorbance generating the calibration curve fig 1 represents the calibration curves for oils from synthetic and real produced water 2 3 determination of salinity salinity refers to the total amount of mineral salts dissolved in water and can be determined by total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity μmhos cm 1 ds m 1 ms cm 1 or μs cm 1 28 a previously calibrated lab1000 conductivity meter model mca 150 was used to determine the conductivity the analysis was performed in triplicate the conductivity was expressed in ms cm units from the conductivity result one can calculate the value of the water salinity using eq 1 1 s c m s c m 0 0017 where s is the salinity in mg l 1 and c is the electrical conductivity in ms cm 1 2 4 construction of the pseudoternary phase diagram to formulate the microemulsions tests were performed using commercial surfactant l1905b from lipesa 2 butanol sigma aldrich 99 as a co surfactant distilled water as aqueous phase pine oil as oil phase and co surfactant surfactant ratio c s equal to 10 according to silva et al 5 increasing c s ratio favors removing the dispersed oil for the construction of the diagram the methodology of ferreira et al 29 was employed where the mass of the c s mixture and oil were fixed and titrated with distilled water initially it was started from the point with 0 pine oil and 100 c s varying from 10 to 10 what confirms that each mixture is a microemulsion are the aspects that define it such as being a translucent and homogeneous system 2 4 1 selection of the point for application in the produced water treatment five points were chosen that covered the area of the microemulsion region winsor iv type they were tested for the produced water treatment using a temperature of 25 c the percentage of the microemulsion of 10 and a contact time of 30 min the best point selected for further studies was the one with a higher reduction of ocg and salinity simultaneously in this step we use synthetic produced water with the initial oil and grease content ogc and the salt concentration of 74 77 mg l 1 and 4 752 94 mg l 1 respectively 2 5 synthetic produced water treatment the treatment of synthetic produced water was carried out through the application of experimental design initially a complete factorial type experimental design matrix was developed with combinations for three variables contact time minutes temperature c and percentage of the microemulsion with repetition of the central point the experimental design matrix has as dependent variables reduction of oil and grease content and salinity the ranges used for contact time were 30 60 and 90 min for temperature were 25 35 and 45 c and for microemulsion percentages were 10 30 and 50 the range of the temperature was chosen to opt for values milder than that used by silva et al 5 for contact time and percentage of the microemulsion broader ranges were explored which was not found in the literature especially with the statistical approach the experiments were performed randomly to reduce the effects of external factors that were not considered in the planning for the application of the experimental design we use synthetic produced water with initial ogc and salinity values of 71 44 mg l 1 and 5 023 53 mg l 1 respectively the experimental design results were modeled by multiple regression with ogc and salinity as a function of the independent variables as the contact time temperature and percentage of the microemulsion therefore a mathematical model could be obtained which expresses each response variable the efficiency of the mathematical model and statistical relevance was analyzed from the second regression using variance analysis anova for the treatment the amount of microemulsion and synthetic produced water spw used for each trial was calculated mainly obeying the need to obtain 140 ml of the water at the end of each experiment to determine its ogc the formulations of the microemulsions are made by mass rather than by volume therefore 160 g of synthetic produced water was adopted for use in all trials after being weighed the components of the microemulsions were homogenized with a nova instruments magnetic agitator model ni1102 and magnetic bar subsequently the weighed spw was transferred to a 500 ml erlenmeyer flask and placed in a solab ultra thermostatic bath model sl152 at the set temperature for each test it took approximately 30 min for the water to reach the appropriate bath temperature and the microemulsion was added the erlenmeyer was shaken manually for 1 min and allowed to stand until the time set for each test had elapsed the mixture was then transferred to a settling funnel and 1 min was allowed to separate the synthetic produced water and the microemulsion recovering the water remaining in the lower part of the funnel 2 6 selection of treatment conditions of real produced water to determine the best conditions independent variable values that were applied in the treatment of real produced water rpw the response surface of the independent variables for salinity and the effects of the independent variables for the oil and grease content were analyzed in the treatment of the synthetic water the rpw treatment was performed following the same procedure as the spw 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of the point for application in the treatment microemulsions can reduce the concentrations of metals 22 23 and ogc 5 in produced water however in this work we show that microemulsions can also reduce the salinity of the water fig 2 shows the pseudoternary diagram obtained for the mixture of distilled water aqueous phase pine oil organic phase 2 butanol co surfactant and l1905b surfactant also we show five compositions chosen to study the winsor iv region in reducing ogc and salinity in the water produced in general relating the reductions in ogc table 1 and the formulations fig 2 we observed that the reductions increase with the increase in the amount of pine oil in the microemulsion this was expected since substances of the same chemical nature are more easily solubilized therefore oil rich microemulsions tend to remove oils and greases better previous research on the treatment of produced water using microemulsion 5 22 23 has not investigated the reduction in salinity therefore we also list the salinity reductions table 1 and the microemulsion formulations fig 2 we observed that the reduction in salinity increased when the amount of c s in the microemulsions was also increased we attribute this behavior to the increase in the amount of co surfactant 2 butanol in the mixture for a high c s ratio for example equal to 10 the higher the amount of c s in the formulation the higher the amount of co surfactant because it is the least dense component of the mixture increasing the amount of co surfactant decreases the resistance to mass transfer of the salt ions from the produced water to the microemulsion for the later stages of the research we selected one of the five formulations firstly we selected the higher reduction percentage of the oil and grease content secondly we selected the more significant reduction of salinity from these criteria it was possible to observe that points 4 and 5 present a more significant reduction in the ogc than the others however considering the standard deviation in these points they are quite similar concerning ogc therefore between these two points we chose the one that showed the most considerable reduction in salinity point 4 point 4 composition is 50 c s 45 pine oil and 5 distilled water 3 2 experimental design in the treatment of synthetic produced water 3 2 1 statistical analysis for the reduction of oil and grease content ogc previous work on the treatment of produced water using microemulsion 5 22 23 has not investigated the effects of interactions of treatment variables on ogc therefore we calculated the effects of the variables time temperature and amount of microemulsion and built the pareto diagram for the ogc table 2 shows the ogc results obtained after the treatment of the synthetic produced water the ogc reduction values ranged from 69 98 to 97 98 as such the different application conditions of microemulsion proved to be effective in reducing ogc as compared to the maximum amount for disposal at sea which was established by brazilian resolution no 393 2007 of conama 7 this resolution states that the monthly simple arithmetic average concentration of oils and greases must be of up to 29 mg l 1 with a maximum daily amount of 42 mg l 1 4 7 considering that the u s environmental protection agency u s epa standards are the same as the brazilian the values are also inside the maximum limits 8 regarding the standards of the convention for the protection and conserving the nort east atlantic ospar commission it stipulates that the maximum monthly limit for disposal of pw is 30 mg l 1 of ogc 9 therefore the obtained results are also in limit the reduction of the ogc of the synthetic produced water treated with the microemulsion presented good results compared to the literature cha et al 30 achieved 83 33 reduction of the ogc using pressure assisted ozonation and sand filtration pardue et al 31 achieved a 50 reduction of ogc using a pilot scale wetland system with biogeochemical processes gobbi et al 32 obtained a reduction of 97 77 ogc using an electrocoagulation system zhang et al 33 obtained a 98 2 reduction of the ogc using a hybrid microfiltration membrane cai et al 34 obtained a 92 5 reduction in ogc using the biological demulsification process which consists of breaking of the emulsion oil in water by marine bacteria that play the role of the demulsifying agent separating the oil from the water silva et al 5 obtained a reduction of up to 99 with microemulsion although the results are similar to ours it is noteworthy that silva et al 5 used higher temperatures and did not investigate the effects of treatment conditions such as temperature contact time and percentage of the microemulsion as well as the interactions of these factors however low temperatures can also provide good removal of ogc from the produced water at a lower cost 22 23 besides it is known that the treatment variables do not act in isolation for reducing the ogc that is one influence the other our results table 3 show that the increase in temperature 25 45 c favors a reduction in ogc the increase of the temperature from low to a high level 25 45 c increases the ogc reduction by 13 60 for the percentage of the microemulsion when increasing the level from low to high 10 50 promotes ogc reduction by 6 61 in addition we found a positive interaction between contact time and the amount of microemulsion therefore regardless of the temperature the reduction in ogc increased when contact time and amount of microemulsion were kept at their higher 90 min and 50 or lower 30 min and 10 levels contrarywise the reduction in ogc decreases when at least one of these variables is at the low level 30 min or 10 and the other at the high level 90 min or 50 the effects of the time the time and temperature interaction and the temperature and the percentage of the microemulsion interaction were not statistically significant the temperature was the most influential factor in reducing ogc according to stokes law the higher the temperature the lower the viscosity and consequently the higher the separation velocity of oil droplets from the produced water positively influencing the reduction of ogc 35 the second most influential factor in reducing ogc is the percentage of the microemulsion this might be explained by the solubilization capacity of the microemulsion with the increase in the percentage of the microemulsion there is an increase in the concentration of surfactant which implies a lower interfacial tension favoring the solubilization of oil in the microemulsion 36 the importance of the factors is in hierarchical order in the pareto graph to the ogc reduction fig 3 in this case the response surface methodology was not used to ogc reduction because it was not possible to get a first order model statistically significant 3 2 2 statistical analysis for the reduction of salinity table 4 shows the salt concentrations results obtained after the treatment of the synthetic produced water for salinity the interactions between the produced water treatment variables have also not been investigated in previous studies 5 22 23 therefore we calculate the effects construct the pareto diagram and use the response surface methodology for salinity from table 4 salinity reduction ranged from 18 74 to 34 66 these results were better than those reported by shahruddin et al 37 the authors investigated the desalination of synthetic produced water using bentonite as a pretreatment and adsorption of total dissolved solids tds as the primary treatment resulting in a salinity reduction of 17 15 the results obtained in this study were also higher than those obtained by kokabian et al 38 who obtained tds reductions of up to 32 2 using a microbial desalination process however it was lower than those found by kim et al 39 who obtained an 84 reduction in salinity using membrane distillation crystallization although the results with membranes are superior to ours it is worth noting that the membranes might be subject to the clogging of oils and greases and biological contents in addition they are also temperature sensitive with the degradation of the polymer membrane material at temperatures higher than 50 c 40 in table 5 we found that increasing the amount of microemulsion 10 50 increased the salinity reduction 11 22 however the change in treatment time did not have influence p value 2 36 10 1 0 05 the temperature and the amount of microemulsion showed a negative interaction effect 5 08 this means that the reduction in salinity increases if one of these variables is kept at a high level 45 c or 50 while the other is kept at a low level 25 c or 10 the effects of the temperature time and temperature interaction and time and percentage of microemulsion interaction were not statistically significant p value 0 05 the percentage of the microemulsion is the factor that most influences the reduction of salinity followed by the interaction of the factors temperature and percentage of microemulsion fig 4 this can be attributed to the solubilization of the salt in the microemulsion with the contribution of temperature by mass transfer 41 eq 2 represents the mathematical model r2 87 83 obtained in terms of the coded independent variables statistically significant in the salinity reduction the model s determination coefficient of 0 8783 indicates that 87 83 of the salinity reduction variation can be explained by the model 2 r s 27 4 10 6 m 4 8 t m in which rs is the salinity reduction m is the percentage of microemulsion and t is the temperature c in table 6 we show the analysis of the variance anova of eq 2 this analysis showed that the model is statistically significant as the model obtained by regression is statistically significant the response surface fig 5 and the level curves can be plotted fig 6 by analyzing figs 5 and 6 it can be stated that low temperatures 25 c up to 35 c 1 0 up to 0 0 and low percentages of the microemulsion 10 up to 20 1 0 up to 0 4 result in lower salinity reductions higher salinity reductions are obtained when the percentage of the microemulsion is in the range of 40 50 0 4 up to 1 0 and temperature in the range of 25 c up to 35 c 1 0 up to 0 0 for the range of 20 up to 40 0 4 up to 0 4 of the microemulsion the temperature did not show any influence in the reduction of salinity 3 3 real produced water treatment to select the conditions used in the rpw treatment firstly it was evaluated the experimental design of the spw treatment it was observed that the conditions used in the test with the most significant ogc reduction of 97 98 were 90 min of contact time the temperature of 45 c and 50 microemulsion the conditions of the highest salinity reduction test 33 96 were 30 min 25 c and 50 microemulsion after these evaluations it can be observed that the only similar condition for the two response variables ogc and salinity was the percentage of the microemulsion by analyzing the salinity response surface and the effects of the oil and grease content of the spw treatment planning it can be concluded that the contact time variable was not influential for ogc and salinity therefore the lowest contact time may be used as the highest ogc reduction temperature was at 45 c and the most significant salinity reduction was at 25 c it was decided to use the average temperature 35 c to meet both responses therefore the following conditions were established for the rpw treatment 30 min of contact time the temperature of 35 c and 50 microemulsion table 7 shows the ogc salinity and the standard deviation for real produced water before treatment and the values including reduction percentages for the treated real produced water trpw as shown in table 7 the ocg reduction was very significant going from 146 56 mg l 1 to 20 18 mg l 1 reaching a reduction percentage of 86 23 the ogc reduction of the synthetic produced water treated with the microemulsion studied in this project presented good results compared to the literature silva et al 42 reported a reduction of 99 of the ogc of the real produced water in the optimal experimental condition using the integration of the flotation and photo fenton processes hosny et al 11 obtained 85 ogc reduction using the chitosan mixture with carboxymethylcellulose to adsorb oil from the real produced water regarding the final destination of the trpw the final ogc of 20 18 mg l 1 with a standard deviation of 3 33 is within the maximum value for disposal at sea as established by brazilian regulatory agency conama by u s environmental protection agency u s epa and by convention for the protection and conserving the nort east atlantic ospar commission their limits were cited in section 3 2 1 4 7 9 regarding the reinjection there are not any ogc values tabulated however it is known that high values provoke the sealing of the rock pores causing damage to the formation 11 therefore to this end it can be stated that the rpw treatment was efficient as the ogc value after treatment was low the salinity reduction values changed from 35 090 20 mg l 1 to 30 927 45 mg l 1 reaching a reduction percentage of 11 86 therefore it is possible to affirm that besides the significant values obtained for the reduction of the tog additionally it was possible to reduce the salinity regarding the final destination of trpw and salinity it can be concluded that it can be disposed of at sea as it is within the maximum salinity limit of marine water which is generally 35 000 mg l 1 43 4 conclusions in this research we tested a new microemulsion formulation pine oil distilled water 2 butanol and l1905b for the treatment of produced water our study concluded that in addition to reducing the content of oils and greases microemulsions can reduce salinity the reduction in the content of oils and greases is favored by the increase in the amount of oil present in the microemulsion meanwhile the reduction in the salt content is favored by increasing the amount of c s of the microemulsion applied in the treatment there are effects of significant interactions between the variables of treatment of the produced water in the case of ogc time and amount of microemulsion interact in turn salinity is affected by the effect of interaction between temperature and amount of microemulsion the favorable condition for reducing ogc and salinity is 35 c 90 min and 50 microemulsion the use of microemulsion in the treatment of synthetic and real produced water allows us to obtain ogc within the limits of u s epa ospar and conama standards for disposal at sea

13762,recently the region of winsor ii has been used to treat produced water to decrease heavy metals amount and oils and greases contents ogc however it usually demands high temperature and the interaction effect of the process factors have not yet been investigated this study has the objective of treating synthetic and real produced water using the region of winsor iv microemulsions to reduce the oil and grease content and also the salinity besides we also statistically investigated the effect of temperature time and microemulsion amount synthetic produced water spw treatment was studied through the experimental design with combinations for three variables time 30 90 min temperature 25 45 c and microemulsion percentage 10 50 the conditions established for the treatment of real produced water rpw were 30 min 35 c and 50 of the microemulsion it was observed that on the treatment of spw the ogc reduction ranged from 69 98 to 97 98 and the salinity from 18 74 to 34 66 regarding the treatment of rpw the ogc reduction was 86 23 from 146 56 mg l 1 to 20 18 mg l 1 and the reduction of salinity was 11 86 from 35 090 20 mg l 1 to 30 928 50 mg l 1 we concluded that the treatments

produced water treatment microemulsion oil and grease content salinity 1 introduction oil has been the world s leading exploration resource used for power generation since the 20th century 1 one of the primary effluents from the process of the oil and gas extraction is the production of large volumes of produced water which can reach almost 98 of the total volume of extracted oil when mature fields are at the end of their useful life 2 3 depending on the geological conditions and field positioning the produced water pw may have a complex composition like organic and inorganic compounds dissolved solids and dissolved gases with a high oil and grease content ogc as well as high salinity which is the main characteristic of pw in the oil industry 2 4 5 pw is seen as a waste that causes a significant impact to the environment and human health and one that even causes operational damage since it is discarded in seawater or soil or is reused by reinjection therefore it can generate several penalties and high costs for corrective actions 6 most of the environmental agencies that deal with effluent disposal focus on the presence of oils and greases content of the produced water as the brazilian environmental agency national environment council conama 7 the u s environmental protection agency u s epa 8 and the convention for the protection and conserving the nort east atlantic ospar commission 9 the conama and u s epa have the same standards for the maximum concentration of ogc for disposal at sea which is 29 mg l 1 for simple monthly arithmetic mean with a maximum daily amount of 42 mg l 1 4 7 8 the rules of the ospar commission stipulate that the maximum monthly limit for the disposal of pw is 30 mg l 1 of ogc 8 however the salt content is also important especially in onshore activities since if the water is reinjected it could cause operational damage 10 treatment of the produced water before its final disposal is urgently required as when discarded the high ogc and salinity affect drinking water and groundwater resources endangering human health as well as flora and fauna additionally high salinity can cause clogging corrosion and fouling of the production system 11 thereby different treatments are being studied to reduce ogc and salinity of the produced water such as physical biological membranes and chemical treatments 12 14 regarding physical treatments the most common are hydrocyclones induced air flotation and dissolved gas flotation the hydrocyclones have a simple structure are compact and have low support and maintenance costs however there are some disadvantages to using this method such as the possibility of encrustation and clogging it is not suitable for heavy oil and stable emulsion and requires pressurized inlets 15 16 the treatment with induced air flotation iaf is compact compared to gravity settling tanks the adhesion of fine particles such as suspended solids and oil to the air bubbles forms lighter agglomerates that can be easily floated and removed from the surface 15 nevertheless the generation of sludge from this treatment must also be considered as it implies a significant operational cost 10 another flotation treatment is called dissolved gas flotation dgf which has good results but requires a saturation system with high cost 15 biological treatments are used to remove biodegradable compounds from the produced water through the growth of microorganisms there are two types of biological treatments suspended growth and attached growth the most used process of suspended growth is called activated sludge 17 although biological treatments present good results they have some limitations as the combination of water oil and salt can affect the metabolism of microorganisms and lead to cellular dehydration also as water enters and exits the reactor sudden volume changes occur which can seriously affect the reactor s biological balance 15 membranes treatment is a technology that offers an efficient and effective separation for pw it can be used for pw reinjection purposes in a reservoir with more restrictive characteristics the most common types of membranes used in the treatment of produced water are microfiltration mf nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro and ultrafiltration uf the membrane treatment use equipment that enables offshore use they have high robustness and ease of scaling however the membranes are subject to clogging of oils and greases and biological contents additionally polymeric type membranes are sensitive to temperature with the degradation of the membrane material at temperatures above 50 c 15 chemical treatments add products to treat pw among chemical treatments demulsification and microemulsion can be mentioned treatment with demulsifiers consists of adding a surfactant to the pw this method achieves excellent results for the reduction of ogc but presents a high cost 10 18 microemulsions have an outstanding performance in phase separation because it reduces the interface tension between water and oil and promotes an interfacial transfer area between the phases allowing the extraction of the phase that is dissolved in this case the oil 19 microemulsions were first studied by hoar and schulman 20 they can be defined as dispersed translucent thermodynamically stable systems formed by two immiscible liquids one polar and the other nonpolar in the presence of surfactant 21 there are few studies in the literature exploring the use of microemulsions in the treatment of produced water such as castro dantas et al 22 23 that studied the extraction of heavy metals from produced water and silva et al 5 that studied removal ogc from produced water from our knowledge up to this moment only silva et al 5 have used microemulsion focused on the removal of ogc the microemulsion was composed by pw as aqueous phase kerosene as oily phase isoamyl alcohol as co surfactant and dissolvan or lipesa as a surfactant using c s co surfactant surfactant ratio 9 time of 25 min temperatures of 50 60 c and a region of winsor ii as can be noticed high temperatures were applied and the authors did not investigate the effect of temperature time and percentage of the microemulsion as well as the interactions of these factors however low temperatures can also provide good removal of ogc from the produced water at a lower cost 22 23 besides it is known that the treatment variables do not act in isolation for reducing the ogc that is one influence the other this study proposed the treatment of synthetic and real produced water from the recôncavo basin in bahia brazil using the response surface methodology rsm and milder temperatures to reduce the oil and grease content and also salinity generally rsm is used to evaluate the influence of several factors independent variables on a group of responses dependent variables also the interaction of these factors is as important as the factors themselves because they overlap individual effects acting together to affect the responses 24 thus in this work an experimental design was used to investigate the influence of time temperature and microemulsion percentage on the reduction of response variables the experimental results were modeled by multiple regression to obtain a mathematical model that expresses a response variable as a function of more than one independent variable 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of synthetic produced water two batches of synthetic produced water spw were prepared with quite similar ogc and salinity values one for the selection of the microemulsion diagram point and another for the experimental planning for the preparation of the synthetic produced water it was used crude oil from the recôncavo basin in bahia brazil from tangará field fluidity point of 24 c api gravity of 12 78 the relative density of 0 9807 and viscosity of 1298 5 cp at 25 c as it was fluid at room temperature 25 c the real produced water was from mata de são joão field fluidity point of 36 c api gravity of 35 09 the relative density of 0 8494 and viscosity of 941 cp at 25 c to prepare the synthetic produced water initially approximately 1 g of crude oil and 2 5056 g of nacl dynamic 99 were weighed into a 1000 ml beaker and 500 ml of distilled water was added the beaker was taken to a tecnal brand mechanical agitator model te 139 at a speed of 2600 rpm for 120 min to solubilize the oil in the water it was observed that there would be a significant loss of oil in the beaker the amount of oil used for the preparation of spw was much higher than the desired ogc in the range of 2 565 mg l 1 cited by piemonte et al 25 similar to amounts found in produced water the amount of nacl placed was to obtain a salinity exceeding 3000 mg l cited by xu et al 26 as values found in produced water the procedure was performed ten times and the samples were stored in a single 10 l cylinder and homogenized in total 5 l of spw were prepared 2 2 determination of the oil and grease content the ogc needs to be assessed before and after treatment with the microemulsion using a biospectro visible uv spectrophotometer model sp 220 the experimental procedure was done applying the adapted two step experimental procedure from costa et al 27 which consists of the construction of the calibration curve using n hexane as the solvent and the extraction of the oil from produced water for the preparation of the calibration curve ten known oil concentrations were chosen the first being the stock solution of 420 mg l 1 and those known as standard solutions were made from dilutions after preparation the solutions were analyzed one by one on the uv vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 244 nm and the absorbance corresponding to each solution was read with the absorbance results a graph was plotted concentration x absorbance generating the calibration curve fig 1 represents the calibration curves for oils from synthetic and real produced water 2 3 determination of salinity salinity refers to the total amount of mineral salts dissolved in water and can be determined by total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity μmhos cm 1 ds m 1 ms cm 1 or μs cm 1 28 a previously calibrated lab1000 conductivity meter model mca 150 was used to determine the conductivity the analysis was performed in triplicate the conductivity was expressed in ms cm units from the conductivity result one can calculate the value of the water salinity using eq 1 1 s c m s c m 0 0017 where s is the salinity in mg l 1 and c is the electrical conductivity in ms cm 1 2 4 construction of the pseudoternary phase diagram to formulate the microemulsions tests were performed using commercial surfactant l1905b from lipesa 2 butanol sigma aldrich 99 as a co surfactant distilled water as aqueous phase pine oil as oil phase and co surfactant surfactant ratio c s equal to 10 according to silva et al 5 increasing c s ratio favors removing the dispersed oil for the construction of the diagram the methodology of ferreira et al 29 was employed where the mass of the c s mixture and oil were fixed and titrated with distilled water initially it was started from the point with 0 pine oil and 100 c s varying from 10 to 10 what confirms that each mixture is a microemulsion are the aspects that define it such as being a translucent and homogeneous system 2 4 1 selection of the point for application in the produced water treatment five points were chosen that covered the area of the microemulsion region winsor iv type they were tested for the produced water treatment using a temperature of 25 c the percentage of the microemulsion of 10 and a contact time of 30 min the best point selected for further studies was the one with a higher reduction of ocg and salinity simultaneously in this step we use synthetic produced water with the initial oil and grease content ogc and the salt concentration of 74 77 mg l 1 and 4 752 94 mg l 1 respectively 2 5 synthetic produced water treatment the treatment of synthetic produced water was carried out through the application of experimental design initially a complete factorial type experimental design matrix was developed with combinations for three variables contact time minutes temperature c and percentage of the microemulsion with repetition of the central point the experimental design matrix has as dependent variables reduction of oil and grease content and salinity the ranges used for contact time were 30 60 and 90 min for temperature were 25 35 and 45 c and for microemulsion percentages were 10 30 and 50 the range of the temperature was chosen to opt for values milder than that used by silva et al 5 for contact time and percentage of the microemulsion broader ranges were explored which was not found in the literature especially with the statistical approach the experiments were performed randomly to reduce the effects of external factors that were not considered in the planning for the application of the experimental design we use synthetic produced water with initial ogc and salinity values of 71 44 mg l 1 and 5 023 53 mg l 1 respectively the experimental design results were modeled by multiple regression with ogc and salinity as a function of the independent variables as the contact time temperature and percentage of the microemulsion therefore a mathematical model could be obtained which expresses each response variable the efficiency of the mathematical model and statistical relevance was analyzed from the second regression using variance analysis anova for the treatment the amount of microemulsion and synthetic produced water spw used for each trial was calculated mainly obeying the need to obtain 140 ml of the water at the end of each experiment to determine its ogc the formulations of the microemulsions are made by mass rather than by volume therefore 160 g of synthetic produced water was adopted for use in all trials after being weighed the components of the microemulsions were homogenized with a nova instruments magnetic agitator model ni1102 and magnetic bar subsequently the weighed spw was transferred to a 500 ml erlenmeyer flask and placed in a solab ultra thermostatic bath model sl152 at the set temperature for each test it took approximately 30 min for the water to reach the appropriate bath temperature and the microemulsion was added the erlenmeyer was shaken manually for 1 min and allowed to stand until the time set for each test had elapsed the mixture was then transferred to a settling funnel and 1 min was allowed to separate the synthetic produced water and the microemulsion recovering the water remaining in the lower part of the funnel 2 6 selection of treatment conditions of real produced water to determine the best conditions independent variable values that were applied in the treatment of real produced water rpw the response surface of the independent variables for salinity and the effects of the independent variables for the oil and grease content were analyzed in the treatment of the synthetic water the rpw treatment was performed following the same procedure as the spw 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of the point for application in the treatment microemulsions can reduce the concentrations of metals 22 23 and ogc 5 in produced water however in this work we show that microemulsions can also reduce the salinity of the water fig 2 shows the pseudoternary diagram obtained for the mixture of distilled water aqueous phase pine oil organic phase 2 butanol co surfactant and l1905b surfactant also we show five compositions chosen to study the winsor iv region in reducing ogc and salinity in the water produced in general relating the reductions in ogc table 1 and the formulations fig 2 we observed that the reductions increase with the increase in the amount of pine oil in the microemulsion this was expected since substances of the same chemical nature are more easily solubilized therefore oil rich microemulsions tend to remove oils and greases better previous research on the treatment of produced water using microemulsion 5 22 23 has not investigated the reduction in salinity therefore we also list the salinity reductions table 1 and the microemulsion formulations fig 2 we observed that the reduction in salinity increased when the amount of c s in the microemulsions was also increased we attribute this behavior to the increase in the amount of co surfactant 2 butanol in the mixture for a high c s ratio for example equal to 10 the higher the amount of c s in the formulation the higher the amount of co surfactant because it is the least dense component of the mixture increasing the amount of co surfactant decreases the resistance to mass transfer of the salt ions from the produced water to the microemulsion for the later stages of the research we selected one of the five formulations firstly we selected the higher reduction percentage of the oil and grease content secondly we selected the more significant reduction of salinity from these criteria it was possible to observe that points 4 and 5 present a more significant reduction in the ogc than the others however considering the standard deviation in these points they are quite similar concerning ogc therefore between these two points we chose the one that showed the most considerable reduction in salinity point 4 point 4 composition is 50 c s 45 pine oil and 5 distilled water 3 2 experimental design in the treatment of synthetic produced water 3 2 1 statistical analysis for the reduction of oil and grease content ogc previous work on the treatment of produced water using microemulsion 5 22 23 has not investigated the effects of interactions of treatment variables on ogc therefore we calculated the effects of the variables time temperature and amount of microemulsion and built the pareto diagram for the ogc table 2 shows the ogc results obtained after the treatment of the synthetic produced water the ogc reduction values ranged from 69 98 to 97 98 as such the different application conditions of microemulsion proved to be effective in reducing ogc as compared to the maximum amount for disposal at sea which was established by brazilian resolution no 393 2007 of conama 7 this resolution states that the monthly simple arithmetic average concentration of oils and greases must be of up to 29 mg l 1 with a maximum daily amount of 42 mg l 1 4 7 considering that the u s environmental protection agency u s epa standards are the same as the brazilian the values are also inside the maximum limits 8 regarding the standards of the convention for the protection and conserving the nort east atlantic ospar commission it stipulates that the maximum monthly limit for disposal of pw is 30 mg l 1 of ogc 9 therefore the obtained results are also in limit the reduction of the ogc of the synthetic produced water treated with the microemulsion presented good results compared to the literature cha et al 30 achieved 83 33 reduction of the ogc using pressure assisted ozonation and sand filtration pardue et al 31 achieved a 50 reduction of ogc using a pilot scale wetland system with biogeochemical processes gobbi et al 32 obtained a reduction of 97 77 ogc using an electrocoagulation system zhang et al 33 obtained a 98 2 reduction of the ogc using a hybrid microfiltration membrane cai et al 34 obtained a 92 5 reduction in ogc using the biological demulsification process which consists of breaking of the emulsion oil in water by marine bacteria that play the role of the demulsifying agent separating the oil from the water silva et al 5 obtained a reduction of up to 99 with microemulsion although the results are similar to ours it is noteworthy that silva et al 5 used higher temperatures and did not investigate the effects of treatment conditions such as temperature contact time and percentage of the microemulsion as well as the interactions of these factors however low temperatures can also provide good removal of ogc from the produced water at a lower cost 22 23 besides it is known that the treatment variables do not act in isolation for reducing the ogc that is one influence the other our results table 3 show that the increase in temperature 25 45 c favors a reduction in ogc the increase of the temperature from low to a high level 25 45 c increases the ogc reduction by 13 60 for the percentage of the microemulsion when increasing the level from low to high 10 50 promotes ogc reduction by 6 61 in addition we found a positive interaction between contact time and the amount of microemulsion therefore regardless of the temperature the reduction in ogc increased when contact time and amount of microemulsion were kept at their higher 90 min and 50 or lower 30 min and 10 levels contrarywise the reduction in ogc decreases when at least one of these variables is at the low level 30 min or 10 and the other at the high level 90 min or 50 the effects of the time the time and temperature interaction and the temperature and the percentage of the microemulsion interaction were not statistically significant the temperature was the most influential factor in reducing ogc according to stokes law the higher the temperature the lower the viscosity and consequently the higher the separation velocity of oil droplets from the produced water positively influencing the reduction of ogc 35 the second most influential factor in reducing ogc is the percentage of the microemulsion this might be explained by the solubilization capacity of the microemulsion with the increase in the percentage of the microemulsion there is an increase in the concentration of surfactant which implies a lower interfacial tension favoring the solubilization of oil in the microemulsion 36 the importance of the factors is in hierarchical order in the pareto graph to the ogc reduction fig 3 in this case the response surface methodology was not used to ogc reduction because it was not possible to get a first order model statistically significant 3 2 2 statistical analysis for the reduction of salinity table 4 shows the salt concentrations results obtained after the treatment of the synthetic produced water for salinity the interactions between the produced water treatment variables have also not been investigated in previous studies 5 22 23 therefore we calculate the effects construct the pareto diagram and use the response surface methodology for salinity from table 4 salinity reduction ranged from 18 74 to 34 66 these results were better than those reported by shahruddin et al 37 the authors investigated the desalination of synthetic produced water using bentonite as a pretreatment and adsorption of total dissolved solids tds as the primary treatment resulting in a salinity reduction of 17 15 the results obtained in this study were also higher than those obtained by kokabian et al 38 who obtained tds reductions of up to 32 2 using a microbial desalination process however it was lower than those found by kim et al 39 who obtained an 84 reduction in salinity using membrane distillation crystallization although the results with membranes are superior to ours it is worth noting that the membranes might be subject to the clogging of oils and greases and biological contents in addition they are also temperature sensitive with the degradation of the polymer membrane material at temperatures higher than 50 c 40 in table 5 we found that increasing the amount of microemulsion 10 50 increased the salinity reduction 11 22 however the change in treatment time did not have influence p value 2 36 10 1 0 05 the temperature and the amount of microemulsion showed a negative interaction effect 5 08 this means that the reduction in salinity increases if one of these variables is kept at a high level 45 c or 50 while the other is kept at a low level 25 c or 10 the effects of the temperature time and temperature interaction and time and percentage of microemulsion interaction were not statistically significant p value 0 05 the percentage of the microemulsion is the factor that most influences the reduction of salinity followed by the interaction of the factors temperature and percentage of microemulsion fig 4 this can be attributed to the solubilization of the salt in the microemulsion with the contribution of temperature by mass transfer 41 eq 2 represents the mathematical model r2 87 83 obtained in terms of the coded independent variables statistically significant in the salinity reduction the model s determination coefficient of 0 8783 indicates that 87 83 of the salinity reduction variation can be explained by the model 2 r s 27 4 10 6 m 4 8 t m in which rs is the salinity reduction m is the percentage of microemulsion and t is the temperature c in table 6 we show the analysis of the variance anova of eq 2 this analysis showed that the model is statistically significant as the model obtained by regression is statistically significant the response surface fig 5 and the level curves can be plotted fig 6 by analyzing figs 5 and 6 it can be stated that low temperatures 25 c up to 35 c 1 0 up to 0 0 and low percentages of the microemulsion 10 up to 20 1 0 up to 0 4 result in lower salinity reductions higher salinity reductions are obtained when the percentage of the microemulsion is in the range of 40 50 0 4 up to 1 0 and temperature in the range of 25 c up to 35 c 1 0 up to 0 0 for the range of 20 up to 40 0 4 up to 0 4 of the microemulsion the temperature did not show any influence in the reduction of salinity 3 3 real produced water treatment to select the conditions used in the rpw treatment firstly it was evaluated the experimental design of the spw treatment it was observed that the conditions used in the test with the most significant ogc reduction of 97 98 were 90 min of contact time the temperature of 45 c and 50 microemulsion the conditions of the highest salinity reduction test 33 96 were 30 min 25 c and 50 microemulsion after these evaluations it can be observed that the only similar condition for the two response variables ogc and salinity was the percentage of the microemulsion by analyzing the salinity response surface and the effects of the oil and grease content of the spw treatment planning it can be concluded that the contact time variable was not influential for ogc and salinity therefore the lowest contact time may be used as the highest ogc reduction temperature was at 45 c and the most significant salinity reduction was at 25 c it was decided to use the average temperature 35 c to meet both responses therefore the following conditions were established for the rpw treatment 30 min of contact time the temperature of 35 c and 50 microemulsion table 7 shows the ogc salinity and the standard deviation for real produced water before treatment and the values including reduction percentages for the treated real produced water trpw as shown in table 7 the ocg reduction was very significant going from 146 56 mg l 1 to 20 18 mg l 1 reaching a reduction percentage of 86 23 the ogc reduction of the synthetic produced water treated with the microemulsion studied in this project presented good results compared to the literature silva et al 42 reported a reduction of 99 of the ogc of the real produced water in the optimal experimental condition using the integration of the flotation and photo fenton processes hosny et al 11 obtained 85 ogc reduction using the chitosan mixture with carboxymethylcellulose to adsorb oil from the real produced water regarding the final destination of the trpw the final ogc of 20 18 mg l 1 with a standard deviation of 3 33 is within the maximum value for disposal at sea as established by brazilian regulatory agency conama by u s environmental protection agency u s epa and by convention for the protection and conserving the nort east atlantic ospar commission their limits were cited in section 3 2 1 4 7 9 regarding the reinjection there are not any ogc values tabulated however it is known that high values provoke the sealing of the rock pores causing damage to the formation 11 therefore to this end it can be stated that the rpw treatment was efficient as the ogc value after treatment was low the salinity reduction values changed from 35 090 20 mg l 1 to 30 927 45 mg l 1 reaching a reduction percentage of 11 86 therefore it is possible to affirm that besides the significant values obtained for the reduction of the tog additionally it was possible to reduce the salinity regarding the final destination of trpw and salinity it can be concluded that it can be disposed of at sea as it is within the maximum salinity limit of marine water which is generally 35 000 mg l 1 43 4 conclusions in this research we tested a new microemulsion formulation pine oil distilled water 2 butanol and l1905b for the treatment of produced water our study concluded that in addition to reducing the content of oils and greases microemulsions can reduce salinity the reduction in the content of oils and greases is favored by the increase in the amount of oil present in the microemulsion meanwhile the reduction in the salt content is favored by increasing the amount of c s of the microemulsion applied in the treatment there are effects of significant interactions between the variables of treatment of the produced water in the case of ogc time and amount of microemulsion interact in turn salinity is affected by the effect of interaction between temperature and amount of microemulsion the favorable condition for reducing ogc and salinity is 35 c 90 min and 50 microemulsion the use of microemulsion in the treatment of synthetic and real produced water allows us to obtain ogc within the limits of u s epa ospar and conama standards for disposal at sea

13763,in this study cheese whey a nutrient rich industrial waste was utilized as a low cost fermentation medium for the growth of bacillus subtilis and nattokinase production the nattokinase yield caseinolytic activity using cheese whey 789 93 u ml 1 was 5 7 less compared to glucose or lactose based synthetic media 833 44 and 850 84 u ml 1 respectively effect of nitrogen supplementation yeast extract tryptone and peptone on nattokinase yield was tested adopting an l9 33 taguchi experimental design which revealed yeast extract as the best nitrogen source yeast extract supplementation 10 g l 1 to cheese whey increased the caseinolytic activity to 833 43 u ml 1 making it comparable to lactose and glucose based synthetic media while lowering the medium cost by 55 60 a dynamic model incorporating logistic growth substrate utilization and luedeking piret product formation kinetics across all carbon sources offered good agreement r2 0 93 the estimated maximum specific growth rate on lactose based synthetic medium 0 204 h 1 or yeast extract supplemented cheese whey medium 0 201 h 1 were better than that of the glucose based synthetic medium 0 122 h 1 a similar observation on the growth associated product formation parameters offers insight on medium selection process overall this study suggested that cheese whey could be utilized as a low cost medium for nattokinase production keywords cheese whey dynamic modelling fibrinolytic enzyme nattokinase taguchi design 1 introduction nattokinase a serine protease first extracted and purified from natto traditional food in japan can degrade fibrin protein 1 3 its clot dissolving ability and applications to treat thrombosis cardiovascular disease is well documented 1 4 5 nattokinase has various advantages over other fibrinolytic enzymes tissue plasminogen activator streptokinase urokinase lumbrokinase etc such as greater activity no side effects longer life time in body can be administered orally and lower cost 3 this fibrinolytic enzyme is known to have various other pharmacological properties such as management in high blood pressure anti platelet and anti coagulant properties and anti atherosclerotic and lipid lowering activity 1 the enzyme is prescribed as low cost blood thinning food supplements to prevent clot and improve circulation the cost of nattokinase supplementation us 50 to us 75 100 mg as of 2014 6 has dramatically reduced us 0 3 0 8 for 200 400 mg as of 2018 1 over the years however the production cost of nattokinase is likely to jump once it gets approved for clinical use for which phase ii clinical trial is already underway economical production of such industrial enzymes with wide pharmaceutical applications is very important this can be realized either by the adoption of inexpensive and efficient purification technique e g three phase partitioning reverse micelle extraction or use of low cost raw material 7 the type and source of raw materials carbon and nitrogen sources used for the fermentation can be of profound importance as raw material price alone can be somewhere between one third to one fourth of the final product 8 9 therefore the use of inexpensive renewable substrate feed under optimized process conditions is necessary for the economical production of industrially important enzymes the overall yield and productivity of enzyme are closely linked with kinetic parameters such as maximal specific growth rate maximal biomass level enzyme substrate or biomass substrate yield coefficients 10 11 exploration of low cost raw materials for the production of fibrinolytic enzymes including nattokinase is very limited recently pan et al 12 explored the possibility of using soybean meal and cassava starch as low cost raw materials for the production of fibrinolytic enzyme from a bacillus subtilis marine isolate a low cost medium with sucrose and corn steep powder developed for the fibrinolytic enzyme production by bacillus subtilis wr350 costs only 8 5 of the initial medium containing soy peptone and yeast extract 13 in another study fodder yeast was used as a low cost nitrogen source for the production of a fibrinolytic enzyme 14 these studies also applied statistical approaches to optimize the medium for fibrinolytic enzymes production 12 14 whey a side product of the dairy industry cheese processing unit contains about 50 g l 1of lactose 10 g l 1 of protein vitamins and mineral salts 15 16 if not recovered such valuable nutrients carbon nitrogen vitamins and mineral salts will be discharged into the wastewater and also contribute to the pollution load high chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand of the final effluent from the dairy industry however no attempts have been made so far to recover the valuable components of low cost cheese whey lactose protein vitamins and mineral salts for the growth of bacteria producing nattokinase therefore the main aim of this study was to utilize the cheese whey as a medium for the production of nattokinase by b subtilis in this work production of nattokinase from b subtilis was assessed first using lactose and glucose as carbon source subsequently carbon source was replaced with whey collected from the local dairy and the effect of nitrogen sources yeast extract tryptone and peptone was studied using the taguchi method dynamic modelling of nattokinase production was undertaken to compare the relevant kinetic parameters under different substrate regime i e glucose lactose and whey this analysis not only allows a better understanding of the process but also a substrate linked exploration of yield and productivity for nattokinase 2 materials and methods 2 1 organism and media nattokinase producing bacteria b subtilis mtcc 2616 was procured from imtech institute of microbial technology chandigarh india bacterial culture was preserved in 40 v v glycerol and stored at 20 c for routine work the bacteria were maintained on 2 agar slant containing in g l 1 glucose 10 tryptone 10 yeast extract 10 k2hpo4 3h2o 1 and mgso4 7h2o 0 5 the slants were kept at 4 c and sub cultured at a regular interval in the aforementioned medium 2 2 nattokinase production in synthetic media using lactose or glucose nattokinase production was studied in erlenmeyer flasks 250 ml containing 50 ml production media composed of g l 1 tryptone 10 yeast

instruments model cis 24bl mumbai india 2 3 nattokinase production using cheese whey as medium and effects of nitrogen supplement cheese whey was collected from a local sweet shop the collected cheese whey had 44 30 g l 1 lactose equivalent reducing sugar and 8 93 g l 1 proteins which were almost equivalent to the literature reported values 15 16 initially the nattokinase production was studied in 50 ml cheese whey without any supplementation referred as cheese whey as medium the cheese whey was inoculated with 10 v v freshly grown seed culture and incubated at 30 c and 150 rpm for 51 h in an orbital shaker further an l9 33 taguchi orthogonal array design was selected to study the effect of 3 additional nitrogen sources peptone tryptone and yeast extract at 3 different levels 0 10 and 20 g l 1 on the production of nattokinase by b subtilis mtcc 2616 grown on cheese whey the l9 33 experimental design is shown in table 1 all the experiments of taguchi design were carried out in duplicate in erlenmeyer flasks 250 ml containing 50 ml production medium as described in table 1 the culture flasks were inoculated with 10 freshly grown seed culture od 0 8 equivalent to 6 4 108 cells ml and incubated for 51 h in an orbital shaker at 30 c and 150 rpm both biomass concentration and nattokinase production at the end of the incubation period was recorded as the response in the experimental design the methodology pertinent to biomass and nattokinase activity measurements are described in sections 2 3 and 2 4 respectively all the statistical analysis of the taguchi orthogonal array design including signal to noise ratio s n and anova analysis of variance were performed using minitab version 17 the validation run of the model developed was carried out using cheese whey supplemented with the best nitrogen source at the best concentration as obtained in the main effect plots 2 4 biomass estimation the bacterial biomass in the broth was quantified by dry cell weight analysis 17 cells were separated from broth by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm 10 261 g for 10 min at 4 c in 2 ml centrifuge tube the supernatant was collected for enzyme assay the pellet was washed twice with 0 9 w v saline and once with distilled water the recovered biomass was dried to constant weight in an oven for 51 h at 50 c 2 5 enzyme assay and characterization the production of nattokinase was measured in terms of the caseinolytic activity briefly one millilitre of the culture supernatant was added into 5 ml of casein solution 0 6 w v in phosphate buffer ph 7 5 the reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 c and subsequently stopped by adding 5 ml of 110 mm trichloroacetic acid the reaction mixture was again incubated at 30 c for 30 min centrifuged eppendorf model no 5430r hamburg germany at 12000 rpm 15294 g for 15 min after removal of precipitates 2 ml of sample was transferred in a separate test tube with the sample 5 ml of na2co3 solution 500 mm and 1 ml of folin ciocalteu reagent was added and incubated at 37 c for 30 min the absorbance of samples was taken at 660 nm using double beam spectrophotometer systronics india ltd model 2203 bhubaneswar india 18 one unit of caseinolytic activity was expressed as the quantity of enzyme required to liberate 1 μg of tyrosine per minute as compared with the tyrosine standard curve the nattokinase activity was confirmed by an artificial blood clot degradation method fresh chicken blood was collected from a local butcher shop a blood clot was formed naturally by coagulation of freshly collected blood in test tubes about 2 ml of enzyme supernatant sample or normal saline control was added into test tubes containing blood clot samples invitro blood clot degradation was analyzed at room temperature 3 the amidolytic activity of nattokinase was calorimetrically estimated using a nattokinase specific synthetic substrate n succinyl ala ala pro phe p nitroanilide analytical grade procured from sigma aldrich according to the method reported in the literature 19 briefly 12 μl of enzyme solution was added to 80 μl of phosphate buffer and the reaction mixture was incubated for 2 min at 30 c after pre incubation 16 μl of 3 mm of n succinyl ala ala pro phe p nitroanilide was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 10 min at 30 c the reaction was terminated by adding 50 μl of 0 2 m glacial acetic acid after the reaction p nitro aniline was released and its absorbance was measured using a microplate reader at 405 nm one unit of amidolytic activity was defined as the enzyme required to release 1 nmol of p nitro aniline per min at 30 c and ph 7 5 3 2 6 dynamic modelling for microbial growth and nattokinase production 2 6 1 biomass growth kinetics logistic equation widely utilized to model microbial growth in enzyme production process was adopted as presented in eq 1 12 1 d x d t μ max 1 x x max x where x is biomass concentration g l 1 xmax is the maximum biomass concentration g l 1 and μ max h 1 is the maximum specific growth rate 2 6 2 kinetics for substrate utilization substrate utilization can be represented by eq 2 2 d s d t 1 y x s d x d t 1 y p s d p d t where s is substrate concentration g l 1 yx s g g 1 is biomass yield coefficient i e g of cell biomass produced g 1 substrate consumed and yp s is product yield coefficient i e u of enzyme produced g 1 substrate consumed 2 6 3 kinetics for product formation the kinetics dependency of enzyme production on biomass was based on the luedeking piret model 20 which combines the growth associated and non growth associated contribution to the enzyme production as presented in eq 3 3 d p d t α x β d x d t where p is the enzyme activity u l 1 α and β are non growth associated and growth associated terms 2 6 4 simulation of the dynamic model and model parameter a complete set of coupled ordinary differential equations odes reflecting the rate of change for all state variables is required for the dynamic model and eqs 1 3 were utilized for this purpose the numerical solution of the dynamic model for an initial value problem requires that all the state variables be known at the initial time point t0 the system of three coupled odes for x s p from their initial conditions were numerically solved in matlab using a 4th order ode45 solver where time step of integration was automatically adapted by the solver so that the solution vector always remained positive in the parameter estimation process the dynamic model was simulated from a reasonable guess and suitable space boundaries of parameters so that the solver does not fail to meet the integration tolerances subsequently the combined normalized residual sum of squares cnsse between experimental and modelled profiles viz total biomass substrate and product was minimized eq 4 while changing the relevant parameter s in a constrained minimization algorithm using fmincon function in matlab 4 c n s s e j 1 u i 1 n x i j x ˆ i j 2 i 1 n x i j x j 2 where u is the number of different profiles directly measured from experiments i e three in this study n is the number of measurements taken at a different time in each profile x i j x ˆ i j indicates the measured and model predicted state variables respectively and x j is the average measured value of the j th profile as a check against overfitting i e it s capacity for out of sample prediction a four fold cross validation analysis was carried out the data set was split into four random approximately equal sized folds the model was calibrated with three folds i e training data and responses were predicted for the left out i e test fold data points the process was repeated so that data points from each fold are considered once as a training set using the predicted values for all data points from cross validation coefficient of determination r2cv was estimated for each state variable 2 7 parameter confidence interval estimation and sensitivity analysis the confidence interval ci for parameter estimated in the dynamic model data was processed using a residual based non parametric bootstrap resampling approach 21 as described here i optimal parameter set vector θ ˆ is established in the least square regression routine and original error matrix is computed e ˆ m n by subtracting modelled profile m ˆ m n from experimental observation o ˆ m n where m is the number of observations at a different time for n number of variables ii the error values for each state variable columns in original error matrix were resampled with replacement to create a large pool 2000 of error matrix sets iii subsequently each of the resampled error matrices was added back to the original modelled data m ˆ m n to create a pool of fabricated observation data sets iv each of the synthetic data set was independently processed through least square parameter estimation approach to find a set of model parameters v essentially a large pool of parameter sets is generated in the process from which the distributions of parameters and ci were calculated the dynamic relative sensitivity i e relative sensitivity at different time intervals for the model parameters was calculated using the finite difference approximation 22 with a repeated solution twice of the model for each parameter the sensitivity analysis represented here is essentially a univariate where a change in modelled responses e g biomass substrate and product is mapped from the perturbation of single parameter value while keeping other parameters on hold at their original estimate local relative sensitivity as a function of time allows a direct comparison of responses at different states or across different parameters eq 5 5 s i j t y i t y i t θ j θ j where yi t is the ith response at time t and θj is the jth parameter of which sensitivity is being measured 3 results and discussion 3 1 nattokinase production in synthetic media the profiles of nattokinase production caseinolytic activity biomass growth and substrate utilization in lactose based synthetic medium and glucose based synthetic medium are shown in fig 1 a b the maximum nattokinase production was 850 u ml 1at 40 h in lactose based synthetic medium however in glucose based synthetic medium the maximum enzyme production reached 830 u ml 1 at 44 h the maximum biomass production in lactose and glucose based media were 10 5 g l 1 and 9 5 g l 1 respectively at 47 h in both cases the substrate was almost exhausted at the end of batch cultivation 51 h suggesting the capability of the organism in utilizing glucose and lactose the results obtained in this study is in contrast to the general hypothesis that the glucose is the most preferred carbon source as it is easily metabolized by most of the bacteria for the microbial growth and enzyme production 23 mahajan et al 3 observed a decrease in nattokinase activity when glucose 188 u ml 1 was replaced with lactose 90 u ml 1 in the fermentation medium the recent report also suggested that the fibrinolytic activity decreased when dextrose was replaced with other carbon sources fructose galactose maltose xylose sucrose starch etc in the medium 23 in contrast to this pan et al 12 observed a significantly higher fibrinolytic activity with cassava starch 1754 u ml 1 or other soluble starch in comparison to glucose 1112 u ml 1 when used as carbon source nevertheless the results of batch study favored a possible utilization of low cost cheese whey which contains a significant amount of lactose in a microbial growth medium 3 2 nattokinase production using cheese whey as medium and effects of nitrogen supplement further study was carried out using cheese whey without any supplement as a medium for the growth and enzyme production the maximum nattokinase production at 40 h and biomass growth 44 h using cheese whey as a medium were 789 u ml 1 and 10 g l 1 respectively the decrease in nattokinase production using cheese whey as a medium without any additional nutrients and nitrogen source was expected organic nitrogen sources such as peptone and yeast extract support higher enzyme production including nattokinase 3 12 24 25 the lactose or glucose based synthetic media were supplemented with two organic nitrogen sources tryptone and yeast extract and therefore the nattokinase production was higher in the synthetic medium compared to cheese whey as the medium a l9 33 taguchi orthogonal array design was employed to study the effect of organic nitrogen peptone tryptone and yeast extract supplement in cheese whey on nattokinase production by b subtilis the experiments were performed as per the design shown in table 1 biomass concentration and enzyme activity caseinolytic activity were analyzed as responses for each experimental run the s n ratio for each response in each run was also presented in table 2 average s n ratio larger is better of the different nitrogen sources at different levels which used to calculate the values of delta s n ratio delta s n value is used to rank the effect of nitrogen source on the enzyme production and biomass yeast extract rank 1 had the maximum effect on the enzyme production while peptone rank 1 had the maximum effect on biomass growth the effect of organic nitrogen on the nattokinase production followed the following sequence yeast extract peptone tryptone similar trend soy peptone yeast extract peptone tryptone was reported by mahajan et al 3 who screened various nitrogen sources for the production of nattokinase however pan et al 12 found peptone a better nitrogen source than yeast extract for the nattokinase production the concentration of the additional nitrogen sources also affects the nattokinase production and biomass concentration as indicated from the variations in the enzyme activities and biomass concentrations table 1 fig 2 shows the main effects plot for nattokinase production and biomass the caseinolytic activity of nattokinase and biomass were maximum at a particular level of each nitrogen source tested for example the caseinolytic activity of nattokinase was maximum at level 2 for peptone and level 3 for tryptone and yeast extract on the other hand biomass was maximum at level 2 for peptone and level 1 for tryptone and yeast extract anova was performed to further validate these findings and evaluate whether these effects of nitrogen sources are significant or not anova analysis table 3 suggests that yeast extract p 0 372 and peptone p 0 174 are the most significant parameters for enzyme production and biomass growth respectively however the effects of different nitrogen sources either on enzyme production or biomass growth were statistically not significant p 0 05 therefore the best medium suggested for the nattokinase production is whey supplemented with yeast extract 10 g l to minimize the medium cost the temporal profiles of biomass and nattokinase production using cheese whey supplemented with yeast extract are shown in fig 1 c the maximum production of nattokinase obtained using the whey supplemented with yeast extract 10 g l was 833 43 u ml 1 though the nattokinase production caseinolytic activity using whey supplemented with yeast extract was slightly less compared to the literature reported values it was equivalent to the nattokinase production using either glucose or lactose based media obtained in our study table 4 3 3 dynamic modelling using different substrates for enzyme production the experimental and modelled profiles for biomass substrate and enzyme production are shown in fig 1 suggesting good agreements between experimental and modelled growth substrate utilization profile the choice of logistic kinetics to model biomass growth had been very enticing as reflected in high regression coefficients r2 0 93 across all substrates table 5 the underlying assumption of the model i e substrate concentration independent specific growth rate has been observed to be valid in many bioprocesses 31 the high cross validation r2 across all profiles suggests no over prediction pertinent to the proposed model structure the least square regression parameter estimates for the models along with their boot strap cis are presented in table 5 the confidence interval estimates from the bootstrap analysis are shown in fig 3 where a normal gaussian symmetric distribution of estimates is evident for growth and substrate consumption related parameters however the distribution of enzyme productions yield coefficient i e yp s with lactose or yeast extract is skewed as the original estimate reappears in boot strap sampling as the distribution is formulated from a non parametric such skewness can be related to the inaccuracy of the estimate or poor parameter sensitivity distribution of estimates for μ max xmax was essentially normal which suggest better credibility of estimates interval estimates of these two parameters cover similar ranges across the three media the distribution of α product formation parameter with glucose medium exhibits a multi modal curve implying existence of outlier in the data set such deviation from not necessarily interprets about the residuals rather can also be attributed to non linearity of the dynamic model 32 the estimates of μ max for culture on lactose 0 204 h 1 or cheese whey with yeast extract 0 201 h 1 are significantly better than that of the glucose 0 122 h 1 for b subtilis culture producing fibrinolytic enzyme on low cost substrates pan et al 12 reported μ max between 0 39 h 1 to 0 87 h 1 on glucose depending on fermenter dimension and degree of oxygen saturation similarly a maximum specific growth rate of 0 364 h 1 was reported for b subtilis 1a752 grown on glucose 33 the difference somewhat lower in μ max can be attributed to variances in microbial culture and fermentation conditions biomass yield coefficient estimates for the substrates projects a different and seemingly inconsistent drift where lactose 0 728 g g 1 and glucose 0 662 g g 1 appear to be better than lactose cheese whey 0 277 g g 1 it should be noted that cheese whey contains a significant proportion of total milk solids milk sugar lactose milk protein milk minerals and almost entire water soluble vitamins 34 increasing substrate complexity or maintenance requirement can result in the decreased conversion efficiency of sugar into biomass 12 the growth associated enzyme production terms 85 916 u g 1 95 197 u g 1 99 195 u g 1 for the three substrates are significantly higher than non growth associated rate constants sensitivity analysis of the model parameters on the output variables i e biomass substrate and enzyme is shown in fig 4 the relative sensitivities of the different parameters vary with time for a given response as well as between responses however the sensitivity profiles remain very similar at least trend across the different substrate under consideration this seems reasonable as the model structure and mechanistic interpretation remain unchanged for total biomass concentration profiles fig 4 a d g the most important parameters are the maximum specific growth rate μ max and followed by the ultimate biomass concentration x max moreover the relative sensitivity of μ max drops at a later phase of fermentation as biomass concentration is already approaching the carrying capacity as the growth model is not coupled with substrate consumption and product formation growth data remains insensitive to α β or yx s the negative relative sensitivity of substrate profiles with μ max or x max is logical as an increase in those two parameters causes faster depletion of the substrate the product yield coefficient yp s exhibit moderate influence on substrate consumption though no influence on biomass or product conceivably as the different parameters in the dynamic model are part of a sequential process any parameter relevant to a later stage does not influence the preceding process responses for example α and β relevant to product formation have little or no influence on the biomass although nearly full sets of parameters should theoretically influence the product profile the sensitivity analysis fig 4 c f i reveals that the most important parameters are β i e growth non associated product synthesis and μ max this is very logical to have high sensitivity of those parameters which are directly embedded in product formation kinetics 3 4 nattokinase activity in vitro blood clot degradation and amidolytic activity in vitro blood clot degradation and amidolytic activity of the cell free supernatant was performed to confirm the production of nattokinase enzyme by the b subtilis mtcc 2616 using lactose based synthetic medium and cheese whey as medium blood clot degradation was evident in experimental sets treated with enzyme solutions cell free supernatants obtained from both synthetic as well as cheese whey based media fig 5 there was no observable difference between the two sets suggesting that the produced nattokinase in both the medium are of the same quality the clot degradation was not observed in control test tubes which contained saline solution with the blood clot the amidolytic activity nattokinase activity of the cell free supernatant was estimated using the nattokinase specific synthetic substrate i e n succinyl ala ala pro phe p nitroanilide the nattokinase activities obtained using the synthetic medium with lactose and glucose were 4873 71 and 4770 29 u ml 1 respectively the reduction in the nattokinase activity 4498 66 u ml 1 was observed when cheese whey was used as a medium for the enzyme production though yeast extract supplementation to cheese whey slightly improved the enzyme activity 4596 33 u ml 1 it remained less compared to synthetic media using either lactose or glucose however the amidolytic activities observed using whey based media in the present study were better then the literature reported values using different carbon source table 4 the results of amidolytic activity of the enzyme are well correlated r2 0 71 with the caseinolytic activity of the enzyme obtained using synthetic media and cheese whey based media section 3 1 and 3 2 4 recovery of resources from cheese whey and cost benefit aspects in this study nutrients present in the cheese whey are recovered as biomass along with the production of nattokinase enzyme cheese whey can reduce the cost of production medium up to 100 neglecting the transportation cost of whey from the dairy industry to enzyme production unit though nattokinase yield with cheese whey alone falls short by 5 7 in comparison to glucose or lactose based synthetic media the outcome with yeast extract supplemented could be comparable although yeast extract supplementation increased the cost it remains 45 cheaper to that of the lactose based synthetic medium the costly yeast extract can be replaced with other nitrogen rich waste stream or waste material such as fodder yeast or soy protein however this may complex the downstream processing of the bioproduct reports on scalable downstream processing of the nattokinase are rare in literature xin et al 35 developed a scalable purification strategy for the nattokinase comprising salting out ion exchange chromatography and ultrafiltration but the cost associated with such downstream processing was not reported therefore an in depth study on the cost benefit analysis for enzyme production and downstream processing is required while utilizing the waste streams to recover nutrients for nattokinase production in future 5 conclusions the study demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing the valuable resources present in the cheese whey for the production of nattokinase the cheese whey was demonstrated as a low cost alternative to costly lactose or glucose based media the maximum specific growth rate of b subtilis with the cheese whey media was comparable to that with lactose and even better than the glucose based one which indicates that bacteria efficiently utilized the nutrients present in the whey the enzyme production was growth associated one and the analogous parameters estimated for cheese whey as a medium supports its advantage though mechanistic kinetic interpretation of substrate or media selection is very important the higher production of an industrially relevant enzyme can be realized with optimal bioprocess conditions and contemporary down stream techniques therefore further research is needed with a focus on the downstream processing and detailed cost benefit analysis of utilizing waste stream for the production of nattokinase declaration of competing interest authors declare no conflict of interest pertinent to this submission

inexpensive and efficient purification technique e g three phase partitioning reverse micelle extraction or use of low cost raw material 7 the type and source of raw materials carbon and nitrogen sources used for the fermentation can be of profound importance as raw material price alone can be somewhere between one third to one fourth of the final product 8 9 therefore the use of inexpensive renewable substrate feed under optimized process conditions is necessary for the economical production of industrially important enzymes the overall yield and productivity of enzyme are closely linked with kinetic parameters such as maximal specific growth rate maximal biomass level enzyme substrate or biomass substrate yield coefficients 10 11 exploration of low cost raw materials for the production of fibrinolytic enzymes including nattokinase is very limited recently pan et al 12 explored the possibility of using soybean meal and cassava starch as low cost raw materials for the production of fibrinolytic enzyme from a bacillus subtilis marine isolate a low cost medium with sucrose and corn steep powder developed for the fibrinolytic enzyme production by bacillus subtilis wr350 costs only 8 5 of the initial medium containing soy peptone and yeast extract 13 in another study fodder yeast was used as a low cost nitrogen source for the production of a fibrinolytic enzyme 14 these studies also applied statistical approaches to optimize the medium for fibrinolytic enzymes production 12 14 whey a side product of the dairy industry cheese processing unit contains about 50 g l 1of lactose 10 g l 1 of protein vitamins and mineral salts 15 16 if not recovered such valuable nutrients carbon nitrogen vitamins and mineral salts will be discharged into the wastewater and also contribute to the pollution load high chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand of the final effluent from the dairy industry however no attempts have been made so far to recover the valuable components of low cost cheese whey lactose protein vitamins and mineral salts for the growth of bacteria producing nattokinase therefore the main aim of this study was to utilize the cheese whey as a medium for the production of nattokinase by b subtilis in this work production of nattokinase from b subtilis was assessed first using lactose and glucose as carbon source subsequently carbon source was replaced with whey collected from the local dairy and the effect of nitrogen sources yeast extract tryptone and peptone was studied using the taguchi method dynamic modelling of nattokinase production was undertaken to compare the relevant kinetic parameters under different substrate regime i e glucose lactose and whey this analysis not only allows a better understanding of the process but also a substrate linked exploration of yield and productivity for nattokinase 2 materials and methods 2 1 organism and media nattokinase producing bacteria b subtilis mtcc 2616 was procured from imtech institute of microbial technology chandigarh india bacterial culture was preserved in 40 v v glycerol and stored at 20 c for routine work the bacteria were maintained on 2 agar

nattokinase production in synthetic media using lactose or glucose nattokinase production was studied in erlenmeyer flasks 250 ml containing 50 ml production media composed of g l 1 tryptone 10 yeast extract 10 k2hpo4 3h2o 1 mgso4 7h2o 0 5 and cacl2 2h2o 0 5 besides either lactose or glucose was added at a concentration of 20 g l 1 as a carbon source and henceforth referred as lactose or glucose

instruments model cis 24bl mumbai india 2 3 nattokinase production using cheese whey as medium and effects of nitrogen supplement cheese whey was collected from a local sweet shop the collected cheese whey had 44 30 g l 1 lactose equivalent reducing sugar and 8 93 g l 1 proteins which were almost equivalent to the literature reported values 15 16 initially the nattokinase production was studied in 50 ml cheese whey without any supplementation referred as cheese whey as medium the cheese whey was inoculated with 10 v v freshly grown seed culture and incubated at 30 c and 150 rpm for 51 h in an orbital shaker further an l9 33 taguchi orthogonal array design was selected to study the effect of 3 additional nitrogen sources peptone tryptone and yeast extract at 3 different levels 0 10 and 20 g l 1 on the production of nattokinase by b subtilis mtcc 2616 grown on cheese whey the l9 33 experimental design is shown in table 1 all the experiments of taguchi design were carried out in duplicate in erlenmeyer flasks 250 ml containing 50 ml production medium as described in table 1 the culture flasks were inoculated with 10 freshly grown seed culture od 0 8 equivalent to 6 4 108 cells ml and incubated for 51 h in an orbital shaker at 30 c and 150 rpm both biomass concentration and nattokinase production at the end of the incubation period was recorded as the response in the experimental design the methodology pertinent to biomass and nattokinase activity measurements are described in sections 2 3 and 2 4 respectively all the statistical analysis of the taguchi orthogonal array design including signal to noise ratio s n and anova analysis of variance were performed using minitab version 17 the validation run of the model developed was carried out using cheese whey supplemented with the best nitrogen source at the best concentration as obtained in the main effect plots 2 4 biomass estimation the bacterial biomass in the broth was quantified by dry cell weight analysis 17 cells were separated from broth by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm 10 261 g for 10 min at 4 c in 2 ml centrifuge tube the supernatant was collected for enzyme assay the pellet was washed twice with 0 9 w v saline and once with distilled water the recovered biomass was dried to constant weight in an oven for 51 h at 50 c 2 5 enzyme assay and characterization the production of nattokinase was measured in terms of the caseinolytic activity briefly one millilitre of the culture supernatant was added into 5 ml of casein solution 0 6 w v in phosphate buffer ph 7 5 the reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 c and subsequently stopped by adding 5 ml of 110 mm trichloroacetic acid the reaction mixture was again incubated at 30 c for 30 min centrifuged eppendorf model no 5430r hamburg germany at 12000 rpm 15294 g for 15 min after removal of precipitates 2 ml of sample was transferred in a separate test tube with the sample 5 ml of na2co3 solution 500 mm and 1 ml of folin ciocalteu reagent was added and incubated at 37 c for 30 min the absorbance of samples was taken at 660 nm using double beam spectrophotometer systronics india ltd model 2203 bhubaneswar india 18 one unit of caseinolytic activity was expressed as the quantity of enzyme required to liberate 1 μg of tyrosine per minute as compared with the tyrosine standard curve the nattokinase activity was confirmed by an artificial blood clot degradation method fresh chicken blood was collected from a local butcher shop a blood clot was formed naturally by coagulation of freshly collected blood in test tubes about 2 ml of enzyme supernatant sample or normal saline control was added into test tubes containing blood clot samples invitro blood clot degradation was analyzed at room temperature 3 the amidolytic activity of nattokinase was calorimetrically estimated using a nattokinase specific synthetic substrate n succinyl ala ala pro phe p nitroanilide analytical grade procured from sigma aldrich according to the method reported in the literature 19 briefly 12 μl of enzyme solution was added to 80 μl of phosphate buffer and the reaction mixture was incubated for 2 min at 30 c after pre incubation 16 μl of 3 mm of n succinyl ala ala pro phe p nitroanilide was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 10 min at 30 c the reaction was terminated by adding 50 μl of 0 2 m glacial acetic acid after the reaction p nitro aniline was released and its absorbance was measured using a microplate reader at 405 nm one unit of amidolytic activity was defined as the enzyme required to release 1 nmol of p nitro aniline per min at 30 c and ph 7 5 3 2 6 dynamic modelling for microbial growth and nattokinase production 2 6 1 biomass growth kinetics logistic equation widely utilized to model microbial growth in enzyme production process was adopted as presented in eq 1 12 1 d x d t μ max 1 x x max x where x is biomass concentration g l 1 xmax is the maximum biomass concentration g l 1 and μ max h 1 is the maximum specific growth rate 2 6 2 kinetics for substrate utilization substrate utilization can be represented by eq 2 2 d s d t 1 y x s d x d t 1 y p s d p d t where s is substrate concentration g l 1 yx s g g 1 is biomass yield coefficient i e g of cell biomass produced g 1 substrate consumed and yp s is product yield coefficient i e u of enzyme produced g 1 substrate consumed 2 6 3 kinetics for product formation the kinetics dependency of enzyme production on biomass was based on the luedeking piret model 20 which combines the growth associated and non growth associated contribution to the enzyme production as presented in eq 3 3 d p d t α x β d x d t where p is the enzyme activity u l 1 α and β are non growth associated and growth associated terms 2 6 4 simulation of the dynamic model and model parameter a complete set of coupled ordinary differential equations odes reflecting the rate of change for all state variables is required for the dynamic model and eqs 1 3 were utilized for this purpose the numerical solution of the dynamic model for an initial value problem requires that all the state variables be known at the initial time point t0 the system of three coupled odes for x s p from their initial conditions were numerically solved in matlab using a 4th order ode45 solver where time step of integration was automatically adapted by the solver so that the solution vector always remained positive in the parameter estimation process the dynamic model was simulated from a reasonable guess and suitable space boundaries of parameters so that the solver does not fail to meet the integration tolerances subsequently the combined normalized residual sum of squares cnsse between experimental and modelled profiles viz total biomass substrate and product was minimized eq 4 while changing the relevant parameter s in a constrained minimization algorithm using fmincon function in matlab 4 c n s s e j 1 u i 1 n x i j x ˆ i j 2 i 1 n x i j x j 2 where u is the number of different profiles directly measured from experiments i e three in this study n is the number of measurements taken at a different time in each profile x i j x ˆ i j indicates the measured and model predicted state variables respectively and x j is the average measured value of the j th profile as a check against overfitting i e it s capacity for out of sample prediction a four fold cross validation analysis was carried out the data set was split into four random approximately equal sized folds the model was calibrated with three folds i e training data and responses were predicted for the left out i e test fold data points the process was repeated so that data points from each fold are considered once as a training set using the predicted values for all data points from cross validation coefficient of determination r2cv was estimated for each state variable 2 7 parameter confidence interval estimation and sensitivity analysis the confidence interval ci for parameter estimated in the dynamic model data was processed using a residual based non parametric bootstrap resampling approach 21 as described here i optimal parameter set vector θ ˆ is established in the least square regression routine and original error matrix is computed e ˆ m n by subtracting modelled profile m ˆ m n from experimental observation o ˆ m n where m is the number of observations at a different time for n number of variables ii the error values for each state variable columns in original error matrix were resampled with replacement to create a large pool 2000 of error matrix sets iii subsequently each of the resampled error matrices was added back to the original modelled data m ˆ m n to create a pool of fabricated observation data sets iv each of the synthetic data set was independently processed through least square parameter estimation approach to find a set of model parameters v essentially a large pool of parameter sets is generated in the process from which the distributions of parameters and ci were calculated the dynamic relative sensitivity i e relative sensitivity at different time intervals for the model parameters was calculated using the finite difference approximation 22 with a repeated solution twice of the model for each parameter the sensitivity analysis represented here is essentially a univariate where a change in modelled responses e g biomass substrate and product is mapped from the perturbation of single parameter value while keeping other parameters on hold at their original estimate local relative sensitivity as a function of time allows a direct comparison of responses at different states or across different parameters eq 5 5 s i j t y i t y i t θ j θ j where yi t is the ith response at time t and θj is the jth parameter of which sensitivity is being measured 3 results and discussion 3 1 nattokinase production in synthetic media the profiles of nattokinase production caseinolytic activity biomass growth and substrate utilization in lactose based synthetic medium and glucose based synthetic medium are shown in fig 1 a b the maximum nattokinase production was 850 u ml 1at 40 h in lactose based synthetic medium however in glucose based synthetic medium the maximum enzyme production reached 830 u ml 1 at 44 h the maximum biomass production in lactose and glucose based media were 10 5 g l 1 and 9 5 g l 1 respectively at 47 h in both cases the substrate was almost exhausted at the end of batch cultivation 51 h suggesting the capability of the organism in utilizing glucose and lactose the results obtained in this study is in contrast to the general hypothesis that the glucose is the most preferred carbon source as it is easily metabolized by most of the bacteria for the microbial growth and enzyme production 23 mahajan et al 3 observed a decrease in nattokinase activity when glucose 188 u ml 1 was replaced with lactose 90 u ml 1 in the fermentation medium the recent report also suggested that the fibrinolytic activity decreased when dextrose was replaced with other carbon sources fructose galactose maltose xylose sucrose starch etc in the medium 23 in contrast to this pan et al 12 observed a significantly higher fibrinolytic activity with cassava starch 1754 u ml 1 or other soluble starch in comparison to glucose 1112 u ml 1 when used as carbon source nevertheless the results of batch study favored a possible utilization of low cost cheese whey which contains a significant amount of lactose in a microbial growth medium 3 2 nattokinase production using cheese whey as medium and effects of nitrogen supplement further study was carried out using cheese whey without any supplement as a medium for the growth and enzyme production the maximum nattokinase production at 40 h and biomass growth 44 h using cheese whey as a medium were 789 u ml 1 and 10 g l 1 respectively the decrease in nattokinase production using cheese whey as a medium without any additional nutrients and nitrogen source was expected organic nitrogen sources such as peptone and yeast extract support higher enzyme production including nattokinase 3 12 24 25 the lactose or glucose based synthetic media were supplemented with two organic nitrogen sources tryptone and yeast extract and therefore the nattokinase production was higher in the synthetic medium compared to cheese whey as the medium a l9 33 taguchi orthogonal array design was employed to study the effect of organic nitrogen peptone tryptone and yeast extract supplement in cheese whey on nattokinase production by b subtilis the experiments were performed as per the design shown in table 1 biomass concentration and enzyme activity caseinolytic activity were analyzed as responses for each experimental run the s n ratio for each response in each run was also presented in table 2 average s n ratio larger is better of the different nitrogen sources at different levels which used to calculate the values of delta s n ratio delta s n value is used to rank the effect of nitrogen source on the enzyme production and biomass yeast extract rank 1 had the maximum effect on the enzyme production while peptone rank 1 had the maximum effect on biomass growth the effect of organic nitrogen on the nattokinase production followed the following sequence yeast extract peptone tryptone similar trend soy peptone yeast extract peptone tryptone was reported by mahajan et al 3 who screened various nitrogen sources for the production of nattokinase however pan et al 12 found peptone a better nitrogen source than yeast extract for the nattokinase production the concentration of the additional nitrogen sources also affects the nattokinase production and biomass concentration as indicated from the variations in the enzyme activities and biomass concentrations table 1 fig 2 shows the main effects plot for nattokinase production and biomass the caseinolytic activity of nattokinase and biomass were maximum at a particular level of each nitrogen source tested for example the caseinolytic activity of nattokinase was maximum at level 2 for peptone and level 3 for tryptone and yeast extract on the other hand biomass was maximum at level 2 for peptone and level 1 for tryptone and yeast extract anova was performed to further validate these findings and evaluate whether these effects of nitrogen sources are significant or not anova analysis table 3 suggests that yeast extract p 0 372 and peptone p 0 174 are the most significant parameters for enzyme production and biomass growth respectively however the effects of different nitrogen sources either on enzyme production or biomass growth were statistically not significant p 0 05 therefore the best medium suggested for the nattokinase production is whey supplemented with yeast extract 10 g l to minimize the medium cost the temporal profiles of biomass and nattokinase production using cheese whey supplemented with yeast extract are shown in fig 1 c the maximum production of nattokinase obtained using the whey supplemented with yeast extract 10 g l was 833 43 u ml 1 though the nattokinase production caseinolytic activity using whey supplemented with yeast extract was slightly less compared to the literature reported values it was equivalent to the nattokinase production using either glucose or lactose based media obtained in our study table 4 3 3 dynamic modelling using different substrates for enzyme production the experimental and modelled profiles for biomass substrate and enzyme production are shown in fig 1 suggesting good agreements between experimental and modelled growth substrate utilization profile the choice of logistic kinetics to model biomass growth had been very enticing as reflected in high regression coefficients r2 0 93 across all substrates table 5 the underlying assumption of the model i e substrate concentration independent specific growth rate has been observed to be valid in many bioprocesses 31 the high cross validation r2 across all profiles suggests no over prediction pertinent to the proposed model structure the least square regression parameter estimates for the models along with their boot strap cis are presented in table 5 the confidence interval estimates from the bootstrap analysis are shown in fig 3 where a normal gaussian symmetric distribution of estimates is evident for growth and substrate consumption related parameters however the distribution of enzyme productions yield coefficient i e yp s with lactose or yeast extract is skewed as the original estimate reappears in boot strap sampling as the distribution is formulated from a non parametric such skewness can be related to the inaccuracy of the estimate or poor parameter sensitivity distribution of estimates for μ max xmax was essentially normal which suggest better credibility of estimates interval estimates of these two parameters cover similar ranges across the three media the distribution of α product formation parameter with glucose medium exhibits a multi modal curve implying existence of outlier in the data set such deviation from not necessarily interprets about the residuals rather can also be attributed to non linearity of the dynamic model 32 the estimates of μ max for culture on lactose 0 204 h 1 or cheese whey with yeast extract 0 201 h 1 are significantly better than that of the glucose 0 122 h 1 for b subtilis culture producing fibrinolytic enzyme on low cost substrates pan et al 12 reported μ max between 0 39 h 1 to 0 87 h 1 on glucose depending on fermenter dimension and degree of oxygen saturation similarly a maximum specific growth rate of 0 364 h 1 was reported for b subtilis 1a752 grown on glucose 33 the difference somewhat lower in μ max can be attributed to variances in microbial culture and fermentation conditions biomass yield coefficient estimates for the substrates projects a different and seemingly inconsistent drift where lactose 0 728 g g 1 and glucose 0 662 g g 1 appear to be better than lactose cheese whey 0 277 g g 1 it should be noted that cheese whey contains a significant proportion of total milk solids milk sugar lactose milk protein milk minerals and almost entire water soluble vitamins 34 increasing substrate complexity or maintenance requirement can result in the decreased conversion efficiency of sugar into biomass 12 the growth associated enzyme production terms 85 916 u g 1 95 197 u g 1 99 195 u g 1 for the three substrates are significantly higher than non growth associated rate constants sensitivity analysis of the model parameters on the output variables i e biomass substrate and enzyme is shown in fig 4 the relative sensitivities of the different parameters vary with time for a given response as well as between responses however the sensitivity profiles remain very similar at least trend across the different substrate under consideration this seems reasonable as the model structure and mechanistic interpretation remain unchanged for total biomass concentration profiles fig 4 a d g the most important parameters are the maximum specific growth rate μ max and followed by the ultimate biomass concentration x max moreover the relative sensitivity of μ max drops at a later phase of fermentation as biomass concentration is already approaching the carrying capacity as the growth model is not coupled with substrate consumption and product formation growth data remains insensitive to α β or yx s the negative relative sensitivity of substrate profiles with μ max or x max is logical as an increase in those two parameters causes faster depletion of the substrate the product yield coefficient yp s exhibit moderate influence on substrate consumption though no influence on biomass or product conceivably as the different parameters in the dynamic model are part of a sequential process any parameter relevant to a later stage does not influence the preceding process responses for example α and β relevant to product formation have little or no influence on the biomass although nearly full sets of parameters should theoretically influence the product profile the sensitivity analysis fig 4 c f i reveals that the most important parameters are β i e growth non associated product synthesis and μ max this is very logical to have high sensitivity of those parameters which are directly embedded in product formation kinetics 3 4 nattokinase activity in vitro blood clot degradation and amidolytic activity in vitro blood clot degradation and amidolytic activity of the cell free supernatant was performed to confirm the production of nattokinase enzyme by the b subtilis mtcc 2616 using lactose based synthetic medium and cheese whey as medium blood clot degradation was evident in experimental sets treated with enzyme solutions cell free supernatants obtained from both synthetic as well as cheese whey based media fig 5 there was no observable difference between the two sets suggesting that the produced nattokinase in both the medium are of the same quality the clot degradation was not observed in control test tubes which contained saline solution with the blood clot the amidolytic activity nattokinase activity of the cell free supernatant was estimated using the nattokinase specific synthetic substrate i e n succinyl ala ala pro phe p nitroanilide the nattokinase activities obtained using the synthetic medium with lactose and glucose were 4873 71 and 4770 29 u ml 1 respectively the reduction in the nattokinase activity 4498 66 u ml 1 was observed when cheese whey was used as a medium for the enzyme production though yeast extract supplementation to cheese whey slightly improved the enzyme activity 4596 33 u ml 1 it remained less compared to synthetic media using either lactose or glucose however the amidolytic activities observed using whey based media in the present study were better then the literature reported values using different carbon source table 4 the results of amidolytic activity of the enzyme are well correlated r2 0 71 with the caseinolytic activity of the enzyme obtained using synthetic media and cheese whey based media section 3 1 and 3 2 4 recovery of resources from cheese whey and cost benefit aspects in this study nutrients present in the cheese whey are recovered as biomass along with the production of nattokinase enzyme cheese whey can reduce the cost of production medium up to 100 neglecting the transportation cost of whey from the dairy industry to enzyme production unit though nattokinase yield with cheese whey alone falls short by 5 7 in comparison to glucose or lactose based synthetic media the outcome with yeast extract supplemented could be comparable although yeast extract supplementation increased the cost it remains 45 cheaper to that of the lactose based synthetic medium the costly yeast extract can be replaced with other nitrogen rich waste stream or waste material such as fodder yeast or soy protein however this may complex the downstream processing of the bioproduct reports on scalable downstream processing of the nattokinase are rare in literature xin et al 35 developed a scalable purification strategy for the nattokinase comprising salting out ion exchange chromatography and ultrafiltration but the cost associated with such downstream processing was not reported therefore an in depth study on the cost benefit analysis for enzyme production and downstream processing is required while utilizing the waste streams to recover nutrients for nattokinase production in future 5 conclusions the study demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing the valuable resources present in the cheese whey for the production of nattokinase the cheese whey was demonstrated as a low cost alternative to costly lactose or glucose based media the maximum specific growth rate of b subtilis with the cheese whey media was comparable to that with lactose and even better than the glucose based one which indicates that bacteria efficiently utilized the nutrients present in the whey the enzyme production was growth associated one and the analogous parameters estimated for cheese whey as a medium supports its advantage though mechanistic kinetic interpretation of substrate or media selection is very important the higher production of an industrially relevant enzyme can be realized with optimal bioprocess conditions and contemporary down stream techniques therefore further research is needed with a focus on the downstream processing and detailed cost benefit analysis of utilizing waste stream for the production of nattokinase declaration of competing interest authors declare no

13764,porous materials have attracted attention in many practical fields including for water desalination carbon templated is an attractive method in enhancing the properties of mesoporous silica materials used as membrane materials this review mainly focuses on the strategies of carbon templates of mesoporous silica materials essentially applied for water desalination numerous strategies for carbon templated mesoporous silica are briefly discussed in addition most carbon silica based membranes for desalination are detailed and their performances are discussed moreover application of carbon silica templates for wetland saline water desalination are also discussed in great detail the comparison between carbon silica based materials and silica based membranes of recent techniques fabrication trend application and operation condition for further improvement of membrane performance are also thoroughly reviewed keywords carbon templated mesoporous silica carbon silica based materials water and wetland saline water desalination 1 introduction porous materials have attracted attention in many practical fields such as chemical medical optic electronic biotechnological environmental and or energy applications porous materials pose regular pore structures and high surface area useful for materials adsorption storage 1 2 according to the iupac definition porous materials are classified into three categories depending on their pore sizes microporous 2 nm mesoporous 2 50 nm and macroporous 50 nm 3 since the first mesoporous material of mcm 41 was introduced in 1990s the developments of other mesoporous materials have been extensive 4 basic preparation of mesoporous materials are done using template synthesis self assembled micelles structure from cost effective silica and carbon sources 1 it is done by employing organic template molecules under various processes or by employing textural templates where the inorganic precursor condenses 4 extensive reports are available on custom developments of novel mesoporous materials for catalyst sorption sensing optics drug delivery or separation mesoporous materials are also attractive for wrapping sirna to enhance the therapeutic effect on cancer for medical treatment 5 6 they have been explored to encapsulate fragrances for controlled release and storage of the odorants 7 mesoporous materials such as zeolite and silica are also highly attractive as support for catalyst 8 9 thanks to their inherent selectivity and high surface area 10 membranes processes have long been established with widespread applications they are mostly used to produce potable water from saline water to treat industrial wastewater effluents and to recover valuable resources from wastewater via concentration and purification and to fractionate macromolecular mixtures in the food and drug industries they have also been established for separation of gases energy conversion systems artificial organs and drug delivery the membrane materials employed in those diverse applications differ widely in their structure and function diverse membrane base processes have recently been emerging molecular separations fractionations concentrations purifications clarifications emulsifications crystallization etc it is mainly because of the inherent characteristic of high efficiency operational simplicity stability and flexibility high selectivity and permeability in separation applications low energy requirements environment compatibility easy to control and scale up apart for being applied as standalone unit membrane processes are also very common in hybrid system involving process intensification they include but not limited to membrane reactors membrane bioreactors membrane contactors however all membranes have several features in common that make them particularly attractive for the separation the separation is performed by physical means mostly at ambient temperature without chemically altering the feed mixture this is mandatory for applications in artificial organs and in many drug delivery systems as well as in the food and drug industry or in downstream processing of bioproducts where temperature sensitive substances are handled the membrane materials used in those applications differ widely in their structure function and the way they operate membrane properties can thus be tailored and adjusted to specific applications the versatility of membrane structures and functions makes a precise and complete definition of a membrane rather difficult a membrane is a barrier that separates and or contacts two different phases and controls the exchange of matter and energy between the phases the membrane can be a selective or simply acts as a contacting barrier in the first case it controls the exchange between the two phases adjacent to it in a very specific manner in the second case it functions as contactor of the two phases in which the transport occurs ones can distinguish between biological membranes which are part of the living organism and synthetic membranes that are man made the structure and function of synthetic membranes are much simpler than the biological membranes they only facilitate passive transport and are less selective however they are chemically and mechanically more stable especially at high temperature the selectivity of synthetic membranes is dictated by sieving property of the pore or the solute solubility and diffusivity within the membrane matrix the permeability of the membrane for different components however is only one parameter determining the flux through the membrane membrane based processes are also driven by different forces such as concentration different pressure different or temperature gradients or an electrical potential for the charged components the use of different driving forces results in a number of processes such as reverse osmosis micro ultra and nanofiltration dialysis electrodialysis pervaporation gas separation membrane contactors membrane distillation membrane based solvent extraction membrane reactors etc 11 mesoporous silica materials are frequently applied for membrane fabrication in the gas and the water separation and thus worthy of detailed overview the interaction between the permeating molecule and the membrane material often dictate the separation process gas steams or water vapor are abundant with water molecules that easily reacts with the hydrophilic sites in the silica thin films created chemical and microstructural instability for instance giessler diniz da costa 12 reported that sol gel derived films produced the silanols from hydrolysis and condensation reactions the presence of silanol bonds collapses of the film structure that lowers the pore volume silanol groups form weakly branched fractal systems and has hydrophilic properties they easily react with water altering the matrix of silica derived materials these include organic covalent templates such as methyl groups and noncovalently bonded organic templates such as c6 and c16 surfactants and alkyltriethoxysilanes 12 to overcome the detrimental interaction of water with the silica material various templating methods have been developed it is generally divided into 3 steps 1 preparation 2 method selection i e hydrothermal precipitation and sol gel and 3 templating dissolution sintering etc regular template is sorted into two categories of materials that is naturally and synthesis one strategy to obtain a good hydro stability of silica is by embedding carbon molecules into the silica matrix various materials have been used earlier as carbon sources such as p123 13 f127 14 and f108 15 or citric acid 16 recently more sustainable and low cost carbon sources have also been explored such as pectin from apple peel 17 banana peel 18 and also glucose 19 the si o c bond can be formed after adding carbon materials into the silica matrix the presence of carbon prevents silica pore from collapsing especially when the material is applied for water desalination carbon material also reported has strong covalent bonding 20 which enhances the mechanical strength in this review we overview of the progress of the advantageous strategies of carbon templates of mesoporous silica materials essentially applied for water desalination numerous strategies for carbon templated mesoporous silica were discussed finally applications of carbon templated mesoporous silica materials in water desalination are also discussed 2 advanced carbon templated strategies materials with nanopore structure allow interaction at atomic ionic and molecular level since they have large surface area and limited spatial space 21 22 nanopores can be classified into macro porous 50 nm mesoporous 2 nm 50 nm and microporous 2 nm materials with nanopore has been used in adsorption 23 separation 24 25 catalysts 26 27 and electronics 28 29 among many application of nanopores nanopore carbons npcs have regular interpenetrations which leads to desirable chemical and physical properties namely high specific surface uniform pore structure good heat resistance and chemical stability low density and many others 28 npcs have been then implemented in hydrogen storage 30 adsorption 31 32 energy storage 33 34 and electronic devices 35 the most commonly used carbon templating methods include physical destruction adhesion and spray and chemical methods precipitation sol gel hydrothermal and template 36 37 template synthesis is a method that has been developed since the 1990 an and still widely applied currently the method is also very easy to do and provide ample flexibility in controlling the structure morphology and particle size of the resulting materials 38 morphology is an important parameter to determine the character of the particle size and pore structure 39 40 the template method changes the morphology of the product by controlling the nucleation and growth of crystals during the nano material preparations it generally consists of 3 steps 1 template preparation 2 methods selection hydrothermal precipitation and sol gel and 3 templated dissolution sintering etc regular template can be classified into materials that is naturally and synthetic also it is based on the difference between the structure of the template the templating method is divided into hard templates and soft templates 41 42 one strategy to obtain a good hydro stability of silica matrix is by embedding carbon molecules into the silica various materials have been used earlier as carbon sources such as p123 13 f127 14 and f108 15 or citric acid addition 16 recently more sustainable and low cost carbon sources have also been explored pectin from apple peel 17 banana peel 18 and also glucose 19 the si o c bond can be formed after adding carbon materials into the matrix the presence of carbon prevents silica pore from collapsing especially when applied for water desalination carbon material also has strong covalent bonding 20 which enhances the mechanical strength of the resulting matrix 2 1 soft and hard templating methods the soft templating uses a nano structure formed through intermolecular interactions as a template 43 they do not have permanent rigid structures during the synthesis of nanoparticles certain structural aggregates are formed through molecular or intra molecular hydrogen bonds chemical bonds and static electricity interactions 38 the soft template materials are typically organic surfactants and or copolymer blocks that can interact with metal ions and merge into a liquid crystal phase through the sol gel process pores are obtained after the removal of soft templates via calcination the soft templating method allows easy control of the structure and pore size relative to the hard template method 43 the crucial step in the soft templating is the transition of sol gel precursors in the form of a surfactant copolymer block 44 46 the hard templating method is known as nano casting mostly attractive for synthesis of mesoporous materials nano casting uses a solid mould as the template to which a material or precursor is filled later after the formation of the porous material the main mould is removed 43 for nano casting of m tmo it consists of 3 steps synthesis of mesoporous replica eg silica carbon alumina a metal interphyracy of precursors and decomposition to form materials into crystals and lastly removal of the mould to obtain pores 2 2 synthesis of carbon templating the porous carbon synthesis using a particular template necessitate the feasibility to remove the template without damaging the resulting structure 47 for example in a method illustrate in fig 1 silica and carbon sources are firstly mixed then the mixture is heated to form solid composites in the final phase silica is removed by using the alkaline solvent fig 1 48 synthesis of porous carbon is also applicable to biomass based carbon by applying a specific template into a carbohydrate containing biomass 49 pang li 48 synthesed porous carbon form sucrose with the template of tetra ethyl ortho teos to form porous carbon fig 2 it was done by applying hydrofluoric acid to leach the silica after carbonization step the product was a carbon sheet that has pore diameter of 2 nm fig 2 porous carbon nanoparticles can also be made poly methyl meta acrylates pmma by using silica as the pore former 49 the resulting nanoparticles have pore size of 300 nm fig 3 liu gan 51 synthesized porous carbon from liquid paraffin by using silica as the regulator of carbon porcelain and surfactants to disperse paraffin in water the synthesis process consisted of two main steps formation of carbon silica composite using paraffin carbonization method followed by elimination of carbon silica by using hydrofluoric acid hf or potassium hydroxide koh the illustration of the sythesis process and morphology of the resulting porous carbon are shown in fig 4 brun sakaushi 53 prepared porous carbon from monosaccharides xylose and glucose using hydrothermal methods backed by carbonization and silica derived from the synthesis of the stober method using teos as a template after the composite of carbon and silica was formed the silica was removed using the ammonium hydrogen difuoride the morphologies of the obtained porous carbon are shown in fig 5 which have pore size of 100 nm and 5 8 nm liu yao 54 prepared microporous carbon particles from poly furfuryl alcohol through carbonization in this sythesis method furfuryl polymerization of alcohol was limited from stem shaped by adding silica or slowed by using surfactants the detail of preparation steps and the morphology of the resulting microporous carbon with pores of 260 320 nm are shown in fig 6 porous carbon synthesis can also be done through the hydrothermal method 54 in this method the common carbon sources used are hydrolysed hemicellulose corn cob and glucose and the template for pore formation is silica nanoparticles the morphology of the resulting porous carbon can be seen in fig 7 2 3 mesoporous carbon through mesoporous silica templated 2 3 1 carbon c synthesis of porous carbonaceous materials using silica template had been started since 1980s the porous membranes were developed from a phenol hexamine mixture as the carbon precursor and silica gel as the template the carbon can easily be filled thanks to the spacious structure of silica gel 56 another templates such as mgo have been introduced 57 59 mgo can be removed by using light acid but the homogeneity of the resulting mesoporous is lower than the ones with the silica template silica template is highly recommended for synthesis of very organized mesoporous architecture coupled with an acid treatment for the template removal 60 however the procedure for the template can cause serious environmental problems from the use of the harmful etchants 61 template method is superior to control mcs pore structure mcs with controlled pore structures can be formed by templating mesoporous silica such as mobil crystalline material 48 mcm 48 typically the synthesize of mcs steps involves infiltration of inorganic templates using carbon precursors followed by template removal 62 although this method results in asymmetric membrane it yields an ordered mesoporous carbon omc 60 like the one obtained using mcm 48 as the hard template omc has symmetrical structure and narrow pore size distribution common silica templates for mesoporous carbon fabrication are mcm santa barbara amorphous sba fudan university fdu msu h and hexagonal mesoporous silica hms 60 the pores size of mesoporous silica materials has been listed in table 1 carbon membranes have gained huge interests for desalination 68 and gas separation 69 mcs based membrane has high pore volume and surface area high resistance in rigorous circumstances and is easy to regenerate the pore size of a mc based membrane is affected by the carbon precursors and the treatment method 62 carbon precursors such as thermosetting phenol resin tpr mesophase pitch mp and polyacrylonitrile pan have been introduced for fabrication of mcs mp is attractive to fabricate the porous material with excellent performances due to good graphitizability high carbonization and low organic content 62 tpr offers higher surface area and pore volume of than mp and pan however mp seems more stable during heat treatment 62 the pores of mcs are formed by letting the small molecules of carbon precursors leach out during carbonization and by removal of the nanosized particles the resulting pore properties are also affected by dispersion of the nanosized silica and the thermal stabilities 2 3 2 mobil crystalline material some researchers studied mesoporous silica structure as a template using mcm 48 70 mcm 41 71 72 mcm 50 the mcm 48 is very attractive as template for production of mcs because the precursor can form periodic pores arrangement with three dimensional system homogeneous pores are contained in the mcm 48 molecular sieves 73 mcm 41 is naturally hexagonal mesoporous silica with high surface pore volume with the pores sizes ranging from 20 to 100 å 74 75 mcm 50 has pillared layer or lamellar pores among all mcm 41 has gained the most interest because of its simple structure as shown in fig 8 in particular the porous silica was created using sodium silicate or teos as the silicon source and alkyl ammonium salts as the structure directing agent 74 2 3 3 santa barbara amorphous sba sba 15 as a mesoporous material that has two dimensional 2 d hexagonal p6mm symmetry and a channel type or 3 d mesopore structure it contains the micropores inside the pore walls 77 the pore wall structure of sba 15 is thicker than the mcm 41 78 79 sba 15 can be prepared from teos or sodium silicate 80 81 or sodium silicate derived from oil palm ash 82 it has controllable pore sizes of 5 30 nm range 77 78 with good thermal and hydrothermal stability due to thick pore walls 2 6 nm sba 15 may show variety of morphologies such as rods fibres spheres gyroids doughnut like and discoid like shape depending on fabricate conditions 77 83 84 various methods of sba 15 fabrication have been reported to name a few grafting and impregnation direct synthesis sol gel and immobilization synthetic grafting and impregnation are used to produce covalent attachment of functional groups between organo silane with silanol groups on surface material 85 direct synthesis is a method where the metal source is added directly to the synthesis gel this method results in sba 15 of high specific area and pore volumes but owing to low ph it requires a high amount of the extra aluminium network 86 pore structure size and shape of sba 15 can be properly arranged when employing sol gel synthesis method that works under modest temperature and results in high purity 87 2 3 4 fudan university fdu the 3d pore structures of fdu 12 s are face centred cubic structure with close packing of spherical cages each is connected to 12 nearest neighboring cages 88 it can be fabricated from non ionic triblock copolymer f127 as a template teos as silica precursor with 1 3 5 trimethylbenzene tmb and potassium chloride kcl as additives tmb is used to enhance the volumetric ratio of the hydrophobic core and to turn it hydrophilic which leads the structure changes from a body centred cubic to a face centred cubic 89 fabrication at low temperature 15 c results in highly ordered cubic of fdu 12 silica with pore diameters of 22 27 nm 89 2 3 5 mesostructured msu h the porous framework of msu h is similar to that of sba 15 that consists of ordered large pores connected by micropores 90 these large two dimensional pore channels allow easy penetration of carbon with better pore sizes adjustment compared to the sba 15 or the mcm 41 91 msu h silica can be obtained from sodium silicate under neutral ph in the presence of triblock copolymer 92 omc membrane using sucrose as precursor and msu h as hard template was succesfully fabricated zeng zhao 91 the resulting omc has a large surface area of 1019 m2 g 1 large volume 1 46 cm 3 g 1 and uniform mesoporous structure with pore size distribution with modus at 4 2 nm 2 3 6 hexagonal mesoporous silica hms is a mesoporous silica template with high surface area 93 prepared via soft templating from neutral long chain of n dodecyl amine 94 95 the long range hexagonal structure can be formed from a long chain template there are few advantages of using hms over mcm 458 namely inexpensive structure directing agent primary alkyl amines high silica recovery yield 95 higher than the mcm 48 of 50 fast synthesis 18 h for hms and 4 days for mcm 48 does not involve hydrothermal reaction 96 thicker walls than sba 15 79 and the template is easy to remove hms has also been considerred as a potential template for drug carriers thanks to its volume for drug molecule loadings 97 2 4 mesoporous silica through mesoporous carbon templated owing to excellent chemical mechanical thermal and molecular sieving properties 98 100 the mesoporous silica membranes have been favorably applied for gas and water desalination processes the fabrications of such membranes involve several types of silica precursors such as teos as the most popular 101 tetramethoxysilane tmos methyltrimethoxysilane mtms and methyltriethoxysilane mtes 102 in recent studies ethyl orthosilicate 40 es 40 103 104 was employed to fabricate this membrane es 40 contains about 40 wt sio2 and an average of five si atoms per molecule it is produced by reacting ethanol water and silicon tetrachloride or through partial hydrolysis and condensation processes of teos however unlike teos es40 has lower hydrolysis rate but higher condensation rate 105 the produced silica is stable for up to 250 h of long term performance test 106 however the silica pores collaps easily because the hydrophilic silanol group si oh is reactive with water 107 108 the hydro stability can be enhanced by templating the carbon source into the silica resulting in improved properties of high mechanical strength good electrochemical performance and good thermal and adsorption properties 109 110 2 4 1 pluronic surfactant pluronic has been used as a template during formation of cpm to create ordered porous structure the pluronic concentration and the initial temperature are important aspects of forming a micelle after the micelle formation in acid solution poly ethylene oxide peo blocks in micelle can interact with the framework precursor teos or tmos 111 because of the high acidity of the solution the framework condenses and forms a silica network around the micelle as shown in fig 9 during the synthesis of mesoporous organo silica pmo pmo is formed when nonionic surfactant consisting of peo is added it results in formation of si c bonds through condensation of templated carbon surfactant such as ro 3 si r si or 3 then hydrolysis and cross link occur between the terminal groups of the bridged bis trialoxysilyl organo silanes 112 113 sba 16 can be prepared by employing pluronic f127 to form high quality mesostructured 114 some studies report smaller pore sizes of sba 16 from copolymer blends of p123 and f127 115 or nonionic oligomeric surfactants 116 f127 has critical micelle temperature of 31 c at 0 1 w v at higher concentration of 0 25 w v the cmt is diminished at the 28 c 111 when pluronic 123 p123 as a carbon source is incorporated into silica structures it produces more robust structures demonstrated by high performance of membrane filtration when using the silica p123 than the pure silica 103 it was also found that at low p123 concentrations the carbonized templates uniformly attached onto the silica matrix forming more microporous network higher concentrations of p123 lead to higher hydro stablility 2 4 2 natural carbon sources material to address the challenge of providing renewable resources at low cost it is very important to utilize non food related materials as the carbon sources several studies report the use of pectin extracted from apple 118 and banana peel 119 as the carbon sources to fabricate carbon templated silica the pectin in the silica matrix prevents the silica networks from collapsing toward water the polysaccharides from pectin allow formation mesoporous structure sucrose has also been used as the carbon precursor through hard template method for formation of mcm 120 sucrose is environmentally benign material that contains multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups that form hydrogen bonding with silica oligomers however there are only a few reports of sucrose incorporated into silica via the soft template 3 mesoporous silica materials 3 1 recent techniques fabrication and application 3 1 1 in situ synthesis in the modified in situ synthesis cetyltrimenthylammonium ctab and urea were firstly dissolved in water next cyclohexane ml ipa teos of 2 5 ml 3 mol 2 cyanoethyl triethoxysilane ceteos were added drop wise 121 after stirring for 30 min at room temperature it was heated to 70 c and was allowed to react for 16 h the results obtained were silica fibrous particles or sio2 cn3 by adopting the same method and by employing pure teos it resulted in formation of fi sio2 122 although in situ synthesis produces mesoporous sizes of 10 20 nm on fi sio2 sio2 cn3 or sio2 cn400 addition of n2 during the n2 adsorption desorption analysis increases the absorption and hysteresis h3 at p p 0 95 it suggests that there are a number of macropore gaps related to the sio2 microspheres fibrous morphology 123 124 higher than the f sio2 of 55 nm both 1 sio2 cn3 and f sio2 microspheres have relatively high specific surface area and total pore volume of microspheres 125 126 the specific surface area m2 g 1 sizes of 399 2 for f sio2 252 for sio2 cn3 and 298 for sio2 cn400 and the total pore volumes cm3 g 1 for f sio2 sio2 cn3 sio2 cn400 are 1 14 0 99 and 0 89 respectively based on available data it shows that the in situ method may produce mesoporous silica 3 1 2 the spinning coating thin film synthesis using the spinning coating process has also been reported 127 the fabrication starts from a mixture of naoh cetyltrimethylammonium chloride ctac water and methanol mixture tetramethylorth osilicate mixture of mos and aminopropyltrimethoxysilane and apt ms to form a sol the formed sol is stirred for 12 h at room temperature and is let idle for 8 h to prepare a thin film via the spinning coating processes a template of mesopore free silica particles is dispersed in ethanol by ultrasonication at 2 5 10 w w the dispersion is then coated on a substrate and spun at 500 2000 rpm for 40 s as detailed elsewhere 128 the bet characterization shows that the resulting particles have diameter of 2 6 nm and surface area 499 942 m2 g 1 suggesting that they are mesoporous in structure sem images reveals that there are still some structural defects with variation in the thicknesses due to the presence of agglomerates either in the original dispersion or formed during spinning in order to study the generality of the used spin coating process corresponding films were also prepared using amino functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles under otherwise identical conditions the surface chemical properties of the nanoparticles are found to be important affecting the interactions of the nanoparticles and the biological environment 129 3 1 3 the electrospinning coating mesoporous silica can also be prepared through the electrospinning coating process as reported elsewhere 130 the base materials are teos mixture with h3po4 that drop wise added during stirring mixing then a 10 pva solution is added into the silica sol as additive to ease the spinning next an alumina sol with a molar composition of al no3 3 9h2o alcl3 6h2o al o i pr 3 al h2o of 1 1 2 4 178 is prepared through hydrolysis and condensation reactions under constant stirring at 80 oc an appropriate amount of hno3is then added to the mixture to adjust the reaction rate and control the ph of the final sol from 3 24 to 4 23 then 0 1 g of peo and 6 0 g of p123 are added into 40 ml of as prepared alumina to improve the spinnability of the sol and to direct the pore structure formation respectively the mixture is then stirred for 12 h to form a spinnable sol to fabricate sio2 al2o3 core shell fibrous membrane the sol silica and sol alumina are put into a separated syringes the one for sol silica is connected to a core needle d 0 4 mm while the one for alumina sol is connected to a shell needle with an inner diameter of 1 mm the flows in the needle are set alike at 2 ml h the distance between the spinneret and the aluminium collector is 17 cm and the voltage of 18 kv the spinning is conducted under ambient condition the electrospun xerogel core shell fibrous membranes are collected on the aluminium foil and are further dried at 90 c for 12 h and then are calcined at 700 800 or 900 c for 2 h at a heating rate of 10 c min 1 131 the bet analysis reveals that higher calcination temperature leads to lower specific surface areas 132 with the values of 134 104 and 79 m2 g at 700 800 and 900 oc respectively the ph of the precursor also affects the pore volumes in which the phs of 3 24 3 53 and 4 23 correspond to the pore volumes are 0 387 0 589 and 0 655 cm3 g 1 respectively considering that the high surface area corresponds to a large adsorption capacity the reports 133 select the precursor ph of 4 23 as the most promissing condition to fabricate the shell in the coaxial electrospinning process 3 1 4 extraction from pumice stone mesoporous silica can be fabricated from pumice via extraction the resulting mesoporous silica has a high purity and shows the presence of siloxane and silanol groups however the extraction process takes so many steps and over a very long period the fabrication process starts with dissolving a pumice in 3 m naoh solutions in a three necks flask equipped with a condenser for 24 h at 100 c and a stirring speed of 300 rpm to produce sodium silica the obtained sodium silica is then washed and heated with distilled water silica settles at ph below 10 which is required to form silica gel under acidic condition furthermore the solution is titrated with h2so4 5 m until reaching ph 7 then is let idle for 24 h to allow formation of a white precipitate the precipitate is then filtered and the solid residue is dried at 80 oc for 24 h the residue is then refluxed with 1 m hcl at 110 oc for 3 h to purify silica from other soluble minerals al ca fe and mg the refluxed solution is then filtered and dried at 110 oc the last step is calcination at 800 oc to produce a white silica powder 134 the resulting pumice powder composes of mostly silica confirmed from ftir and chemical analysis main minerals content of clinopyroxene diopside augite or basanite types forsterite and other apatite and haematite in minor quantities 135 138 the pure silica structure is amorphous as demonstrated by strong peak at 2θ of 15 30 ftir peaks analysis show the narrow band centred at wavelength 1039 cm 1 may be attributed to the presence of silica with the highest percentage 139 as also confirmed by chemical analysis the predominant bands at wavelength 1101 cm 1 and the shoulder at 1193 cm 1 are associated with asymmetric stretching vibrations of siloxane si o si the presence of bands at 470 cm 1 and 810 cm 1 is from symmetric siloxane groups si o si the existence of a band at 950 cm 1 is associated with si oh groups from silanol groups with smaller particle sizes 140 the shoulder appeared at 3750 cm 1 indicates the presence of hydrogen bonds from interaction between the silanol groups si oh located at the surface of the nanosilica material 141 bet results show that the pore size of the silica is in range of 2 6 nm indicating of the mesoporous structure with a pore volume of 0 645 that exceeds the size of the nanoparticles of 0 195 cm g 1 with the surface area of 422 m2 g 1 3 2 recent trends on the ordered and the disordered mesoporous silica materials summary of structure and pore size distribution of silica carbon base materials is presented in table 2 it summarizes the main properties of recently developed ordered and disordered mesoporous silica materials discussed in this sub section 3 2 1 teos etoh c6h12o6 h2o ordered mesoporous silica materials is a promising material in the field of technology membrane filtration synthesis of order mesoporous silica have recently been developed by directly assembly of organic or carbon template 149 elma et al reported development of direct acid catalyst for preparation of mesoporous carbon template silica membranes with ordered structure on porous a α alumina support the ordered mesoporous silica membranes made from organocatalytic posed relatively high surface area and pore volume of 354 m² g 1 and 0 215 cm3 g 1 g 1 respectively the citric acid catalyst acts as a carbon source in the silica matrix and increases the hydro stability of silica networks absorption of the n2 curve shows xerogels refluxed at 0 and 50 c are included in type iv h4 142 while elma et al work found surface area and pore size of 475 m² g 1 and 1 94 cm³ g 1 143 3 2 2 teos etoh hno3 h2o nh3 modified the sol gel process is needed to reduce the amount of silanol group reflux temperature can be adjusted to get optimum condition for ordered mesoporous silica the ordered mesoporous silica materials were also preserved during reflux temperature on sol gel process the sol gel was refluxed at 0 and 50 c to achieve the lowest and the highest siloxane concentrations with calcined xerogel at a ph of 6 or 9 xerogel at ph 6 and 9 shows a tendency to form micro and mesoporous materials as adsorption saturation is achieved above 0 65 p p with capillary condensation leads to hysteresis near 0 5 p p the average pore diameter each was measured around 2 6 2 7 nm and showed type iv isotherm curves with hysteresis loops indicating the mesopore structures in other hand silica based materials of ph 7 and 8 had type i isotherms curves without hysteresis indicating of microporous material the bet surface area 420 m2 g 1 and total pore volume 0 18 cm3 g 1 were proportional to the pore size of about 1 8 nm therefore micro porosity was correlated well with high concentrations of silanol groups 143 while silica sol mixed with various variations of cobalt oxide 5 35 w v obtained at ph 6 and produced mesoporous membrane the bet results show that the isotherms of the two samples were type iv ascribing the characteristics of the mesoporous material the greater addition of si co concentration the larger was the surface area volume and pore size this was because the cobalt oxide in xerogel increased the silanol and siloxane groups to enlarge the pores 150 3 2 3 teos tevs etoh hno3 h2o nh3 p123 triethoxyvinylsilane tevs is frequently used to produce microporous silica membranes on interlayer porous substrates 146 it contains vinyl groups as silica ligand pendants the silica methyl ligand pendant group is known to produce high quality microporous silica membranes in order to form mesoporous structures tevs and other silica precursors are combined using teos with the addition of p123 non ligand triblock copolymer as a template then the sol gel synthesis is carried out with a base catalyst which allows its deposition directly to the porous substrate without using interlayers the non ligand surfactant is embedded into the silica matrix followed by carbonization high quality carbon can be prepared using ligand and non ligand templates together with the co polymerization reaction of two different silica precursors where teos does not have a template while tevs has a ligand template based on the vinyl group then the xerogel and silica membrane are calcined under vacuum or n2 atmosphere carbon silica hybrid membranes are represented as cs n2 calcined under n2 and cs vc calcined under vacuum air calcined at 450 c the isotherms of the order p123 template teos tevs is type iv of the mesoporous material the interlayer free carbon silica hybrid membranes were successfully prepared by adding template of pluronic triblock copolymer p123 and vinyl pendant ligands in tevs in synthesis sol gel also contain teos as the second silica precursor both the vacuum calcined and the n2 samples exhibit mesoporous properties with high pore volume but the calcined vacuum samples cs vc produces more carbon structure in the silica matrix resulting in better desalination performance surface area and pore volume of cs n2 membrane are 754 m² g 1 and 0 546 cm³ g 1 while cs vc membrane are 761 m² g 1 and 0 615 cm³ g 1 the cs vc membrane produces water flux much higher than previously reported for processing saltwater the combine method of organo silica hybrid with polymer template and vacuum calcination produces mesoporous silica membrane carbonization very well for the separation of water from hydrated salt ions and exhibits high water flux especially for processing brine salt solutions 148 3 2 4 teos tevs etoh hno3 h2o nh3 k2s2o8 hybrid silica membranes can be prepared by mixing teos and tevs using k2s2o8 kps as an initiator elma wang 146 the kps provides radical polymerization to create cc bonds as a secondary network and then to produce more space in the silica network the radical polymerization formed by kps affects the growth of oriented particles in order to avoid decomposition of cc groups in the silica matrices the calcination process is held up to 350 c densification is then formed when the ratio of tevs is greater than teos composition the tevs teos molar ratio is 10 90 and produces micro porosity pure tevs is not suitable to produce amorphous silica material because the functional groups formed were found blocked inside the pores as such the xerogel hybrids containing tevs become microporous the isotherms found the saturation process at very low relative pressures p p 0 05 it is due to the mixing between tevs and teos is greatly reduced and this trend continues as a function of tevs 146 3 2 5 teos etoh nh3 h2o ctab cetyltrimethylammonium bromide mesoporous silica carbon template materials have been explored and developed very fast to competes in desalination application carbon template is one of effective strategy to stabilized the silanol group of silica membrane recently ashrafi shahria ravaria 147 used ctab surfactants as template to embedded into silica silica precursors were synthesized at 550 c to remove cationic templates from ctab required to form the mesoporous structures order mesoporous silica ms nanoparticles were synthesized and then functioned by eriochrome black t ecbt as a corrosion inhibitor composite coating systems a combination between ti zr conversion layers and organic inorganic hybrid sol gel were applied instead of simple sol gel films to provide better corrosion protection and adhesive strength nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms were plotted with bjh plots from ms nanoparticles before and after loading of the inhibitors the n2 physisorption data showed that the surface area and pore volume of ms were 925 1 m² g 1 and 02 025 cm³ g 1 while the surface area and pore volume of ms ecbt were 103 1 m² g 1 and 0 0561 cm³ g 1 it is clear that the specific surface area of ms nanoparticles is greatly decreased by the final functionalization process due to the addition of ecbt molecules in the mesoporous space in addition the pore volume of ms nanoparticles is greatly decreased by loading of inhibitors however the pore diameter of ms nanoparticles did not change significantly after the loading inhibitor because the structure of nanoparticles could not be affected by the functionalization process 147 this is also similar to that studyexplained by vazquez gonzalez 151 in which surfactants play an important effect in changing the morphology of particles but it cannot change pore size and pore diameter 3 2 6 teos etoh ni no3 2 6h2o h2o2 h2o the ordered of nickel oxide sol are synthesized by hydrolysis and condensation of teos in ethanol with and without 30 h2o2 water and nickel nitrate hexahydrate ni no3 2 6h2o the tendency of the silanol siloxane ratio clearly showed that the role of h2o2 was favoured by the formation of silanol groups and slightly inhibited the condensation reaction the presence of h2o2 acidified the the sol gel process by the presence of nitric acid which promoted the formation of silanol groups and microporous materials nitrogen adsorption isotherm of ordered xerogel doped with nickel by addition of h2o2 produced a type i isotherm curves ascribed by very strong initial adsorption at very low partial pressures p p 0 2 followed by saturation ascribing the characteristic of type i micropores whereas nickel doped xerogels without h2o2 formed mesopores with higher adsorption saturation capacities above 0 4 p p and hysteresis with subtle inflection indicating the type iv isotherms surface area for ordered mesoporous nickel oxide with 10 h2o2 was affected by the ni si molar ratio the average pore diameter with h2o2 remained constant at 2 1 0 05 nm addition of nickel oxide to silica gel matrix with h2o2 could maintain the micro porosity of amorphous silica xerogel whereas samples without h2o2 produced meso porosity that increased significantly as a function of ni content as the average pore size increased while the bet surface area decreased for a ni si ratio of 25 50 this effect had also been observed for cobalt silica oxide and increased meso porosity is associated with cobalt oxide agglomeration perhaps the same effect also occurs on increasing the shaft as a function of the ni si molar ratio in this work 52 4 the application of carbon templated mesoporous silica materials carbon templated mesoporous silica membranes are excellent material for pervaporation a process to separate liquid mixtures by vaporization and selective permeation and through a membrane 152 it uses molecular sieve type of membranes that permits only passage to water molecules under driving force of a water vapor pressure difference 10 highly permeable and selective membranes can be prepared via sol gel method that offers great advantages in the control of pore sizes 10 143 152 153 recent advances in the preparation of carbon template mesoporous silica membranes have opened avenue to substantially improve pervaporation performance with respect to flux selectivity and stability conscientious adjusting of carbon silica template mesoporous structures makes it possible to design membranes as coveted of respective separation applications carbon template silica membranes have also widely been applied for gas separation particularly the ones with microporous structures 154 157 microporous molecular sieve carbon silica base membranes can also offer the considerable advantages in comparison to the zeolite the polymeric or the carbon based membranes 157 whereas membrane materials with mesoporous structure are more appropriate for water desalination 143 158 159 the carbon templated molecular sieve mesoporous silica materials are gaining popularity for desalination which is detailed in the following section 4 1 hydro stability of silica carbon templated and current strategies for water desalination desalination via pervaporation is promising to produce fresh water from non potable saline sources it offers advantages of a high salt rejection and the capability of treating a high salinity solution novel mesoporous silica base membranes for desalination have recently been developed because of the affinity of amorphous silica for water adsorption pure silica derived membranes suffer from structural degradation when in contact with water leading to a loss of selectivity hydro stability is therefore a severe problem which prompts the recent studies on altering the surface properties of the silica to lessen the interaction of water molecules with the membrane structure one strategy to address hydro stability problems is by introducing a non covalently bonded organic templates into the pure silica matrix 12 157 160 the existence of carbon moieties embedded into the silica framework can inhibit the mobility of soluble silica groups under hydrolytic attack and consequently hinders micropore from collapsing 10 154 the carbon templates and silanol groups si ohs interact weakly via the electrostatic interaction to form a peculiar structure derived from a hydrophobic core and hydrophilic exterior properties 161 the carbon templates obstruct the micropore spaces to forbid the mobility and degradation of the silanol groups for the first time raman and brinker 160 demonstrated a break through organic templating approach to fabricate the molecular sieving organo silica membranes it results in high flux and selectivity membrane for gas separation the hydrophobic carbon template improves the hydrothermal stability of the silica membranes in similar research done by duke da costa 154 report carbonized template molecular sieve silica ctmss as new material for wet gas separation the c6 surfactant hexyl trimethyl ammonium bromide is embedded into ctmss as carbon template to achieve a great hydro stability via hydrophobic surface functionalization the mechanism of carbon templates in imposing hydro stabilization toward exposure to water is illustrated in fig 10 both mesoporous silica and template carbon materials alter the surface chemistry to limit water in breaking the siloxane groups hydrolysis and allowing for dissociative chemisorption as detailed elsewhere 162 normally the rehydration on the silica surface is done by a physisorption of water to form a hydroxyl group followed by a chemisorption with the nearby siloxane groups as more silanol groups are formed more sites become available for h2o sorption and a chain reaction of siloxane breakage occurs across the surface the mobility of silica groups then becomes localized in the higher attraction energy regions in the smaller pores where thermal condition above 180 c causes a subsequent cross pore condensation leading to their closure fig 10 demonstrates how the carbon moieties templated into silica matrices prevent the mobility of silica groups under hydrolytic attack and inhibits micropore cave in the entrapment of carbon moieties in the carbon template silica matrix is facilitated by carbonization of the templates under vacuum or an inert atmosphere leading to a hybrid silica carbon membrane carbon template membranes thus offers a great potential for achieving hydro stability without compromising the selectivity 162 the carbon silica template membranes have also been tested for desalination of saline water nacl 3 5 wt demonstrating high salt rejection 163 carbon templated mesoporous silica materials have a pore size of 0 3 10 nm and thus are very suitable for desalination applications 145 158 163 165 wijaya duke 166 reported the investigation of carbon chain length of ionic surfactants effect toward ctmss membranes for desalination by preparing sol gels with c6 c12 and c16 the ctmss membrane fabricated with the longest carbon chain c16 surfactant delivered the highest salt rejection whilst also given the largest pore volume and surface area interestingly the average pore sizes of the membranes were identical for the three surfactants used ladewig tan 165 investigated the potential of a polyethylene glycol polypropylene glycol polyethylene glycol peg ppg peg as the template non ionic surfactant the enhanced carbon content up to10 increased the pore volume and the specific surface area consequently the membrane demonstrated a slightly higher flux of 3 7 kg m 2 h 1 and 985 of salt rejection at room temperature compared to the surfactant template membranes mentioned above that is 2 2 and 3 kg m 2 h 1 respectively the embedded carbon has a beneficial role in silica matrices and the amount embedded has a direct impact to performance of the carbon silica template 4 1 1 effect of operation condition on performance of carbon template silica membranes table 3 summarizes the reports on carbon template silica performance in terms of water flux and salt rejection performance of membrane in pervaporation is affected by the testing conditions such as feed temperature feed salt concentration and permeate vapor pressure to achieve optimum performance it is necessary to study the effect of testing parameters on water flux and salt rejection a change of feed concentration directly affects sorption at the liquid membrane interface 161 since diffusion in the membrane is concentration dependent the water flux generally decreases with increasing salt concentration in the feed 10 145 mass transfer in the liquid feed side may be limited by the extent of concentration polarization in general when the feed flow rate increases water flux also increases due to a reduction of transport resistance in the liquid boundary layer and reduction of the concentration polarization the feed temperature exponentially increases the water flux it is because when feed temperature increases the vapor pressure on the feed side increases exponentially while the vapor pressure on the permeate side remains constant the raising of vapor pressure leads to an increase in the driving force of the water vapor transport thus improving the water flux the diffusion coefficient of water vapor increases by four times as the feed temperature is raised from 20 to 65 c 153 moreover high temperature increases the frequency and amplitude of thermal motions of the polymer chains which can bring about the free channels of polymer promoting the water vapor transport the carbon templated silica membranes have been widely reported and developed for water desalination application 17 19 99 109 144 146 159 163 164 166 170 pervaporation using inorganic membranes based on mesoporous silica offers high salt rejection but rather low in water fluxes especially for saline solution nacl 3 5 wt these low performances diminish the chance of the pervaporation using inorganic membranes to compete against the reverse osmosis ro processes it is however worth noting that the results are dependent upon many parameters related to testing condition including the feed concentration the feed temperature the permeate vapor pressure and the fouling scaling tendencies in addition the listed membranes on table 3 may have different geometries flat hollow fibre or tubular and sizes and architecture thickness of top layer number interlayers or top layer porosity and substrate as such all these factors play a role in the final performances duke o brien abraham 171 reported that a mtes membrane with pore diameter of 0 5 nm exhibits a higher water flux than carbonized template molecular sieve silica ctmss membrane with pore diameters of 0 3 nm but with lower salt rejection the comparison of three kinds of inorganic membranes alumina mtes and ctmss for desalination by pervaporation have also been reported among them ctmss displayed the best performance with a flux of 2 2 kg m 2 h 1 a rejection 99 9 and long term testing at 25 c was stable for 5 h the findings suggest that the incorporation of carbon in a silica matrix plays a role in increasing salt rejection as well as matrix stabilization wijaya duke 166 reported a cts membrane derived from long carbon chain surfactant c16 showed high salt rejection of up to 97 with a flux of 3 kg m 2 h 1 carbon chain length of surfactants templates is a crucial factor that give direct impact in terms of desalination performance the amount of embedded carbon has a beneficial role in silica matrices and is directly related to the number of residual carbons after the carbonization however if the surfactants concentration is too high it forms micelles which block the possibility of using the sol gel to coat the substrates ladewig tan 165 to use the tri block copolymer polyethylene glycol polypropylene glycol polyethylene glycol peg ppg peg as the template the surfactant templates tend to form micelles at high concentrations and precipitate if in excess of 3 wt in the silica sol gel when the carbon content increased to 10 there was a rise in porosity despite still remained microporous consequently the membrane demonstrated a slightly higher flux of 3 7 kg m 2 h 1 and 985 of salt rejection for system operating at room temperature further increases of the tri block copolymer to 20 wt altered the structure becomes mesopores the performance is slightly higher than the surfactant template membranes 2 2 and 3 kg m 2 h 1 mentioned earlier mesopore ctab silica membranes exhibited an excellent salt rejection 99 and water flux2 6 kg m 2 h 1 in seawater desalination at 25 c however when it is exposed to high feed temperature 40 c the barrier layer of the mesostructured formed by a weak electrostatic interaction between ctab and silica may suffer a disturbance leading to a release of nacl molecules to the permeate side and thus drastically decreases the salt rejection this effect of temperature was reversible the rejection came back to normal when reversed to lower feed temperature 172 recently p123 carbon template silica prepared by the ctp technique by elma wang 13 were successfully fabricated using the dual catalyst sol gel method embedded p123 loading from 0 50 wt into silica sol exhibited salt rejection of 99 the water fluxes varied depending on the loading of p123 in the silica sol the feed temperature and the salt concentration in the feed the water flux of the silica p123 membranes varied between 0 5 4 5 kg m 2 h 1 p123 5 wt 0 9 5 5 kg m 2 h 1 p123 20 wt 1 4 6 3 kg m 2 h 1 p123 35 wt and 1 5 8 5 kg m 2 h 1 p123 50 wt the major finding here was that the effect of salt concentration polarization was greatly reduced as the concentration of p123 in the silica matrix increased from 5 to 50 wt hence high carbon content conferred salt concentration anti polarization to the membrane surface as compared to the high silica content glucose template silica membranes were investigated by mujiyanti elma 19 for brine water desalination the c h stretching vibration showed from ftir results indicating carbon from glucose successfully induced into the silica matrices silica glucose membrane showed good performance with salt rejection of 93 but rather low water flux of 0 22 2 28 kg m 2 h 1 under feed temperatures of 25 40 and 60 c this work concluded that the addiction of glucose as carbon template agents strengthen the silica network becomes stronger even though the water fluxes remains a bit lower elma pratiwi 17 produced potable water from nacl 3 5 wt solution they found that the pectin template silica membranes gave similar water fluxes of 5 9 8 66 kg m 2 h 1 25 60 c with salt rejections of 99 3 depending on the testing conditions and amount of pectin loading 2 5 wt calcined at 300 c the membranes work well thanks to the presence of carbon chains from the pectin apple which strengthened silica membrane pore structure syauqiyah elma 109 reported silica p123 membrane for seawater desalination prepared under different calcined technique of rtp the rtp technique offered faster fabrication time with competitive performance against the ctp technique this work reported comparing performance of silica pectin and silica p123 membranes by measuring water flux and salt rejection silica pectin membrane displayed prominent water flux of 3 folds higher than the silica p123 it is suggested that the number of carbon chains of p123 joined to silica matrices densified the membranes film liang zhan 173 prepared go graphene oxide films coated on polyacrylonitrile pan by vacuum filtration method as the new intriguing material go has ultra thin two dimensional structure with abundant functional groups such as epoxide carbonyl on the surface the resulting membrane displayed outstanding water permeability of up to 65 kg m 2 h 1 and salt rejection of 99 8 for desalination nacl 3 5 wt via pervaporation at 90 c go based membranes have the potentials to become the preferred candidates to next generation high performing membranes however fabrication method of go membranes is rather complex and the go membranes tend to quickly swell when immersed in water on a large recent results show that pervaporation using inorganic membranes have undergone major improvement as water fluxes are now reaching values as high as 65 kg m 2 h 1 for feed of nacl 3 5 wt these results clearly show that pervaporation using inorganic membranes has closed the performance gap with the pervaporation using organic polymer based membrane with performances now in the same range as commercial ro membranes 4 1 2 desalination of wetland saline water by carbon template silica membranes desalination of wetland saline water is an interesting application for pervaporation by carbon template silica membranes reports on desalination of wetland saline water by pervaporation using carbon silica template membrane are listed on table 4 wetland saline water is abundant in indonesia especially in south kalimantan generally wetland saline water has unique characteristics such as low ph brownish colour and consists of high natural organic matter nom 99 that typically increases membrane vulnerability from fouling even more sea water infiltrates into wetland aquifers during the rainy season and increase the salinity of the wetland water in many wetland areas wetland water is often seen as the only water resource but its utilization is highly limited by the salt concentration and nom contents elma fitriani 169 reported the application of mesopore carbonized template silica membrane by employing p123 triblock copolymers calcinated at different temperatures 350 600 c for desalination of wetland saline water the silica p123 membranes showed good water flux and salt rejection the water flux of silica p123 increased from 1 3 to 1 7 kg m 2 h 1 by raising the calcination temperatures from 300 to 600 c in the contrary the salt rejection decreased sharply from 96 to 66 such behaviours are attributed to the carbon moieties tight at low temperature in arranging the silica pore structure leading to the reduction of water fluxes therefore silica p123 membranes calcined at high temperature having loose indeed the membrane structure become unstable and force the selectivity decreases in another study elma hairullah 168 pure silica membrane was proved effective to reduce the salt concentration of wetland saline water feed via pervaporation process the highest water flux obtained at feed temperature of 60 c was1 2 kg m 2 h 1 unfortunately the salt rejection was still poor only 69 at the highest feed temperature a phenomena equivocal with the one discussed earlier interestingly another study lestari elma 99 also reported organosilica membrane with similar water flux of 1 2 kg m 2 h 1 at lower feed temperature 25 c coupled with high salt rejection over 99 fig 11 the organosilica membranes was prepared by employing citric acid with dual roles as the carbon sources and catalyst such membrane poses advantages such as inexpensive easy to fabricate and fast in production the pure mesoporous silica has slightly lower performance than other carbon mesopore template silica membranes overall it can be deduced that carbon template effective and yet affordable material for preparation of silica based membranes for wetland saline water desalination silica pectin membrane showed excellent water fluxes of 2 3 folds higher than various silica based membranes applied for wetland saline water desalination fig 11 rahma elma 174 investigated pectin templated silica membrane and claimed that it achieved almost complete salt rejection of 99 the nom content was effectively reduced by incorporating a coagulation process as the pre treatment the highest nom uv254 rejection was over 90 174 mechanism of pervaporation process for wetland saline water using carbon silica template membrane is shown in fig 12 selectively of pure silica membranes are greatly reduced as the mobility of the silica enlarge the pore in the silica film facilitating salt diffusion water molecules react with the hydrophilic silanol groups because the silica matrix becomes mobile the carbon template provides a barrier in the silica matrix that blocks the mobility of silica fig 12 in this application carbon can be attributed as a strong agent that switches the weakly silanol groups to avoid shrinkage of the silica matrices at higher temperature carbon silica template materials are needed 4 1 3 long term stability of carbon template silica membranes the stability of pervaporation process is judged by the ability to maintain the performance over time flux decline can happen due to hydration of the ions in solution and on the pore mouths which blocks the entry of water molecules therefore during long time testing the membrane fouling becomes critical due to the tendency of salt deposition that block the membrane pores deposition of salt shrinks the pore structure that block the transport of water which lowers the flux 143 153 fig 13 summarizes the stability performance of various membranes types for desalination application regarding the long term testing of pure silica membrane inorganic based material an excellent result was reported by elma yacou 143 for desalination of feed solution of 3 5 wt of nacl it was observed that pure silica membranes have stable long term performances for 250 h at feed temperature of 22 c the first part of the operation of 150 h showed water fluxes 8 5 kg m 2 h 1 and the 250 h test yielded the water fluxes of 6 7 kg m 2 h 1 the salt rejections were maintained high of 98 however elma yacou 143 also reported that water flux slightly reduced attributed to micropore blocking by hydrated salt ions due to the pure silica matrices cave during the submergence in water despite the importance of performance stability only a few reports are available table 5 in the longest performance evaluation reported so far lin ding 175 demonstrated cobalt oxide silica membranes cooxsi est with multiples salt solutions i e 1 288 h 3 5 wt 144 h 7 5 wt 72 h and 15 wt 72 h totalling of 570 h water flux of the cooxsi membrane tended to stabilize after 5 days ascribed to initial structural changes in the cooxsi matrices the long term testing successfully demonstrated the improved hydro stability of cooxsi membranes at various feed concentrations in the several other studies ctmss c6 membranes showed stable performance over 5 h wijaya duke 166 and over 12 h 165 due to the benefit of the carbonized templating method to improve the hydro stability of the silica membranes the report of long term stability study of carbon templated mesoporous silica membranes is still limited zwijnenberg koops 176 demonstrated the longest stability performance of non porous polyether amide membranes using solar driven pervaporation the test was carried out using three different feed de oiled formation water untreated seawater and artificial seawater 3 5 wt nacl the water flux remained stable over 250 day in the beginning of the experiment a slightly lower flux was observed due to the hold up volume on the permeate side of the system however water flux reached a steady state after 10 days tests the occurrence of membrane fouling was not obvious over the experiment duration the decrease in water flux due to fouling also reduced the heat loss via evaporation this automatically resulted in an increase in the feed temperature consequently the increased feed temperature enhanced the evaporation rate to about the same level that occurred as that without fouling 4 2 future challenges carbon template silica based membranes for desalination application are still at the premature stages of research and development therefore this type of material requires significant enhancements to be able to compete against both established membranes and or established technologies indeed the ro process using polymeric based membranes is now the golden standard as a result of major research development and deployment in the last 30 years silica based membranes have shown potential in providing excellent molecular sieving properties for gas separation applications but less so in water desalination it is primarily due to the shortage of hydro stability of silica structures when contact with water the final challenge for the membrane researchers is to establish the carbon materials which are favourable most technically and economically viable applied for water desalination using silica based membranes go and polyetherimide materials have been reported to be effective carbon template into silica matrices in wetland saline water desalination improvement is required to have membrane material that can handle the presence of nom in the feed application of mesoporous carbon template silica membranes by pervaporation is also restricted by the high energy input in comparison to the ro analysis of the thermodynamics also indicates that parity will never be reached when utilizing primary energy sources however if the pervaporation process is successfully integrated with solar heat sources waste heat or other sustainable energy source then the technology may be attractive for niche applications such as brine processing or salt recovery currently there is limited study on membrane fouling for the silica carbon based membranes mainly due to the immature stages of the testing most studies still utilize laboratory scale using artificial saltwater as the feed similarly for fouling study of wetland saline water desalination given the scale of the problem for ro membranes this is a problem that will require substantial research in the future to ensure that mesoporous carbon template silica membranes can be deployed in an industrial context 5 conclusions many approaches have been developed to prepare carbon templated mesoporous silica hard templating methods have often been applied in which the incorporated carbon sources are deposited through mesoporous silica however this method is costly involves toxic substances and complicated which limit its application soft templating is favourable strategies to tailor well defined mesoporous structure sustainable carbon sources material as templating agents are very attractive technically and economically sucrose has been explored as carbon templates because it is an environmentally friendly product and contains multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups which will make the formation of hydrogen bonding with silica oligomers possible in addition go and polyetherimide material can also be considered as effective carbon templating into silica matrices due to their excellent properties application of carbon templated mesoporous silica membranes is promising for water desalination future challenges for desalination of wetland saline water are on improve membrane performances high flux and salt rejection as well as handle nom content to tackle the energy input issue application of mesoporous carbon template silica membranes by pervaporation systems can be coupled with renewable energy such as solar heat sources waste heat or others as such it can be competitive against ro for niche applications such as brine processing or salt recovery declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements

13764,porous materials have attracted attention in many practical fields including for water desalination carbon templated is an attractive method in enhancing the properties of mesoporous silica materials used as membrane materials this review mainly focuses on the strategies of carbon templates of mesoporous silica materials essentially applied for water desalination numerous strategies for carbon templated mesoporous silica are briefly discussed in addition most carbon silica based membranes for desalination are detailed and their performances are discussed moreover application of carbon silica templates for wetland saline water desalination are also discussed in great detail the comparison between carbon silica based materials and silica based membranes of recent techniques fabrication trend application and operation condition for further improvement of membrane performance are also thoroughly reviewed keywords carbon templated mesoporous silica carbon silica based materials water and wetland saline water desalination 1 introduction porous materials have attracted attention in many practical fields such as chemical medical optic electronic biotechnological environmental and or energy applications porous materials pose regular pore structures and high surface area useful for materials adsorption storage 1 2 according to the iupac definition porous materials are classified into three categories depending on their pore sizes microporous 2 nm mesoporous 2 50 nm and macroporous 50 nm 3 since the first mesoporous material of mcm 41 was introduced in 1990s the developments of other mesoporous materials have been extensive 4 basic preparation of mesoporous materials are done using template synthesis self assembled micelles structure from cost effective silica and carbon sources 1 it is done by employing organic template molecules under various processes or by employing textural templates where the inorganic precursor condenses 4 extensive reports are available on custom developments of novel mesoporous materials for catalyst sorption sensing optics drug delivery or separation mesoporous materials are also attractive for wrapping sirna to enhance the therapeutic effect on cancer for medical treatment 5 6 they have been explored to encapsulate fragrances for controlled release and storage of the odorants 7 mesoporous materials such as zeolite and silica are also highly attractive as support for catalyst 8 9 thanks to their inherent selectivity and high surface area 10 membranes processes have long been established with widespread applications they are mostly used to produce potable water from saline water to treat industrial wastewater effluents and to recover valuable resources from wastewater via concentration and purification and to fractionate macromolecular mixtures in the food and drug industries they have also been established for separation of gases energy conversion systems artificial organs and drug delivery the membrane materials employed in those diverse applications differ widely in their structure and function diverse membrane base processes have recently been emerging molecular separations fractionations concentrations purifications clarifications emulsifications crystallization etc it is mainly because of the inherent characteristic of high efficiency operational simplicity stability and flexibility high selectivity and permeability in separation applications low energy requirements environment compatibility easy to control and scale up apart for being applied as standalone unit membrane processes are also very common in hybrid system involving process intensification they include but not limited to membrane reactors membrane bioreactors membrane contactors however all membranes have several features in common that make them particularly attractive for the separation the separation is performed by physical means mostly at ambient temperature without chemically altering the feed mixture this is mandatory for applications in artificial organs and in many drug delivery systems as well as in the food and drug industry or in downstream processing of bioproducts where temperature sensitive substances are handled the membrane materials used in those applications differ widely in their structure function and the way they operate membrane properties can thus be tailored and adjusted to specific applications the versatility of membrane structures and functions makes a precise and complete definition of a membrane rather difficult a membrane is a barrier that separates and or contacts two different phases and controls the exchange of matter and energy between the phases the membrane can be a selective or simply acts as a contacting barrier in the first case it controls the exchange between the two phases adjacent to it in a very specific manner in the second case it functions as contactor of the two phases in which the transport occurs ones can distinguish between biological membranes which are part of the living organism and synthetic membranes that are man made the structure and function of synthetic membranes are much simpler than the biological membranes they only facilitate passive transport and are less selective however they are chemically and mechanically more stable especially at high temperature the selectivity of synthetic membranes is dictated by sieving property of the pore or the solute solubility and diffusivity within the membrane matrix the permeability of the membrane for different components however is only one parameter determining the flux through the membrane membrane based processes are also driven by different forces such as concentration different pressure different or temperature gradients or an electrical potential for the charged components the use of different driving forces results in a number of processes such as reverse osmosis micro ultra and nanofiltration dialysis electrodialysis pervaporation gas separation membrane contactors membrane distillation membrane based solvent extraction membrane reactors etc 11 mesoporous silica materials are frequently applied for membrane fabrication in the gas and the water separation and thus worthy of detailed overview the interaction between the permeating molecule and the membrane material often dictate the separation process gas steams or water vapor are abundant with water molecules that easily reacts with the hydrophilic sites in the silica thin films created chemical and microstructural instability for instance giessler diniz da costa 12 reported that sol gel derived films produced the silanols from hydrolysis and condensation reactions the presence of silanol bonds collapses of the film structure that lowers the pore volume silanol groups form weakly branched fractal systems and has hydrophilic properties they easily react with water altering the matrix of silica derived materials these include organic covalent templates such as methyl groups and noncovalently bonded organic templates such as c6 and c16 surfactants and alkyltriethoxysilanes 12 to overcome the detrimental interaction of water with the silica material various templating methods have been developed it is generally divided into 3 steps 1 preparation 2 method selection i e hydrothermal precipitation and sol gel and 3 templating dissolution sintering etc regular template is sorted into two categories of materials that is naturally and synthesis one strategy to obtain a good hydro stability of silica is by embedding carbon molecules into the silica matrix various materials have been used earlier as carbon sources such as p123 13 f127 14 and f108 15 or citric acid 16 recently more sustainable and low cost carbon sources have also been explored such as pectin from apple peel 17 banana peel 18 and also glucose 19 the si o c bond can be formed after adding carbon materials into the silica matrix the presence of carbon prevents silica pore from collapsing especially when the material is applied for water desalination carbon material also reported has strong covalent bonding 20 which enhances the mechanical strength in this review we overview of the progress of the advantageous strategies of carbon templates of mesoporous silica materials essentially applied for water desalination numerous strategies for carbon templated mesoporous silica were discussed finally applications of carbon templated mesoporous silica materials in water desalination are also discussed 2 advanced carbon templated strategies materials with nanopore structure allow interaction at atomic ionic and molecular level since they have large surface area and limited spatial space 21 22 nanopores can be classified into macro porous 50 nm mesoporous 2 nm 50 nm and microporous 2 nm materials with nanopore has been used in adsorption 23 separation 24 25 catalysts 26 27 and electronics 28 29 among many application of nanopores nanopore carbons npcs have regular interpenetrations which leads to desirable chemical and physical properties namely high specific surface uniform pore structure good heat resistance and chemical stability low density and many others 28 npcs have been then implemented in hydrogen storage 30 adsorption 31 32 energy storage 33 34 and electronic devices 35 the most commonly used carbon templating methods include physical destruction adhesion and spray and chemical methods precipitation sol gel hydrothermal and template 36 37 template synthesis is a method that has been developed since the 1990 an and still widely applied currently the method is also very easy to do and provide ample flexibility in controlling the structure morphology and particle size of the resulting materials 38 morphology is an important parameter to determine the character of the particle size and pore structure 39 40 the template method changes the morphology of the product by controlling the nucleation and growth of crystals during the nano material preparations it generally consists of 3 steps 1 template preparation 2 methods selection hydrothermal precipitation and sol gel and 3 templated dissolution sintering etc regular template can be classified into materials that is naturally and synthetic also it is based on the difference between the structure of the template the templating method is divided into hard templates and soft templates 41 42 one strategy to obtain a good hydro stability of silica matrix is by embedding carbon molecules into the silica various materials have been used earlier as carbon sources such as p123 13 f127 14 and f108 15 or citric acid addition 16 recently more sustainable and low cost carbon sources have also been explored pectin from apple peel 17 banana peel 18 and also glucose 19 the si o c bond can be formed after adding carbon materials into the matrix the presence of carbon prevents silica pore from collapsing especially when applied for water desalination carbon material also has strong covalent bonding 20 which enhances the mechanical strength of the resulting matrix 2 1 soft and hard templating methods the soft templating uses a nano structure formed through intermolecular interactions as a template 43 they do not have permanent rigid structures during the synthesis of nanoparticles certain structural aggregates are formed through molecular or intra molecular hydrogen bonds chemical bonds and static electricity interactions 38 the soft template materials are typically organic surfactants and or copolymer blocks that can interact with metal ions and merge into a liquid crystal phase through the sol gel process pores are obtained after the removal of soft templates via calcination the soft templating method allows easy control of the structure and pore size relative to the hard template method 43 the crucial step in the soft templating is the transition of sol gel precursors in the form of a surfactant copolymer block 44 46 the hard templating method is known as nano casting mostly attractive for synthesis of mesoporous materials nano casting uses a solid mould as the template to which a material or precursor is filled later after the formation of the porous material the main mould is removed 43 for nano casting of m tmo it consists of 3 steps synthesis of mesoporous replica eg silica carbon alumina a metal interphyracy of precursors and decomposition to form materials into crystals and lastly removal of the mould to obtain pores 2 2 synthesis of carbon templating the porous carbon synthesis using a particular template necessitate the feasibility to remove the template without damaging the resulting structure 47 for example in a method illustrate in fig 1 silica and carbon sources are firstly mixed then the mixture is heated to form solid composites in the final phase silica is removed by using the alkaline solvent fig 1 48 synthesis of porous carbon is also applicable to biomass based carbon by applying a specific template into a carbohydrate containing biomass 49 pang li 48 synthesed porous carbon form sucrose with the template of tetra ethyl ortho teos to form porous carbon fig 2 it was done by applying hydrofluoric acid to leach the silica after carbonization step the product was a carbon sheet that has pore diameter of 2 nm fig 2 porous carbon nanoparticles can also be made poly methyl meta acrylates pmma by using silica as the pore former 49 the resulting nanoparticles have pore size of 300 nm fig 3 liu gan 51 synthesized porous carbon from liquid paraffin by using silica as the regulator of carbon porcelain and surfactants to disperse paraffin in water the synthesis process consisted of two main steps formation of carbon silica composite using paraffin carbonization method followed by elimination of carbon silica by using hydrofluoric acid hf or potassium hydroxide koh the illustration of the sythesis process and morphology of the resulting porous carbon are shown in fig 4 brun sakaushi 53 prepared porous carbon from monosaccharides xylose and glucose using hydrothermal methods backed by carbonization and silica derived from the synthesis of the stober method using teos as a template after the composite of carbon and silica was formed the silica was removed using the ammonium hydrogen difuoride the morphologies of the obtained porous carbon are shown in fig 5 which have pore size of 100 nm and 5 8 nm liu yao 54 prepared microporous carbon particles from poly furfuryl alcohol through carbonization in this sythesis method furfuryl polymerization of alcohol was limited from stem shaped by adding silica or slowed by using surfactants the detail of preparation steps and the morphology of the resulting microporous carbon with pores of 260 320 nm are shown in fig 6 porous carbon synthesis can also be done through the hydrothermal method 54 in this method the common carbon sources used are hydrolysed hemicellulose corn cob and glucose and the template for pore formation is silica nanoparticles the morphology of the resulting porous carbon can be seen in fig 7 2 3 mesoporous carbon through mesoporous silica templated 2 3 1 carbon c synthesis of porous carbonaceous materials using silica template had been started since 1980s the porous membranes were developed from a phenol hexamine mixture as the carbon precursor and silica gel as the template the carbon can easily be filled thanks to the spacious structure of silica gel 56 another templates such as mgo have been introduced 57 59 mgo can be removed by using light acid but the homogeneity of the resulting mesoporous is lower than the ones with the silica template silica template is highly recommended for synthesis of very organized mesoporous architecture coupled with an acid treatment for the template removal 60 however the procedure for the template can cause serious environmental problems from the use of the harmful etchants 61 template method is superior to control mcs pore structure mcs with controlled pore structures can be formed by templating mesoporous silica such as mobil crystalline material 48 mcm 48 typically the synthesize of mcs steps involves infiltration of inorganic templates using carbon precursors followed by template removal 62 although this method results in asymmetric membrane it yields an ordered mesoporous carbon omc 60 like the one obtained using mcm 48 as the hard template omc has symmetrical structure and narrow pore size distribution common silica templates for mesoporous carbon fabrication are mcm santa barbara amorphous sba fudan university fdu msu h and hexagonal mesoporous silica hms 60 the pores size of mesoporous silica materials has been listed in table 1 carbon membranes have gained huge interests for desalination 68 and gas separation 69 mcs based membrane has high pore volume and surface area high resistance in rigorous circumstances and is easy to regenerate the pore size of a mc based membrane is affected by the carbon precursors and the treatment method 62 carbon precursors such as thermosetting phenol resin tpr mesophase pitch mp and polyacrylonitrile pan have been introduced for fabrication of mcs mp is attractive to fabricate the porous material with excellent performances due to good graphitizability high carbonization and low organic content 62 tpr offers higher surface area and pore volume of than mp and pan however mp seems more stable during heat treatment 62 the pores of mcs are formed by letting the small molecules of carbon precursors leach out during carbonization and by removal of the nanosized particles the resulting pore properties are also affected by dispersion of the nanosized silica and the thermal stabilities 2 3 2 mobil crystalline material some researchers studied mesoporous silica structure as a template using mcm 48 70 mcm 41 71 72 mcm 50 the mcm 48 is very attractive as template for production of mcs because the precursor can form periodic pores arrangement with three dimensional system homogeneous pores are contained in the mcm 48 molecular sieves 73 mcm 41 is naturally hexagonal mesoporous silica with high surface pore volume with the pores sizes ranging from 20 to 100 å 74 75 mcm 50 has pillared layer or lamellar pores among all mcm 41 has gained the most interest because of its simple structure as shown in fig 8 in particular the porous silica was created using sodium silicate or teos as the silicon source and alkyl ammonium salts as the structure directing agent 74 2 3 3 santa barbara amorphous sba sba 15 as a mesoporous material that has two dimensional 2 d hexagonal p6mm symmetry and a channel type or 3 d mesopore structure it contains the micropores inside the pore walls 77 the pore wall structure of sba 15 is thicker than the mcm 41 78 79 sba 15 can be prepared from teos or sodium silicate 80 81 or sodium silicate derived from oil palm ash 82 it has controllable pore sizes of 5 30 nm range 77 78 with good thermal and hydrothermal stability due to thick pore walls 2 6 nm sba 15 may show variety of morphologies such as rods fibres spheres gyroids doughnut like and discoid like shape depending on fabricate conditions 77 83 84 various methods of sba 15 fabrication have been reported to name a few grafting and impregnation direct synthesis sol gel and immobilization synthetic grafting and impregnation are used to produce covalent attachment of functional groups between organo silane with silanol groups on surface material 85 direct synthesis is a method where the metal source is added directly to the synthesis gel this method results in sba 15 of high specific area and pore volumes but owing to low ph it requires a high amount of the extra aluminium network 86 pore structure size and shape of sba 15 can be properly arranged when employing sol gel synthesis method that works under modest temperature and results in high purity 87 2 3 4 fudan university fdu the 3d pore structures of fdu 12 s are face centred cubic structure with close packing of spherical cages each is connected to 12 nearest neighboring cages 88 it can be fabricated from non ionic triblock copolymer f127 as a template teos as silica precursor with 1 3 5 trimethylbenzene tmb and potassium chloride kcl as additives tmb is used to enhance the volumetric ratio of the hydrophobic core and to turn it hydrophilic which leads the structure changes from a body centred cubic to a face centred cubic 89 fabrication at low temperature 15 c results in highly ordered cubic of fdu 12 silica with pore diameters of 22 27 nm 89 2 3 5 mesostructured msu h the porous framework of msu h is similar to that of sba 15 that consists of ordered large pores connected by micropores 90 these large two dimensional pore channels allow easy penetration of carbon with better pore sizes adjustment compared to the sba 15 or the mcm 41 91 msu h silica can be obtained from sodium silicate under neutral ph in the presence of triblock copolymer 92 omc membrane using sucrose as precursor and msu h as hard template was succesfully fabricated zeng zhao 91 the resulting omc has a large surface area of 1019 m2 g 1 large volume 1 46 cm 3 g 1 and uniform mesoporous structure with pore size distribution with modus at 4 2 nm 2 3 6 hexagonal mesoporous silica hms is a mesoporous silica template with high surface area 93 prepared via soft templating from neutral long chain of n dodecyl amine 94 95 the long range hexagonal structure can be formed from a long chain template there are few advantages of using hms over mcm 458 namely inexpensive structure directing agent primary alkyl amines high silica recovery yield 95 higher than the mcm 48 of 50 fast synthesis 18 h for hms and 4 days for mcm 48 does not involve hydrothermal reaction 96 thicker walls than sba 15 79 and the template is easy to remove hms has also been considerred as a potential template for drug carriers thanks to its volume for drug molecule loadings 97 2 4 mesoporous silica through mesoporous carbon templated owing to excellent chemical mechanical thermal and molecular sieving properties 98 100 the mesoporous silica membranes have been favorably applied for gas and water desalination processes the fabrications of such membranes involve several types of silica precursors such as teos as the most popular 101 tetramethoxysilane tmos methyltrimethoxysilane mtms and methyltriethoxysilane mtes 102 in recent studies ethyl orthosilicate 40 es 40 103 104 was employed to fabricate this membrane es 40 contains about 40 wt sio2 and an average of five si atoms per molecule it is produced by reacting ethanol water and silicon tetrachloride or through partial hydrolysis and condensation processes of teos however unlike teos es40 has lower hydrolysis rate but higher condensation rate 105 the produced silica is stable for up to 250 h of long term performance test 106 however the silica pores collaps easily because the hydrophilic silanol group si oh is reactive with water 107 108 the hydro stability can be enhanced by templating the carbon source into the silica resulting in improved properties of high mechanical strength good electrochemical performance and good thermal and adsorption properties 109 110 2 4 1 pluronic surfactant pluronic has been used as a template during formation of cpm to create ordered porous structure the pluronic concentration and the initial temperature are important aspects of forming a micelle after the micelle formation in acid solution poly ethylene oxide peo blocks in micelle can interact with the framework precursor teos or tmos 111 because of the high acidity of the solution the framework condenses and forms a silica network around the micelle as shown in fig 9 during the synthesis of mesoporous organo silica pmo pmo is formed when nonionic surfactant consisting of peo is added it results in formation of si c bonds through condensation of templated carbon surfactant such as ro 3 si r si or 3 then hydrolysis and cross link occur between the terminal groups of the bridged bis trialoxysilyl organo silanes 112 113 sba 16 can be prepared by employing pluronic f127 to form high quality mesostructured 114 some studies report smaller pore sizes of sba 16 from copolymer blends of p123 and f127 115 or nonionic oligomeric surfactants 116 f127 has critical micelle temperature of 31 c at 0 1 w v at higher concentration of 0 25 w v the cmt is diminished at the 28 c 111 when pluronic 123 p123 as a carbon source is incorporated into silica structures it produces more robust structures demonstrated by high performance of membrane filtration when using the silica p123 than the pure silica 103 it was also found that at low p123 concentrations the carbonized templates uniformly attached onto the silica matrix forming more microporous network higher concentrations of p123 lead to higher hydro stablility 2 4 2 natural carbon sources material to address the challenge of providing renewable resources at low cost it is very important to utilize non food related materials as the carbon sources several studies report the use of pectin extracted from apple 118 and banana peel 119 as the carbon sources to fabricate carbon templated silica the pectin in the silica matrix prevents the silica networks from collapsing toward water the polysaccharides from pectin allow formation mesoporous structure sucrose has also been used as the carbon precursor through hard template method for formation of mcm 120 sucrose is environmentally benign material that contains multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups that form hydrogen bonding with silica oligomers however there are only a few reports of sucrose incorporated into silica via the soft template 3 mesoporous silica materials 3 1 recent techniques fabrication and application 3 1 1 in situ synthesis in the modified in situ synthesis cetyltrimenthylammonium ctab and urea were firstly dissolved in water next cyclohexane ml ipa teos of 2 5 ml 3 mol 2 cyanoethyl triethoxysilane ceteos were added drop wise 121 after stirring for 30 min at room temperature it was heated to 70 c and was allowed to react for 16 h the results obtained were silica fibrous particles or sio2 cn3 by adopting the same method and by employing pure teos it resulted in formation of fi sio2 122 although in situ synthesis produces mesoporous sizes of 10 20 nm on fi sio2 sio2 cn3 or sio2 cn400 addition of n2 during the n2 adsorption desorption analysis increases the absorption and hysteresis h3 at p p 0 95 it suggests that there are a number of macropore gaps related to the sio2 microspheres fibrous morphology 123 124 higher than the f sio2 of 55 nm both 1 sio2 cn3 and f sio2 microspheres have relatively high specific surface area and total pore volume of microspheres 125 126 the specific surface area m2 g 1 sizes of 399 2 for f sio2 252 for sio2 cn3 and 298 for sio2 cn400 and the total pore volumes cm3 g 1 for f sio2 sio2 cn3 sio2 cn400 are 1 14 0 99 and 0 89 respectively based on available data it shows that the in situ method may produce mesoporous silica 3 1 2 the spinning coating thin film synthesis using the spinning coating process has also been reported 127 the fabrication starts from a mixture of naoh cetyltrimethylammonium chloride ctac water and methanol mixture tetramethylorth osilicate mixture of mos and aminopropyltrimethoxysilane and apt ms to form a sol the formed sol is stirred for 12 h at room temperature and is let idle for 8 h to prepare a thin film via the spinning coating processes a template of mesopore free silica particles is dispersed in ethanol by ultrasonication at 2 5 10 w w the dispersion is then coated on a substrate and spun at 500 2000 rpm for 40 s as detailed elsewhere 128 the bet characterization shows that the resulting particles have diameter of 2 6 nm and surface area 499 942 m2 g 1 suggesting that they are mesoporous in structure sem images reveals that there are still some structural defects with variation in the thicknesses due to the presence of agglomerates either in the original dispersion or formed during spinning in order to study the generality of the used spin coating process corresponding films were also prepared using amino functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles under otherwise identical conditions the surface chemical properties of the nanoparticles are found to be important affecting the interactions of the nanoparticles and the biological environment 129 3 1 3 the electrospinning coating mesoporous silica can also be prepared through the electrospinning coating process as reported elsewhere 130 the base materials are teos mixture with h3po4 that drop wise added during stirring mixing then a 10 pva solution is added into the silica sol as additive to ease the spinning next an alumina sol with a molar composition of al no3 3 9h2o alcl3 6h2o al o i pr 3 al h2o of 1 1 2 4 178 is prepared through hydrolysis and condensation reactions under constant stirring at 80 oc an appropriate amount of hno3is then added to the mixture to adjust the reaction rate and control the ph of the final sol from 3 24 to 4 23 then 0 1 g of peo and 6 0 g of p123 are added into 40 ml of as prepared alumina to improve the spinnability of the sol and to direct the pore structure formation respectively the mixture is then stirred for 12 h to form a spinnable sol to fabricate sio2 al2o3 core shell fibrous membrane the sol silica and sol alumina are put into a separated syringes the one for sol silica is connected to a core needle d 0 4 mm while the one for alumina sol is connected to a shell needle with an inner diameter of 1 mm the flows in the needle are set alike at 2 ml h the distance between the spinneret and the aluminium collector is 17 cm and the voltage of 18 kv the spinning is conducted under ambient condition the electrospun xerogel core shell fibrous membranes are collected on the aluminium foil and are further dried at 90 c for 12 h and then are calcined at 700 800 or 900 c for 2 h at a heating rate of 10 c min 1 131 the bet analysis reveals that higher calcination temperature leads to lower specific surface areas 132 with the values of 134 104 and 79 m2 g at 700 800 and 900 oc respectively the ph of the precursor also affects the pore volumes in which the phs of 3 24 3 53 and 4 23 correspond to the pore volumes are 0 387 0 589 and 0 655 cm3 g 1 respectively considering that the high surface area corresponds to a large adsorption capacity the reports 133 select the precursor ph of 4 23 as the most promissing condition to fabricate the shell in the coaxial electrospinning process 3 1 4 extraction from pumice stone mesoporous silica can be fabricated from pumice via extraction the resulting mesoporous silica has a high purity and shows the presence of siloxane and silanol groups however the extraction process takes so many steps and over a very long period the fabrication process starts with dissolving a pumice in 3 m naoh solutions in a three necks flask equipped with a condenser for 24 h at 100 c and a stirring speed of 300 rpm to produce sodium silica the obtained sodium silica is then washed and heated with distilled water silica settles at ph below 10 which is required to form silica gel under acidic condition furthermore the solution is titrated with h2so4 5 m until reaching ph 7 then is let idle for 24 h to allow formation of a white precipitate the precipitate is then filtered and the solid residue is dried at 80 oc for 24 h the residue is then refluxed with 1 m hcl at 110 oc for 3 h to purify silica from other soluble minerals al ca fe and mg the refluxed solution is then filtered and dried at 110 oc the last step is calcination at 800 oc to produce a white silica powder 134 the resulting pumice powder composes of mostly silica confirmed from ftir and chemical analysis main minerals content of clinopyroxene diopside augite or basanite types forsterite and other apatite and haematite in minor quantities 135 138 the pure silica structure is amorphous as demonstrated by strong peak at 2θ of 15 30 ftir peaks analysis show the narrow band centred at wavelength 1039 cm 1 may be attributed to the presence of silica with the highest percentage 139 as also confirmed by chemical analysis the predominant bands at wavelength 1101 cm 1 and the shoulder at 1193 cm 1 are associated with asymmetric stretching vibrations of siloxane si o si the presence of bands at 470 cm 1 and 810 cm 1 is from symmetric siloxane groups si o si the existence of a band at 950 cm 1 is associated with si oh groups from silanol groups with smaller particle sizes 140 the shoulder appeared at 3750 cm 1 indicates the presence of hydrogen bonds from interaction between the silanol groups si oh located at the surface of the nanosilica material 141 bet results show that the pore size of the silica is in range of 2 6 nm indicating of the mesoporous structure with a pore volume of 0 645 that exceeds the size of the nanoparticles of 0 195 cm g 1 with the surface area of 422 m2 g 1 3 2 recent trends on the ordered and the disordered mesoporous silica materials summary of structure and pore size distribution of silica carbon base materials is presented in table 2 it summarizes the main properties of recently developed ordered and disordered mesoporous silica materials discussed in this sub section 3 2 1 teos etoh c6h12o6 h2o ordered mesoporous silica materials is a promising material in the field of technology membrane filtration synthesis of order mesoporous silica have recently been developed by directly assembly of organic or carbon template 149 elma et al reported development of direct acid catalyst for preparation of mesoporous carbon template silica membranes with ordered structure on porous a α alumina support the ordered mesoporous silica membranes made from organocatalytic posed relatively high surface area and pore volume of 354 m² g 1 and 0 215 cm3 g 1 g 1 respectively the citric acid catalyst acts as a carbon source in the silica matrix and increases the hydro stability of silica networks absorption of the n2 curve shows xerogels refluxed at 0 and 50 c are included in type iv h4 142 while elma et al work found surface area and pore size of 475 m² g 1 and 1 94 cm³ g 1 143 3 2 2 teos etoh hno3 h2o nh3 modified the sol gel process is needed to reduce the amount of silanol group reflux temperature can be adjusted to get optimum condition for ordered mesoporous silica the ordered mesoporous silica materials were also preserved during reflux temperature on sol gel process the sol gel was refluxed at 0 and 50 c to achieve the lowest and the highest siloxane concentrations with calcined xerogel at a ph of 6 or 9 xerogel at ph 6 and 9 shows a tendency to form micro and mesoporous materials as adsorption saturation is achieved above 0 65 p p with capillary condensation leads to hysteresis near 0 5 p p the average pore diameter each was measured around 2 6 2 7 nm and showed type iv isotherm curves with hysteresis loops indicating the mesopore structures in other hand silica based materials of ph 7 and 8 had type i isotherms curves without hysteresis indicating of microporous material the bet surface area 420 m2 g 1 and total pore volume 0 18 cm3 g 1 were proportional to the pore size of about 1 8 nm therefore micro porosity was correlated well with high concentrations of silanol groups 143 while silica sol mixed with various variations of cobalt oxide 5 35 w v obtained at ph 6 and produced mesoporous membrane the bet results show that the isotherms of the two samples were type iv ascribing the characteristics of the mesoporous material the greater addition of si co concentration the larger was the surface area volume and pore size this was because the cobalt oxide in xerogel increased the silanol and siloxane groups to enlarge the pores 150 3 2 3 teos tevs etoh hno3 h2o nh3 p123 triethoxyvinylsilane tevs is frequently used to produce microporous silica membranes on interlayer porous substrates 146 it contains vinyl groups as silica ligand pendants the silica methyl ligand pendant group is known to produce high quality microporous silica membranes in order to form mesoporous structures tevs and other silica precursors are combined using teos with the addition of p123 non ligand triblock copolymer as a template then the sol gel synthesis is carried out with a base catalyst which allows its deposition directly to the porous substrate without using interlayers the non ligand surfactant is embedded into the silica matrix followed by carbonization high quality carbon can be prepared using ligand and non ligand templates together with the co polymerization reaction of two different silica precursors where teos does not have a template while tevs has a ligand template based on the vinyl group then the xerogel and silica membrane are calcined under vacuum or n2 atmosphere carbon silica hybrid membranes are represented as cs n2 calcined under n2 and cs vc calcined under vacuum air calcined at 450 c the isotherms of the order p123 template teos tevs is type iv of the mesoporous material the interlayer free carbon silica hybrid membranes were successfully prepared by adding template of pluronic triblock copolymer p123 and vinyl pendant ligands in tevs in synthesis sol gel also contain teos as the second silica precursor both the vacuum calcined and the n2 samples exhibit mesoporous properties with high pore volume but the calcined vacuum samples cs vc produces more carbon structure in the silica matrix resulting in better desalination performance surface area and pore volume of cs n2 membrane are 754 m² g 1 and 0 546 cm³ g 1 while cs vc membrane are 761 m² g 1 and 0 615 cm³ g 1 the cs vc membrane produces water flux much higher than previously reported for processing saltwater the combine method of organo silica hybrid with polymer template and vacuum calcination produces mesoporous silica membrane carbonization very well for the separation of water from hydrated salt ions and exhibits high water flux especially for processing brine salt solutions 148 3 2 4 teos tevs etoh hno3 h2o nh3 k2s2o8 hybrid silica membranes can be prepared by mixing teos and tevs using k2s2o8 kps as an initiator elma wang 146 the kps provides radical polymerization to create cc bonds as a secondary network and then to produce more space in the silica network the radical polymerization formed by kps affects the growth of oriented particles in order to avoid decomposition of cc groups in the silica matrices the calcination process is held up to 350 c densification is then formed when the ratio of tevs is greater than teos composition the tevs teos molar ratio is 10 90 and produces micro porosity pure tevs is not suitable to produce amorphous silica material because the functional groups formed were found blocked inside the pores as such the xerogel hybrids containing tevs become microporous the isotherms found the saturation process at very low relative pressures p p 0 05 it is due to the mixing between tevs and teos is greatly reduced and this trend continues as a function of tevs 146 3 2 5 teos etoh nh3 h2o ctab cetyltrimethylammonium bromide mesoporous silica carbon template materials have been explored and developed very fast to competes in desalination application carbon template is one of effective strategy to stabilized the silanol group of silica membrane recently ashrafi shahria ravaria 147 used ctab surfactants as template to embedded into silica silica precursors were synthesized at 550 c to remove cationic templates from ctab required to form the mesoporous structures order mesoporous silica ms nanoparticles were synthesized and then functioned by eriochrome black t ecbt as a corrosion inhibitor composite coating systems a combination between ti zr conversion layers and organic inorganic hybrid sol gel were applied instead of simple sol gel films to provide better corrosion protection and adhesive strength nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms were plotted with bjh plots from ms nanoparticles before and after loading of the inhibitors the n2 physisorption data showed that the surface area and pore volume of ms were 925 1 m² g 1 and 02 025 cm³ g 1 while the surface area and pore volume of ms ecbt were 103 1 m² g 1 and 0 0561 cm³ g 1 it is clear that the specific surface area of ms nanoparticles is greatly decreased by the final functionalization process due to the addition of ecbt molecules in the mesoporous space in addition the pore volume of ms nanoparticles is greatly decreased by loading of inhibitors however the pore diameter of ms nanoparticles did not change significantly after the loading inhibitor because the structure of nanoparticles could not be affected by the functionalization process 147 this is also similar to that studyexplained by vazquez gonzalez 151 in which surfactants play an important effect in changing the morphology of particles but it cannot change pore size and pore diameter 3 2 6 teos etoh ni no3 2 6h2o h2o2 h2o the ordered of nickel oxide sol are synthesized by hydrolysis and condensation of teos in ethanol with and without 30 h2o2 water and nickel nitrate hexahydrate ni no3 2 6h2o the tendency of the silanol siloxane ratio clearly showed that the role of h2o2 was favoured by the formation of silanol groups and slightly inhibited the condensation reaction the presence of h2o2 acidified the the sol gel process by the presence of nitric acid which promoted the formation of silanol groups and microporous materials nitrogen adsorption isotherm of ordered xerogel doped with nickel by addition of h2o2 produced a type i isotherm curves ascribed by very strong initial adsorption at very low partial pressures p p 0 2 followed by saturation ascribing the characteristic of type i micropores whereas nickel doped xerogels without h2o2 formed mesopores with higher adsorption saturation capacities above 0 4 p p and hysteresis with subtle inflection indicating the type iv isotherms surface area for ordered mesoporous nickel oxide with 10 h2o2 was affected by the ni si molar ratio the average pore diameter with h2o2 remained constant at 2 1 0 05 nm addition of nickel oxide to silica gel matrix with h2o2 could maintain the micro porosity of amorphous silica xerogel whereas samples without h2o2 produced meso porosity that increased significantly as a function of ni content as the average pore size increased while the bet surface area decreased for a ni si ratio of 25 50 this effect had also been observed for cobalt silica oxide and increased meso porosity is associated with cobalt oxide agglomeration perhaps the same effect also occurs on increasing the shaft as a function of the ni si molar ratio in this work 52 4 the application of carbon templated mesoporous silica materials carbon templated mesoporous silica membranes are excellent material for pervaporation a process to separate liquid mixtures by vaporization and selective permeation and through a membrane 152 it uses molecular sieve type of membranes that permits only passage to water molecules under driving force of a water vapor pressure difference 10 highly permeable and selective membranes can be prepared via sol gel method that offers great advantages in the control of pore sizes 10 143 152 153 recent advances in the preparation of carbon template mesoporous silica membranes have opened avenue to substantially improve pervaporation performance with respect to flux selectivity and stability conscientious adjusting of carbon silica template mesoporous structures makes it possible to design membranes as coveted of respective separation applications carbon template silica membranes have also widely been applied for gas separation particularly the ones with microporous structures 154 157 microporous molecular sieve carbon silica base membranes can also offer the considerable advantages in comparison to the zeolite the polymeric or the carbon based membranes 157 whereas membrane materials with mesoporous structure are more appropriate for water desalination 143 158 159 the carbon templated molecular sieve mesoporous silica materials are gaining popularity for desalination which is detailed in the following section 4 1 hydro stability of silica carbon templated and current strategies for water desalination desalination via pervaporation is promising to produce fresh water from non potable saline sources it offers advantages of a high salt rejection and the capability of treating a high salinity solution novel mesoporous silica base membranes for desalination have recently been developed because of the affinity of amorphous silica for water adsorption pure silica derived membranes suffer from structural degradation when in contact with water leading to a loss of selectivity hydro stability is therefore a severe problem which prompts the recent studies on altering the surface properties of the silica to lessen the interaction of water molecules with the membrane structure one strategy to address hydro stability problems is by introducing a non covalently bonded organic templates into the pure silica matrix 12 157 160 the existence of carbon moieties embedded into the silica framework can inhibit the mobility of soluble silica groups under hydrolytic attack and consequently hinders micropore from collapsing 10 154 the carbon templates and silanol groups si ohs interact weakly via the electrostatic interaction to form a peculiar structure derived from a hydrophobic core and hydrophilic exterior properties 161 the carbon templates obstruct the micropore spaces to forbid the mobility and degradation of the silanol groups for the first time raman and brinker 160 demonstrated a break through organic templating approach to fabricate the molecular sieving organo silica membranes it results in high flux and selectivity membrane for gas separation the hydrophobic carbon template improves the hydrothermal stability of the silica membranes in similar research done by duke da costa 154 report carbonized template molecular sieve silica ctmss as new material for wet gas separation the c6 surfactant hexyl trimethyl ammonium bromide is embedded into ctmss as carbon template to achieve a great hydro stability via hydrophobic surface functionalization the mechanism of carbon templates in imposing hydro stabilization toward exposure to water is illustrated in fig 10 both mesoporous silica and template carbon materials alter the surface chemistry to limit water in breaking the siloxane groups hydrolysis and allowing for dissociative chemisorption as detailed elsewhere 162 normally the rehydration on the silica surface is done by a physisorption of water to form a hydroxyl group followed by a chemisorption with the nearby siloxane groups as more silanol groups are formed more sites become available for h2o sorption and a chain reaction of siloxane breakage occurs across the surface the mobility of silica groups then becomes localized in the higher attraction energy regions in the smaller pores where thermal condition above 180 c causes a subsequent cross pore condensation leading to their closure fig 10 demonstrates how the carbon moieties templated into silica matrices prevent the mobility of silica groups under hydrolytic attack and inhibits micropore cave in the entrapment of carbon moieties in the carbon template silica matrix is facilitated by carbonization of the templates under vacuum or an inert atmosphere leading to a hybrid silica carbon membrane carbon template membranes thus offers a great potential for achieving hydro stability without compromising the selectivity 162 the carbon silica template membranes have also been tested for desalination of saline water nacl 3 5 wt demonstrating high salt rejection 163 carbon templated mesoporous silica materials have a pore size of 0 3 10 nm and thus are very suitable for desalination applications 145 158 163 165 wijaya duke 166 reported the investigation of carbon chain length of ionic surfactants effect toward ctmss membranes for desalination by preparing sol gels with c6 c12 and c16 the ctmss membrane fabricated with the longest carbon chain c16 surfactant delivered the highest salt rejection whilst also given the largest pore volume and surface area interestingly the average pore sizes of the membranes were identical for the three surfactants used ladewig tan 165 investigated the potential of a polyethylene glycol polypropylene glycol polyethylene glycol peg ppg peg as the template non ionic surfactant the enhanced carbon content up to10 increased the pore volume and the specific surface area consequently the membrane demonstrated a slightly higher flux of 3 7 kg m 2 h 1 and 985 of salt rejection at room temperature compared to the surfactant template membranes mentioned above that is 2 2 and 3 kg m 2 h 1 respectively the embedded carbon has a beneficial role in silica matrices and the amount embedded has a direct impact to performance of the carbon silica template 4 1 1 effect of operation condition on performance of carbon template silica membranes table 3 summarizes the reports on carbon template silica performance in terms of water flux and salt rejection performance of membrane in pervaporation is affected by the testing conditions such as feed temperature feed salt concentration and permeate vapor pressure to achieve optimum performance it is necessary to study the effect of testing parameters on water flux and salt rejection a change of feed concentration directly affects sorption at the liquid membrane interface 161 since diffusion in the membrane is concentration dependent the water flux generally decreases with increasing salt concentration in the feed 10 145 mass transfer in the liquid feed side may be limited by the extent of concentration polarization in general when the feed flow rate increases water flux also increases due to a reduction of transport resistance in the liquid boundary layer and reduction of the concentration polarization the feed temperature exponentially increases the water flux it is because when feed temperature increases the vapor pressure on the feed side increases exponentially while the vapor pressure on the permeate side remains constant the raising of vapor pressure leads to an increase in the driving force of the water vapor transport thus improving the water flux the diffusion coefficient of water vapor increases by four times as the feed temperature is raised from 20 to 65 c 153 moreover high temperature increases the frequency and amplitude of thermal motions of the polymer chains which can bring about the free channels of polymer promoting the water vapor transport the carbon templated silica membranes have been widely reported and developed for water desalination application 17 19 99 109 144 146 159 163 164 166 170 pervaporation using inorganic membranes based on mesoporous silica offers high salt rejection but rather low in water fluxes especially for saline solution nacl 3 5 wt these low performances diminish the chance of the pervaporation using inorganic membranes to compete against the reverse osmosis ro processes it is however worth noting that the results are dependent upon many parameters related to testing condition including the feed concentration the feed temperature the permeate vapor pressure and the fouling scaling tendencies in addition the listed membranes on table 3 may have different geometries flat hollow fibre or tubular and sizes and architecture thickness of top layer number interlayers or top layer porosity and substrate as such all these factors play a role in the final performances duke o brien abraham 171 reported that a mtes membrane with pore diameter of 0 5 nm exhibits a higher water flux than carbonized template molecular sieve silica ctmss membrane with pore diameters of 0 3 nm but with lower salt rejection the comparison of three kinds of inorganic membranes alumina mtes and ctmss for desalination by pervaporation have also been reported among them ctmss displayed the best performance with a flux of 2 2 kg m 2 h 1 a rejection 99 9 and long term testing at 25 c was stable for 5 h the findings suggest that the incorporation of carbon in a silica matrix plays a role in increasing salt rejection as well as matrix stabilization wijaya duke 166 reported a cts membrane derived from long carbon chain surfactant c16 showed high salt rejection of up to 97 with a flux of 3 kg m 2 h 1 carbon chain length of surfactants templates is a crucial factor that give direct impact in terms of desalination performance the amount of embedded carbon has a beneficial role in silica matrices and is directly related to the number of residual carbons after the carbonization however if the surfactants concentration is too high it forms micelles which block the possibility of using the sol gel to coat the substrates ladewig tan 165 to use the tri block copolymer polyethylene glycol polypropylene glycol polyethylene glycol peg ppg peg as the template the surfactant templates tend to form micelles at high concentrations and precipitate if in excess of 3 wt in the silica sol gel when the carbon content increased to 10 there was a rise in porosity despite still remained microporous consequently the membrane demonstrated a slightly higher flux of 3 7 kg m 2 h 1 and 985 of salt rejection for system operating at room temperature further increases of the tri block copolymer to 20 wt altered the structure becomes mesopores the performance is slightly higher than the surfactant template membranes 2 2 and 3 kg m 2 h 1 mentioned earlier mesopore ctab silica membranes exhibited an excellent salt rejection 99 and water flux2 6 kg m 2 h 1 in seawater desalination at 25 c however when it is exposed to high feed temperature 40 c the barrier layer of the mesostructured formed by a weak electrostatic interaction between ctab and silica may suffer a disturbance leading to a release of nacl molecules to the permeate side and thus drastically decreases the salt rejection this effect of temperature was reversible the rejection came back to normal when reversed to lower feed temperature 172 recently p123 carbon template silica prepared by the ctp technique by elma wang 13 were successfully fabricated using the dual catalyst sol gel method embedded p123 loading from 0 50 wt into silica sol exhibited salt rejection of 99 the water fluxes varied depending on the loading of p123 in the silica sol the feed temperature and the salt concentration in the feed the water flux of the silica p123 membranes varied between 0 5 4 5 kg m 2 h 1 p123 5 wt 0 9 5 5 kg m 2 h 1 p123 20 wt 1 4 6 3 kg m 2 h 1 p123 35 wt and 1 5 8 5 kg m 2 h 1 p123 50 wt the major finding here was that the effect of salt concentration polarization was greatly reduced as the concentration of p123 in the silica matrix increased from 5 to 50 wt hence high carbon content conferred salt concentration anti polarization to the membrane surface as compared to the high silica content glucose template silica membranes were investigated by mujiyanti elma 19 for brine water desalination the c h stretching vibration showed from ftir results indicating carbon from glucose successfully induced into the silica matrices silica glucose membrane showed good performance with salt rejection of 93 but rather low water flux of 0 22 2 28 kg m 2 h 1 under feed temperatures of 25 40 and 60 c this work concluded that the addiction of glucose as carbon template agents strengthen the silica network becomes stronger even though the water fluxes remains a bit lower elma pratiwi 17 produced potable water from nacl 3 5 wt solution they found that the pectin template silica membranes gave similar water fluxes of 5 9 8 66 kg m 2 h 1 25 60 c with salt rejections of 99 3 depending on the testing conditions and amount of pectin loading 2 5 wt calcined at 300 c the membranes work well thanks to the presence of carbon chains from the pectin apple which strengthened silica membrane pore structure syauqiyah elma 109 reported silica p123 membrane for seawater desalination prepared under different calcined technique of rtp the rtp technique offered faster fabrication time with competitive performance against the ctp technique this work reported comparing performance of silica pectin and silica p123 membranes by measuring water flux and salt rejection silica pectin membrane displayed prominent water flux of 3 folds higher than the silica p123 it is suggested that the number of carbon chains of p123 joined to silica matrices densified the membranes film liang zhan 173 prepared go graphene oxide films coated on polyacrylonitrile pan by vacuum filtration method as the new intriguing material go has ultra thin two dimensional structure with abundant functional groups such as epoxide carbonyl on the surface the resulting membrane displayed outstanding water permeability of up to 65 kg m 2 h 1 and salt rejection of 99 8 for desalination nacl 3 5 wt via pervaporation at 90 c go based membranes have the potentials to become the preferred candidates to next generation high performing membranes however fabrication method of go membranes is rather complex and the go membranes tend to quickly swell when immersed in water on a large recent results show that pervaporation using inorganic membranes have undergone major improvement as water fluxes are now reaching values as high as 65 kg m 2 h 1 for feed of nacl 3 5 wt these results clearly show that pervaporation using inorganic membranes has closed the performance gap with the pervaporation using organic polymer based membrane with performances now in the same range as commercial ro membranes 4 1 2 desalination of wetland saline water by carbon template silica membranes desalination of wetland saline water is an interesting application for pervaporation by carbon template silica membranes reports on desalination of wetland saline water by pervaporation using carbon silica template membrane are listed on table 4 wetland saline water is abundant in indonesia especially in south kalimantan generally wetland saline water has unique characteristics such as low ph brownish colour and consists of high natural organic matter nom 99 that typically increases membrane vulnerability from fouling even more sea water infiltrates into wetland aquifers during the rainy season and increase the salinity of the wetland water in many wetland areas wetland water is often seen as the only water resource but its utilization is highly limited by the salt concentration and nom contents elma fitriani 169 reported the application of mesopore carbonized template silica membrane by employing p123 triblock copolymers calcinated at different temperatures 350 600 c for desalination of wetland saline water the silica p123 membranes showed good water flux and salt rejection the water flux of silica p123 increased from 1 3 to 1 7 kg m 2 h 1 by raising the calcination temperatures from 300 to 600 c in the contrary the salt rejection decreased sharply from 96 to 66 such behaviours are attributed to the carbon moieties tight at low temperature in arranging the silica pore structure leading to the reduction of water fluxes therefore silica p123 membranes calcined at high temperature having loose indeed the membrane structure become unstable and force the selectivity decreases in another study elma hairullah 168 pure silica membrane was proved effective to reduce the salt concentration of wetland saline water feed via pervaporation process the highest water flux obtained at feed temperature of 60 c was1 2 kg m 2 h 1 unfortunately the salt rejection was still poor only 69 at the highest feed temperature a phenomena equivocal with the one discussed earlier interestingly another study lestari elma 99 also reported organosilica membrane with similar water flux of 1 2 kg m 2 h 1 at lower feed temperature 25 c coupled with high salt rejection over 99 fig 11 the organosilica membranes was prepared by employing citric acid with dual roles as the carbon sources and catalyst such membrane poses advantages such as inexpensive easy to fabricate and fast in production the pure mesoporous silica has slightly lower performance than other carbon mesopore template silica membranes overall it can be deduced that carbon template effective and yet affordable material for preparation of silica based membranes for wetland saline water desalination silica pectin membrane showed excellent water fluxes of 2 3 folds higher than various silica based membranes applied for wetland saline water desalination fig 11 rahma elma 174 investigated pectin templated silica membrane and claimed that it achieved almost complete salt rejection of 99 the nom content was effectively reduced by incorporating a coagulation process as the pre treatment the highest nom uv254 rejection was over 90 174 mechanism of pervaporation process for wetland saline water using carbon silica template membrane is shown in fig 12 selectively of pure silica membranes are greatly reduced as the mobility of the silica enlarge the pore in the silica film facilitating salt diffusion water molecules react with the hydrophilic silanol groups because the silica matrix becomes mobile the carbon template provides a barrier in the silica matrix that blocks the mobility of silica fig 12 in this application carbon can be attributed as a strong agent that switches the weakly silanol groups to avoid shrinkage of the silica matrices at higher temperature carbon silica template materials are needed 4 1 3 long term stability of carbon template silica membranes the stability of pervaporation process is judged by the ability to maintain the performance over time flux decline can happen due to hydration of the ions in solution and on the pore mouths which blocks the entry of water molecules therefore during long time testing the membrane fouling becomes critical due to the tendency of salt deposition that block the membrane pores deposition of salt shrinks the pore structure that block the transport of water which lowers the flux 143 153 fig 13 summarizes the stability performance of various membranes types for desalination application regarding the long term testing of pure silica membrane inorganic based material an excellent result was reported by elma yacou 143 for desalination of feed solution of 3 5 wt of nacl it was observed that pure silica membranes have stable long term performances for 250 h at feed temperature of 22 c the first part of the operation of 150 h showed water fluxes 8 5 kg m 2 h 1 and the 250 h test yielded the water fluxes of 6 7 kg m 2 h 1 the salt rejections were maintained high of 98 however elma yacou 143 also reported that water flux slightly reduced attributed to micropore blocking by hydrated salt ions due to the pure silica matrices cave during the submergence in water despite the importance of performance stability only a few reports are available table 5 in the longest performance evaluation reported so far lin ding 175 demonstrated cobalt oxide silica membranes cooxsi est with multiples salt solutions i e 1 288 h 3 5 wt 144 h 7 5 wt 72 h and 15 wt 72 h totalling of 570 h water flux of the cooxsi membrane tended to stabilize after 5 days ascribed to initial structural changes in the cooxsi matrices the long term testing successfully demonstrated the improved hydro stability of cooxsi membranes at various feed concentrations in the several other studies ctmss c6 membranes showed stable performance over 5 h wijaya duke 166 and over 12 h 165 due to the benefit of the carbonized templating method to improve the hydro stability of the silica membranes the report of long term stability study of carbon templated mesoporous silica membranes is still limited zwijnenberg koops 176 demonstrated the longest stability performance of non porous polyether amide membranes using solar driven pervaporation the test was carried out using three different feed de oiled formation water untreated seawater and artificial seawater 3 5 wt nacl the water flux remained stable over 250 day in the beginning of the experiment a slightly lower flux was observed due to the hold up volume on the permeate side of the system however water flux reached a steady state after 10 days tests the occurrence of membrane fouling was not obvious over the experiment duration the decrease in water flux due to fouling also reduced the heat loss via evaporation this automatically resulted in an increase in the feed temperature consequently the increased feed temperature enhanced the evaporation rate to about the same level that occurred as that without fouling 4 2 future challenges carbon template silica based membranes for desalination application are still at the premature stages of research and development therefore this type of material requires significant enhancements to be able to compete against both established membranes and or established technologies indeed the ro process using polymeric based membranes is now the golden standard as a result of major research development and deployment in the last 30 years silica based membranes have shown potential in providing excellent molecular sieving properties for gas separation applications but less so in water desalination it is primarily due to the shortage of hydro stability of silica structures when contact with water the final challenge for the membrane researchers is to establish the carbon materials which are favourable most technically and economically viable applied for water desalination using silica based membranes go and polyetherimide materials have been reported to be effective carbon template into silica matrices in wetland saline water desalination improvement is required to have membrane material that can handle the presence of nom in the feed application of mesoporous carbon template silica membranes by pervaporation is also restricted by the high energy input in comparison to the ro analysis of the thermodynamics also indicates that parity will never be reached when utilizing primary energy sources however if the pervaporation process is successfully integrated with solar heat sources waste heat or other sustainable energy source then the technology may be attractive for niche applications such as brine processing or salt recovery currently there is limited study on membrane fouling for the silica carbon based membranes mainly due to the immature stages of the testing most studies still utilize laboratory scale using artificial saltwater as the feed similarly for fouling study of wetland saline water desalination given the scale of the problem for ro membranes this is a problem that will require substantial research in the future to ensure that mesoporous carbon template silica membranes can be deployed in an industrial context 5 conclusions many approaches have been developed to prepare carbon templated mesoporous silica hard templating methods have often been applied in which the incorporated carbon sources are deposited through mesoporous silica however this method is costly involves toxic substances and complicated which limit its application soft templating is favourable strategies to tailor well defined mesoporous structure sustainable carbon sources material as templating agents are very attractive technically and economically sucrose has been explored as carbon templates because it is an environmentally friendly product and contains multiple adjacent hydroxyl groups which will make the formation of hydrogen bonding with silica oligomers possible in addition go and polyetherimide material can also be considered as effective carbon templating into silica matrices due to their excellent properties application of carbon templated mesoporous silica membranes is promising for water desalination future challenges for desalination of wetland saline water are on improve membrane performances high flux and salt rejection as well as handle nom content to tackle the energy input issue application of mesoporous carbon template silica membranes by pervaporation systems can be coupled with renewable energy such as solar heat sources waste heat or others as such it can be competitive against ro for niche applications such as brine processing or salt recovery declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements
