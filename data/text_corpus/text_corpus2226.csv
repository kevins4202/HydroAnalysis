11130,the presence of clay particles increases the specific surface area of a soil and can affect the calibration of electromagnetic soil water sensors including reflectometers to quantify and correct for this effect in two relatively new reflectometers three tdr315 and three cs655 sensors were installed in each of five soils with clay content ranging from 5 to 49 as the soils were dried in a temperature controlled room sensor reported soil volumetric water content θv according to the factory calibration was compared against reference θv determined by weighing the soils sensor reported θv was similar to reference θv in the sand soil root mean square difference rmsd 0 02 m3 m 3 but the discrepancy was larger for the clayey soils an increase in clay content tended to cause tdr315 to underestimate low θv and tended to cause cs655 to overestimate θv in a concave down pattern at the levels evaluated in this experiment differences in clay content produced a larger effect than differences in temperature 24 versus 35 c and salinity 0 versus 3 09 g l cacl2 on factory calibration accuracy of both sensors soil specific empirical calibrations developed using a square root mixing model fitted the experimental data very closely r2 0 93 for both sensors by estimating calibration coefficients based on clay content alone to recalculate sensor θv from sensor reported apparent relative permittivity rmsd from reference θv was reduced by approximately 36 for both sensors as compared with using the factory calibration applying the same procedure to independent literature data tended to improve θv accuracy of both sensors increasingly as clay content increased above 20 the findings suggest that a simple user friendly correction for clay content effects may provide initial practical improvement over the factory calibration of a reflectometer in clayey soils keywords calibration clay cs655 nebraska sensor tdr315 1 introduction accurate and continuous determination of soil water status is vital in many agricultural and hydrologic studies and can assist in making optimal irrigation management decisions for example monitoring of soil volumetric water content θv can be used to trigger irrigation when soil water is depleted to a defined threshold based on crop and soil type electromagnetic em sensors are widely used to monitor θv due to ease of installation rarity of regulatory and safety concerns cost effectiveness and convenience of frequent measurement in addition some em sensors have the capability to measure additional soil properties such as temperature and apparent electrical conductivity eca thus broadening the applicability of these sensors in both research and practice electromagnetic soil water sensors estimate θv by taking advantage of the high apparent relative permittivity εra of water in comparison to that of other soil constituents however soil εra can be influenced by other factors such as temperature salinity textural composition organic matter content omc and bulk density ρb paige and keefer 2008 these factors might not be properly accounted for in the factory calibration of em sensors some studies have proposed to correct for non water influences on εra by developing soil specific calibrations this approach requires capturing the response of em sensors over a large θv range in the field chávez and evett 2012 kisekka et al 2014 michel et al 2015 rudnick et al 2015 singh et al 2018 or in the laboratory adeyemi et al 2016 caldwell et al 2018 kargas and soulis 2019 although soil specific calibrations have enabled the confident use of em sensors at research sites this approach might be infeasible for supporting wide adoption of em sensors other studies have proposed to correct for non water influences on εra by developing one general calibration with built in adjustments for such influences this approach can be followed using empirical functions or physically based dielectric mixing models dirksen and dasberg 1993 or and wraith 1999 schwartz et al 2009 jacobsen and schjønning 1993 found that adding linear terms of ρb omc and clay content to the calibration equation produced a statistically significant improvement in the accuracy of θv determined by time domain reflectometry tdr across 189 soil samples besides corrections for stable properties such as clay content corrections for transient properties such as temperature western and seyfried 2005 and eca kelleners et al 2009 could also be included if non water influences on εra can be predicted well from easily measurable soil properties then this approach may be feasible for supporting wide adoption of em sensors for example rüdiger et al 2010 substantially improved θv accuracy of cs616 sensors by using textural composition data to estimate the coefficients in empirical equations for temperature correction and soil moisture calibration instead of applying the factory calibration specific objectives of this research were 1 to evaluate how differences in clay content temperature and salinity affect factory calibration accuracy of two relatively new reflectometers and 2 to develop for each of the two reflectometers a general non soil specific calibration equation that adjusts its coefficients based on clay content alone readers should note that this study does not attempt to characterize fully these two specific reflectometers or to advance reflectometer physics in general instead this study provides a preliminary idea of the factory calibration accuracy of two reflectometers under a variety of soil conditions and also a simple user friendly way to improve upon the factory calibration of two reflectometers across soils using an easily measurable property such outputs may not add significantly to the scientific understanding of reflectometers but may be extremely valuable to the practical use of reflectometers 2 materials and methods 2 1 soils a laboratory study was conducted to analyze the performance of two recently developed em sensors in five nebraska soils soil was collected from particular depths at five sites across the state of nebraska usa specifically to capture a wide range in clay content fig 1 shows the geographical distribution of these five sites and the corresponding soil associations the collection sites were occurrences of the valent mixed mesic ustic torripsamments cozad coarse silty mixed superactive mesic typic haplustolls kuma fine silty mixed superactive mesic pachic argiustolls hastings fine smectitic mesic udic argiustolls and wymore fine smectitic mesic aquertic argiudolls soil series the location depth and corresponding properties of each soil collection are presented in table 1 textural composition was measured using the hydrometer method by ward laboratories kearney ne usa according to the natural resources conservation service nrcs classification system the mean standard deviation in clay content among the collected soils ranged from 5 1 for the valent soil to 49 4 for the wymore soil table 1 the corresponding textural classes were sand sandy clay loam clay loam silty clay and silty clay for the valent cozad kuma hastings and wymore soils respectively according to the nrcs classification system given the depths and soil series from which the soils were collected typical cation exchange capacity at ph 7 would be 0 016 0 170 0 212 0 279 and 0 288 mmol g for the valent cozad kuma hastings and wymore soils respectively according to nrcs laboratory data california soil resource lab 2019 organic matter content was measured using the loss on ignition method by ward laboratories 2 2 reflectometers two recently developed reflectometers that are becoming more widely used were chosen for this study one of the two sensor types investigated was tdr315 tdr315 l acclima meridian id usa acclima 2017 time domain reflectometers both tdr315 and tdr315 l are configured with three parallel rods 15 cm length by 3 2 mm diameter serving as the waveguide the sensor head for tdr315 has all necessary electronics and firmware to generate an em pulse and to analyze the reflected waveform for determining the two way travel time of the em pulse which is used to compute εra tdr315 l has similar electronics firmware and functionality as tdr315 however tdr315 l consumes less power and is not capable of exporting waveforms for both tdr315 and tdr315 l θv is calculated from εra using a proprietary dielectric mixing model both tdr315 and tdr315 l also use thermistors for determining temperature and use the giese and tiemann method for determining eca for this study tdr315 and tdr315 l were considered to be equivalent schwartz et al 2016 observed that tdr315 can perform similarly to or better than conventional tdr specifically tdr315 and conventional tdr reported nearly indistinguishable εra values at the same known θv value but tdr315 was less sensitive than conventional tdr to the interference of salinity because tdr315 does not use long coaxial cables that can degrade high frequency signals the other sensor type investigated in this study was cs655 campbell scientific logan ut usa campbell scientific 2017 water content reflectometers wcr the cs655 is equipped with two parallel rods 12 cm length by 3 2 mm diameter forming an open ended transmission line the cs655 determines 1 temperature by measuring thermistor resistance 2 eca by measuring the voltage ratio between a known excitation voltage and the measured attenuated voltage and 3 period average by measuring the number of times per second that the reflection of the previous generated em pulse returns to the sensor head to trigger the next generated em pulse the εra is calculated from period average using a factory calibrated empirical model that includes adjustments based on eca campbell scientific personal communication 2017 caldwell et al 2018 and then εra is used to determine θv using the topp equation topp et al 1980 eq 1 1 θv 4 3 10 6 εra 3 5 5 10 4 εra 2 2 92 10 2 εra 5 3 10 2 2 3 experiment for each of the five collected soils with varying clay content three vertical soil columns were constructed each in a separate polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe section 0 223 m length by 0 255 m internal diameter landscape fabric and window screen were secured to the bottom end of each pipe section to serve as a water permeable but soil impermeable support the collected soils were oven dried at 105 c ground passed through a 2 mm sieve and oven dried at 105 c again a metallic plate slightly smaller than the pipe internal diameter was attached to a hydraulic press and was used to pack the loose dry soil in five layers to the target ρb table 1 with a total height of 0 176 m then one tdr315 l or tdr315 for three cozad columns and one kuma column sensor and one cs655 sensor were inserted downward into each soil column until the bottom of the sensor head was flush with the top of the column the dimensions of the soil columns and the placement of the two sensors were carefully designed so that the sensing volume of each sensor extended almost the full height of the column remained entirely within the column and did not include the hardware of the other sensor in the column for simplicity tdr315 and tdr315 l will be jointly referred to as tdr315 from here forward the soil columns were subjected to multiple saturation drying cycles inside a temperature controlled room to study the θv measurement accuracy of tdr315 and cs655 in soils with varying clay content for every cycle soil columns were wetted from the bottom up and then were allowed to drain briefly before the bottom was sealed with plastic film in the saturation drying cycle with constant temperature and no added salinity room temperature was maintained at 35 c and saturation was performed using municipal tap water with electrical conductivity ec of 0 7 ds m 1 ward laboratories kearney ne usa in the saturation drying cycle with two temperatures and no added salinity room temperature alternated weekly between 35 and 24 c i e one week at 35 c one week at 24 c and repeat and saturation was performed using municipal tap water in the saturation drying cycle with constant temperature and added salinity room temperature was maintained at 35 c but saturation was performed using a solution prepared by adding 3 09 g l 1 cacl2 ec 5 0 ds m 1 rumble 2018 to municipal tap water throughout each drying cycle the output of the tdr315 and cs655 sensors were collected and recorded by a cr1000 campbell scientific logan ut datalogger every three minutes each soil column was weighed using a bss 250 s beam load cell connected to a ti 500rf ss digital display transcell technology buffalo grove il the frequency of weighing ranged from twice a day to once every two or three days generally decreasing as the evaporation rate of the soil columns decreased to obtain θv at the end of the entire experiment the soil of each column was extracted and oven dried at 105 c whereas each now empty soil column setup which included its two sensors was weighed in the same way as when it contained the soil column 2 4 analysis to assess the θv measurement accuracy of tdr315 and cs655 in the five soils with varying clay content sensor θv output was compared against reference θv determined from soil column weight reference θv of each column at each weighing time was calculated using eq 2 and was matched with θv reported by its two sensors at the closest timestamp 2 r e f e r e n c e θ v w t o t a l w s o i l w s e t u p ρ w v s o i l where wtotal is the total weight of the soil column wsoil is the weight of the dry soil in the column wsetup is the weight of the empty soil column setup ρw is the density of water 1 0 g cm 3 and vsoil is the volume of the soil in the column root mean square difference rmsd eq 3 was calculated for each sensor in each soil over each drying cycle to indicate the absolute magnitude of differences between sensor θv and reference θv while penalizing larger differences 3 r m s d t n i m s i t r i t 2 m n where i is the index of the soil column m is the number of soil columns per soil t is the index of the weighing time n is the number of weighing times during the drying cycle si t is the sensor θv of the ith soil column at the tth weighing time and ri t is the reference θv of the ith soil column at the tth weighing time the effect of clay content and the potential interference of temperature and salinity on θv measurement accuracy of tdr315 and cs655 in the five soils were evaluated to examine the effect of clay content under isothermal and non saline conditions the 33 weighing times from the drying cycle with constant temperature and no added salinity were analyzed to examine the potential interference of temperature the eight end of week weighing times from the drying cycle with two alternating weekly temperatures and no added salinity were analyzed to examine the potential interference of salinity the 33 weighing times from the drying cycle with constant temperature and no added salinity as well as the 40 weighing times from the drying cycle with constant temperature and added salinity were analyzed in each of these analyses the square root mixing model eq 4 was fitted to the reference θv versus sensor εra data from the soil columns then analysis of variance anova with a significance level α 0 05 was conducted using statistical computing language r version 3 5 1 r foundation for statistical computing wein austria this procedure explored whether within the ranges of clay content temperature and salinity evaluated in this experiment θv calibrations are statistically distinguishable when fitted separately to different levels of a non water variable as when fitted jointly to all levels 4 θ v a ε r a b a general correction for clay content effects was proposed for θv measurements by tdr315 and a general correction for clay content effects was proposed for θv measurements by cs655 the basis of each correction was the 15 column specific square root mixing model calibration equations eq 4 relating sensor εra to reference θv during the drying cycle with constant temperature and no added salinity then a set of polynomial regression interpolation equations was developed to estimate the value of each calibration coefficient i e a and b as a function of clay content the polynomial order of each interpolation equation was chosen using leave one out cross validation the magnitude of improvement from applying the corrections would be best assessed by external validation in soils that were not part of this experiment a comprehensive validation effort was prevented by the limited number of published studies that presented graphs or equations relating sensor εra of tdr315 schwartz et al 2016 singh et al 2018 or cs655 chávez and evett 2012 caldwell et al 2018 singh et al 2018 kargas and soulis 2019 to reference θv nonetheless validation with these available studies generated preliminary information about the effectiveness of the general corrections for clay content effects 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of soil type on sensor performance the effects of soil type on sensor performance were analyzed using the drying cycle with constant temperature and no added salinity overall the relationship between tdr315 θv and reference θv was relatively linear with slope near unity fig 2 however differences among soils were present in general tdr315 slightly overestimated in the valent soil by 0 013 m3 m 3 and underestimated in the kuma soil by 0 018 m3 m 3 in the cozad soil tdr315 increasingly underestimated above but remained accurate below reference θv of 0 25 m3 m 3 the tdr315 response was similar in the hastings and wymore soils which were closest in clay content tdr315 θv was accurate above but underestimated below reference θv of 0 33 m3 m 3 with the magnitude of underestimation being larger for the hastings than the wymore soil the general pattern for tdr315 was that as clay content increased underestimation increased especially at lower θv underestimation of low θv in clayey soils by tdr is well documented in the literature a portion of water is bound to clay surfaces and this bound water has much lower εra than bulk water dirksen and dasberg 1993 thus a mixing model that does not consider bound water including the tdr315 factory calibration and the topp equation eq 1 would underestimate particularly at low θv the sharp transition to underestimation below a threshold as observed for the hastings and wymore soils does not appear to be an artifact of the factory calibration using data from this study the factory calibration was similar to the topp equation when εra 25 theoretically corresponding to 0 40 m3 m 3 only above this value the factory calibration estimated a higher θv than the topp equation sharp increases in underestimation by the topp equation over a small θv range have been observed by others in clayey soils ponizovsky et al 1999 based on limited information the sharp transition to underestimation would be attributed to the effect of increasing clay content in contrast the relationship between cs655 θv and reference θv was clearly curvilinear for four out of five soils fig 2 similar to tdr315 cs655 slightly overestimated in the valent soil by approximately 0 005 m3 m 3 cs655 generally underestimated in the cozad soil and the underestimation increased as reference θv moved outside of 0 19 0 27 m3 m 3 also cs655 overestimated in the kuma hastings and wymore soils however the overestimation peaked at intermediate reference θv for all three soils 0 26 0 27 m3 m 3 for kuma 0 32 0 34 m3 m 3 for hastings and 0 29 0 36 m3 m 3 for wymore among these three soils both the overall magnitude of overestimation and the most overestimated θv were smallest for kuma and largest for hastings similar to tdr315 cs655 response was most similar between the hastings and wymore soils which were closest in clay content the pattern for cs655 was that as clay content increased the overall magnitude of overestimation and the most overestimated θv increased the influence of clay content on wcrs is also well known in the literature kelleners et al 2005 found that wcrs overestimated θv in sandy loam loam and silt loam soils due to dielectric dispersion and ionic conductivity the effects of dielectric dispersion and ionic conductivity tend to increase with increasing clay content so the increasing prominence of these two phenomena are likely explanations for increasing overestimation by cs655 with increasing clay content in field research overestimation by cs655 has been reported by chávez and evett 2012 in a clay loam soil kisekka et al 2014 in a silt loam soil michel et al 2015 in a silt loam over sand soil and singh et al 2018 in a loam soil these observations which are mostly in finer textured soils are consistent with the results of the present laboratory study root mean squared difference rmsd values are consistent with the earlier discussion on the relationships between sensor and reference θv for both cs655 and tdr315 sensors were observed to be most accurate 0 02 m3 m 3 in the valent soil whose clay content was the least table 2 most other sensor soil combinations resulted in moderate rmsd between 0 02 0 04 m3 m 3 the large rmsd of cs655 in hastings and wymore 0 07 m3 m 3 reflect the large overestimation that occurred throughout the drying cycle the diversity in response of both sensors among soils suggests that soil specific calibrations would be more appropriate than a soil blind calibration indeed the anova results indicated that soil specific square root mixing model calibrations provided a statistically significant improvement over soil blind square root mixing model calibrations for both sensors for tdr315 this finding is in agreement with ponizovsky et al 1999 which reported clay content dependence of tdr calibration coefficients for cs655 this finding is in agreement with seyfried and murdock 2001 and chandler et al 2004 both of which reported the need for soil specific calibration of wcrs using soil specific square root mixing model calibrations instead of soil blind square root mixing model calibrations overall rmsd across all soils would be lowered from 0 025 to 0 013 m3 m 3 for tdr315 and from 0 038 to 0 012 m3 m 3 for cs655 the soil specific calibrations generally reduced rmsd in each soil to less than 0 015 m3 m 3 table 3 and their coefficient values are listed in table 3 3 2 effect of temperature on sensor performance across soil types the effects of temperature on sensor performance across soil types were analyzed using the drying cycle with two temperatures 24 and 35 c and no added salinity temperature appeared to exert a small yet soil dependent effect on performance of tdr315 and cs655 for both sensors across soils coefficients a and b of the square root mixing model eq 4 tend to be less positive and less negative respectively at 24 c than at 35 c for both sensors in the valent soil the same reference θv tended to correspond to a slightly higher sensor θv at 24 c than at 35 c fig 3 the temperature effect in the cozad soil was inconsistent between the two sensors for both sensors in kuma hastings and wymore soils the same reference θv tended to correspond to a noticeably lower sensor θv at 24 c than at 35 c among these three soils the magnitude of the temperature effect seemed to increase with increasing clay content for tdr315 but seemed to decrease with increasing clay content for cs655 the temperature effect caused rmsd for cs655 to be smaller at 24 c than at 35 c in these three soils because overestimation was reduced table 2 in all five soils the temperature effect was more dramatic for cs655 than for tdr315 soil type dependence of temperature effects on sensor θv is primarily attributed to temperature dependence of both bound water content and bulk water permittivity wraith and or 1999 in clayey soils e g kuma hastings wymore which provide large surface area for binding water sensor θv generally increases with increasing temperature because the increase in εra with the release of bound water outweighs the decrease in εra with the lowering of bulk water permittivity in soils with low clay content e g valent which provide little surface area for binding water sensor θv generally decreases with increasing temperature because the decrease in εra with the lowering of bulk water permittivity outweighs the increase in εra with the release of bound water these two trends explain well the observations from fig 3 though wraith and or 1999 developed their theory from tdr research seyfried and murdock 2001 noticed the same two trends in wcr research this is not surprising because both tdr and wcr respond to εra interestingly the present finding of the larger temperature effect for cs655 than for tdr315 is in agreement with blonquist et al 2005 who found a larger temperature effect for a cs655 predecessor than for conventional tdr blonquist et al 2005 also found that the magnitude of temperature effects were similar between sensors operating at higher em frequencies than those operating at lower em frequencies thus the slightly larger temperature effect for cs655 than for tdr315 is perhaps a consequence of sensor design and firmware rather than em frequency literature also indicates that temperature effects on sensor θv can depend on θv this phenomenon has been reported by pepin et al 1995 gong et al 2003 and adeyemi et al 2016 for tdr and by seyfried and murdock 2001 and western and seyfried 2005 for wcr wraith and or 1999 explained that because the ratio of bound water to bulk water decreases with increasing θv the relative significance of bound water release versus declining bulk water permittivity can change with θv with four measurement times per temperature the θv dependence of temperature effects could not be properly evaluated in this study but may be present for tdr315 and or cs655 results from anova indicate that for cs655 but not tdr315 soil and temperature specific square root mixing model calibrations offered statistically significant improvement over soil specific but temperature blind square root mixing model calibrations using soil and temperature specific square root mixing model calibrations instead of soil specific but temperature blind square root mixing model calibrations overall rmsd across all soils would be lowered from 0 011 to 0 010 m3 m 3 for cs655 and almost unchanged at 0 011 m3 m 3 for tdr315 unless the sensors are very near the surface 11 c might be a likely range in topsoil temperature over an irrigation season rather than over the course of a day the actual θv uncertainty encountered within the timeframe of irrigation decision making i e typically daily to weekly as a result of soil temperature fluctuations would be even smaller than what the differences in overall rmsd suggest thus temperature fluctuations between 24 and 35 c were inferred to cause potentially detectable but generally negligible effects on θv calibration of tdr315 and cs655 for irrigation management furthermore because only two temperatures were evaluated in this study the development of a temperature correction for the two sensors was not attempted 3 3 effect of salinity on sensor performance across soil types the effects of salinity on sensor performance across soil types were analyzed by contrasting the drying cycle with constant temperature and added salinity against the drying cycle with constant temperature and no added salinity for both tdr315 and cs655 across soils the coefficients a and b of the square root mixing model eq 4 tended to be less positive and less negative respectively with added salinity than without though the reverse was true for cs655 in the valent soil salinity appeared to exert an opposite effect on performance of tdr315 than on performance of cs655 for tdr315 adding salinity slightly increased sensor θv in the valent mean difference md 0 005 m3 m 3 kuma md 0 007 m3 m 3 and wymore md 0 011 m3 m 3 soils fig 4 this increase was concentrated at intermediate θv in the valent soil but at high θv in the kuma and wymore soils for cs655 on the other hand adding salinity decreased sensor θv moderately in the valent kuma hastings and wymore soils md 0 020 to 0 034 m3 m 3 the magnitude of decrease increased with increasing θv in the valent soil but decreased with increasing θv in the kuma hastings and wymore soils for both sensors large inter replicate differences overshadowed any salinity effects in the cozad soil while the largest salinity effect was observed in the wymore soil theory generally suggests that salinity should either do nothing or increase sensor θv one mechanism by which salinity can increase sensor θv is by increasing imaginary permittivity imaginary permittivity increases with increasing apparent soil electrical conductivity and decreases with increasing em frequency kelleners et al 2005 at the same salinity level sensors at lower frequencies will encounter a larger imaginary permittivity which in turn will increase apparent permittivity to a greater extent again because both tdr315 and cs655 are responding to apparent permittivity when determining θv this mechanism applies to both sensors a mechanism by which salinity can increase wcr θv specifically is by delaying its measurement of period average kelleners et al 2005 as eca increases the reflection of the previous generated em pulse will be further attenuated wcrs rely on this reflection to reach a predefined voltage threshold before triggering the next generated em pulse given the same travel speed weaker reflections will take a longer time to reach that voltage threshold than stronger reflections and therefore will result in longer wcr period averages the observation that tdr315 experiences a smaller salinity effect than does cs655 is not surprising tdr uses a range of relatively high frequencies which reduces its sensitivity to salinity as observed by blonquist et al 2005 earlier studies had claimed that tdr was insensitive to salinity topp et al 1980 nadler et al 1991 but later studies have found otherwise wyseure et al 1997 topp et al 2000 schwartz et al 2013 in the present study average eca reported by tdr315 for each soil at the first measurement time was 0 16 1 04 ds m 1 with no added salinity and 0 66 1 90 ds m 1 with added salinity as explained by rhoades et al 1976 the same pore water ec corresponds to a higher eca in clayey soils because these soils generally have higher θv and more conductive soil solid surfaces in this study eca indeed increased with increasing θv and loosely increased with increasing clay content wet wymore soil witnessed not only the highest eca but also the largest salinity induced increase in tdr315 θv the observation that cs655 θv was reduced by added salinity across multiple soils is surprising though blonquist et al 2005 found that both period average and sensor θv for a wcr predecessor of cs655 increased with increasing salinity as predicted by theory in all soils of the present study cs655 period average increased with added salinity at high θv as predicted by theory but decreased with added salinity at low and intermediate θv contrary to theory unlike its predecessors cs655 uses both eca and period average to calculate sensor θv campbell scientific 2017 caldwell et al 2018 under the conditions of the study the factory calibration decreases θv as eca increases given constant period average campbell scientific personal communication 2017 this adjustment counteracted against the salinity induced increase in period average at high θv but exacerbated the salinity induced decrease in period average at low and intermediate θv the unexpected response of cs655 period average to salinity at low and intermediate θv is troubling and needs to be further investigated results from anova indicate that for both tdr315 and cs655 soil and salinity specific square root mixing model calibrations offered statistically significant improvement over soil specific but salinity blind square root mixing model calibrations the large number of measurement times in the two drying cycles certainly provided large statistical power for distinguishing differences using soil and salinity specific square root mixing model calibrations instead of soil specific but salinity blind square root mixing model calibrations overall rmsd across all soils would be lowered from 0 015 to 0 014 m3 m 3 for tdr315 and from 0 018 to 0 015 m3 m 3 for cs655 although this difference in rmsd might not seem substantial the aforementioned θv dependence on salinity effects means that the direction and magnitude of sensor error may be changing noticeably during the timeframe of irrigation decision making accounting for salinity would be recommended especially when using cs655 as compared with tdr315 because only two salinity levels were evaluated in this study the development of a salinity correction for the two sensors was not attempted 3 4 correction for clay content effects considering the theories discussed above clay content was deemed to be the most appropriate predictive variable for interpolating the trends in the θv calibration for tdr315 and cs655 among the 15 soil columns of this study during the drying cycle with constant temperature and no added salinity for both sensors both coefficients a and b of the square root mixing model were quadratically related to clay content fig 5 the procedure for obtaining coefficients of the θv calibration equation from fig 5 will be hereafter referred to as the correction for clay content effects if this correction was applied to the data from which it was developed rmsd between sensor and reference θv would decrease roughly by 36 for both tdr315 and cs655 as compared with using the factory calibration the relative reduction in rmsd would be similar among soils for tdr315 but larger in clayeyer soils for cs655 overall these re substitution results suggest that the correction for clay content effects is able to remove a substantial portion of the clay content effects on sensor θv for both sensors external validation was conducted using the limited independent data from the literature chávez and evett 2012 schwartz et al 2016 caldwell et al 2018 singh et al 2018 kargas and soulis 2019 caldwell et al 2018 experimented with different wetting drying procedures to obtain a range of θv here for external validation only the data from the batch procedure was used after pooling soils bac and hnd together and soils fr and lub together based on similar clay contents to assemble more data points for rmsd calculations to avoid extrapolation comparisons were restricted to the range in reference θv spanned by both the cycle with constant temperature and no added salinity i e the dataset from which the correction for clay content effects was developed and the external study of interest in this cycle of the experiment the ranges in average reference θv were 0 011 0 272 m3 m 3 for the valent soil 0 106 0 457 m3 m 3 for the cozad soil 0 139 0 427 m3 m 3 for the kuma soil 0 229 0 455 m3 m 3 for the hastings soil and 0 243 0 469 m3 m 3 for the wymore soil fig 2 these ranges span and exceed those typically observed under irrigated conditions for each soil respectively overall the correction for clay content effects seemed to achieve increasing reduction in tdr315 and cs655 rmsd as clay content increased beyond 20 fig 6 the five studies differed widely in both reference methods and wetting drying methods chávez and evett 2012 was a field study where cs655 was compared against conventional tdr with soil specific calibration and the site was bare soil that included a repacked surface and was periodically flooded within a berm schwartz et al 2016 caldwell et al 2018 and kargas and soulis 2019 were laboratory studies where tdr315 or cs655 was compared against known θv in columns packed from uniform mixtures of water and dry soil singh et al 2018 was a field study where tdr315 and cs655 were compared against a neutron moisture meter nmm and the site was no till soybeans and was wetted by rainfall the correction for clay content effects clearly improving θv accuracy in multiple soils from contrasting experiments is definitely an optimistic finding readers should be aware of issues related to the transferability of corrections for clay content effects because real permittivity and losses due to dielectric relaxation and ionic conductivity are both affected by specific surface area and not by the prevalence of clay sized particles specific surface area is certainly a more direct predictor of clay content effects than is clay content itself yet because measurements of clay content are much more accessible than measurements of specific surface area the correction developed in this study used clay content as the predictor this choice would certainly limit the transferability of the correction to soils with distinctly different clay mineralogies nevertheless except where information about local clay mineralogy is widely available to guide the estimation of specific surface area from clay content or and wraith 1999 most users of reflectometers may not be able to apply corrections that used specific surface area as the predictor finally some em sensors preferentially respond to small wetter and drier spots in natural soil and thus overestimate θv logsdon 2009 so caution should be exercised when considering the transfer of corrections between laboratory and field 4 conclusions a laboratory study was conducted at the west central research and extension center north platte ne usa to analyze the performance of two recently developed electromagnetic em sensors tdr315 and cs655 in five nebraska soils the study evaluated how differences in clay content ranging from 5 to 49 temperature 24 versus 35 c and salinity 0 versus 3 09 g l 1 of added cacl2 affected volumetric water content θv reported by the em sensors using their factory calibrations for all five soils the relationship between tdr315 and reference θv was relatively linear with slope near unity the general pattern for tdr315 was that as clay content increased underestimation increased especially at lower θv in contrast the relationship between cs655 and reference θv was curvilinear for four out of the five soils as clay content increased the overall magnitude of overestimation and the most overestimated θv increased for cs655 in all five soils the temperature effect was more dramatic for cs655 than for tdr315 with respect to the kuma hastings and wymore soils the magnitude of the temperature effect increased with increasing clay content for tdr315 but decreased for cs655 although the effect of temperature on θv was statistically detectable for one of the two sensors the effect is expected to be negligible for most irrigation management applications salinity had an opposite effect on the performance of tdr315 than cs655 for tdr315 adding salinity slightly increased sensor θv in the valent kuma and wymore soils this increase was concentrated at intermediate θv in the valent soil but at high θv in the kuma and wymore soils for cs655 adding salinity decreased sensor θv moderately in the valent kuma hastings and wymore soils the magnitude of decrease increased with increasing θv in the valent soil but decreased in the kuma hastings and wymore soils accounting for the effects of salinity is recommended especially when using cs655 as compared with tdr315 in this study clay content was deemed to be an appropriate predictive variable for interpolating the trends in the θv calibration for tdr315 and cs655 therefore a correction for clay content effects was established applying the correction to the data from which it was developed rmsd between sensor and reference θv decreased roughly 36 for both tdr315 and cs655 external validation of the correction was also conducted using limited independent data from the literature the correction improved the results in soils with more than 20 clay content but not in less clayey soils these encouraging findings highlight the promise of simple empirical corrections such as the one developed in this study colleagues are invited to validate and refine this correction further future efforts should focus on developing corrections for clay content effects in the field and especially on bridging the advancements of modern soil physics with the practical challenges and

11130,the presence of clay particles increases the specific surface area of a soil and can affect the calibration of electromagnetic soil water sensors including reflectometers to quantify and correct for this effect in two relatively new reflectometers three tdr315 and three cs655 sensors were installed in each of five soils with clay content ranging from 5 to 49 as the soils were dried in a temperature controlled room sensor reported soil volumetric water content θv according to the factory calibration was compared against reference θv determined by weighing the soils sensor reported θv was similar to reference θv in the sand soil root mean square difference rmsd 0 02 m3 m 3 but the discrepancy was larger for the clayey soils an increase in clay content tended to cause tdr315 to underestimate low θv and tended to cause cs655 to overestimate θv in a concave down pattern at the levels evaluated in this experiment differences in clay content produced a larger effect than differences in temperature 24 versus 35 c and salinity 0 versus 3 09 g l cacl2 on factory calibration accuracy of both sensors soil specific empirical calibrations developed using a square root mixing model fitted the experimental data very closely r2 0 93 for both sensors by estimating calibration coefficients based on clay content alone to recalculate sensor θv from sensor reported apparent relative permittivity rmsd from reference θv was reduced by approximately 36 for both sensors as compared with using the factory calibration applying the same procedure to independent literature data tended to improve θv accuracy of both sensors increasingly as clay content increased above 20 the findings suggest that a simple user friendly correction for clay content effects may provide initial practical improvement over the factory calibration of a reflectometer in clayey soils keywords calibration clay cs655 nebraska sensor tdr315 1 introduction accurate and continuous determination of soil water status is vital in many agricultural and hydrologic studies and can assist in making optimal irrigation management decisions for example monitoring of soil volumetric water content θv can be used to trigger irrigation when soil water is depleted to a defined threshold based on crop and soil type electromagnetic em sensors are widely used to monitor θv due to ease of installation rarity of regulatory and safety concerns cost effectiveness and convenience of frequent measurement in addition some em sensors have the capability to measure additional soil properties such as temperature and apparent electrical conductivity eca thus broadening the applicability of these sensors in both research and practice electromagnetic soil water sensors estimate θv by taking advantage of the high apparent relative permittivity εra of water in comparison to that of other soil constituents however soil εra can be influenced by other factors such as temperature salinity textural composition organic matter content omc and bulk density ρb paige and keefer 2008 these factors might not be properly accounted for in the factory calibration of em sensors some studies have proposed to correct for non water influences on εra by developing soil specific calibrations this approach requires capturing the response of em sensors over a large θv range in the field chávez and evett 2012 kisekka et al 2014 michel et al 2015 rudnick et al 2015 singh et al 2018 or in the laboratory adeyemi et al 2016 caldwell et al 2018 kargas and soulis 2019 although soil specific calibrations have enabled the confident use of em sensors at research sites this approach might be infeasible for supporting wide adoption of em sensors other studies have proposed to correct for non water influences on εra by developing one general calibration with built in adjustments for such influences this approach can be followed using empirical functions or physically based dielectric mixing models dirksen and dasberg 1993 or and wraith 1999 schwartz et al 2009 jacobsen and schjønning 1993 found that adding linear terms of ρb omc and clay content to the calibration equation produced a statistically significant improvement in the accuracy of θv determined by time domain reflectometry tdr across 189 soil samples besides corrections for stable properties such as clay content corrections for transient properties such as temperature western and seyfried 2005 and eca kelleners et al 2009 could also be included if non water influences on εra can be predicted well from easily measurable soil properties then this approach may be feasible for supporting wide adoption of em sensors for example rüdiger et al 2010 substantially improved θv accuracy of cs616 sensors by using textural composition data to estimate the coefficients in empirical equations for temperature correction and soil moisture calibration instead of applying the factory calibration specific objectives of this research were 1 to evaluate how differences in clay content temperature and salinity affect factory calibration accuracy of two relatively new reflectometers and 2 to develop for each of the two reflectometers a general non soil specific calibration equation that adjusts its coefficients based on clay content alone readers should note that this study does not attempt to characterize fully these two specific reflectometers or to advance reflectometer physics in general instead this study provides a preliminary idea of the factory calibration accuracy of two reflectometers under a variety of soil conditions and also a simple user friendly way to improve upon the factory calibration of two reflectometers across soils using an easily measurable property such outputs may not add significantly to the scientific understanding of reflectometers but may be extremely valuable to the practical use of reflectometers 2 materials and methods 2 1 soils a laboratory study was conducted to analyze the performance of two recently developed em sensors in five nebraska soils soil was collected from particular depths at five sites across the state of nebraska usa specifically to capture a wide range in clay content fig 1 shows the geographical distribution of these five sites and the corresponding soil associations the collection sites were occurrences of the valent mixed mesic ustic torripsamments cozad coarse silty mixed superactive mesic typic haplustolls kuma fine silty mixed superactive mesic pachic argiustolls hastings fine smectitic mesic udic argiustolls and wymore fine smectitic mesic aquertic argiudolls soil series the location depth and corresponding properties of each soil collection are presented in table 1 textural composition was measured using the hydrometer method by ward laboratories kearney ne usa according to the natural resources conservation service nrcs classification system the mean standard deviation in clay content among the collected soils ranged from 5 1 for the valent soil to 49 4 for the wymore soil table 1 the corresponding textural classes were sand sandy clay loam clay loam silty clay and silty clay for the valent cozad kuma hastings and wymore soils respectively according to the nrcs classification system given the depths and soil series from which the soils were collected typical cation exchange capacity at ph 7 would be 0 016 0 170 0 212 0 279 and 0 288 mmol g for the valent cozad kuma hastings and wymore soils respectively according to nrcs laboratory data california soil resource lab 2019 organic matter content was measured using the loss on ignition method by ward laboratories 2 2 reflectometers two recently developed reflectometers that are becoming more widely used were chosen for this study one of the two sensor types investigated was tdr315 tdr315 l acclima meridian id usa acclima 2017 time domain reflectometers both tdr315 and tdr315 l are configured with three parallel rods 15 cm length by 3 2 mm diameter serving as the waveguide the sensor head for tdr315 has all necessary electronics and firmware to generate an em pulse and to analyze the reflected waveform for determining the two way travel time of the em pulse which is used to compute εra tdr315 l has similar electronics firmware and functionality as tdr315 however tdr315 l consumes less power and is not capable of exporting waveforms for both tdr315 and tdr315 l θv is calculated from εra using a proprietary dielectric mixing model both tdr315 and tdr315 l also use thermistors for determining temperature and use the giese and tiemann method for determining eca for this study tdr315 and tdr315 l were considered to be equivalent schwartz et al 2016 observed that tdr315 can perform similarly to or better than conventional tdr specifically tdr315 and conventional tdr reported nearly indistinguishable εra values at the same known θv value but tdr315 was less sensitive than conventional tdr to the interference of salinity because tdr315 does not use long coaxial cables that can degrade high frequency signals the other sensor type investigated in this study was cs655 campbell scientific logan ut usa campbell scientific 2017 water content reflectometers wcr the cs655 is equipped with two parallel rods 12 cm length by 3 2 mm diameter forming an open ended transmission line the cs655 determines 1 temperature by measuring thermistor resistance 2 eca by measuring the voltage ratio between a known excitation voltage and the measured attenuated voltage and 3 period average by measuring the number of times per second that the reflection of the previous generated em pulse returns to the sensor head to trigger the next generated em pulse the εra is calculated from period average using a factory calibrated empirical model that includes adjustments based on eca campbell scientific personal communication 2017 caldwell et al 2018 and then εra is used to determine θv using the topp equation topp et al 1980 eq 1 1 θv 4 3 10 6 εra 3 5 5 10 4 εra 2 2 92 10 2 εra 5 3 10 2 2 3 experiment for each of the five collected soils with varying clay content three vertical soil columns were constructed each in a separate polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe section 0 223 m length by 0 255 m internal diameter landscape fabric and window screen were secured to the bottom end of each pipe section to serve as a water permeable but soil impermeable support the collected soils were oven dried at 105 c ground passed through a 2 mm sieve and oven dried at 105 c again a metallic plate slightly smaller than the pipe internal diameter was attached to a hydraulic press and was used to pack the loose dry soil in five layers to the target ρb table 1 with a total height of 0 176 m then one tdr315 l or tdr315 for three cozad columns and one kuma column sensor and one cs655 sensor were inserted downward into each soil column until the bottom of the sensor head was flush with the top of the column the dimensions of the soil columns and the placement of the two sensors were carefully designed so that the sensing volume of each sensor extended almost the full height of the column remained entirely within the column and did not include the hardware of the other sensor in the column for simplicity tdr315 and tdr315 l will be jointly referred to as tdr315 from here forward the soil columns were subjected to multiple saturation drying cycles inside a temperature controlled room to study the θv measurement accuracy of tdr315 and cs655 in soils with varying clay content for every cycle soil columns were wetted from the bottom up and then were allowed to drain briefly before the bottom was sealed with plastic film in the saturation drying cycle with constant temperature and no added salinity room temperature was maintained at 35 c and saturation was performed using municipal tap water with electrical conductivity ec of 0 7 ds m 1 ward laboratories kearney ne usa in the saturation drying cycle with two temperatures and no added salinity room temperature alternated weekly between 35 and 24 c i e one week at 35 c one week at 24 c and repeat and saturation was performed using municipal tap water in the saturation drying cycle with constant temperature and added salinity room temperature was maintained at 35 c but saturation was performed using a solution prepared by adding 3 09 g l 1 cacl2 ec 5 0 ds m 1 rumble 2018 to municipal tap water throughout each drying cycle the output of the tdr315 and cs655 sensors were collected and recorded by a cr1000 campbell scientific logan ut datalogger every three minutes each soil column was weighed using a bss 250 s beam load cell connected to a ti 500rf ss digital display transcell technology buffalo grove il the frequency of weighing ranged from twice a day to once every two or three days generally decreasing as the evaporation rate of the soil columns decreased to obtain θv at the end of the entire experiment the soil of each column was extracted and oven dried at 105 c whereas each now empty soil column setup which included its two sensors was weighed in the same way as when it contained the soil column 2 4 analysis to assess the θv measurement accuracy of tdr315 and cs655 in the five soils with varying clay content sensor θv output was compared against reference θv determined from soil column weight reference θv of each column at each weighing time was calculated using eq 2 and was matched with θv reported by its two sensors at the closest timestamp 2 r e f e r e n c e θ v w t o t a l w s o i l w s e t u p ρ w v s o i l where wtotal is the total weight of the soil column wsoil is the weight of the dry soil in the column wsetup is the weight of the empty soil column setup ρw is the density of water 1 0 g cm 3 and vsoil is the volume of the soil in the column root mean square difference rmsd eq 3 was calculated for each sensor in each soil over each drying cycle to indicate the absolute magnitude of differences between sensor θv and reference θv while penalizing larger differences 3 r m s d t n i m s i t r i t 2 m n where i is the index of the soil column m is the number of soil columns per soil t is the index of the weighing time n is the number of weighing times during the drying cycle si t is the sensor θv of the ith soil column at the tth weighing time and ri t is the reference θv of the ith soil column at the tth weighing time the effect of clay content and the potential interference of temperature and salinity on θv measurement accuracy of tdr315 and cs655 in the five soils were evaluated to examine the effect of clay content under isothermal and non saline conditions the 33 weighing times from the drying cycle with constant temperature and no added salinity were analyzed to examine the potential interference of temperature the eight end of week weighing times from the drying cycle with two alternating weekly temperatures and no added salinity were analyzed to examine the potential interference of salinity the 33 weighing times from the drying cycle with constant temperature and no added salinity as well as the 40 weighing times from the drying cycle with constant temperature and added salinity were analyzed in each of these analyses the square root mixing model eq 4 was fitted to the reference θv versus sensor εra data from the soil columns then analysis of variance anova with a significance level α 0 05 was conducted using statistical computing language r version 3 5 1 r foundation for statistical computing wein austria this procedure explored whether within the ranges of clay content temperature and salinity evaluated in this experiment θv calibrations are statistically distinguishable when fitted separately to different levels of a non water variable as when fitted jointly to all levels 4 θ v a ε r a b a general correction for clay content effects was proposed for θv measurements by tdr315 and a general correction for clay content effects was proposed for θv measurements by cs655 the basis of each correction was the 15 column specific square root mixing model calibration equations eq 4 relating sensor εra to reference θv during the drying cycle with constant temperature and no added salinity then a set of polynomial regression interpolation equations was developed to estimate the value of each calibration coefficient i e a and b as a function of clay content the polynomial order of each interpolation equation was chosen using leave one out cross validation the magnitude of improvement from applying the corrections would be best assessed by external validation in soils that were not part of this experiment a comprehensive validation effort was prevented by the limited number of published studies that presented graphs or equations relating sensor εra of tdr315 schwartz et al 2016 singh et al 2018 or cs655 chávez and evett 2012 caldwell et al 2018 singh et al 2018 kargas and soulis 2019 to reference θv nonetheless validation with these available studies generated preliminary information about the effectiveness of the general corrections for clay content effects 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of soil type on sensor performance the effects of soil type on sensor performance were analyzed using the drying cycle with constant temperature and no added salinity overall the relationship between tdr315 θv and reference θv was relatively linear with slope near unity fig 2 however differences among soils were present in general tdr315 slightly overestimated in the valent soil by 0 013 m3 m 3 and underestimated in the kuma soil by 0 018 m3 m 3 in the cozad soil tdr315 increasingly underestimated above but remained accurate below reference θv of 0 25 m3 m 3 the tdr315 response was similar in the hastings and wymore soils which were closest in clay content tdr315 θv was accurate above but underestimated below reference θv of 0 33 m3 m 3 with the magnitude of underestimation being larger for the hastings than the wymore soil the general pattern for tdr315 was that as clay content increased underestimation increased especially at lower θv underestimation of low θv in clayey soils by tdr is well documented in the literature a portion of water is bound to clay surfaces and this bound water has much lower εra than bulk water dirksen and dasberg 1993 thus a mixing model that does not consider bound water including the tdr315 factory calibration and the topp equation eq 1 would underestimate particularly at low θv the sharp transition to underestimation below a threshold as observed for the hastings and wymore soils does not appear to be an artifact of the factory calibration using data from this study the factory calibration was similar to the topp equation when εra 25 theoretically corresponding to 0 40 m3 m 3 only above this value the factory calibration estimated a higher θv than the topp equation sharp increases in underestimation by the topp equation over a small θv range have been observed by others in clayey soils ponizovsky et al 1999 based on limited information the sharp transition to underestimation would be attributed to the effect of increasing clay content in contrast the relationship between cs655 θv and reference θv was clearly curvilinear for four out of five soils fig 2 similar to tdr315 cs655 slightly overestimated in the valent soil by approximately 0 005 m3 m 3 cs655 generally underestimated in the cozad soil and the underestimation increased as reference θv moved outside of 0 19 0 27 m3 m 3 also cs655 overestimated in the kuma hastings and wymore soils however the overestimation peaked at intermediate reference θv for all three soils 0 26 0 27 m3 m 3 for kuma 0 32 0 34 m3 m 3 for hastings and 0 29 0 36 m3 m 3 for wymore among these three soils both the overall magnitude of overestimation and the most overestimated θv were smallest for kuma and largest for hastings similar to tdr315 cs655 response was most similar between the hastings and wymore soils which were closest in clay content the pattern for cs655 was that as clay content increased the overall magnitude of overestimation and the most overestimated θv increased the influence of clay content on wcrs is also well known in the literature kelleners et al 2005 found that wcrs overestimated θv in sandy loam loam and silt loam soils due to dielectric dispersion and ionic conductivity the effects of dielectric dispersion and ionic conductivity tend to increase with increasing clay content so the increasing prominence of these two phenomena are likely explanations for increasing overestimation by cs655 with increasing clay content in field research overestimation by cs655 has been reported by chávez and evett 2012 in a clay loam soil kisekka et al 2014 in a silt loam soil michel et al 2015 in a silt loam over sand soil and singh et al 2018 in a loam soil these observations which are mostly in finer textured soils are consistent with the results of the present laboratory study root mean squared difference rmsd values are consistent with the earlier discussion on the relationships between sensor and reference θv for both cs655 and tdr315 sensors were observed to be most accurate 0 02 m3 m 3 in the valent soil whose clay content was the least table 2 most other sensor soil combinations resulted in moderate rmsd between 0 02 0 04 m3 m 3 the large rmsd of cs655 in hastings and wymore 0 07 m3 m 3 reflect the large overestimation that occurred throughout the drying cycle the diversity in response of both sensors among soils suggests that soil specific calibrations would be more appropriate than a soil blind calibration indeed the anova results indicated that soil specific square root mixing model calibrations provided a statistically significant improvement over soil blind square root mixing model calibrations for both sensors for tdr315 this finding is in agreement with ponizovsky et al 1999 which reported clay content dependence of tdr calibration coefficients for cs655 this finding is in agreement with seyfried and murdock 2001 and chandler et al 2004 both of which reported the need for soil specific calibration of wcrs using soil specific square root mixing model calibrations instead of soil blind square root mixing model calibrations overall rmsd across all soils would be lowered from 0 025 to 0 013 m3 m 3 for tdr315 and from 0 038 to 0 012 m3 m 3 for cs655 the soil specific calibrations generally reduced rmsd in each soil to less than 0 015 m3 m 3 table 3 and their coefficient values are listed in table 3 3 2 effect of temperature on sensor performance across soil types the effects of temperature on sensor performance across soil types were analyzed using the drying cycle with two temperatures 24 and 35 c and no added salinity temperature appeared to exert a small yet soil dependent effect on performance of tdr315 and cs655 for both sensors across soils coefficients a and b of the square root mixing model eq 4 tend to be less positive and less negative respectively at 24 c than at 35 c for both sensors in the valent soil the same reference θv tended to correspond to a slightly higher sensor θv at 24 c than at 35 c fig 3 the temperature effect in the cozad soil was inconsistent between the two sensors for both sensors in kuma hastings and wymore soils the same reference θv tended to correspond to a noticeably lower sensor θv at 24 c than at 35 c among these three soils the magnitude of the temperature effect seemed to increase with increasing clay content for tdr315 but seemed to decrease with increasing clay content for cs655 the temperature effect caused rmsd for cs655 to be smaller at 24 c than at 35 c in these three soils because overestimation was reduced table 2 in all five soils the temperature effect was more dramatic for cs655 than for tdr315 soil type dependence of temperature effects on sensor θv is primarily attributed to temperature dependence of both bound water content and bulk water permittivity wraith and or 1999 in clayey soils e g kuma hastings wymore which provide large surface area for binding water sensor θv generally increases with increasing temperature because the increase in εra with the release of bound water outweighs the decrease in εra with the lowering of bulk water permittivity in soils with low clay content e g valent which provide little surface area for binding water sensor θv generally decreases with increasing temperature because the decrease in εra with the lowering of bulk water permittivity outweighs the increase in εra with the release of bound water these two trends explain well the observations from fig 3 though wraith and or 1999 developed their theory from tdr research seyfried and murdock 2001 noticed the same two trends in wcr research this is not surprising because both tdr and wcr respond to εra interestingly the present finding of the larger temperature effect for cs655 than for tdr315 is in agreement with blonquist et al 2005 who found a larger temperature effect for a cs655 predecessor than for conventional tdr blonquist et al 2005 also found that the magnitude of temperature effects were similar between sensors operating at higher em frequencies than those operating at lower em frequencies thus the slightly larger temperature effect for cs655 than for tdr315 is perhaps a consequence of sensor design and firmware rather than em frequency literature also indicates that temperature effects on sensor θv can depend on θv this phenomenon has been reported by pepin et al 1995 gong et al 2003 and adeyemi et al 2016 for tdr and by seyfried and murdock 2001 and western and seyfried 2005 for wcr wraith and or 1999 explained that because the ratio of bound water to bulk water decreases with increasing θv the relative significance of bound water release versus declining bulk water permittivity can change with θv with four measurement times per temperature the θv dependence of temperature effects could not be properly evaluated in this study but may be present for tdr315 and or cs655 results from anova indicate that for cs655 but not tdr315 soil and temperature specific square root mixing model calibrations offered statistically significant improvement over soil specific but temperature blind square root mixing model calibrations using soil and temperature specific square root mixing model calibrations instead of soil specific but temperature blind square root mixing model calibrations overall rmsd across all soils would be lowered from 0 011 to 0 010 m3 m 3 for cs655 and almost unchanged at 0 011 m3 m 3 for tdr315 unless the sensors are very near the surface 11 c might be a likely range in topsoil temperature over an irrigation season rather than over the course of a day the actual θv uncertainty encountered within the timeframe of irrigation decision making i e typically daily to weekly as a result of soil temperature fluctuations would be even smaller than what the differences in overall rmsd suggest thus temperature fluctuations between 24 and 35 c were inferred to cause potentially detectable but generally negligible effects on θv calibration of tdr315 and cs655 for irrigation management furthermore because only two temperatures were evaluated in this study the development of a temperature correction for the two sensors was not attempted 3 3 effect of salinity on sensor performance across soil types the effects of salinity on sensor performance across soil types were analyzed by contrasting the drying cycle with constant temperature and added salinity against the drying cycle with constant temperature and no added salinity for both tdr315 and cs655 across soils the coefficients a and b of the square root mixing model eq 4 tended to be less positive and less negative respectively with added salinity than without though the reverse was true for cs655 in the valent soil salinity appeared to exert an opposite effect on performance of tdr315 than on performance of cs655 for tdr315 adding salinity slightly increased sensor θv in the valent mean difference md 0 005 m3 m 3 kuma md 0 007 m3 m 3 and wymore md 0 011 m3 m 3 soils fig 4 this increase was concentrated at intermediate θv in the valent soil but at high θv in the kuma and wymore soils for cs655 on the other hand adding salinity decreased sensor θv moderately in the valent kuma hastings and wymore soils md 0 020 to 0 034 m3 m 3 the magnitude of decrease increased with increasing θv in the valent soil but decreased with increasing θv in the kuma hastings and wymore soils for both sensors large inter replicate differences overshadowed any salinity effects in the cozad soil while the largest salinity effect was observed in the wymore soil theory generally suggests that salinity should either do nothing or increase sensor θv one mechanism by which salinity can increase sensor θv is by increasing imaginary permittivity imaginary permittivity increases with increasing apparent soil electrical conductivity and decreases with increasing em frequency kelleners et al 2005 at the same salinity level sensors at lower frequencies will encounter a larger imaginary permittivity which in turn will increase apparent permittivity to a greater extent again because both tdr315 and cs655 are responding to apparent permittivity when determining θv this mechanism applies to both sensors a mechanism by which salinity can increase wcr θv specifically is by delaying its measurement of period average kelleners et al 2005 as eca increases the reflection of the previous generated em pulse will be further attenuated wcrs rely on this reflection to reach a predefined voltage threshold before triggering the next generated em pulse given the same travel speed weaker reflections will take a longer time to reach that voltage threshold than stronger reflections and therefore will result in longer wcr period averages the observation that tdr315 experiences a smaller salinity effect than does cs655 is not surprising tdr uses a range of relatively high frequencies which reduces its sensitivity to salinity as observed by blonquist et al 2005 earlier studies had claimed that tdr was insensitive to salinity topp et al 1980 nadler et al 1991 but later studies have found otherwise wyseure et al 1997 topp et al 2000 schwartz et al 2013 in the present study average eca reported by tdr315 for each soil at the first measurement time was 0 16 1 04 ds m 1 with no added salinity and 0 66 1 90 ds m 1 with added salinity as explained by rhoades et al 1976 the same pore water ec corresponds to a higher eca in clayey soils because these soils generally have higher θv and more conductive soil solid surfaces in this study eca indeed increased with increasing θv and loosely increased with increasing clay content wet wymore soil witnessed not only the highest eca but also the largest salinity induced increase in tdr315 θv the observation that cs655 θv was reduced by added salinity across multiple soils is surprising though blonquist et al 2005 found that both period average and sensor θv for a wcr predecessor of cs655 increased with increasing salinity as predicted by theory in all soils of the present study cs655 period average increased with added salinity at high θv as predicted by theory but decreased with added salinity at low and intermediate θv contrary to theory unlike its predecessors cs655 uses both eca and period average to calculate sensor θv campbell scientific 2017 caldwell et al 2018 under the conditions of the study the factory calibration decreases θv as eca increases given constant period average campbell scientific personal communication 2017 this adjustment counteracted against the salinity induced increase in period average at high θv but exacerbated the salinity induced decrease in period average at low and intermediate θv the unexpected response of cs655 period average to salinity at low and intermediate θv is troubling and needs to be further investigated results from anova indicate that for both tdr315 and cs655 soil and salinity specific square root mixing model calibrations offered statistically significant improvement over soil specific but salinity blind square root mixing model calibrations the large number of measurement times in the two drying cycles certainly provided large statistical power for distinguishing differences using soil and salinity specific square root mixing model calibrations instead of soil specific but salinity blind square root mixing model calibrations overall rmsd across all soils would be lowered from 0 015 to 0 014 m3 m 3 for tdr315 and from 0 018 to 0 015 m3 m 3 for cs655 although this difference in rmsd might not seem substantial the aforementioned θv dependence on salinity effects means that the direction and magnitude of sensor error may be changing noticeably during the timeframe of irrigation decision making accounting for salinity would be recommended especially when using cs655 as compared with tdr315 because only two salinity levels were evaluated in this study the development of a salinity correction for the two sensors was not attempted 3 4 correction for clay content effects considering the theories discussed above clay content was deemed to be the most appropriate predictive variable for interpolating the trends in the θv calibration for tdr315 and cs655 among the 15 soil columns of this study during the drying cycle with constant temperature and no added salinity for both sensors both coefficients a and b of the square root mixing model were quadratically related to clay content fig 5 the procedure for obtaining coefficients of the θv calibration equation from fig 5 will be hereafter referred to as the correction for clay content effects if this correction was applied to the data from which it was developed rmsd between sensor and reference θv would decrease roughly by 36 for both tdr315 and cs655 as compared with using the factory calibration the relative reduction in rmsd would be similar among soils for tdr315 but larger in clayeyer soils for cs655 overall these re substitution results suggest that the correction for clay content effects is able to remove a substantial portion of the clay content effects on sensor θv for both sensors external validation was conducted using the limited independent data from the literature chávez and evett 2012 schwartz et al 2016 caldwell et al 2018 singh et al 2018 kargas and soulis 2019 caldwell et al 2018 experimented with different wetting drying procedures to obtain a range of θv here for external validation only the data from the batch procedure was used after pooling soils bac and hnd together and soils fr and lub together based on similar clay contents to assemble more data points for rmsd calculations to avoid extrapolation comparisons were restricted to the range in reference θv spanned by both the cycle with constant temperature and no added salinity i e the dataset from which the correction for clay content effects was developed and the external study of interest in this cycle of the experiment the ranges in average reference θv were 0 011 0 272 m3 m 3 for the valent soil 0 106 0 457 m3 m 3 for the cozad soil 0 139 0 427 m3 m 3 for the kuma soil 0 229 0 455 m3 m 3 for the hastings soil and 0 243 0 469 m3 m 3 for the wymore soil fig 2 these ranges span and exceed those typically observed under irrigated conditions for each soil respectively overall the correction for clay content effects seemed to achieve increasing reduction in tdr315 and cs655 rmsd as clay content increased beyond 20 fig 6 the five studies differed widely in both reference methods and wetting drying methods chávez and evett 2012 was a field study where cs655 was compared against conventional tdr with soil specific calibration and the site was bare soil that included a repacked surface and was periodically flooded within a berm schwartz et al 2016 caldwell et al 2018 and kargas and soulis 2019 were laboratory studies where tdr315 or cs655 was compared against known θv in columns packed from uniform mixtures of water and dry soil singh et al 2018 was a field study where tdr315 and cs655 were compared against a neutron moisture meter nmm and the site was no till soybeans and was wetted by rainfall the correction for clay content effects clearly improving θv accuracy in multiple soils from contrasting experiments is definitely an optimistic finding readers should be aware of issues related to the transferability of corrections for clay content effects because real permittivity and losses due to dielectric relaxation and ionic conductivity are both affected by specific surface area and not by the prevalence of clay sized particles specific surface area is certainly a more direct predictor of clay content effects than is clay content itself yet because measurements of clay content are much more accessible than measurements of specific surface area the correction developed in this study used clay content as the predictor this choice would certainly limit the transferability of the correction to soils with distinctly different clay mineralogies nevertheless except where information about local clay mineralogy is widely available to guide the estimation of specific surface area from clay content or and wraith 1999 most users of reflectometers may not be able to apply corrections that used specific surface area as the predictor finally some em sensors preferentially respond to small wetter and drier spots in natural soil and thus overestimate θv logsdon 2009 so caution should be exercised when considering the transfer of corrections between laboratory and field 4 conclusions a laboratory study was conducted at the west central research and extension center north platte ne usa to analyze the performance of two recently developed electromagnetic em sensors tdr315 and cs655 in five nebraska soils the study evaluated how differences in clay content ranging from 5 to 49 temperature 24 versus 35 c and salinity 0 versus 3 09 g l 1 of added cacl2 affected volumetric water content θv reported by the em sensors using their factory calibrations for all five soils the relationship between tdr315 and reference θv was relatively linear with slope near unity the general pattern for tdr315 was that as clay content increased underestimation increased especially at lower θv in contrast the relationship between cs655 and reference θv was curvilinear for four out of the five soils as clay content increased the overall magnitude of overestimation and the most overestimated θv increased for cs655 in all five soils the temperature effect was more dramatic for cs655 than for tdr315 with respect to the kuma hastings and wymore soils the magnitude of the temperature effect increased with increasing clay content for tdr315 but decreased for cs655 although the effect of temperature on θv was statistically detectable for one of the two sensors the effect is expected to be negligible for most irrigation management applications salinity had an opposite effect on the performance of tdr315 than cs655 for tdr315 adding salinity slightly increased sensor θv in the valent kuma and wymore soils this increase was concentrated at intermediate θv in the valent soil but at high θv in the kuma and wymore soils for cs655 adding salinity decreased sensor θv moderately in the valent kuma hastings and wymore soils the magnitude of decrease increased with increasing θv in the valent soil but decreased in the kuma hastings and wymore soils accounting for the effects of salinity is recommended especially when using cs655 as compared with tdr315 in this study clay content was deemed to be an appropriate predictive variable for interpolating the trends in the θv calibration for tdr315 and cs655 therefore a correction for clay content effects was established applying the correction to the data from which it was developed rmsd between sensor and reference θv decreased roughly 36 for both tdr315 and cs655 external validation of the correction was also conducted using limited independent data from the literature the correction improved the results in soils with more than 20 clay content but not in less clayey soils these encouraging findings highlight the promise of simple empirical corrections such as the one developed in this study colleagues are invited to validate and refine this correction further future efforts should focus on developing corrections for clay content effects in the field and especially on bridging the advancements of modern soil physics with the practical challenges and

then gradual declined from 15 to 30 daf fig 3 the soluble protein content was significantly affected by growth period the changes in extreme low temperature at reviving stage significantly enhanced the soluble protein content the optimum environmental conditions at flowering stage favor the plant growth and significantly improved the soluble protein content as the plants goes to maturity the gradual decrease in soluble protein content were recorded mda accumulation was higher at reviving stage decreased at jointing stage and then gradual increased from jointing stage to 30 daf fig 4 at reviving stage the higher mda accumulation was attributed to cold conditions at jointing stage the mda accumulation was lower but as the plant growth proceeds the mda content showed an increasing

chlorophyll content net photosynthetic rate soluble protein content and anti oxidant enzymes activities table 4 4 discussion environmental stresses such as drought increased the accumulations of ros such as h2o2 and o2 and lead to degradation of photosynthetic pigments and reduce photosynthetic efficiency ali et al 2018 under water deficit conditions reduction in photosynthetic efficiency were recorded in soybean zhang et al 2007 in wheat gong et al 2005 and in rice widodo et al 2003 triazoles are also called stress protectants because of their ability to enhanced stress tolerance by enhancing the antioxidant defense system jaleel et al 2007 zhang et al 2010 soumya et al 2017 the application of uniconazole improved stress tolerance induced by waterlogging qiu et al 2005 heat zhou

significantly decreased under water deficit conditions fig 2 3 table 1 uniconazole has been reported to improve the cks biosynthesis and the higher cks improved significantly the chlorophyll content and pn liu et al 2015 huang et al 2015 wang et al 2009 reported that the uniconazole application significantly reduced the photosynthetic pigments degradation during the process of leaf senescence in maize and improved the grain yield uniconazole application improved chlorophyll and soluble protein contents compared with the control previous studies suggested that increased in photosynthetic efficiency and soluble protein content was recorded with exogenous uniconazole application leul and zhou 1998 zhang et al 2007 uniconazole application in combination with manganese significantly improved chlorophyll content pn and soluble protein content compared with the uniconazole applied alone the possible reason might be that manganese is an essential micronutrient which plays a key role in improving chlorophyll content soluble protein content and pn and hence in combination with uniconazole significantly improved the chlorophyll and protein contents compared with the uniconazole applied alone previous research suggested that manganese resulted in increased in chlorophyll and soluble protein contents marschner and rimmington 1988 meng et al 2016 the results of the present study suggested that the treatment smu2 and su2 significantly improved chlorophyll content soluble protein content and pn compared with the other treatments water deficit leads to generation of ros

strategies el hadrami et al 2005 sod cat pod and apx are the key enzymes that quench o2 and h2o2 and thus inhabit and reduced the accumulation of ros lee and lee 2000 zhao et al 2007 the application of triazoles improved the activity of antioxidant enzymes in various plant species gopi et al 2007 somasundaram et al 2009 pan et al 2013 previous studies suggested that sod enzyme play a key role in dismutation of o2 into oxygen and h2o2 alscher et al 2002 zhang et al 2010 and reduces the accumulation of destructive radicals under stress conditions smironoff 1993 pastori et al 2000 concluded that stresses leads to increase in the sod activity uniconazole applied alone or in combination with manganese significantly increased the sod activity while reduced the o2 content compared with the control treatment the sod activity gradually increased from reviving to jointing stage reached to its maximum at flowering stage and again declined from 15 to 30 daf while the o2 content was lower until flowering stage and increased significantly from 15 to 30 daf uniconazole application in combination with manganese significantly increased the sod activity while reduced the o2 content compared with the uniconazole applied alone treatments smu2 and su2 resulted in maximum sod activity and lower o2 accumulation compared with the other treatments the sod activity was significantly higher from reviving to flowering stage where the higher sod activity significantly reduced the o2 content after flowering stage the sod activity decreased where the lower sod activity resulted in higher o2 content this indicated that sod is the first line of defense against ros and play a pivotal role in stress tolerance in plants research suggested that manganese play role in anti oxidant defense system previous research suggested that uniconazole or triazoles application resulted in increased in sod activity kraus and fletcher 1994 zhou and ye 1996 zhang et al 2007 pan et al 2013 the higher sod activity significantly dismutase the o2 content zhang et al 2010 also concluded that the triazole application resulted in higher sod activity and reduced the o2 content in wheat leaves pod cat and apx are important anti oxidant enzymes which play role in scavenging h2o2 into oxygen and water the main product produced by sod asada 1992 shigeoka et al 2002 lafitte et al 2007 the activities of cat pod and apx are upregulated under water deficit conditions sankar et al 2007 jaleel et al 2007 our results showed that the cat activity gradually increased form reviving to jointing stage reached to its peak value at flowering stage and again decline from 15 to 30 daf while pod activity showed an increasing trend and reached to its peak value at 15 daf and again declined at 30 daf the apx activity showed an increasing trend and reached to its peak value at 30 daf this indicated that h2o2 generated by sod was removed by the induced activity of cat pod and apx after flowering stage the cat activity decreased but yet the h2o2 content was lower which indicated that higher pod activity at 15 daf significantly reduced the h2o2 content at 30 daf the cat and pod decreased but the apx activity was higher and thus reduced the h2o2 content significantly these results clearly reflect that the activities of cat pod and apx play an important role to inhabit the ros accumulations under stress conditions previous research suggested that cat pod and apx are important enzymes for decomposition of h2o2 into water and oxygen kocsy et al 1996 zhang et al 2010 our results suggested that uniconazole application with manganese resulted in maximum pod cat and apx activities compared with the uniconazole applied alone treatment smu2 and su2 resulted in maximum pod cat and apx activities and reduced the accumulation of h2o2 previous researches have shown that triazoles application under stress condition resulted in higher cat pod and apx activities kraus and fletcher 1994 zhang et al 2007 under stresses conditions mda is a main indicator of oxidative damage soumya et al 2017 water deficit results in higher mda accumulation and because of this reason it s commonly used as a stress marker sharma and dubey 2005 bhattacharjee 2014 the higher ros production results in higher mda accumulation liu et al 1997 zhang et al 2010 uniconazole application under water deficit conditions reduces the accumulation of mda zhang et al 2007 leul and zhou 1998 reported that the uniconazole application resulted in lower mda accumulation under stress conditions our results showed that mda accumulation was reduced significantly when uniconazole was applied alone or with manganese compared with the uniconazole applied alone uniconazole seed soaking with manganese resulted in lower mda accumulation treatment smu2 and su2 resulted in reduced mda accumulation compared with the rest of the treatments decreased in mda content with uniconazole and triazoles application was recorded by many researchers wang et al 2009 pan et al 2013 accumulations of proline under water deficient conditions act as osmolyte and promote damage repair ability kumar et al 2011 anjum et al 2011 water deficiency leads to accumulation of proline in wheat sawhney and singh 2002 and in soybean van and krüger 2002 our results showed that uniconazole applied alone or in combination with manganese resulted in lower proline accumulation treatment smu2 and su2 resulted in lower proline accumulation compared with the other treatments previous research suggested that application of triazoles resulted in reduced accumulation of proline under water deficiency mohamadi and rajaei 2013 reddy et al 2004 concluded that proline accumulation is positively correlated with drought tolerance our results showed that chlorophyll content soluble protein content and anti oxidant enzymes activities were negatively correlated with mda content proline content and ros there is a significant positive correlation between chlorophyll a and b contents soluble protein content pn and antioxidant enzymes activities the number of spikes m 2 grains spike 1 thousand kernel weight and grain yield were improved significantly with uniconazole applied alone or in combination with manganese uniconazole application in combination with manganese treatments resulted in higher chlorophyll content pn anti oxidant defense system and leaf area plant 1 and thus improved the number of spikes m 2 grains spike 1 thousand kernel weight and grain yield guoping et al 2001 also reported that the numbers of tillers were increased with uniconazole application higher grain yield during 2016 2017 growing season was probably due to higher precipitation compared with the 2015 2016 growing season fig 1 previous research suggested that uniconazole application resulted in higher grain yield han and yang 2009 wang et al 2009 2015 the su3 treatment resulted in lower grain yield compared with ck during both growing seasons the su3 significantly reduced the plant height data not shown furthermore the su3 treatments reduced the leaf area plant 1 number of grains spike 1 spikes m 2 and thousand kernel weight compared with the ck our previous research also showed that the uniconazole application at higher concentration reduced the grain yield in maize ahmad et al 2018a b wang et al 2015 also concluded that the higher concentration of uniconazole has inhibitory effect on common buckwheat and thus resulted in lower grain yield uniconazole is economical because of its lower cost 5 conclusion improvement in photosynthetic efficiency could results in higher crop productivity uniconazole applied alone or in combination with manganese significantly improved the photosynthetic efficiency of winter wheat the anti oxidant enzymes activities chlorophyll a and b contents soluble protein content pn and leaf area plant 1 were significantly improved while mda proline and ros contents were reduced with uniconazole applied alone or in combination with manganese moreover our results showed that the chlorophyll a and b contents soluble protein content pn and anti oxidant enzymes activities

arid and semiarid regions wheat productivity depends on natural precipitation zhang et al 2015 ren et al 2016 ali et al 2017 however precipitations in these regions are inadequate and average rainfall over a 48 years period was 379 mm li and gong 2002 wheat is sown in october and harvested in june while 72 of the precipitations occur between july and september in these regions wen et al 2012 water deficiency during the crucial growth stages resulted in reduces production by enhancing leaf senescence oxidative damages to photosynthetic machinery and reducing grain set kang et al 2002 farooq et al 2014 reddy et al 2004 concluded that under arid and semiarid regions deficit and unpredictable precipitation leads to drought stress which significantly affects the plant growth and development therefore protection of photosynthetic machinery during water deficiency in semiarid regions could result in higher wheat production water insufficiency leads to reactive oxygen species ros accumulation such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydroxyl radicals superoxide radical o2 and singlet oxygen which damages chlorophyll protein lipids carbohydrates and nucleic acid fridovich 1986 robinson

concentration depended and was significantly lower with higher uniconazole concentration 45 mg l 1 uniconazole application in combination with manganese significantly improved the leaf area plant 1 compared with the uniconazole applied alone mean of the two growing seasons results depicted that the treatments su1 and su2 increased the leaf area plant 1 at tillering stage by 7 7 and 12 6 respectively jointing stage by 18 7 and 31 1 flowering stage by 20 2 and 33 1 and grain filling stage by 50 and 81 8 while the treatment su3 decreased the leaf area plant 1 at tillering 2 8 jointing

enzymes activities and reactive oxygen species pearson s correlation analysis showed that there was a positive correlation between chlorophyll content net photosynthetic rate soluble protein content and anti oxidant enzymes activities there was a positive correlation between mda content proline content and ros mda content proline content and ros were significantly negatively correlated with chlorophyll content net photosynthetic rate soluble protein content and anti oxidant enzymes activities table 4 4 discussion environmental stresses such as drought increased the accumulations of ros such as h2o2 and o2 and lead to degradation of photosynthetic pigments and reduce photosynthetic efficiency ali et al 2018 under water deficit conditions reduction in photosynthetic efficiency were recorded in soybean zhang et al 2007 in wheat gong et al 2005 and in rice widodo et al 2003 triazoles are also called stress protectants because of their ability to enhanced stress tolerance by enhancing the antioxidant defense system jaleel et al 2007 zhang et al 2010 soumya et al 2017 the application of uniconazole improved stress tolerance induced by waterlogging qiu et al 2005 heat zhou and leul 1999 freezing leul and zhou 1998 and drought zhang et al 2007 the results of the present study showed that the chlorophyll content pn and soluble protein content of leaves in wheat were significantly decreased under water deficit conditions fig 2 3 table 1 uniconazole has been reported to improve the cks biosynthesis and the higher cks improved significantly the chlorophyll content and pn liu et al 2015 huang et al 2015 wang et al 2009 reported that the uniconazole application significantly reduced the photosynthetic pigments degradation during the process of leaf senescence in maize and improved the grain yield uniconazole application improved chlorophyll and soluble protein contents compared with the control previous studies suggested that increased in photosynthetic efficiency and soluble protein content was recorded with exogenous uniconazole application leul and zhou 1998 zhang et al 2007 uniconazole application in combination with manganese significantly improved chlorophyll content pn and soluble protein content compared with the uniconazole applied alone the possible reason might be that manganese is an essential micronutrient which plays a key role in improving chlorophyll content soluble protein content and pn and hence in combination with uniconazole significantly improved the chlorophyll and protein contents compared with the uniconazole applied alone previous research suggested that manganese resulted in increased in chlorophyll and soluble protein contents marschner and rimmington 1988 meng et al 2016 the results of the present study suggested that the treatment smu2 and su2 significantly improved chlorophyll content soluble protein content and pn compared with the other treatments water deficit leads to generation of ros which damages lipids photosynthetic pigments protein and nucleic acid fridovich 1986 robinson and bunce 2000 in order to reduce or eliminate the ros accumulations plants have evolved anti oxidative strategies el hadrami et al 2005 sod cat pod and apx are the key enzymes that quench o2 and h2o2 and thus inhabit and reduced the accumulation of ros lee and lee 2000 zhao et al 2007 the application of triazoles improved the activity of antioxidant enzymes in various plant species gopi et al 2007 somasundaram et al 2009 pan et al 2013 previous studies suggested that sod enzyme play a key role in dismutation of o2 into oxygen and h2o2 alscher et al 2002 zhang et al 2010 and reduces the accumulation of destructive radicals under stress conditions smironoff 1993 pastori et al 2000 concluded that stresses leads to increase in the sod activity uniconazole applied alone or in combination with manganese significantly increased the sod activity while reduced the o2 content compared with the control treatment the sod activity gradually increased from reviving to jointing stage reached to its maximum at flowering stage and again declined from 15 to 30 daf while the o2 content was lower until flowering stage and increased significantly from 15 to 30 daf uniconazole application in combination with manganese significantly increased the sod activity while reduced the o2 content compared with the uniconazole applied alone treatments smu2 and su2 resulted in maximum sod activity and lower o2 accumulation compared with the other treatments the sod activity was significantly higher from reviving to flowering stage where the higher sod activity significantly reduced the o2 content after flowering stage the sod activity decreased where the lower sod activity resulted in higher o2 content this indicated that sod is the first line of defense against ros and play a pivotal role in stress tolerance in plants research suggested that manganese play role in anti oxidant defense system previous research suggested that uniconazole or triazoles application resulted in increased in sod activity kraus and fletcher 1994 zhou and ye 1996 zhang et al 2007 pan et al 2013 the higher sod activity significantly dismutase the o2 content zhang et al 2010 also concluded that the triazole application resulted in higher sod activity and reduced the o2 content in wheat leaves pod cat and apx are important anti oxidant enzymes which play role in scavenging h2o2 into oxygen and water the main product produced by sod asada 1992 shigeoka et al 2002 lafitte et al 2007 the activities of cat pod and apx are upregulated under water deficit conditions sankar et al 2007 jaleel et al 2007 our results showed that the cat activity gradually increased form reviving to jointing stage reached to its peak value at flowering stage and again decline from 15 to 30 daf while pod activity showed an increasing trend and reached to its peak value at 15 daf and again declined at 30 daf the apx activity showed an increasing trend and reached to its peak value at 30 daf this indicated that h2o2 generated by sod was removed by the induced activity of cat pod and apx after flowering stage the cat activity decreased but yet the h2o2 content was lower which indicated that higher pod activity at 15 daf significantly reduced the h2o2 content at 30 daf the cat and pod decreased but the apx activity was higher and thus reduced the h2o2 content significantly these results clearly reflect that the activities of cat pod and apx play an important role to inhabit the ros accumulations under stress conditions previous research suggested that cat pod and apx are important enzymes for decomposition of h2o2 into water and oxygen kocsy et al 1996 zhang et al 2010 our results suggested that uniconazole application with manganese resulted in maximum pod cat and apx activities compared with the uniconazole applied alone treatment smu2 and su2 resulted in maximum pod cat and apx activities and reduced the accumulation of h2o2 previous researches have shown that triazoles application under stress condition resulted in higher cat pod and apx activities kraus and fletcher 1994 zhang et al 2007 under stresses conditions mda is a main indicator of oxidative damage soumya et al 2017 water deficit results in higher mda accumulation and because of this reason it s commonly used as a stress marker sharma and dubey 2005 bhattacharjee 2014 the higher ros production results in higher mda accumulation liu et al 1997 zhang et al 2010 uniconazole application under water deficit conditions reduces the accumulation of mda zhang et al 2007 leul and zhou 1998 reported that the uniconazole application resulted in lower mda accumulation under stress conditions our results showed that mda accumulation was reduced significantly when uniconazole was applied alone or with manganese compared with the uniconazole applied alone uniconazole seed soaking with manganese resulted in lower mda accumulation treatment smu2 and su2 resulted in reduced mda accumulation compared with the rest of the treatments decreased in mda content with uniconazole and triazoles application was recorded by many researchers wang et al 2009 pan et al 2013 accumulations of proline under water deficient conditions act as osmolyte and promote damage repair ability kumar et al 2011 anjum et al 2011 water deficiency leads to accumulation of proline in wheat sawhney and singh 2002 and in soybean van and krüger 2002 our results showed that uniconazole applied alone or in combination with manganese resulted in lower proline accumulation treatment smu2 and su2 resulted in lower proline accumulation compared with the other treatments previous research suggested that application of triazoles resulted in reduced accumulation of proline under water deficiency mohamadi and rajaei 2013 reddy et al 2004 concluded that proline accumulation is positively correlated with drought tolerance our results showed that chlorophyll content soluble protein content and anti oxidant enzymes activities were negatively correlated with mda content proline content and ros there is a significant positive correlation between chlorophyll a and b contents soluble protein content pn and antioxidant enzymes activities the number of spikes m 2 grains spike 1 thousand kernel weight and grain yield were improved significantly with uniconazole applied alone or in combination with manganese uniconazole application in combination with manganese treatments resulted in higher chlorophyll content pn anti oxidant defense system and leaf area plant 1 and thus improved the number of spikes m 2 grains spike 1 thousand kernel weight and grain yield guoping et al 2001 also reported that the numbers of tillers were increased with uniconazole application higher grain yield during 2016 2017 growing season was probably due to higher precipitation compared with the 2015 2016 growing season fig 1 previous research suggested that uniconazole application resulted in higher grain yield han and yang 2009 wang et al 2009 2015 the su3 treatment resulted in lower grain yield compared with ck during both growing seasons the su3 significantly reduced the plant height data not shown furthermore the su3 treatments reduced the leaf area plant 1 number of grains spike 1 spikes m 2 and thousand kernel weight compared with the ck our previous research also showed that the uniconazole application at higher concentration reduced the grain yield in maize ahmad et al 2018a b wang et al 2015 also concluded that the higher concentration of uniconazole has inhibitory effect on common buckwheat and thus resulted in lower grain yield uniconazole is economical because of its lower cost 5 conclusion improvement in photosynthetic efficiency could results in higher crop productivity uniconazole applied alone or in combination with manganese significantly improved the photosynthetic efficiency of winter wheat the anti oxidant enzymes activities chlorophyll a and b contents soluble protein content pn and leaf area plant 1 were significantly improved while mda proline and ros contents were reduced with uniconazole applied alone or in combination with manganese moreover our results showed that the chlorophyll a and b contents soluble protein content pn and anti oxidant enzymes activities were significantly negatively correlated with ros mda and proline contents wheat production was improved significantly with uniconazole seed soaking in combination with manganese treatments it is concluded from our research that the treatments sum2 and su2 improved the anti oxidant defense system and winter wheat production in semiarid regions funding this study was supported by funding from

11132,soil organic nitrogen fractions and soil soluble nitrogen pools are important indicators of soil fertility and plant nutrition requirements however little is known about soil organic nitrogen fractions and their correlations with soil mineral nitrogen smn and soluble organic nitrogen son a five year field experiment was conducted to determine the effects of lower irrigation limits 25 35 and 45 kpa and nitrogen fertilization 75 300 and 525 kg ha 1 rates on greenhouse soil organic nitrogen fractions and soil soluble nitrogen pools the results indicated that the soil organic nitrogen fractions and soil soluble nitrogen pools were significantly affected by the irrigation and nitrogen fertilization rates and their interactions at various greenhouse soil depths p 0 01 the soil organic nitrogen occurred mainly in the form of acid hydrolyzable n ahn the soil organic nitrogen fractions other than the amino sugar n asn and the soil soluble nitrogen pools smn and son decreased with increasing soil depth our findings suggest that ammonium n an amino acid n aan and smn may predict the soil nitrogen supply potential in greenhouse agroecosystems soil total nitrogen ntotal soil

nitrogen utilization irrigation lower limit nitrogen fertilizer rate optimizing schedule 1 introduction irrigation and nitrogen are the major limiting factors affecting crop yield water use efficiency and nitrogen uptake dai et al 2019 gao et al 2017 wang et al 2017b however excessive irrigation and nitrogen fertilization may cause soil degeneration nitrogen leaching and low water and nitrogen use efficiency especially under the high temperature and moisture conditions of a greenhouse chen et al 2004 fan et al 2014 ju et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 irrigation is the only soil water source in the greenhouse irrigation and nitrogen fertilization scheduling may directly or indirectly affect microbial activity and soil nitrogen availability which in turn influence soil organic nitrogen content and distribution ji et al 2014 nguyen and shindo 2011 soil organic nitrogen accounts for more than 90 of the soil total nitrogen ntotal its structure and availability play pivotal roles in soil nitrogen retention mineralization and nitrogen supply stevenson 1982 small molecules like amino acids are directly absorbed intact by crops most of the soil organic nitrogen however must first be transformed into mineral nitrogen by mineralization before it can be absorbed by crops mishra et al 2005 yang et al 2016 soil mineral nitrogen smn and soluble organic nitrogen son levels have been used to measure and predict soil nitrogen mineralization and immobilization chen et al 2005 ros et al 2009 soil soluble nitrogen pools participate in nitrogen mineralization and are key indicators of nitrogen mineralization characteristics zhang et al 2017 therefore smn and son may reflect soil fertility and nitrogen supply potential according to the bremner and stevenson there are acid

et al 2009 yan and quan 2013 zhang et al 2016 however the roles of the soil organic nitrogen fractions in soil nitrogen supply under greenhouse conditions are not fully understood there are few published reports concerning the relationship between the soil organic nitrogen fractions and the soil soluble nitrogen pools in the greenhouse we hypothesized that both irrigation and nitrogen rates combined effects are critical in the improvement of the soil nitrogen supply they also influence the soil organic nitrogen fractions and the soil soluble nitrogen pools optimized irrigation and nitrogen rates could maximize nutrient supply and crop yield while minimizing adverse environmental effects the objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of the irrigation and nitrogen rates on the soil nitrogen fractions and soluble nitrogen pools the impact of the water and fertilizer application rate on soil total n excluding nitrate tn and total soluble nitrogen tsn were also assessed the effects of the soil soluble nitrogen pools on the soil organic nitrogen fractions in greenhouse soil were also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and experimental design the study site was the greenhouse at the experimental station of shenyang agricultural university latitude 41 49 n longitude 123 34 e in liaoning province china the experimental area has a temperate semi humid continental monsoon climate the mean annual temperature and the sunlight duration were 7 0 8 1 c and 2445 7 h respectively the frost free period was 148 180 d the greenhouse field experiment was established in 2012 initially the soil a haplic luvisol was compacted and had low fertility cow manure 22 5 t fw ha 1 was added to the soil in the spring of 2012 and 2013 chicken manure 26 4 t fw ha 1 was applied to the soil annually before the onset of the experiment before the 2012 experiment the soil organic matter was 10 9 g kg 1 the total n was 1 4 g kg 1 the available n was 59 5 mg kg 1 the available k was 88 8 mg kg 1 and the olsen p was 26 3 mg kg 1 in the top 30 cm the soil bulk density was 1 56 g cm 3 and the soil ph was 7 0 soil water 2 5 1 a two factor nitrogen application rate and irrigation lower limit three level randomized block design was used with four replicates and nine treatments the experimental treatments included three irrigation lower limits 25 kpa i1 35 kpa i2 and 45 kpa i3 and three nitrogen application rates 75 n1 300 n2 and 525 n3 kg ha 1 urea was used as the n fertilizer single tomato crops solanum lycopersicum l var green fortune were cultivated annually in the greenhouse from may to august using the aforementioned experimental design the greenhouse was maintained under natural light and temperature and covered with polyethylene film throughout the year to exclude rainfall except for the growing period the greenhouse was left fallow to minimize the impact of continuous cropping in addition to manuring calcium superphosphate 12 p2o5 and potassium sulfate 50 k2o were applied at 220 kg p2o5 ha 1 y 1 and 300 kg k2o ha 1 y 1 one third of the nitrogen and potassium fertilizer was applied as basal and the remaining fertilizer was dissolved and applied along with drip irrigation during the first and second ear fruit periods june 19 2016 and july 16 2016 respectively the calcium superphosphate was applied as a basal fertilizer in every treatment the area of each plot was 2 5 m2 and a total of 576 tomato seeds were sown the limited area of plot reduced soil spatial heterogeneity each plot was protected from intra plot water and nutrient seepage with 8 mil polyethylene films buried vertically to a depth of 0 6 m below the soil surface after the installation of the films the disturbed surface soil and subsoil were replaced in their corresponding layers drip irrigation in the form of tap water was applied under the plastic films irrigation was supplied based on tensiometer readings taken at 8 00 a m and 30 cm soil depth with 5 cm distance to drip hole when the tensiometer readings reached the soil water suction value at the irrigation lower limit they were converted into soil moisture content using the experimental soil water characteristic curve θ 0 5205 1 6382 43h 11 501 0 0094 r 0 995 p 0 01 where h is soil water suction kpa and θ is soil moisture content m3 m 3 the irrigation upper limit was the soil field

random soil cores in each plot at 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm soil depths visible stone and plant debris were manually removed the fresh soil samples were immediately brought to the laboratory and stored at 4 c before the smn and son determinations each soil sample was homogenized air dried and milled to pass through a 0 15 mm sieve for the soil organic nitrogen fraction and ntotal determinations 2 3 analysis of soil properties and soil soluble n pools soil organic carbon soc and ntotal were determined using an element analyzer vario el iii elementar langenselbold germany smn sum of nh4 n and no3 n was extracted with 0 01 m cacl2 then measured using a seal aa3 auto analyzer seal analytical inc mequon wi usa the k2s2o8 oxidation method was used to determine tsn and son in soil leachates filtered through 0 45 μm mixed cellulose filters nh4 n and son in the leachates were oxidized and converted to no3 n by reacting them with 0 15 m naoh and 3 w v k2s2o8 at 123 c for 30

no3 n total soil organic nitrogen tson was calculated as the difference between ntotal and smn all results were expressed on a dry weight basis 2 4 analysis of soil organic n fractions soil organic nitrogen fractions were determined by the micro kjeldahl method soil samples were hydrolyzed with 6 m hcl for 12 h to measure the organic nitrogen fractions stevenson 1982 total ahn an aan and an asn were determined by steam distillation with 10 m naoh 3 5 w v mgo phosphate borate buffer at ph 11 2 and oxidized ninhydrin powder followed by phosphate borate buffer respectively asn was calculated as the difference between an asn and an un was calculated as the difference between total ahn and an aan asn nhn was calculated by subtracting ahn from tn 2 5 statistical analysis two way anova was used to analyze the effects of irrigation lower limit ill nitrogen application rate nar and their interactions on the soil organic n fractions and the soil soluble n pools for the multiple comparisons a post hoc duncan test was used to compare the differences among the treatments at the p 0 05 and p 0 01 levels pearson correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the relationships among soil parameter variables in spss v 21 0 ibm corp armonk ny usa plots were generated with origin pro v 9 3 originlab corp northampton ma usa constrained ordination was used to identify the soil organic nitrogen fractions explained by the soil soluble nitrogen pools and other correlations the response dataset soil organic nitrogen fractions was subjected to detrended correspondence analysis dca which indicated the lengths of the ordination axes the first axis was 0 7 sd which indicated the appropriate linear response ordination method the ordination was then subjected to redundancy analysis rda in canoco v 5 04 prior to the rda the soil organic nitrogen fractions data were simultaneously log x 1 transformed and standardized by error variance the variance inflation factor vif was used to identify multicollinearity among the explanatory variables those with vif 10 were discarded an automated forward selection of explained variables was implemented to determine statistical significance using 999 monte carlo permutations p 0 05 significances of the conditional effects were obtained for each variable in the rda 3 results 3 1 basic soil properties ntotal tson soc nh4 n and no3 n levels were significantly different among the soil depths p 0 05 no labels in table 1 ntotal tson and soc decreased with soil depth table 1 the no3 n content at 0 20 cm soil depth was highest in the i2n3 treatment the tson content at the 10 30 cm soil depth was highest in the i3n1 treatment the anova indicated that ill nar and their interactions significantly impacted ntotal tson and no3 n table 1 p 0 01 they had no significant effect on soc at the 0 30 cm soil depth ill nar and their interactions had disparate effects on c n and nh4 n at the various soil depths table 1 3 2 content and distribution of soil organic nitrogen fractions in greenhouse soil 3 2 1 soil total n excluding nitrate acid hydrolyzable n and non hydrolyzable n at the 0 30 cm soil depth the tn ahn and nhn ranges were 654 52 2014 55 388 98 1170 33 and 189 11 956 84 mg kg 1 respectively table 2 based on the data in table 2 ahn and nhn accounted for 40 59 86 03 and 13 97 59 41 of the tn respectively with increasing soil depth tn ahn and nhn decreased significantly in all cases except for certain nhn determinations ill nar and their interactions had very significant effects on tn ahn and nhn at the 0 30 cm soil depth in contrast the lowest soil ahn level at the 0 30 cm soil depth was obtained for the i1n2 treatment the second lowest was found in the i3n2 treatment 3 2 2 amino acid n and ammonium n under the various irrigation and nitrogen fertilization regimes the ranges of aan and an were 64 47 508 91 and 118 99 532 36 mg kg 1 respectively fig 1 at the various soil depths aan and an accounted for 7 22 32 70 and 12 41 39 34 of the tn respectively table 3 the contents and distributions of aan and an decreased with increasing soil depth the differences among the various irrigation and nitrogen treatments reached the 5 significance level two way anova indicated that ill nar and their interactions extremely significantly affected the content and distribution of aan and an at the various soil depths in contrast the highest aan level was found in the i2n1 treatment and the second highest in the i2n2 treatment but the difference between them was not significant the highest an levels at the 0 20 cm and 20 30 cm soil depths were found in the i2n3 and i2n2 treatments respectively and they were significantly higher than those measured in the other treatments 3 2 3 amino sugar n and unknown n under the various irrigation and nitrogen fertilization regimes the ranges of asn and un were 12 37 137 89 and 47 20 310 98 mg kg 1 respectively fig 1 at the various soil depths asn and un contributed 7 22 32 70 and 12 41 39 34 to the tn respectively table 3 compared with other ahn fractions the content and distribution of asn were the lowest the content and distribution of asn and un varied with soil depth under different irrigation and nitrogen regimes two way anova demonstrated that ill nar and their interactions very significantly affected the distribution of asn at the various soil depths nevertheless the effects of ill nar and their interactions on the distribution of un varied with soil depth in contrast the lowest asn and un levels at the 0 20 cm soil depth were found in the i1n1 and i2n3 treatments respectively the un at the 20 30 cm soil depth was highest in the i2n3 treatment and lowest in the i1n1 treatment except for asn the levels of all ahn fractions decreased with increasing soil depth under the various irrigation and nitrogen fertilization regimes the content and distribution of asn were the lowest irrigation nitrogen fertilization and their interactions caused significant differences among the content and distribution of the soil organic nitrogen fractions the order of the content and distribution of the soil ahn fractions at the various soil depths was aan an un asn 3 3 content and distribution of soil soluble nitrogen pools in greenhouse soil the content and distribution of smn and son at the 0 30 cm soil depth under different irrigation and nitrogen fertilization regimes are shown in table 4 and fig 2 two way anova indicated that ill nar and their interactions significantly affected the levels of tsn smn and son and the proportions of smn and son in tsn at various soil depths under different irrigation and nitrogen regimes the exceptions were the effect of ill on the tsn content and the effect of nar on the distribution at the 0 10 cm soil depth in general the tsn smn and son levels were highest at the soil surface accumulation and lowest at the 10 20 cm soil depth in contrast at the 0 20 cm soil depth tsn smn and son were highest in the i2n3 treatment and lowest in the i2n1 treatment the proportion of smn in tsn was higher than that of son in tsn the average smn proportion in tsn was 63 9 for the various soil depths the proportion of smn in tsn at the 0 30 cm soil depth was highest in the i2n1 treatment and the results of multiple comparisons showed that the smn contents at the 0 20 cm soil depth always were the highest in i2 35 kpa level in greenhouse 3 4 relationships between soil organic n fractions and soil soluble nitrogen pools the pearson correlation coefficients between the soil organic nitrogen fractions and the soil soluble nitrogen pools indicated that smn nh4 n and no3 n were all significantly positively correlated with an and ahn nh4 n was also significantly positively correlated with aan there was no significant difference between son and the soil organic nitrogen fractions ntotal tson and soc were very significantly positively correlated with the soil organic nitrogen fractions except asn and nhn were not correlated with soc c n was significantly and very significantly positively correlated with un and nhn respectively table 5 the pearson correlation was also confirmed by the rda results which demonstrated that ntotal soc and no3 n were the best explanatory variables they accounted for very significant proportions of the variations in the soil organic nitrogen fractions under the different irrigation and nitrogen fertilization regimes fig 3 the first two constrained axes explained 61 36 and 14 86 of the total variation in the soil organic nitrogen fractions respectively the first canonical axis f 33 4 p 0 001 and the sum of all canonical axes f 14 1 p 0 001 were very significantly different according to the monte carlo test an aan ahn and un had similar loadings along the first axis asn and nhn had high relative contributions to the second axis ntotal and soc were significantly positively correlated with an ahn aan and un no3 n was positively correlated with asn along the second axis nhn was only positively correlated with ntotal 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization on the soil organic nitrogen fractions in greenhouse soil nitrogen is the key limiting factor for crop growth the compositions and contents of soil organic nitrogen fractions are closely linked with soil nitrogen supply potential li and li 2014 liu et al 2016 kielland et al 2007 shahid et al 2017 moreover organic nitrogen is the main form in the soil and the proportions of the soil organic nitrogen fractions contributing to the total soil nitrogen vary with nitrogen application rate irrigation and tillage practices yan et al 2016 tian et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 in our study the results indicated that the content and distribution of the soil organic nitrogen fractions differed significantly under various irrigation and nitrogen fertilization regimes tables 2 and 3 these findings were consistent with those reported previously tian et al 2017 the ahn content was higher than that of nhn and highest in the i2n2 treatment at the 0 10 cm soil depth however the ahn content was lowest in the i1n2 treatment followed by i3n2 treatment table 2 which demonstrated too high 25 kpa or low irrigation level 45 kpa all were detrimental for the accumulation of ahn in greenhouse soil therefore the soil organic nitrogen fractions consisted mainly of ahn and moderate irrigation and nitrogen regimes were conducive to promoting the soil nitrogen supply potential in greenhouse soil several studies have shown that the irrigation and fertilization influence soil organic matter mineralization and humification which account for the relative differences in ahn content wang et al 2017a zhang et al 2017 therefore the ahn fraction content and distribution were indicative of the effects of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization on soil organic nitrogen transformation nguyen and shindo 2011 unlike certain other agroecosystems the greenhouse soil temperature is high and humidity is larger so that the microbial activities and the mineralization of organic nitrogen irrigation are all correspondingly enhanced consequently the special environmental conditions of greenhouse soil water fertilizer aeration and temperature may have more obvious influence on the soil organic nitrogen fractions distribution even the soil nitrogen supply capacity in a greenhouse ecosystem the content and distribution of all ahn fractions except for asn decreased with increasing soil depth and they differed significantly fig 1 p 0 05 these observations were consistent with previous research results durani et al 2016 li and li 2014 santos et al 2014 the order of the content and distribution of the soil ahn fractions was aan an un asn this finding also corroborated those reported in earlier studies chadwick et al 2000 li and li 2014 which indicated that the distributions of the soil organic nitrogen fractions were similar across different agroecosystems the present study demonstrated that an and aan were the main forms of soil organic nitrogen in greenhouse soil fig 2 gonzález prieto et al 1997 indicated that readily hydrolyzed organic nitrogen fractions especially aan asn and an were the most active nitrogen reservoirs and used as the main source of the crop uptake li and li 2014 showed that an asn and aan were easily mineralized and those contents determined the nitrogen mineralization rate even soil nitrogen supply capacity zhang et al 2006 reported there were linear correlations among an and aan and organic nitrogen mineralization rate and an and aan were considered to be the main source of soil labile organic nitrogen that can promote soil nitrogen supply capacity bardgett et al 2003 reported that aan was the main source of available nitrogen in the soil and it predominated in soil available nitrogen pools lü et al 2013 demonstrated that the an serves as a temporary nitrogen pool storing large quantities of labile organic nitrogen therefore an and aan are the most important and the main forms of soil organic nitrogen they are also the key indicators of soil nitrogen supply potential in greenhouse soil and the correlation analysis showed there was a significant positive correlation between an and aan r 0 858 data not shown in our study moreover the contents of aan and an all were highest in i2 35 kpa irrigation level fig 1 and table 3 which may be the result of microbial activity influenced by irrigation moderate irrigation 35 kpa level in turn may affect microbial activity by modulating soil moisture aeration and temperature thereby influencing soil organic nitrogen turnover hallin et al 2018 ji et al 2014 furthermore nitrogen fertilization directly influences the source and availability of soil nitrogen for microbes an and aan all were high in the i2n2 35 kpa 300 kg ha 1 treatment so moderate nitrogen fertilizer irrigation regimes could improve the greenhouse soil nitrogen supply potential most of the aan occurs in the form of polymers associated with soil microbial metabolism and acts as a transitional nitrogen pool linking soil nitrogen reserves with crop nitrogen uptake and nhn functions as a stable nitrogen pool closely correlated with the retention of fertilizer derived nitrogen lü et al 2013 luxhøi et al 2007 sørensen 2004 so far the specific composition structure and functions of nhn are not very clear and need to be further studied two way anova indicated that ill nar and their interactions very significantly affected the content and distribution of the soil organic nitrogen fractions at various soil depths and there were significant differences among the soil organic nitrogen fractions under the various irrigation and nitrogen fertilization regimes tables 2 and 3 these might be explained by the fact that soil microbial metabolism is promoted by moderate soil water and substrate conditions judy et al 2017 stanford and epstein 1974 showed that the increasing irrigation significantly improves soil nutrient availability and soil nitrogen mineralization is positively correlated with soil moisture certain studies have also reported that soil nitrogen mineralization and nitrification increase with soil temperature koyama et al 2010 lang et al 2010 sierra 2002 zaman and chang 2004 due to the special soil water and temperature conditions in the greenhouse their effects on the soil organic nitrogen fractions there require further study 4 2 effects of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization on soil soluble nitrogen pools soil soluble nitrogen pools are labile nitrogen sources for soil microorganisms and crops jones et al 2005 murphy et al 2000 nasholm et al 1998 moreover the content and distribution of soil soluble nitrogen pools vary with soil type nitrogen application rate tillage and other factors huygens et al 2016 liang et al 1995 smith 1987 zhang et al 2016 2017 the results indicated that ill nar and their interactions very significantly affected the soil soluble nitrogen pools smn and son at various soil depths table 4 and fig 2 in our study the tsn smn and son levels all were highest in the i2n3 35 kpa 525 kg ha 1 treatments this observation may be explained by the fact that microbial and plant root nitrogen fertilizer uptake under moderate irrigation stimulated nitrogen mineralization and the cause of the higher mineral nitrogen fertilizer application rate soto et al 2015 and the smn contents at the 0 20 cm soil depth always were the highest in i2 35 kpa level in greenhouse which indicate moderate irrigation level increased the smn contents several researches demonstrated moderate irrigation increases soil temperature and decreases soil bulk density both of which enhance soil microorganism metabolism sun and mu 2013 wang et al 2008 the tsn smn and son levels were higher in the n3 525 kg ha 1 than the n1 75 kg ha 1 treatments higher nitrogen fertilizer application rate increased tsn smn and son contents possibly by reacting with soil organic nitrogen promoting no3 n accumulation and nitrogen mineralization in greenhouse soil huang et al 2018 high temperatures and moisture levels may prompt the microbial decomposition of soil organic nitrogen mineralized into smn stanford and epstein 1974 the present study demonstrated that the content and proportion of smn in tsn all were higher than those of son and the tsn smn and son levels were stable in greenhouse soil under different ill nar regimes table 4 and fig 2 which indicated that smn was main available nitrogen form in soil soluble nitrogen pools a large number of field results demonstrated that the cumulative amount of nitrate nitrogen from the 0 to 100 cm soil layer was significantly correlated to crop uptake n with a correlation coefficient of 0 908 and nitrate n was the major form existing in dryland soils and due to high ph buffering capacity it was also the major form taken up by plants li et al 2009 moreover microbial son assimilation and the competition between microbes and plants for son may have caused the accumulation of smn liang et al 1995 4 3 roles of the soil organic nitrogen fractions and the soil soluble nitrogen pools in the soil nitrogen supply potential both the soil organic nitrogen fractions and the soil soluble nitrogen pools are closely correlated with the soil nitrogen supply potential li et al 2009 lü et al 2013 therefore the soil organic nitrogen fractions may be tightly linked to the soil soluble nitrogen pools most soil organic nitrogen can be directly absorbed by plants such like amino acids nasholm et al 2009 the majority of the soil organic nitrogen must first be transformed into mineral nitrogen which can then be absorbed by the roots mishra et al 2005 nannipieri and eldor 2009 the results revealed that smn is significantly positively correlated with an and ahn table 5 son is not correlated with the soil organic nitrogen fractions but is closely correlated with both smn and tsn data not shown the present study indicated the soil organic nitrogen fractions other than nhn and asn are positively correlated with the soil soluble nitrogen pools but not at the 5 significance level fig 3 ntotal soc and no3 n significantly influence soil organic nitrogen fractions but son and nh4 n do not the soil organic nitrogen exists mainly in the form of stable organic nitrogen and the potential soil organic nitrogen transformation may be limited by the carbon source hurisso et al 2015 liu et al 2016 prado et al 2016 shahid et al 2017 ntotal soc and no3 n play different key roles in the soil organic nitrogen turnover ntotal and soc contribute positively to ahn an un and aan ntotal also has a positive effect on nhn soc may become the limiting factor in soil organic nitrogen cycling when soc was limited microorganisms could use low molecular weight nitrogenous compounds like amino acids and amino sugars as carbon sources brogowski and chojnicki 2013 hurisso et al 2015 liu et al 2016 shahid et al 2017 winck et al 2014 an is considered a nitrogen source for microbial and plant growth lü et al 2013 nh4 n is significantly positively correlated with an aan and ahn however available nh4 n is relatively low in greenhouse soil because of the particular environmental conditions in the greenhouse table 1 nevertheless no3 n contributes negatively to nhn in contrast the available no3 n level was very high relative to the available nh4 n in greenhouse soil table 1 nitrification may account for most of the soil nitrogen cycling in greenhouse soil penton et al 2013 rudisill et al 2016 several studies reported that soil microbes affected by soil environmental conditions participate substantially in soil organic nitrogen transformation clark et al 2015 lang et al 2016 nannipieri and eldor 2009 rothrock et al 2010 in our study the soil organic nitrogen fractions and the soil soluble nitrogen pools are affected by the irrigation and nitrogen fertilization rates and play key roles in soil nitrogen cycling under greenhouse conditions soil organic nitrogen fractions and soil soluble nitrogen pools contribute significantly to the soil nitrogen supply potential in greenhouse soil which may serve as key indicators of the soil nitrogen supply potential aan an and smn including nh4 n and no3 n are the main components of the soil organic nitrogen fractions and soil soluble nitrogen pools respectively therefore aan an and smn are the main components of soil available nitrogen and the key indicators of greenhouse soil nitrogen supply potential given the results mentioned above considering water saving nitrogen reduction and soil nitrogen supply optimization we concluded that the most efficient irrigation and nitrogen fertilization regime and the optimal soil nitrogen supply capacity could be obtained in the i2n1 and i2n2 treatments respectively the roles of aan an and smn in soil nitrogen supply potential and capacity under various ill nar regimes merit further investigation particularly in the greenhouse agroecosystem 5 conclusions the present five year greenhouse study indicated that irrigation nitrogen fertilization and their interactions significantly influenced the content and distribution of the soil organic nitrogen fractions and the soil soluble nitrogen pools at various soil depths soil total nitrogen ntotal soil organic carbon soc and no3 n played important roles in the soil organic nitrogen fractions our findings suggested that soil mineral nitrogen smn amino acid n aan and ammonium n an were the main components of the soil available nitrogen and key indicators of the soil nitrogen supply potential in the greenhouse agroecosystem the results demonstrated that optimizing the irrigation and nitrogen fertilization schedules effectively enhances the soil nitrogen supply potential and improves soil fertility considering water saving nitrogen reduction and soil nitrogen supply optimization we concluded that the most efficient irrigation and nitrogen fertilization regime and the optimal soil nitrogen supply capacity could be obtained in the i2n1 and i2n2

11132,soil organic nitrogen fractions and soil soluble nitrogen pools are important indicators of soil fertility and plant nutrition requirements however little is known about soil organic nitrogen fractions and their correlations with soil mineral nitrogen smn and soluble organic nitrogen son a five year field experiment was conducted to determine the effects of lower irrigation limits 25 35 and 45 kpa and nitrogen fertilization 75 300 and 525 kg ha 1 rates on greenhouse soil organic nitrogen fractions and soil soluble nitrogen pools the results indicated that the soil organic nitrogen fractions and soil soluble nitrogen pools were significantly affected by the irrigation and nitrogen fertilization rates and their interactions at various greenhouse soil depths p 0 01 the soil organic nitrogen occurred mainly in the form of acid hydrolyzable n ahn the soil organic nitrogen fractions other than the amino sugar n asn and the soil soluble nitrogen pools smn and son decreased with increasing soil depth our findings suggest that ammonium n an amino acid n aan and smn may predict the soil nitrogen supply potential in greenhouse agroecosystems soil total nitrogen ntotal soil organic carbon soc and nitrate nitrogen no3 n appeared to be the major factors explaining the soil organic nitrogen fractions considering water saving nitrogen reduction and soil nitrogen supply

nitrogen utilization irrigation lower limit nitrogen fertilizer rate optimizing schedule 1 introduction irrigation and nitrogen are the major limiting factors affecting crop yield water use efficiency and nitrogen uptake dai et al 2019 gao et al 2017 wang et al 2017b however excessive irrigation and nitrogen fertilization may cause soil degeneration nitrogen leaching and low water and nitrogen use efficiency especially under the high temperature and moisture conditions of a greenhouse chen et al 2004 fan et al 2014 ju et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 irrigation is the only soil water source in the greenhouse irrigation and nitrogen fertilization scheduling may directly or indirectly affect microbial activity and soil nitrogen availability which in turn influence soil organic nitrogen content and distribution ji et al 2014 nguyen and shindo 2011 soil organic nitrogen accounts for more than 90 of the soil total nitrogen ntotal its structure and availability play pivotal roles in soil nitrogen retention mineralization and nitrogen supply stevenson 1982 small molecules like amino acids are directly absorbed intact by crops most of the soil organic nitrogen however must first be transformed into mineral nitrogen by mineralization before it can be absorbed by crops mishra et al 2005 yang et al 2016 soil mineral nitrogen smn and soluble organic nitrogen son levels have been used to measure and predict soil nitrogen mineralization and immobilization chen et al 2005 ros et al 2009 soil soluble nitrogen pools participate in nitrogen mineralization and are key indicators of nitrogen mineralization characteristics zhang et al 2017 therefore smn and son may reflect soil fertility and nitrogen supply potential according to the bremner and stevenson there are acid

et al 2009 yan and quan 2013 zhang et al 2016 however the roles of the soil organic nitrogen fractions in soil nitrogen supply under greenhouse conditions are not fully understood there are few published reports concerning the relationship between the soil organic nitrogen fractions and the soil soluble nitrogen pools in the greenhouse we hypothesized that both irrigation and nitrogen rates combined effects are critical in the improvement of the soil nitrogen supply they also influence the soil organic nitrogen fractions and the soil soluble nitrogen pools optimized irrigation and nitrogen rates could maximize nutrient supply and crop yield while minimizing adverse environmental effects the objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of the irrigation and nitrogen rates on the soil nitrogen fractions and soluble nitrogen pools the impact of the water and fertilizer application rate on soil total n excluding nitrate tn and total soluble nitrogen tsn were also assessed the effects of the soil soluble nitrogen pools on the soil organic nitrogen fractions in greenhouse soil were also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and experimental design the study site was the greenhouse at the experimental station of shenyang agricultural university latitude 41 49 n longitude 123 34 e in liaoning province china the experimental area has a temperate semi

irrigation lower limit three level randomized block design was used with four replicates and nine treatments the experimental treatments included three irrigation lower limits 25 kpa i1 35 kpa i2 and 45 kpa i3 and three nitrogen application rates 75 n1 300 n2 and 525 n3 kg ha 1 urea was used as the n fertilizer single tomato crops solanum lycopersicum l var green fortune were cultivated annually in the greenhouse from may to august using the aforementioned experimental design the greenhouse was maintained under natural light and temperature and covered with polyethylene film throughout the year to exclude rainfall except for the growing period the greenhouse was left fallow to minimize the impact of continuous cropping in addition to manuring calcium superphosphate 12 p2o5 and potassium sulfate 50 k2o were applied at 220 kg p2o5 ha 1 y 1 and 300 kg k2o ha 1 y 1 one third of the nitrogen and potassium fertilizer was applied as basal and the remaining fertilizer was dissolved and applied along with drip irrigation during the first and second ear fruit periods june 19 2016 and july 16 2016 respectively the calcium superphosphate was applied as a basal fertilizer in every treatment the area of each plot was 2 5 m2 and a total of 576 tomato seeds were sown the limited area of plot reduced soil spatial heterogeneity each plot was protected from intra plot water and nutrient seepage with 8 mil polyethylene films buried vertically to a depth of 0 6 m below the soil surface after the installation of the films the disturbed surface soil and subsoil were replaced in their corresponding layers drip irrigation in the form of tap water was applied under the plastic films irrigation was supplied based on tensiometer readings taken at 8 00 a m and 30 cm soil depth with 5 cm distance to drip hole when the tensiometer readings reached the soil water suction value at the irrigation lower limit they were converted into soil moisture content using the experimental

random soil cores in each plot at 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm soil depths visible stone and plant debris were manually removed the fresh soil samples were immediately brought to the laboratory and stored at 4 c before the smn and son determinations each soil sample was homogenized air dried and milled to pass through a 0 15 mm sieve for the soil organic nitrogen fraction and ntotal determinations 2 3 analysis of soil properties and soil soluble n pools soil organic carbon soc and ntotal were determined using an element analyzer vario el iii elementar langenselbold germany smn sum of nh4 n and no3 n was extracted with 0 01 m cacl2 then measured using a seal aa3 auto analyzer seal analytical inc mequon wi usa the k2s2o8 oxidation method was used to determine tsn and son in soil leachates filtered through 0 45 μm mixed cellulose filters nh4 n and son in the leachates were oxidized and converted to no3 n by reacting them with 0 15 m naoh and 3 w v k2s2o8 at 123 c for 30

the difference between an asn and an un was calculated as the difference between total ahn and an aan asn nhn was calculated by subtracting ahn from tn 2 5 statistical analysis two way anova was used to analyze the effects of irrigation lower limit ill nitrogen application rate nar and their interactions on the soil organic n fractions and the soil soluble n pools for the multiple comparisons a post hoc duncan test was used to compare the differences among the treatments at the p 0 05 and p 0 01 levels pearson correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the relationships among soil

nitrogen fractions explained by the soil soluble nitrogen pools and other correlations the response dataset soil organic nitrogen fractions was subjected to detrended correspondence analysis dca which indicated the lengths of the ordination axes the first axis was 0 7 sd which indicated the appropriate linear response ordination method the ordination was then subjected to redundancy analysis rda in canoco v 5 04 prior to the rda the soil organic nitrogen fractions data were simultaneously log x 1 transformed and standardized by error variance the variance inflation factor vif was used to identify multicollinearity among the explanatory variables those with vif 10 were discarded an automated forward selection of explained variables was implemented to determine statistical significance using 999 monte carlo permutations p 0 05 significances of the conditional effects were obtained for each variable in the rda 3 results 3 1 basic soil properties ntotal tson soc nh4 n and no3 n levels were significantly different among the soil depths p 0 05 no labels in table 1 ntotal tson and soc decreased with soil depth table 1 the no3 n content at 0 20 cm soil depth was highest in the i2n3 treatment the tson content at the 10 30 cm soil depth was highest in the i3n1 treatment the anova indicated that ill nar and their interactions significantly impacted ntotal tson and no3 n table 1 p 0

of soil organic nitrogen fractions in greenhouse soil 3 2 1 soil total n excluding nitrate acid hydrolyzable n and non hydrolyzable n at the 0 30 cm soil depth the tn ahn and nhn ranges were 654 52 2014 55 388 98 1170 33 and 189 11 956 84 mg kg 1 respectively table 2 based on the data in table 2 ahn and nhn accounted for 40 59 86 03 and 13 97 59 41 of the tn respectively with increasing soil depth tn ahn and nhn decreased significantly in all cases except for certain nhn determinations ill nar and their interactions had very significant effects on tn ahn and nhn at the 0 30 cm soil depth in contrast the lowest soil ahn level at the 0 30 cm soil depth was obtained for the i1n2 treatment the second lowest was found in the i3n2 treatment 3 2 2 amino acid n and ammonium n under the various irrigation and nitrogen fertilization regimes the ranges of aan and an were 64 47 508 91 and 118 99 532 36 mg kg 1 respectively fig 1 at the various soil depths aan and an accounted for 7 22 32 70 and 12 41 39 34 of the tn respectively table 3 the contents and distributions of aan and an decreased with increasing soil depth the differences among the various irrigation and nitrogen treatments reached the 5 significance level two way anova indicated that ill nar and their interactions extremely significantly affected the content and distribution of aan and an at the various soil depths in contrast the highest aan level was found in the i2n1 treatment and the second highest in the i2n2 treatment but the difference between them was not significant the highest an levels at the 0 20 cm and 20 30 cm soil depths were found in the i2n3 and i2n2 treatments respectively and they were significantly higher than those measured in the other treatments 3 2 3 amino sugar n and unknown n under the various irrigation and nitrogen fertilization regimes the ranges of asn and un were 12 37 137 89 and 47 20 310 98 mg kg 1 respectively fig 1 at the various soil depths asn and un contributed 7 22 32 70 and 12 41 39 34 to the tn respectively table 3 compared with other ahn fractions the content and distribution of asn were the lowest the content and distribution of asn and un varied with soil depth under different irrigation and nitrogen regimes two way anova demonstrated that ill nar and their interactions very significantly affected the distribution of asn at the various soil depths nevertheless the effects of ill nar and their interactions on the distribution of un varied with soil depth in contrast the lowest asn and un levels at the 0 20 cm soil depth were found in the i1n1 and i2n3 treatments respectively the un at the 20 30 cm soil depth was highest in the i2n3 treatment and lowest in the i1n1 treatment except for asn the levels of all ahn fractions decreased with increasing soil depth under the various irrigation and nitrogen fertilization regimes the content and distribution of asn were the lowest irrigation nitrogen fertilization and their interactions caused significant differences among the content and distribution of the soil organic nitrogen fractions the order of the content and distribution of the soil ahn fractions at the various soil depths was aan an un asn 3 3 content and distribution of soil soluble nitrogen pools in greenhouse soil the content and distribution of smn and son at the 0 30 cm soil depth under different irrigation and nitrogen fertilization regimes are shown in table 4 and fig 2 two way anova indicated that ill nar and their interactions significantly affected the levels of tsn smn and son and the proportions of smn and son in tsn at various soil depths under different irrigation and nitrogen regimes the exceptions were the effect of ill on the tsn content and the effect of nar on the distribution at the 0 10 cm soil depth in general the tsn smn and son levels were highest at the soil surface accumulation and lowest at the 10 20 cm soil depth in contrast at the 0 20 cm soil depth tsn smn and son were highest in the i2n3 treatment and lowest in the i2n1 treatment the proportion of smn in tsn was higher than that of son in tsn the average smn proportion in tsn was 63 9 for the various soil depths the proportion of smn in tsn at the 0 30 cm soil depth was highest in the i2n1 treatment and the results of multiple comparisons showed that the smn contents at the 0 20 cm soil depth always were the highest in i2 35 kpa level in greenhouse 3 4 relationships between soil organic n fractions and soil soluble nitrogen pools the pearson correlation coefficients between the soil organic nitrogen fractions and the soil soluble nitrogen pools indicated that smn nh4 n and no3 n were all significantly positively correlated with an and ahn nh4 n was also significantly positively correlated with aan there was no significant difference between son and the soil organic nitrogen fractions ntotal tson and soc were very significantly positively correlated with the soil organic nitrogen fractions except asn and nhn were not correlated with soc c n was significantly and very significantly positively correlated with un and nhn respectively table 5 the pearson correlation was also confirmed by the rda results which demonstrated that ntotal soc and no3 n were the best explanatory variables they accounted for very significant proportions of the variations in the soil organic nitrogen fractions under the different irrigation and nitrogen fertilization regimes fig 3 the first two constrained axes explained 61 36 and 14 86 of the total variation in the soil organic nitrogen fractions respectively the first canonical axis f 33 4 p 0 001 and the sum of all canonical axes f 14 1 p 0 001 were very significantly different according to the monte carlo test an aan ahn and un had similar loadings along the first axis asn and nhn had high relative contributions to the second axis ntotal and soc were significantly positively correlated with an ahn aan and un no3 n was positively correlated with asn along the second axis nhn was only positively correlated with ntotal 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization on the soil organic nitrogen fractions in

tian et al 2017 the ahn content was higher than that of nhn and highest in the i2n2 treatment at the 0 10 cm soil depth however the ahn content was lowest in the i1n2 treatment followed by i3n2 treatment table 2 which demonstrated too high 25 kpa or low irrigation level 45 kpa all were detrimental for the accumulation of ahn in greenhouse soil therefore the soil organic nitrogen fractions consisted mainly of ahn and moderate irrigation and nitrogen regimes were conducive to promoting the soil nitrogen supply potential in greenhouse soil several studies have shown that the irrigation and fertilization influence soil organic matter mineralization and humification which account for the relative differences in ahn content wang et al 2017a zhang et al 2017 therefore the ahn fraction content and distribution were indicative of the effects of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization on soil organic nitrogen transformation nguyen and shindo 2011 unlike certain other agroecosystems the greenhouse soil temperature is high and humidity is larger so that the microbial activities and the mineralization of organic nitrogen irrigation are all correspondingly enhanced consequently the special environmental conditions of greenhouse soil water fertilizer aeration and temperature may have more obvious influence on the soil organic nitrogen fractions distribution even the soil nitrogen supply capacity in a greenhouse ecosystem the content and distribution of all ahn fractions except for asn decreased with increasing soil depth and they differed significantly fig 1 p 0 05 these observations were consistent with previous research results durani et al 2016 li and li 2014 santos et al 2014 the order of the content and distribution of the soil ahn fractions was aan an un asn this finding also corroborated those reported in earlier studies chadwick et al 2000 li and li 2014 which indicated that the distributions of the soil organic nitrogen fractions were similar across different agroecosystems the present study demonstrated that an and aan were the main forms of soil organic nitrogen in greenhouse soil fig 2 gonzález prieto et al 1997 indicated that readily hydrolyzed organic nitrogen fractions especially aan asn and an were the most active nitrogen reservoirs and used as the main source of the crop uptake li and li 2014 showed that an asn and aan were easily mineralized and those contents determined the nitrogen mineralization rate even soil nitrogen supply capacity zhang et al 2006 reported there were linear correlations among an and aan and organic nitrogen mineralization rate and an and aan were considered to be the main source of soil labile organic nitrogen that can promote soil nitrogen supply capacity bardgett et al 2003 reported that aan was the main source of available nitrogen in the soil and it predominated in soil available nitrogen pools lü et al 2013 demonstrated that the an serves as a temporary nitrogen pool storing large quantities of labile organic nitrogen therefore an and aan are the most important and the main forms of soil organic nitrogen they are also the key indicators of soil nitrogen supply potential in greenhouse soil and the correlation analysis showed there was a significant positive correlation between an and aan r 0 858 data not shown in our study moreover the contents of aan and an all were highest in i2 35 kpa irrigation level fig 1 and table 3 which may be the result of microbial activity influenced by irrigation moderate irrigation 35 kpa level in turn may affect microbial activity by modulating soil moisture aeration and temperature thereby influencing soil organic nitrogen turnover hallin et al 2018 ji et al 2014 furthermore nitrogen fertilization directly influences the source and availability of soil nitrogen for microbes an and aan all were high in the i2n2 35 kpa 300 kg ha 1 treatment so moderate nitrogen fertilizer irrigation regimes could improve the greenhouse soil nitrogen supply potential most of the aan occurs in the form of polymers associated with soil microbial metabolism and acts as a transitional nitrogen pool linking soil nitrogen reserves with crop nitrogen uptake and nhn functions as a stable nitrogen pool closely correlated with the retention of fertilizer derived nitrogen lü et al 2013 luxhøi et al 2007 sørensen 2004 so far the specific composition structure and functions of nhn are not very clear and need to be further studied two way anova indicated that ill nar and their interactions very significantly affected the content and distribution of the soil organic nitrogen fractions at various soil depths and there were significant differences among the soil organic nitrogen fractions under the various irrigation and nitrogen fertilization regimes tables 2 and 3 these might be explained by the fact that soil microbial metabolism is promoted by moderate soil water and substrate conditions judy et al 2017 stanford and epstein 1974 showed that the increasing irrigation significantly improves soil nutrient availability and soil nitrogen mineralization is positively correlated with soil moisture certain studies have also reported that soil nitrogen mineralization and nitrification increase with soil temperature koyama et al 2010 lang et al 2010 sierra 2002 zaman and chang 2004 due to the special soil water and temperature conditions in the greenhouse their effects on the soil organic nitrogen fractions there require further study 4 2 effects of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization on soil soluble nitrogen pools soil soluble nitrogen pools are labile nitrogen sources for soil microorganisms and crops jones et al 2005 murphy et al 2000 nasholm et al 1998 moreover the content and distribution of soil soluble nitrogen pools vary with soil type nitrogen application rate tillage and other factors huygens et al 2016 liang et al 1995 smith 1987 zhang et al 2016 2017 the results indicated that ill nar and their interactions very significantly affected the soil soluble nitrogen pools smn and son at various soil depths table 4 and fig 2 in our study the tsn smn and son levels all were highest in the i2n3 35 kpa 525 kg ha 1 treatments this observation may be explained by the fact that microbial and plant root nitrogen fertilizer uptake under moderate irrigation stimulated nitrogen mineralization and the cause of the higher mineral nitrogen fertilizer application rate soto et al 2015 and the smn contents at the 0 20 cm soil depth always were the highest in i2 35 kpa level in greenhouse which indicate moderate irrigation level increased the smn contents several researches demonstrated moderate irrigation increases soil temperature and decreases soil bulk density both of which enhance soil microorganism metabolism sun and mu 2013 wang et al 2008 the tsn smn and son levels were higher in the n3 525 kg ha 1 than the n1 75 kg ha 1 treatments higher nitrogen fertilizer application rate increased tsn smn and son contents possibly by reacting with soil organic nitrogen promoting no3 n accumulation and nitrogen mineralization in greenhouse soil huang et al 2018 high temperatures and moisture levels may prompt the microbial decomposition of soil organic nitrogen mineralized into smn stanford and epstein 1974 the present study demonstrated that the content and proportion of smn in tsn all were higher than those of son and the tsn smn and son levels were stable in greenhouse soil under different ill nar regimes table 4 and fig 2 which indicated that smn was main available nitrogen form in soil soluble nitrogen pools a large number of field results demonstrated that the cumulative amount of nitrate nitrogen from the 0 to 100 cm soil layer was significantly correlated to crop uptake n with a correlation coefficient of 0 908 and nitrate n was the major form existing in dryland soils and due to high ph buffering capacity it was also the major form taken up by plants li et al 2009 moreover microbial son assimilation and the competition between microbes and plants for son may have caused the accumulation of smn liang et al 1995 4 3 roles of the soil organic nitrogen fractions and the soil soluble nitrogen pools in the soil nitrogen supply potential both the soil organic nitrogen fractions and the soil soluble nitrogen pools are closely correlated with the soil nitrogen supply potential li et al 2009 lü et al 2013 therefore the soil organic nitrogen fractions may be tightly linked to the soil soluble nitrogen pools most soil organic nitrogen can be directly absorbed by plants such like amino acids nasholm et al 2009 the majority of the soil organic nitrogen must first be transformed into mineral nitrogen which can then be absorbed by the roots mishra et al 2005 nannipieri and eldor 2009 the results revealed that smn is significantly positively correlated with an and ahn table 5 son is not correlated with the soil organic nitrogen fractions but is closely correlated with both smn and tsn data not shown the present study indicated the soil organic nitrogen fractions other than nhn and asn are positively correlated with the soil soluble nitrogen pools but not at the 5 significance level fig 3 ntotal soc and no3 n significantly influence soil organic nitrogen fractions but son and nh4 n do not the soil organic nitrogen exists mainly in the form of stable organic nitrogen and the potential soil organic nitrogen transformation may be limited by the carbon source hurisso et al 2015 liu et al 2016 prado et al 2016 shahid et al 2017 ntotal soc and no3 n play different key roles in the soil organic nitrogen turnover ntotal and soc contribute positively to ahn an un and aan ntotal also has a positive effect on nhn soc may become the limiting factor in soil organic nitrogen cycling when soc was limited microorganisms could use low molecular weight nitrogenous compounds like amino acids and amino sugars as carbon sources brogowski and chojnicki 2013 hurisso et al 2015 liu et al 2016 shahid et al 2017 winck et al 2014 an is considered a nitrogen source for microbial and plant growth lü et al 2013 nh4 n is significantly positively correlated with an aan and ahn however available nh4 n is relatively low in greenhouse soil because of the particular environmental conditions in the greenhouse table 1 nevertheless no3 n contributes negatively to nhn in contrast the available no3 n level was very high relative to the available nh4 n in greenhouse soil table 1 nitrification may account for most of the soil nitrogen cycling in greenhouse soil penton et al 2013 rudisill et al 2016 several studies reported that soil microbes affected by soil environmental conditions participate substantially in soil organic nitrogen transformation clark et al 2015 lang et al 2016 nannipieri and eldor 2009 rothrock et al 2010 in our study the soil organic nitrogen fractions and the soil soluble nitrogen pools are affected by the irrigation and nitrogen fertilization rates and play key roles in soil nitrogen cycling under greenhouse conditions soil organic nitrogen fractions and soil soluble nitrogen pools contribute significantly to the soil nitrogen supply potential in greenhouse soil which may serve as key indicators of the soil nitrogen supply potential aan an and smn including nh4 n and no3 n are the main components of the soil organic nitrogen fractions and soil soluble nitrogen pools respectively therefore aan an and smn are the main components of soil available nitrogen and the key indicators of greenhouse soil nitrogen supply potential given the results mentioned above considering water saving nitrogen reduction and soil nitrogen supply optimization we concluded that the most efficient irrigation and nitrogen fertilization regime and the optimal soil nitrogen supply capacity could be obtained in the i2n1 and i2n2 treatments respectively the roles of aan an and smn in soil nitrogen supply potential and capacity under various ill nar regimes merit further investigation particularly in the greenhouse agroecosystem 5 conclusions the present five year greenhouse study indicated that irrigation nitrogen fertilization and their interactions significantly influenced the content and distribution of the soil organic nitrogen fractions and the soil soluble nitrogen pools at various soil depths soil total nitrogen ntotal soil organic carbon soc and no3 n played important roles in the soil organic nitrogen fractions our findings suggested that soil mineral nitrogen smn amino acid n aan and ammonium n an were the main components of the soil available nitrogen and key indicators of the soil nitrogen supply potential in the greenhouse agroecosystem the results demonstrated that optimizing the irrigation and nitrogen fertilization schedules effectively enhances the soil nitrogen supply potential and improves soil fertility considering water saving nitrogen reduction and soil nitrogen supply optimization we concluded that the most efficient irrigation and nitrogen fertilization regime and the optimal soil nitrogen supply capacity could be obtained in the i2n1 and i2n2

11133,aims soil drying has occurred widely in artificial plantations in the semiarid loess region because the water consumption exceeds the rainfall jujube ziziphus jujube mill cv lizao plantations have been planted to improve the economic income since 2000 in order to prevent soil drying and sustain artificial plantation development we examined the relationships between the canopy size water consumption and water use efficiency in a dry land jujube plantation methods seven treatments were tested comprising native jujube with no pruning and dwarfing jujube under different pruning levels ranging from 1 to 6 jujube is a popular dwarfing canopy type in this region with a tree height of 2 2 m and this comprised level 1 jujube received increased intensities of pruning as well as decreases in tree height and canopy size for levels 2 4 jujube received severe pruning to a tree height of only 1 1 m at level 5 and the canopy was removed with only 30 40 cm of the trunk left for level 6 soil water was detected using cnc100 neutron tubes a thermal diffusion probe was used to monitor the sap flow in jujube trees throughout the whole growth period results during our study period 2014 was a wet year with rainfall of 460 4 mm and 2015 was a dry year with rainfall of only 380 8 mm transpiration and water consumption by jujube decreased significantly whereas the soil water content increased as the pruning intensity increased in these two years compared with 15 year old native jujube the annual soil water consumption by 15 year old dwarfing jujube pruned at level 1 was 6 54 mm less and the soil water consumption depth moved upward by 2 2 m the soil water recovered faster for jujube at level 6 and the soil water restoration depth reached 4 6 m after 3 years with an annual restoration depth of 153 3 cm compared with level 1 jujube at level 5 the height was halved the transpiration was about 22 1 and the water use efficiency was significantly improved by 1 1 times thereby demonstrating that the water consumption could be regulated by the canopy size level 2 jujube had the highest water use efficiency with the optimal pruning level in the local region conclusions we found that pruning could effectively decrease water consumption relieve deep soil drying and improve the water use efficiency in jujube the pruning level should be determined based on the water consumption rate and average rainfall to obtain high yields keywords jujube plantation loess region pruning transpiration water consumption water use efficiency 1 introduction large scale afforestation was introduced in north china since 1978 in order to improve the ecological environment wang et al 2012 but the ecological benefits have not yet been determined chen et al 2007 wang et al 2002 previous studies have shown that the plantations were sustained but with low survivability chinea 2002 du et al 2005 gao et al 2011 and a dry soil layer was formed in the loess region according to li 1983 the growth of the plantations was severely restricted by the low rainfall in this region the rainfall infiltration depth is less than 2 m zhao et al 2009 and the groundwater table is very deep at below 50 m li 1983 and thus natural protection and restoration are important for improving the ecological benefits previous studies have mainly evaluated the relationship between drought resistance and water consumption in different plantations but little is known about how canopy pruning might regulate plantation growth and soil water consumption fan and hao 2004 wang et al 2011 xue et al 2011 zhao et al 2000 jujube ziziphus jujube mill cv lizao trees are drought tolerant and jujube fruit has great economic value thus jujube has become a major tree species in china due to its ecological and economical benefits under the policy of returning farmland to forestland since 1999 native unpruned jujube grow widely in this region 2 m between trees and 3 m between tree rows with 1667 trees ha 1 and pruning was introduced in 2012 to improve the fruit yield ma et al 2013 studies have shown that artificial plantations grow poorly in the loess region because the rate of evapotranspiration exceeds the rainfall cao et al 2012 chen 2005 thereby leading to continuous drying of the deep soil studies in ecology soil hydrology and forestry have investigated how to restore the soil moisture cao et al 2010 chen et al 2008b ma et al 2012 found that the soil dry layer extended to 5 6 m in a 12 year old jujube plantation wang et al 2009 showed that the soil dry layer was deeper than 20 m in an artificial plantation and it would take more than 150 years to restore the soil water under normal rainfall after the death of an artificial plantation it appears that the plantations started well but then degraded the soil water ecology and it will be difficult to reconstruct the plantations chen et al 2008a li 1983 liu and diamond 2005 understanding the relationships between the tree canopy tree height and water consumption are important for predicting how a plantation might adapt to a drought environment as well as being essential for assessing water regimes however little is known about how the canopy pruning level is related to soil water consumption particularly under field conditions li et al 2003 found that summer pruning might reduce the water consumption by apple trees and improve the water status forrester et al 2013 also showed that pruning could increase the water use efficiency in eucalyptus plantations in south eastern australia by removing the least efficient lower canopy foliage and increasing the efficiency of the remaining foliage thereby potentially reducing the susceptibility to drought and improving the water use efficiency deep soil drying in forestland is caused by excessive transpiration chen et al 2008b previous studies have focused mainly on preventing deep soil drying by increasing the soil moisture i e by utilizing rainwater harvesting and decreasing soil evaporation i e mulching to conserve the soil moisture in order to reduce deep soil drying and maintain the soil ecology for sustainable development we proposed the concept of water saving pruning wang et al 2017 by regulating the canopy size in terms of the amount of branches and biomass thereby decreasing transpiration our objective was to examine jujube water consumption and the soil water content under different pruning levels and find ways to reduce deep soil drying we examined the effects of the tree height canopy size branch length related to jujube water consumption and soil water with native jujube no pruning and dwarfing jujube at different pruning levels we tested the following hypotheses 1 compared with native jujube dwarfing jujube might decrease the water consumption and move the water consumption depth upward 2 the soil water may be restored faster due to the reduced water consumption after decreasing the canopy size in jujube and 3 pruning might be beneficial for jujube growth and prevent deep soil drying 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site was located in mizhi county shaanxi province china 37 5 n 119 49 e which is in an area classified as a temperate semiarid climate zone fig 1 the study site is in a typical loess hilly region with a sloping gradient ranging from 23 to 45 further details of the site description topography and soil properties were provided previously by ma et al 2013 the soil in the area is a sandy loam with an average soil bulk density of 1 29 g cm 3 in the 0 1 m depth an average field capacity of 23 4 and wilting water content of 5 06 the mean annual precipitation was 451 6 mm in the last 30 years fig 2 where 50 of the total annual rainfall occurred in july august and september of the two years when the study was conducted 2014 was a wet year with annual rainfall of 460 4 mm and 2015 was a dry year with annual rainfall of 334 8 mm the annual average temperature was 8 4 c the annual average sunshine was 2761 h and the annual total radiation was 580 5 kj cm 2 the average monthly temperature rainfall and evapotranpiration et0 are shown in table 1 where et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration rate determined using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 according to meteorological data 2 2 jujube stands jujube were planted in 2000 our population comprised native unpruned jujube covering 40 ha 140 ha of dwarfing jujube that followed the contour line of the slope and 6 ha of farmland planted with potato solanum tuberosum potato was grown as an annual crop and it has been cultivated in this region for several years it could not form a permanent drying soil layer because its short roots only absorb soil moisture from the upper layer the native jujube trees are large in size so dwarfing jujube pruned at level 1 has become popular recently in order to improve productivity and it was the typical pruning level in this region the size of jujube trees is determined by the height and canopy which depend mainly on the trunk and lateral branches leaves and shedding shoots are mostly present on the lateral branches thus pruning was conducted according to the height canopy main branch number and length and the secondary branch number and length to maintain the pruning level we marked each pruned branch and they were pruned every five days during the overall growth period germination to leaf sprouting flowering to fruit setting fruit development and fruit ripening from may to october in 2014 and 2015 we measured the tree height from the ground to the top and the total branch length using a standard tape measure we also measured the maximum canopy size from aspects parallel to the tree length and perpendicular to the tree width our study comprised seven treatments according to the size of the trees i e native jujube with no pruning and dwarfing jujube with different pruning levels ranging from 1 to 6 table 2 all of the jujube stands were on the upper part of the east slope with a gradient of 25 and the observation plots were located in the middle covering an area greater than 0 3 ha baffle plates were set at the top and bottom of the observation plots at 0 2 m above the ground to prevent runoff six trees at similar growth stages were treated with six replicates for each stand we excavated a rectangular trench in the ground at 1 m from the tree trunk and 1 5 m from the tree rows down to a depth of 3 m and embedded a thick plastic sheet as a moisture barrier to prevent root and water interactions in the level 1 2 3 and 4 stands fig 3 liu et al 2013 showed that more than 50 of the fine roots of 12 year old jujube trees are distributed at a depth of 0 0 8 m thus a depth of 3 m was considered sufficient the level 5 jujube plot was prepared in 2009 we planted one jujube tree in the middle of each observation area with a length of 2 m width of 1 m and depth of 1 m where they were separated from each other by cement walls with thick plastic sheet at the bottom to prevent penetration fig 4 the jujube trees were severely pruned to only half of the usual dwarfing jujube height level 1 for the level 6 jujube the canopy was removed using a saw and only 30 40 cm of the trunk height remained in march 2012 in order to regenerate jujube which was the smallest tree size fig 5 new branches grew and three branches were retained in 2013 2 3 soil moisture the volumetric soil water content was monitored using neutron moisture gauges cnc100 the neutron tubes were installed 80 cm away from the trunk soil water was monitored every 10 days at 0 2 m depth interval down to depths of 10 m for the native unpruned jujube dwarfing jujube pruned at level 1 farmland and jujube with the canopy removed level 6 but to depths of 3 m for level 1 2 3 and 4 jujube and 1 m for level 5 jujube the soil water storage capacity was calculated as 1 w 10 h θ where w mm is the soil water storage capacity h cm is the soil depth and θ cm3 cm 3 is the soil volumetric water content 2 4 transpiration monitoring thermal diffusion probes tdp 20 dynamax co usa were used to monitor the sap flow in jujube trees for 24 h during the overall growth period thermal diffusion probes length 20 mm diameter 2 mm were installed on the east aspects of the jujube trunks at 0 4 m above the ground to eliminate detection errors lu et al 2004 and they were wrapped with silver paper to avoid interference from the external environment sap flow data were collected every 10 min with a cr1000 data logger campbell co usa and the sap flow density was calculated as follows granier 1987 2 j s 119 δ t m δ t δ t 1 231 where js g m 2 s 1 is the sap flow density and δ t m and δ t c are the temperature differences between the probe and atmosphere under no sap flow and upward sap flow conditions respectively therefore the daily transpiration was calculated as 3 a t i 1 144 j s i a s 10 5 where at mm d 1 is the daily transpiration as cm 2 is the area of sap flow and jsi is the sap flow density at 10 i min as was calculated as 4 as 0 8249 dbh 1 5634 where dbh cm is the jujube tree diameter at breast height regression was performed between as and dbh where the regression coefficient r2 was 0 8901 and the correlation coefficient r was 0 943 p 0 01 2 5 jujube water consumption we calculate the water consumption by the jujube plants with the water balance method there was no effective runoff because we set baffle plates at the top and bottom of the observation plot the ground water table is more than 50 m deep li 1983 in the loess region thus the runoff and ground water could be neglected the water consumption was calculated as 5 e t p δ s where et is the water consumption by the jujube plantation p is the rainfall and δ s is the variation in the soil water storage capacity 6 δ s s p r e s e n t s i n i t i a l we did not determine the soil water in this region before the jujube planted so the local farmland soil water capacity was regarded as s i n i t i a l and s p r e s e n t is the current jujube plantation soil water capacity 2 6 water use efficiency the water use efficiency was expressed as the fruit yield per jujube water consumption 7 w u e y e t where wue is the water use efficiency kg m 3 y is the fruit yield kg ha 1 and et is the water consumption by the jujube plantation m3 ha 1 statistical calculations were performed using excel 2012 and spss statistics 18 0 anova tests were used to determine differences in the tree height secondary branch length fruit yield jujube water consumption transpiration and water use efficiency significant differences were accepted at the p 0 05 level duncan s test figures were prepared with sigmaplot 12 5 and autocad 2010 3 results 3 1 effects of pruning on the soil water storage and consumption in the 0 10 m depth the average soil volume water contents in the 10 m soil profiles in the native unpruned jujube dwarfing jujube pruned at level 1 and farmland plots during 2015 are shown in fig 6 the average soil volume water contents in the 10 m depth were in the following order farmland 12 62 dwarfing jujube 9 40 pruned at level 1 native jujube 8 42 and they differed significantly in general only the rainfall was consumed on farmland without drying the deep soil layer wang et al 2007 thus the water consumed by jujube comprised the cumulative rainfall plus the soil volume water reduction compared with that on farmland the soil water storage was 1261 61 mm in farmland 939 83 mm in dwarfing jujube plots and 841 66 mm in native jujube plots in the 0 10 m depth thus compared with farmland the soil water storage was 321 78 mm lower in the dwarfing jujube plots and 419 95 mm lower in the native jujube plots the total rainfall was 6215 9 mm from 2000 to 2015 and the annual average rainfall was 414 39 mm thus the water consumption rates in the 15 year old dwarfing jujube and native jujube plots were 6537 68 mm 6215 9 plus 321 78 and 6635 85 mm 6215 9 plus 419 95 respectively and the annual water consumption rates were 435 85 mm and 442 39 mm where they exceeded the annual rainfall by 21 46 mm and 28 mm the annual water consumption in the dwarfing jujube plots was 6 54 mm less than that in the native jujube plots the soil water contents in the 15 year old dwarfing jujube plots and native jujube plots were lower in the 6 4 m and 8 6 m depths respectively compared with that in farmland and thus the soil water consumption depths extended to 6 4 m and 8 6 m while the annual soil water consumption depths were 42 6 cm and 57 3 cm the results showed that dwarfing jujube could decrease the water consumption and pruning can play an important role in regulating the water consumption in plantations as shown by ma et al 2012 3 2 effects of pruning on daily transpiration water consumption and soil water characteristics levels 1 5 fig 7 shows the daily transpiration and soil water during the whole growth period for jujube at levels 1 to 5 transpiration decreased significantly as the pruning intensity increased the daily transpiration varied throughout the whole growth period from may to october but the trends were similar in all of the plots thus transpiration increased gradually after may dormancy breaking before a stable higher transpiration rate was maintained from july to october and it decreased drastically until dormancy when the leaves fell after october the maximum daily transpiration amounts were 1 83 mm 1 64 mm 1 37 mm 1 18 mm and 0 42 mm for jujube at levels 1 to 5 respectively there were no obvious differences between dwarfing jujube at levels 1 and 2 after august because jujube at level 2 could not effectively regulate the water consumption related to the canopy during the rainy season the jujube water consumption also decreased significantly as the pruning intensity increased and the effect was more obvious with more rainfall the soil water content throughout the whole jujube growth period was higher in 2014 than 2015 because there was more rainfall in 2014 and the soil water content increased as the pruning intensity increased the differences in the soil water contents among different pruning levels were also larger in 2014 than 2015 where the maximum differences were 7 51 in 2014 and 3 33 in 2015 we found that there was an opposite and reciprocal relationship between soil water and growth where more soil water could support growth but rapid growth could consume more soil water the interaction between soil water and growth was stronger in the wet year 2014 than the dry year 2015 wei et al 2015 indicated that a soil water content of 6 is a threshold that can affect transpiration in jujube thus transpiration is restricted due to stomata closure when the soil water content is lower than 6 we also found that the soil water content tended to be stable below 6 due to limited transpiration by jujube in our study each jujube tree only occupied 2 m2 at level 5 which was only one third of the area for the dwarfing jujube plants thus each tree only received one third of the rainfall compared with the dwarfing jujube in this region the jujube trees could survive in the case of severe water shortages but the water consumption was greatly decreased thus we conclude that a limited water supply could reduce jujube water consumption 3 3 effect of canopy removal level 6 on soil water restoration fig 8 shows the average soil water contents in the 0 10 m depth after canopy removal from 2012 to 2015 we examined the effects of canopy removal on soil water restoration clearly transpiration and water consumption decreased after the canopy was removed fig 5 in addition the average soil water content in the 0 10 m depth increased significantly in the 13 year old jujube plots 9 92 compared with the 12 year old jujube plots 8 91 we defined the soil water content in 12 year old jujube plots as the initial soil water restoration value and the soil water content in farmland as the upper limit wang et al 2007 the soil water restoration depth was the depth where the soil water content was more than that in the 12 year old jujube plots the water consumption depth in the 12 year old dwarfing jujube plots level 1 extended to 5 4 m and by 45 cm per year because more water was consumed than the rainfall received the soil water restoration depth reached 3 m in 2013 4 m in 2014 and 4 6 m in 2015 due to the downward movement of infiltrated water from previous years bai 2015 the annual restoration depth was 153 3 cm from 2013 to 2015 and it was 3 41 times the water consumption the soil water storage in the 4 6 m profile was 489 07 mm in the jujube plots and 573 38 mm in farmland during 2015 the difference in the soil water storage between jujube and farmland decreased greatly from 2012 to 2015 thereby demonstrating that canopy removal was an effective method for improving soil water infiltration and recovery in old jujube plantations the soil water restoration depth was deeper than that reported in previous studies wan et al 2008 wang et al 2009 possibly because the jujube trees sprouted later and they only retained three branches with clean cultivation thereby decreasing the water consumption and the well developed roots might have helped the soil water move down into the soil 3 4 effect of pruning on the water use efficiency the water use efficiencies with different pruning levels are shown in table 3 the highest water use efficiency was with jujube at level 2 and the lowest with native jujube where the difference was significant the maximum water use efficiency was 2 25 times the minimum in 2014 and 3 13 times the minimum in 2015 the ultimate aims of economic plantation management are decreasing the water consumption and increasing the water use efficiency in our study the native jujube consumed more water than the dwarfing jujube level 1 and the water use efficiency exhibited the opposite trend the water use efficiency by the native jujube was only 2 1 kg m3 in 2014 and 1 8 kg m3 in 2015 but the water use efficiency with dwarfing jujube was 62 higher in 2014 and 72 higher in 2015 we found that the yield and water use efficiency were highest at level 2 in both the wet year 2014 and dry year 2015 thus an appropriate pruning level decreased the water consumption but increased the yield and water use efficiency under certain water supply conditions more rainfall could obviously improve the yield and water use efficiency our findings demonstrate that dwarfing jujube in this region can potentially improve the yield and the decrease water consumption thereby increasing the water use efficiency 4 discussion the consumption of water by jujube is affected by interactions among the atmosphere plant and soil in general we cannot change the atmosphere under field conditions but the jujube canopy size and soil environment can be regulated few studies have considered the relationship between the canopy size and water consumption in jujube in general transpiration is regarded as controlling water consumption by plants to maintain regular growth nie et al 2017 thus we propose that the canopy should be pruned to reduce transpiration by jujube according to the average annual rainfall in order to maintain sustainable jujube plantation development and prevent deep soil drying as well as obtaining a high stable yield and improved water use efficiency the availability of abundant water leads to excessive transpiration which produces larger tree with more transpiration but a lower yield we found that the native jujube plots with larger trees and higher water consumption had lower yields than the dwarfing jujube thus pruning could reduce excessive water consumption in jujube further studies should investigate how to convert greater transpiration to increase the yield the soil water content increased as the canopy size decreased thus we showed that canopy regulation can be an effective method for preventing soil drying chen et al 2016 reached the same conclusion and showed that branch removal in jujube plantations could improve the soil water content richardson et al 2010 also found that canopy trimming led to greater throughfall and higher soil moisture contents the soil water content increased gradually after pruning in the jujube level 6 plots thereby reducing the drying of the soil the water consumption in the jujube level 4 plots were 3904 1 m3 ha 1 equal to 390 4 mm in 2014 and 2450 3 m3 ha 1 equal to 245 mm in 2015 over the whole growth period which was lower than the rainfall received 402 mm in 2014 and 251 4 mm in 2015 thus pruning at level 4 could prevent the occurrence of permanent deep soil drying further studies should investigate how to relieve soil drying based on rainfall prediction a soil dry layer below 2 m is usually regarded as a permanent dry layer that is unlikely to be restored wang et al 2007 the soil water restoration depth in our jujube level 6 plots with canopy removal was greater than that found in previous studies where it took many years to restore the deep soil dry layer wang et al 2007 we found that the water consumption was low in the jujube plots with canopy removal and the soil was favorable for rainfall infiltration thereby demonstrating that canopy removal is suitable for restoring the soil moisture the local dwarfing jujube occupied an area of 6 m2 with a distance of 3 m between the trees and 2 m between the rows of trees and the roots extended several meters in the level 5 treatment the area was only one third of that for the usual dwarfing jujube with an area of 2 m2 and a root depth of 1 m the level 5 jujube plots survived and produced a yield in this extremely limited space where the trees exhibited strong drought resistance thus we conclude that jujube can survive and produce a yield when the local rainfall received is decreased to one third by appropriate pruning i e appropriate pruning can ensure that the jujube yield is obtained in low water consumption conditions we found that pruning could reduce the water consumption in jujube compared with the 15 year old native jujube plots and dwarfing jujube plots the difference in the water consumption depth was more than 2 m and thus dwarfing plantations can help to reduce the soil water consumption similarly liu et al 2013 showed that the root distribution depth in native jujube was 2 m deeper than that in dwarfing plantations zhang et al 2016 also found that decreasing the height of grass can reduce the root depth and soil water consumption in addition ma et al 2013 showed that dwarfing jujube trees can reduce the root depth comas et al 2005 demonstrated that root production by concord grapevines was greater under minimal canopy pruning than heavy pruning zhao 2013 found that pruning could clog grape ducts and reduce the water consumption the results obtained in these studies are consistent with our findings all of these studies showed that pruning can save water so we suggest that pruning can save water by regulating water consumption according to the available water supply thereby maximizing the conversion of limited water into the fruit yield and improving the water use efficiency jujube has been cultivated for 1000 years because of its drought tolerance chen et al 1990 and we showed that effective pruning can improve the soil ecological environment and maintain good plantation growth maffei et al 2016 also concluded that pruning has a positive effect on longevity thus future studies should determine whether canopy pruning might affect the long term longevity of plantations

11133,aims soil drying has occurred widely in artificial plantations in the semiarid loess region because the water consumption exceeds the rainfall jujube ziziphus jujube mill cv lizao plantations have been planted to improve the economic income since 2000 in order to prevent soil drying and sustain artificial plantation development we examined the relationships between the canopy size water consumption and water use efficiency in a dry land jujube plantation methods seven treatments were tested comprising native jujube with no pruning and dwarfing jujube under different pruning levels ranging from 1 to 6 jujube is a popular dwarfing canopy type in this region with a tree height of 2 2 m and this comprised level 1 jujube received increased intensities of pruning as well as decreases in tree height and canopy size for levels 2 4 jujube received severe pruning to a tree height of only 1 1 m at level 5 and the canopy was removed with only 30 40 cm of the trunk left for level 6 soil water was detected using cnc100 neutron tubes a thermal diffusion probe was used to monitor the sap flow in jujube trees throughout the whole growth period results during our study period 2014 was a wet year with rainfall of 460 4 mm and 2015 was a dry year with rainfall of only 380 8 mm transpiration and water consumption by jujube decreased significantly whereas the soil water content increased as the pruning intensity increased in these two years compared with 15 year old native jujube the annual soil water consumption by 15 year old dwarfing jujube pruned at level 1 was 6 54 mm less and the soil water consumption depth moved upward by 2 2 m the soil water recovered faster for jujube at level 6 and the soil water restoration depth reached 4 6 m after 3 years with an annual restoration depth of 153 3 cm compared with level 1 jujube at level 5 the height was halved the transpiration was about 22 1 and the water use efficiency was significantly improved by 1 1 times thereby demonstrating that the water consumption could be regulated by the canopy size level 2 jujube had the highest water use efficiency with the optimal pruning level in the local region conclusions we found that pruning could effectively decrease water consumption relieve deep soil drying and improve the water use efficiency in jujube the pruning level should be determined based on the water consumption rate and average rainfall to obtain high yields keywords jujube plantation loess region pruning transpiration water consumption water use efficiency 1 introduction large scale afforestation was introduced in north china since 1978 in order to improve the ecological environment wang et al 2012 but the ecological benefits have not yet been determined chen et al 2007 wang et al 2002 previous studies have shown that the plantations were sustained but with low survivability chinea 2002 du et al 2005 gao et al 2011 and a dry soil layer was formed in the loess region according to li 1983 the growth of the plantations was severely restricted by the low rainfall in this region the rainfall infiltration depth is less than 2 m zhao et al 2009 and the groundwater table is very deep at below 50 m li 1983 and thus natural protection and restoration are important for improving the ecological benefits previous studies have mainly evaluated the relationship between drought resistance and water consumption in different plantations but little is known about how canopy pruning might regulate plantation growth and soil water consumption fan and hao 2004 wang et al 2011 xue et al 2011 zhao et al 2000 jujube ziziphus jujube mill cv lizao trees are drought tolerant and jujube fruit has great economic value thus jujube has become a major tree species in china due to its ecological and economical benefits under the policy of returning farmland to forestland since 1999 native unpruned jujube grow widely in this region 2 m between trees and 3 m between tree rows with 1667 trees ha 1 and pruning was introduced in 2012 to improve the fruit yield ma et al 2013 studies have shown that artificial plantations grow poorly in the loess region because the rate of evapotranspiration exceeds the rainfall cao et al 2012 chen 2005 thereby leading to continuous drying of the deep soil studies in ecology soil hydrology and forestry have investigated how to restore the soil moisture cao et al 2010 chen et al 2008b ma et al 2012 found that the soil dry layer extended to 5 6 m in a 12 year old jujube plantation wang et al 2009 showed that the soil dry layer was deeper than 20 m in an artificial plantation and it would take more than 150 years to restore the soil water under normal rainfall after the death of an artificial plantation it appears that the plantations started well but then degraded the soil water ecology and it will be difficult to reconstruct the plantations chen et al 2008a li 1983 liu and diamond 2005 understanding the relationships between the tree canopy tree height and water consumption are important for predicting how a plantation might adapt to a drought environment as well as being essential for assessing water regimes however little is known about how the canopy pruning level is related to soil water consumption particularly under field conditions li et al 2003 found that summer pruning might reduce the water consumption by apple trees and improve the water status forrester et al 2013 also showed that pruning could increase the water use efficiency in eucalyptus plantations in south eastern australia by removing the least efficient lower canopy foliage and increasing the efficiency of the remaining foliage thereby potentially reducing the susceptibility to drought and improving the water use efficiency deep soil drying in forestland is caused by excessive transpiration chen et al 2008b previous studies have focused mainly on preventing deep soil drying by increasing the soil moisture i e by utilizing rainwater harvesting and decreasing soil evaporation i e mulching to conserve the soil moisture in order to reduce deep soil drying and maintain the soil ecology for sustainable development we proposed the concept of water saving pruning wang et al 2017 by regulating the canopy size in terms of the amount of branches and biomass thereby decreasing transpiration our objective was to examine jujube water consumption and the soil water content under different pruning levels and find ways to reduce deep soil drying we examined the effects of the tree height canopy size branch length related to jujube water consumption and soil water with native jujube no pruning and dwarfing jujube at different pruning levels we tested the following hypotheses 1 compared with native jujube dwarfing jujube might decrease the water consumption and move the water consumption depth upward 2 the soil water may be restored faster due to the reduced water consumption after decreasing the canopy size in jujube and 3 pruning might be beneficial for jujube growth and prevent deep soil drying 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site was located in mizhi county shaanxi province china 37 5 n 119 49 e which is in an area classified as a temperate semiarid climate zone fig 1 the study site is in a typical loess hilly region with a sloping gradient ranging from 23 to 45 further details of the site description topography and soil properties were provided previously by ma et al 2013 the soil in the area is a sandy loam with an average soil bulk density of 1 29 g cm 3 in the 0 1 m depth an average field capacity of 23 4 and wilting water content of 5 06 the mean annual precipitation was 451 6 mm in the last 30 years fig 2 where 50 of the total annual rainfall occurred in july august and september of the two years when the study was conducted 2014 was a wet year with annual rainfall of 460 4 mm and 2015 was a dry year with annual rainfall of 334 8 mm the annual average temperature was 8 4 c the annual average sunshine was 2761 h and the annual total radiation was 580 5 kj cm 2 the average monthly temperature rainfall and evapotranpiration et0 are shown in table 1 where et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration rate determined using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 according to meteorological data 2 2 jujube stands jujube were planted in 2000 our population comprised native unpruned jujube covering 40 ha 140 ha of dwarfing jujube that followed the contour line of the slope and 6 ha of farmland planted with potato solanum tuberosum potato was grown as an annual crop and it has been cultivated in this region for several years it could not form a permanent drying soil layer because its short roots only absorb soil moisture from the upper layer the native jujube trees are large in size so dwarfing jujube pruned at level 1 has become popular recently in order to improve productivity and it was the typical pruning level in this region the size of jujube trees is determined by the height and canopy which depend mainly on the trunk and lateral branches leaves and shedding shoots are mostly present on the lateral branches thus pruning was conducted according to the height canopy main branch number and length and the secondary branch number and length to maintain the pruning level we marked each pruned branch and they were pruned every five days during the overall growth period germination to leaf sprouting flowering to fruit setting fruit development and fruit ripening from may to october in 2014 and 2015 we measured the tree height from the ground to the top and the total branch length using a standard tape measure we also measured the maximum canopy size from aspects parallel to the tree length and perpendicular to the tree width our study comprised seven treatments according to the size of the trees i e native jujube with no pruning and dwarfing jujube with different pruning levels ranging from 1 to 6 table 2 all of the jujube stands were on the upper part of the east slope with a gradient of 25 and the observation plots were located in the middle covering an area greater than 0 3 ha baffle plates were set at the top and bottom of the observation plots at 0 2 m above the ground to prevent runoff six trees at similar growth stages were treated with six replicates for each stand we excavated a rectangular trench in the ground at 1 m from the tree trunk and 1 5 m from the tree rows down to a depth of 3 m and embedded a thick plastic sheet as a moisture barrier to prevent root and water interactions in the level 1 2 3 and 4 stands fig 3 liu et al 2013 showed that more than 50 of the fine roots of 12 year old jujube trees are distributed at a depth of 0 0 8 m thus a depth of 3 m was considered sufficient the level 5 jujube plot was prepared in 2009 we planted one jujube tree in the middle of each observation area with a length of 2 m width of 1 m and depth of 1 m where they were separated from each other by cement walls with thick plastic sheet at the bottom to prevent penetration fig 4 the jujube trees were severely pruned to only half of the usual dwarfing jujube height level 1 for the level 6 jujube the canopy was removed using a saw and only 30 40 cm of the trunk height remained in march 2012 in order to regenerate jujube which was the smallest tree size fig 5 new branches grew and three branches were retained in 2013 2 3 soil moisture the volumetric soil water content was monitored using neutron moisture gauges cnc100 the neutron tubes were installed 80 cm away from the trunk soil water was monitored every 10 days at 0 2 m depth interval down to depths of 10 m for the native unpruned jujube dwarfing jujube pruned at level 1 farmland and jujube with the canopy removed level 6 but to depths of 3 m for level 1 2 3 and 4 jujube and 1 m for level 5 jujube the soil water storage capacity was calculated as 1 w 10 h θ where w mm is the soil water storage capacity h cm is the soil depth and θ cm3 cm 3 is the soil volumetric water content 2 4 transpiration monitoring thermal diffusion probes tdp 20 dynamax co usa were used to monitor the sap flow in jujube trees for 24 h during the overall growth period thermal diffusion probes length 20 mm diameter 2 mm were installed on the east aspects of the jujube trunks at 0 4 m above the ground to eliminate detection errors lu et al 2004 and they were wrapped with silver paper to avoid interference from the external environment sap flow data were collected every 10 min with a cr1000 data logger campbell co usa and the sap flow density was calculated as follows granier 1987 2 j s 119 δ t m δ t δ t 1 231 where js g m 2 s 1 is the sap flow density and δ t m and δ t c are the temperature differences between the probe and atmosphere under no sap flow and upward sap flow conditions respectively therefore the daily transpiration was calculated as 3 a t i 1 144 j s i a s 10 5 where at mm d 1 is the daily transpiration as cm 2 is the area of sap flow and jsi is the sap flow density at 10 i min as was calculated as 4 as 0 8249 dbh 1 5634 where dbh cm is the jujube tree diameter at breast height regression was performed between as and dbh where the regression coefficient r2 was 0 8901 and the correlation coefficient r was 0 943 p 0 01 2 5 jujube water consumption we calculate the water consumption by the jujube plants with the water balance method there was no effective runoff because we set baffle plates at the top and bottom of the observation plot the ground water table is more than 50 m deep li 1983 in the loess region thus the runoff and ground water could be neglected the water consumption was calculated as 5 e t p δ s where et is the water consumption by the jujube plantation p is the rainfall and δ s is the variation in the soil water storage capacity 6 δ s s p r e s e n t s i n i t i a l we did not determine the soil water in this region before the jujube planted so the local farmland soil water capacity was regarded as s i n i t i a l and s p r e s e n t is the current jujube plantation soil water capacity 2 6 water use efficiency the water use efficiency was expressed as the fruit yield per jujube water consumption 7 w u e y e t where wue is the water use efficiency kg m 3 y is the fruit yield kg ha 1 and et is the water consumption by the jujube plantation m3 ha 1 statistical calculations were performed using excel 2012 and spss statistics 18 0 anova tests were used to determine differences in the tree height secondary branch length fruit yield jujube water consumption transpiration and water use efficiency significant differences were accepted at the p 0 05 level duncan s test figures were prepared with sigmaplot 12 5 and autocad 2010 3 results 3 1 effects of pruning on the soil water storage and consumption in the 0 10 m depth the average soil volume water contents in the 10 m soil profiles in the native unpruned jujube dwarfing jujube pruned at level 1 and farmland plots during 2015 are shown in fig 6 the average soil volume water contents in the 10 m depth were in the following order farmland 12 62 dwarfing jujube 9 40 pruned at level 1 native jujube 8 42 and they differed significantly in general only the rainfall was consumed on farmland without drying the deep soil layer wang et al 2007 thus the water consumed by jujube comprised the cumulative rainfall plus the soil volume water reduction compared with that on farmland the soil water storage was 1261 61 mm in farmland 939 83 mm in dwarfing jujube plots and 841 66 mm in native jujube plots in the 0 10 m depth thus compared with farmland the soil water storage was 321 78 mm lower in the dwarfing jujube plots and 419 95 mm lower in the native jujube plots the total rainfall was 6215 9 mm from 2000 to 2015 and the annual average rainfall was 414 39 mm thus the water consumption rates in the 15 year old dwarfing jujube and native jujube plots were 6537 68 mm 6215 9 plus 321 78 and 6635 85 mm 6215 9 plus 419 95 respectively and the annual water consumption rates were 435 85 mm and 442 39 mm where they exceeded the annual rainfall by 21 46 mm and 28 mm the annual water consumption in the dwarfing jujube plots was 6 54 mm less than that in the native jujube plots the soil water contents in the 15 year old dwarfing jujube plots and native jujube plots were lower in the 6 4 m and 8 6 m depths respectively compared with that in farmland and thus the soil water consumption depths extended to 6 4 m and 8 6 m while the annual soil water consumption depths were 42 6 cm and 57 3 cm the results showed that dwarfing jujube could decrease the water consumption and pruning can play an important role in regulating the water consumption in plantations as shown by ma et al 2012 3 2 effects of pruning on daily transpiration water consumption and soil water characteristics levels 1 5 fig 7 shows the daily transpiration and soil water during the whole growth period for jujube at levels 1 to 5 transpiration decreased significantly as the pruning intensity increased the daily transpiration varied throughout the whole growth period from may to october but the trends were similar in all of the plots thus transpiration increased gradually after may dormancy breaking before a stable higher transpiration rate was maintained from july to october and it decreased drastically until dormancy when the leaves fell after october the maximum daily transpiration amounts were 1 83 mm 1 64 mm 1 37 mm 1 18 mm and 0 42 mm for jujube at levels 1 to 5 respectively there were no obvious differences between dwarfing jujube at levels 1 and 2 after august because jujube at level 2 could not effectively regulate the water consumption related to the canopy during the rainy season the jujube water consumption also decreased significantly as the pruning intensity increased and the effect was more obvious with more rainfall the soil water content throughout the whole jujube growth period was higher in 2014 than 2015 because there was more rainfall in 2014 and the soil water content increased as the pruning intensity increased the differences in the soil water contents among different pruning levels were also larger in 2014 than 2015 where the maximum differences were 7 51 in 2014 and 3 33 in 2015 we found that there was an opposite and reciprocal relationship between soil water and growth where more soil water could support growth but rapid growth could consume more soil water the interaction between soil water and growth was stronger in the wet year 2014 than the dry year 2015 wei et al 2015 indicated that a soil water content of 6 is a threshold that can affect transpiration in jujube thus transpiration is restricted due to stomata closure when the soil water content is lower than 6 we also found that the soil water content tended to be stable below 6 due to limited transpiration by jujube in our study each jujube tree only occupied 2 m2 at level 5 which was only one third of the area for the dwarfing jujube plants thus each tree only received one third of the rainfall compared with the dwarfing jujube in this region the jujube trees could survive in the case of severe water shortages but the water consumption was greatly decreased thus we conclude that a limited water supply could reduce jujube water consumption 3 3 effect of canopy removal level 6 on soil water restoration fig 8 shows the average soil water contents in the 0 10 m depth after canopy removal from 2012 to 2015 we examined the effects of canopy removal on soil water restoration clearly transpiration and water consumption decreased after the canopy was removed fig 5 in addition the average soil water content in the 0 10 m depth increased significantly in the 13 year old jujube plots 9 92 compared with the 12 year old jujube plots 8 91 we defined the soil water content in 12 year old jujube plots as the initial soil water restoration value and the soil water content in farmland as the upper limit wang et al 2007 the soil water restoration depth was the depth where the soil water content was more than that in the 12 year old jujube plots the water consumption depth in the 12 year old dwarfing jujube plots level 1 extended to 5 4 m and by 45 cm per year because more water was consumed than the rainfall received the soil water restoration depth reached 3 m in 2013 4 m in 2014 and 4 6 m in 2015 due to the downward movement of infiltrated water from previous years bai 2015 the annual restoration depth was 153 3 cm from 2013 to 2015 and it was 3 41 times the water consumption the soil water storage in the 4 6 m profile was 489 07 mm in the jujube plots and 573 38 mm in farmland during 2015 the difference in the soil water storage between jujube and farmland decreased greatly from 2012 to 2015 thereby demonstrating that canopy removal was an effective method for improving soil water infiltration and recovery in old jujube plantations the soil water restoration depth was deeper than that reported in previous studies wan et al 2008 wang et al 2009 possibly because the jujube trees sprouted later and they only retained three branches with clean cultivation thereby decreasing the water consumption and the well developed roots might have helped the soil water move down into the soil 3 4 effect of pruning on the water use efficiency the water use efficiencies with different pruning levels are shown in table 3 the highest water use efficiency was with jujube at level 2 and the lowest with native jujube where the difference was significant the maximum water use efficiency was 2 25 times the minimum in 2014 and 3 13 times the minimum in 2015 the ultimate aims of economic plantation management are decreasing the water consumption and increasing the water use efficiency in our study the native jujube consumed more water than the dwarfing jujube level 1 and the water use efficiency exhibited the opposite trend the water use efficiency by the native jujube was only 2 1 kg m3 in 2014 and 1 8 kg m3 in 2015 but the water use efficiency with dwarfing jujube was 62 higher in 2014 and 72 higher in 2015 we found that the yield and water use efficiency were highest at level 2 in both the wet year 2014 and dry year 2015 thus an appropriate pruning level decreased the water consumption but increased the yield and water use efficiency under certain water supply conditions more rainfall could obviously improve the yield and water use efficiency our findings demonstrate that dwarfing jujube in this region can potentially improve the yield and the decrease water consumption thereby increasing the water use efficiency 4 discussion the consumption of water by jujube is affected by interactions among the atmosphere plant and soil in general we cannot change the atmosphere under field conditions but the jujube canopy size and soil environment can be regulated few studies have considered the relationship between the canopy size and water consumption in jujube in general transpiration is regarded as controlling water consumption by plants to maintain regular growth nie et al 2017 thus we propose that the canopy should be pruned to reduce transpiration by jujube according to the average annual rainfall in order to maintain sustainable jujube plantation development and prevent deep soil drying as well as obtaining a high stable yield and improved water use efficiency the availability of abundant water leads to excessive transpiration which produces larger tree with more transpiration but a lower yield we found that the native jujube plots with larger trees and higher water consumption had lower yields than the dwarfing jujube thus pruning could reduce excessive water consumption in jujube further studies should investigate how to convert greater transpiration to increase the yield the soil water content increased as the canopy size decreased thus we showed that canopy regulation can be an effective method for preventing soil drying chen et al 2016 reached the same conclusion and showed that branch removal in jujube plantations could improve the soil water content richardson et al 2010 also found that canopy trimming led to greater throughfall and higher soil moisture contents the soil water content increased gradually after pruning in the jujube level 6 plots thereby reducing the drying of the soil the water consumption in the jujube level 4 plots were 3904 1 m3 ha 1 equal to 390 4 mm in 2014 and 2450 3 m3 ha 1 equal to 245 mm in 2015 over the whole growth period which was lower than the rainfall received 402 mm in 2014 and 251 4 mm in 2015 thus pruning at level 4 could prevent the occurrence of permanent deep soil drying further studies should investigate how to relieve soil drying based on rainfall prediction a soil dry layer below 2 m is usually regarded as a permanent dry layer that is unlikely to be restored wang et al 2007 the soil water restoration depth in our jujube level 6 plots with canopy removal was greater than that found in previous studies where it took many years to restore the deep soil dry layer wang et al 2007 we found that the water consumption was low in the jujube plots with canopy removal and the soil was favorable for rainfall infiltration thereby demonstrating that canopy removal is suitable for restoring the soil moisture the local dwarfing jujube occupied an area of 6 m2 with a distance of 3 m between the trees and 2 m between the rows of trees and the roots extended several meters in the level 5 treatment the area was only one third of that for the usual dwarfing jujube with an area of 2 m2 and a root depth of 1 m the level 5 jujube plots survived and produced a yield in this extremely limited space where the trees exhibited strong drought resistance thus we conclude that jujube can survive and produce a yield when the local rainfall received is decreased to one third by appropriate pruning i e appropriate pruning can ensure that the jujube yield is obtained in low water consumption conditions we found that pruning could reduce the water consumption in jujube compared with the 15 year old native jujube plots and dwarfing jujube plots the difference in the water consumption depth was more than 2 m and thus dwarfing plantations can help to reduce the soil water consumption similarly liu et al 2013 showed that the root distribution depth in native jujube was 2 m deeper than that in dwarfing plantations zhang et al 2016 also found that decreasing the height of grass can reduce the root depth and soil water consumption in addition ma et al 2013 showed that dwarfing jujube trees can reduce the root depth comas et al 2005 demonstrated that root production by concord grapevines was greater under minimal canopy pruning than heavy pruning zhao 2013 found that pruning could clog grape ducts and reduce the water consumption the results obtained in these studies are consistent with our findings all of these studies showed that pruning can save water so we suggest that pruning can save water by regulating water consumption according to the available water supply thereby maximizing the conversion of limited water into the fruit yield and improving the water use efficiency jujube has been cultivated for 1000 years because of its drought tolerance chen et al 1990 and we showed that effective pruning can improve the soil ecological environment and maintain good plantation growth maffei et al 2016 also concluded that pruning has a positive effect on longevity thus future studies should determine whether canopy pruning might affect the long term longevity of plantations

experiment irrigation treatments were full irrigation fi 0 65fi and 0 35fi and salinity levels of irrigation water were 0 6 well water 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 ds m 1 in the first year grain yield was reduced by 20 and 26 in irrigation regimes of 0 65fi 381 mm and 0 35fi 217 mm respectively these reductions were 17 and 30 in the second year respectively the corresponding irrigation water reductions were 33 and 62 in both years for 0 65fi 381 and 355 mm compared to 573 mm and 0 35fi 217 and 203 mm compared to 533 mm respectively therefore it is indicated that the proportion of irrigation water reduction to the grain yield reduction is 2 1 in benefit of the deficit irrigation mostly due to the seasonal rainfall of 363 and 439 mm in the first and second years respectively although the majority of rainfall occurred in winter the winter wheat growth is at rest results also indicated that in fi with irrigation application efficiency of 80 leaching fraction of 20 the salinity level of 3 36 ds m 1 produced no grain yield reduction furthermore salinity level of 7 5 ds m 1 for irrigation regimes of 0 65fi and 0 35fi respectively did not show significant difference in grain yield compared with that obtained in 0 6 ds m 1 salinity level therefore by deficit irrigation higher salinity level is applicable due to lower salt accumulation in soil in furrow planting resulted in 4 statistically significant higher grain yield compared with that obtained in on ridge planting with 5 higher irrigation water productivity iwp by considering acceptable grain yield production in 0 65fi its iwp 1 03 kg m 3 and 1 1 kg m 3 in the first and second year respectively was significantly higher than those obtained in fi 0 85 kg m 3 and 0 87 kg m 3 in the first and second year respectively in in furrow planting grain yield in salinity level of 7 5 ds m 1 was suitable with irrigation regime of 0 65fi whereas for on ridge planting appropriate salinity is 5 0 ds m 1 therefore in non limited irrigation water condition fi with salinity level of 5 0 ds m 1 and in furrow planting is the appropriate irrigation management for winter wheat however with limited water supply 0 65fi with salinity of 7 5 ds m 1 and in furrow planting would be appropriate in winter wheat irrigation management in the study region the root water uptake was predicted by homaee feddes method with higher accuracy and its value was used in grain yield prediction with doorenbos kassam yield et function with higher accuracy keywords salinity and irrigation interaction salinity stress water stress yield yield production function 1 introduction water scarcity and its salinity are the main factors affecting wheat production in arid and semi arid regions in iran therefore efficient use of saline water resources is essential in these areas to achieve efficient water use different methods are used to decrease the irrigation water depth and increase the benefit from higher water salinity one of these methods is in furrow planting buttar et al 2006 zhang et al 2007 shabani et al 2013 yarami and sepaskhah 2015a b in furrow irrigation crops are planted on furrow ridges and furrow bottoms are wetted by irrigation therefore the salt is accumulated on the ridge and it is reduced in the furrow bottom in ordinary furrow irrigation water is evaporated from the furrow whereas in in furrow planting crops are planted in furrow bottoms which results in soil evaporation reduction and increases the water productivity buttar et al 2006 shabani et al 2013 yarami and sepaskhah 2015a b zhang et al 2007 and li et al 2010 studied the effects of different planting patterns on wheat yield they indicated that water use efficiency in planting on raised bed and in furrow was higher than that in basin planting furthermore quanqi et al 2012 reported that in furrow planting in light loamy soil and summer monsoon climates increased wheat grain yield from 7 6 t ha 1 to 8 1 t ha 1 in comparison with yields for on ridge planting efficient water use can be achieved by deficit irrigation however optimum water depth in deficit irrigation should be determined on the other hand the optimum level of deficit irrigation could be different in various levels of irrigation water salinity panda et al 2003 used different reductions in water depth of full irrigation 10 30 45 60 and 75 for wheat in sandy loam soil in a sunhumid subtropical climate they indicated that the highest water use efficiency was obtained at 45 of water reduction furthermore mugabe and nyakatawa 2000 applied irrigation water depth with 50 75 and 100 of full irrigation for wheat in dark reddish brown clay soil and a semi arid climate they found that the reductions in grain yield were 9 and 16 by reducing 25 and 50 irrigation water respectively mahbod et al 2015 used different water depths as 0 50 80 100 and 120 of full irrigation with different rates of nitrogen application 0 46 92 and 136 kg n ha 1 for wheat in bajgah area shiraz iran with clay loam soil and semi arid climate they indicated that with 136 kg n ha 1 and 20 reduction in irrigation water depth grain yield was not reduced chauhan et al 2008 showed that supplementary irrigation of wheat in fields with irrigation water salinity of 8 12 ds m 1 resulted in 10 yield reduction furthermore hamdy et al 2005 indicated that supplementary irrigation of wheat irrigation at sensitive stages of flowering and grain filling in greenhouse with irrigation water salinity of 3 9 ds m 1 resulted in 25 reduction in grain yield interaction effects between irrigation regimes 100 80 and 60 of etc and salinity levels of irrigation water 0 65 3 2 and 6 1 ds m 1 on wheat yield were studied by jiang et al 2012 in an arid climate the soil texture consists of 0 50 cm sandy loam and 50 125 cm clay loam loam with medium fertility they indicated that the highest grain yield was obtained with 300 mm of water and salinity level of 3 2 ds m 1 and by using salinity level of 6 1 ds m 1 yield reduction was 8 10 in the crop evapotranspiration process pure soil water is extracted and salt concentration in soil solution is increased which resulted in a reduction in soil matric and osmotic potentials consequently the reduced soil matric and osmotic potentials decrease root water uptake macroscopic extraction models are readily used to determine the root water uptake by investigators feddes et al 1978 in this method the total root extraction rate under non stressed conditions is assumed to be equal to the potential transpiration by decreasing the soil water pressure head to a critical value the water uptake is decreased until the transpiration rate is ceased at the soil water wilting point feddes et al 1978 proposed a linear reduction model for root water uptake however van genuchten 1987 and dirksen et al 1993 proposed non linear osmotic and matric head functions that are additive or multiplicative functions recently homaee and feddes 1999 and homaee et al 2002 indicated that both intercept and slope of the reduction functions are increased by salinity for water uptake in vegetative growth periods of alfalfa their model was used for prediction of water uptake coefficient α in yield water relationship under different salinity levels accurately there is a strong interaction effect between salinity and irrigation regimes and the optimum irrigation regimes in different salinity levels for wheat should be determined for better management of saline irrigation water furthermore during the winter wheat growing period rainfall occurs that is stored in soil to supply some of the crop water requirement and even with excess amount of rainfall it can leach the salt in soil as accumulated by applied saline water in the semi arid region therefore for winter wheat it is important to determine the appropriate irrigation regimes salinity levels of irrigation water and planting method the objectives of this study are to investigate the effects of different irrigation regimes salinity levels and planting methods on yield yield quality and water productivity of winter wheat in a semi arid region 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment this experiment was conducted at the experimental research station in agricultural college shiraz university i r of iran in 2011 2012 and 2012 2013 growing seasons the experiment was conducted at the same place in two consecutive years the climatic conditions of the study area is semi arid mean daily minimum temperature in december 2011 and 2012 was 2 5 and 1 4 c respectively frost occurred during the plant dormancy in 2011 2012 and 2012 2013 growing season figs 1 and 2 the value of reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated based on the modified penman monteith method modified by razzaghi and sepaskhah 2012 physical and chemical properties of soil and water are shown in tables 1 and 2 physical and chemical properties of soil are obtained in the first year before planting and the same value are assumed for the second year after the first year harvest the experimental plots were leached with enough fresh water to reduce the soil salinity to the initial value experimental design was a split split plot arrangement in randomized complete block design with irrigation treatment as the main plot salinity level of water as the subplot and planting method as the sub subplot with three replications irrigation treatments included full irrigation fi 65 and 35 of full irrigation 0 65fi and 0 35fi respectively full irrigation is water requirement with irrigation application efficiency of 80 shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2016 that uses an equivalent leaching fraction of 20 however the seasonal depth of irrigation water for fi is higher in the first year due to lower seasonal rainfall 363 mm compared with that in the second year 439 mm table 3 in full irrigation the applied water provided by raising the soil water content in the root zone to the soil field capacity therefore the crop was kept under non stressed conditions irrigation water salinity levels were 0 6 well water 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 ds m 1 in the both years of study different salinity levels of water were prepared by the addition of nacl and cacl2 to the fresh water well water with equal equivalent proportion the irrigation efficiency of 80 in field may result in 20 leaching fraction that controls the salt accumulation in soil by saline water use on ridge and in furrow planting methods were used as sub subplot fig 3 each sub subplot area was 3 4 m2 with 1 0 m distance between two adjacent sub subplots to avoid water invasion from one sub subplot to another a local cultivar pishtaz of winter wheat sowed on 6 november 2011 and 11 november 2012 in eight rows with seeding rate of 250 kg ha 1 in furrow planting contained two rows in bottom of each furrow and on ridge planting contained two rows on top of each ridge with spacing of 0 15 m the spacing between ridges and furrows were 0 6 m during the main irrigation period irrigation water was applied in 10 14 day intervals irrigation water depth for each irrigation event was determined by measuring the soil water content at depths of 0 0 3 0 3 0 6 0 6 0 9 and 0 9 1 2 m before each irrigation event and it was measured eight times in the non irrigated period in fall and winter by the neutron scattering method the access tubes were installed in the middle of the furrow and the on ridge for in furrow and on ridge planting methods respectively the neutron probe was calibrated by a standard method as described by carneiro and de jong 1985 the soil water content in the root zone was raised to the soil field capacity and amount of the net irrigation water was calculated as follows 1 d n i 1 n θ f c i θ i δ z i where dn is the net irrigation water depth m өfci and өi are the volumetric soil water content in layer i at field capacity and before irrigation respectively m3 m 3 δzi is the soil layer thickness m and n is the number of soil layers depth of root was estimated by the equation proposed by borg and grimes 1986 the volume of irrigation water was determined by multiplying the gross irrigation water depth by the plot area 12 m2 and it was applied by a flexible hose connected to a flow meter uniformly to each plot even for low amount of irrigation water in 0 35fi treatment soil phosphorous was enriched by applying ammonium phosphate at a rate of 100 kg ha 1 20 kg n ha 1 46 kg p2o5 ha 1 mixed with the soil at plowing for soil nitrogen enrichment urea was applied as 150 kg ha 1 at 110 days after planting dap late winter and 158 dap early spring in 2011 2012 and at 105 dap and 158 dap in 2012 2013 respectively total of 138 kg n ha 1 for determination of soil saturation extract salinity soil samples were collected from each plot about 179 198 and 250 dap in first year and 195 and 250 dap in the second year soil samples were taken in 0 3 m increment to depth of 1 2 m to assess the soil salinity in the root zone soil samples were taken from bed of furrow in in furrow planting and were taken from top of ridge in on ridge planting method i e where the most of plant roots are growing and exposing to soil salinity the depth of furrow was 0 15 m saturated soil extract salinity was determined using the method described by the u s salinity laboratory staff richards 1954 one plant was selected in each plot and leaf length and width for this plant were measured by a ruler and converted to leaf area by the following equation mosaffa 2016 2 a 0 65l w 0 35 where a is the leaf area cm2 l and w are the leaf length and width cm respectively in eq 2 there is an intercept 0 35 for the relationship between a and l w as reported by mosaffa 2016 the leaf area index lai is calculated as 3 lai a ac where ac is the area of soil surface occupied by a plant it is determined by multiplication of row spacing and distance between plants on a row lai was measured six times in 2011 2012 and seven times in 2012 2013 plants were harvested from four middle rows with length of 2 5 m on july 4 in 2012 and july 11 in 2013 grain yield and top dry matter were determined seed nitrogen concentration was determined by kejldahl procedure bremner et al 1982 the grain protein concentration was determined by multiplying the nitrogen concentration by 5 7 irrigation water productivity kg m 3 was estimated by dividing the grain yield kg ha 1 by the volume of applied irrigation water m3 ha 1 barzegari et al 2017 as follows 4 iwp gy iw where iwp is the irrigation water productivity kg m 3 gy is the grain yield kg ha 1 and iw is the applied irrigation water m3 ha 1 2 2 crop evapotranspiration the water balance procedure was used to determine either the standard or actual crop evapotranspiration for the irrigation in dry periods and rainfall intervals in winter as follows 5 e t i p d δ s where i is the irrigation amount mm p is the precipitation mm d is the deep percolation mm and δs is the change of soil water depth between two irrigations in root zone deep percolation that mostly occurs in the rainfall season winter was estimated by the following equation between heavy rainfall events allen et al 1998 6 d i p i 1 n θ f c i θ i δ z i where d is the deep percolation other components in eq 6 are defined previously in eqs 1 and 5 the depths of d for different water balance periods were accumulated as cumulative deep percolation in the rainfall season winter the soil surface is usually wet and it is assumed that the soil water content reduction is equal to reference evapotranspiration eto farshi et al 1987 therefore soil water content before rain θi was estimated approximately this estimation was made by considering the soil water content after previous rain as field capacity and soil water depletion occurred by eto values reference evapotranspiration eto estimated by penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 which was calibrated by razzaghi and sepaskhah 2012 for semi arid environment in the study area the amounts of reference evapotranspiration eto applied irrigation water for each irrigation event for different irrigation treatments and rainfall for 2011 2012 and 2012 2013 respectively are shown in figs 1 and 2 microlysimeter was used to measure evaporation e from the soil surface one small cylinder with diameter of 0 1 m and 0 3 m height filled with the same field soil was buried in the surface soil between the crop rows the microlysimer was weighted between irrigation intervals to determine the soil surface evaporation the value of evaporation decreased by increasing the crop canopy cover crop transpiration was calculated as the difference between the estimated et from water balance and the measured e from microlysimeter 2 3 root water uptake coefficient water flow in unsaturated soils is described by the richards differential equation including a root extraction term s as follows feddes et al 1978 7 s smaxα h ho where smax is the maximum water uptake rate and α h ho is water uptake dimensionless coefficient that is a function of pressure and osmotic head the available macroscopic water uptake reduction functions for the combined stresses are divided into two categories additive and multiplicative however the most appropriate one is the multiplicative equation proposed by van dam et al 1997 as multiplication of the reduction function of feddes et al 1978 and maas and hoffman 1977 this equation was used by homaee and feddes 1999 and azizian et al 2015 the van dam et al 1997 equation is as follows 8 α h h o h h 4 h 3 h 4 b 360 h o h o where h is the soil water pressure head h3 is the soil water pressure head threshold value h4 is the soil water pressure head at wilting point and b is the yield reduction as percent per unit increase in salinity of soil water as ds m 1 the values of h3 h4 and b were determined by relationship between the relative yield and volumetric soil water content and the relationship between the relative yield and soil saturation extract salinity homaee and feddes 1999 proposed another equation that is basically a combination of linear and non linear and differs conceptually from additive and multiplicative theories in their equation it is assumed that each ds m 1 salinity beyond the threshold value ec shifts the wilting point 360 cm to the left and the equation is as follows 9 α h h o h h 4 h o h 3 h 4 h o 1 b 360 h o h o this equation is valid for ho ho and h4 ho h h3 respectively the value of 360 cm is the conversion factor of soil water salinity to osmotic pressure head cm as suggested by richards 1954 after estimation of the soil salinity osmotic head ho of the soil water was estimated by the following equation richards 1954 10 h o 360 e c e where ho is the osmotic pressure head cm and ece is the soil saturation extract ds m 1 soil water pressure head was obtained by using the soil water content in equation of the soil water retention curve as follows van genuchten 1980 11 θv 0 1 0 34 1 0 0154 h 1 279 0 218 where θv is the soil volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 and h is the soil water pressure head cm equation 11 was obtained for the soil used in this study as reported by shabani et al 2015 2 4 yield production function relative yield under water and salinity stress was estimated by the following equation doorenbos and kassam 1979 sepaskhah and yarami 2010 12 y a y m 1 k y 1 k s e t c e t c where ya is the actual crop yield mg ha 1 ym is the maximum expected crop yield mg ha 1 ky is the relative yield response factor at water stress etc is the crop evapotranspiration for standard condition no water stress mm d 1 and ks is the transpiration reduction factor which depends on soil salinity and water stress the ky can be determined by the following equation 13 1 ya ym ky 1 eta etm where eta is the actual et the value of ks is determined by the following equation as proposed by allen et al 1998 14 k s 1 b k y 100 e c e e c e t h r e s h o l d t a w d r 1 p t a w where dr is the root zone water depletion mm taw is the total available water in the root zone mm p is the fraction of taw that a crop can extract water from the root zone without suffering water stress ece is the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract ds m 1 ece th is the threshold soil saturated extract electrical conductivity ds m 1 and b is the seed yield reduction per unit saturated soil extract salinity under full irrigation condition the value of ece th is obtained by the relationship between relative grain yield and ec of soil saturation extract in fi treatment the values of p are presented by allen et al 1998 for different crops application of eq 14 is usually restricted to ece ece threshold 50 b and ky 1 0 for ky 1 0 it should predict ya 0 at ks 0 in addition the ky values are given for only 23 crops by doorenbos and kassam 1979 and where ky is unknown it is suggested to use ky 1 or may select the ky for a crop that has similar behavior there are different equations to estimate the relative yield one of them is eq 12 and another one is obtained by substituting ks in eq 12 with α h ho that is obtained by eqs 8 and 9 the resulting equation is as follows 15 y a y m 1 k y 1 α h h o e t c e t c eq 15 is used to estimate the relative yield with knowing the maximum yield ym the value of actual yield ya is estimated here the hypothesis is which equations are more appropriate for estimation of relative yield 2 5 statistical analysis results were statistically analyzed by mstat c for anova table and differences between means were compared by the duncan multiple range test at 5 level of probability soil salinity extract and leaf area were determined in two replicates therefore statistical analysis was not conducted for these traits further normalized root mean square error nrmse refined index of agreement dr theil s u inequality index were used to compare the measured and predicted values of α and yield by the following equations willmott 1982 willmott et al 2011 theil 1967 respectively 16 n r m s e 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 0 5 o 17 u 1

nrmse and d are the normalized root mean square error and the index of agreement respectively and n is the number of observations x is the measured values y is the predicted values õ is mean values of the measured data and oe is mean value of the predicted data the values of nrmse and dr approach 0 0 and 1 0 respectively for accurate simulation the closer nrmse is to 0 the model is more accurate the value of dr varies between 0 and 1 0 and the closer its value to 1 0 the model accuracy is higher the value of u varies from 0 to 1 with 0 meaning maximum agreement in addition the relationship between the measured and predicted values was compared with a 1 1 line statistically 3 results 3 1 analysis of variance results of the analysis of variance for the irrigation regimes salinity levels and planting methods and their interaction effects on the measured parameters are shown in table 3 in the first year for most of the parameters the experimental treatments influenced the measured parameters separately at 5 level of probability and there was no significant interaction effects however in the second year effects of the experimental treatments were the same as those in the first year for some of the parameters except seasonal et that salinity levels and planting methods affected differently on the seasonal et the effects of different treatments on lai were not significant data are not shown furthermore mean values of the measured parameters at different experimental treatments are compared statistically in table 4 these results are presented and discussed later in the next sections 3 2 evapotranspiration and evaporation obtained evapotranspiration et in different treatments and years are shown in tables 4 and 5 the value of et in fi and 0 6 salinity level was 690 mm and 796 mm in the first and second year respectively deficit irrigation of 0 65fi and 0 35fi reduced the et value by 18 and 28 in the first year and13 and 32 in the second year respectively the value of et reduced by salinity in the first year this reduction was 3 10 and 11 in water salinity of 5 7 5 and 10 ds m 1 compared with 0 6 ds m 1 in the second year they were 4 9 and 10 respectively the mean values of et in different salinities and irrigation treatments were 533 and 535 mm in on ridge planting and in furrow planting respectively in the first year these values were 637 mm and 640 mm respectively in the second year the mean seasonal soil surface evaporation e for different salinity levels was 149 113 and 99 mm for fi 0 65 fi and 0 35 fi respectively for in furrow planting and 166 137 and 113 mm respectively for on ridge planting respectively in the first year these values were 247 244 and 161 mm in fi 0 65fi and 0 35fi respectively for in furrow planting and 259 241 and 168 mm for on ridge planting respectively in the second year 3 3 soil salinity the mean salinity of soil saturation extract ece in the root zone and during the growing season for different treatments is shown in table 6 the highest ece was obtained in fi with 10 ds m 1 salinity level and on ridge planting as 5 8 and 4 8 ds m 1 in the first and second year respectively this highest ece was lower in the second year compared with that in the first year this is due to the fact that lower irrigation water was applied and higher rainfall occurred in the second year in both years and irrigation treatments of fi and 0 65fi soil salinity in the on ridge planting was higher than that in in furrow planting however for 0 35fi irrigation regime it is reversed soil salinity increased during the growing season results for 10 ds m 1 level different irrigation regimes and planting methods are shown in table 7 the soil salinity increased by increasing the applied water in all soil depths this increase was higher in the soil surface layer 3 4 yield and yield components grain yield deficit irrigation and salinity decreased the grain yield significantly tables 4 and 8 and grain yields were significantly different in deficit irrigation regimes for two consecutive years grain yield in water salinity level of 7 5 and 10 ds m 1 was reduced significantly in the first year compared with that in 0 6 ds m 1 however the significant reduction occurred in 10 ds m 1 in the second year compared with that in 0 6 ds m 1 in furrow planting resulted in significantly higher grain yield compared with that obtained in on ridge planting in the first and second year dry matter yield dry matter dm yield for different irrigation regimes salinity levels and planting methods are shown in tables 4 and 9 dm was reduced in deficit irrigation it was also reduced in increasing salinity levels dm was higher for in furrow planting method compared with that obtained for on ridge planting however there was no significant difference in dm in salinity levels of 0 6 5 0 and 7 5 ds m 1 in the second year grain protein concentration and harvest index grain protein concentration varied between 13 4 and 14 7 in different treatments in the first year and the difference was not statistically significant data are not shown this variation was between 14 6 and 16 5 in the second year with no significant difference however grain protein concentration in the second year is higher than that in the first year the effects of different treatments on harvest index hi were not significant hi value varied between 0 28 and 0 32 data not shown this finding might be due to the similar effects of different treatments on grain and dm yields therefore hi was not affected by different treatments 3 5 leaf area index leaf area index lai reached its highest value at 169 dap in the first year and at nearly similar time 171 dap in the second year the highest lai among different measured lai in different treatments are shown in table 10 in different treatments the highest lai was obtained in fi and salinity level of 0 6 ds m 1 deficit irrigation regimes and higher salinity levels decreased lai in the second year the lai variation was similar to that in the first year 3 6 irrigation water productivity irrigation water productivity iwp for different treatments are shown in table 11 in both years the highest iwp was obtained in 0 35fi then it was obtained in 0 65fi the lowest iwp resulted in fi regime furthermore iwp was decreased by increasing the salinity levels in both years it is indicated that iwp was higher in in furrow planting compared with that obtained in on ridge planting production function for grain yield modeling under water and salinity stress soil water matric and osmotic potentials at specific points are needed for this purpose the relationship between relative grain yield and seasonal mean volumetric soil water content at seasonal mean soil water content between 21 and 26 3 volume basis was obtained as follows 19 sya sym 0 054θv 0 418 r2 0 85 u 0 022 dr 0 82 where sya sym is the relative grain yield with respect to maximum and θv is the mean soil volumetric water content during the growing season by inserting relative grain yield equal to 1 0 in eq 19 threshold θv was obtained as 26 3 matric water potential equivalent to this θv as h3 is obtained from eq 11 as 1474 cm similar relationship for θv lower than 21 0 volume basis is 20 sya sym 0 246θv 4 27 r2 0 88 u 0 008 dr 0 86 according to eq 20 the value of θv for zero relative yield is 17 3 volume basis that is close to the pwp of the soil the water matric potential of the soil equivalent to this θv as h4 is 12 742 cm obtained from eq 11 by using the values of θv as 26 3 17 3 and θfc as 32 the value of p is obtained as 0 4 that is used in eq 14 the relationship between the relative grain yield and mean salinity of soil saturated extract at the soil surface layer in fi irrigation regime is as follows 21 sya sym 1 0 033 ece 3 36 r2 0 81 u 0 016 dr 0 79 where ece is the salinity of soil saturated extract in 0 0 3 m soil layer ds m 1 threshold value of ece is 3 36 ds m 1 that is close to that reported for wheat maas and hoffman 1977 similar equation for dm yield is obtained as follows 22 dma dmm 1 0 029 ece 2 51 r2 0 49 u 0 037 dr 0 67 where dma dmm is the relative dm yield the values of slopes and thresholds in eq 21 and 22 for grain and dm yields are close to each other and are not different very much the relationship between the relative grain and dm yields and relative et in different salinity levels are shown in table 12 these equations are site and condition specific and may not be applicable in other soils and conditions however the value of ky was not influenced by salinity levels and for grain it varied between 0 97 and 1 01 the value of ky for dm varied between 0 85 and 0 9 and it was lower than ky for grain root water uptake coefficient equations 8 and 9 used to calculate the root water uptake coefficient α necessary parameters for this calculation are obtained from our study and are shown in table 13 the relationship between the predicted α αp and measured α αm are as follows figs 4 and 5 23 αp 0 9394αm 0 0651 from eq 8 r² 0 75 u 0 05 dr 0 747 24 αp 0 9755αm 0 0246 from eq 9 r² 0 87 u 0 04 dr 0 763 the slope and intercept values are close to 1 0 and 0 respectively they indicated that eqs 8 and 9 are appropriate for α estimation equation 9 showed slope and intercept closer to 1 0 and 0 respectively with higher value of r2 and lower u value therefore eq 9 is more appropriate than eq 8 in estimating α value grain yield prediction using the values of ks obtained from eq 14 in eq 12 and α from eq 9 in eq 15 the grain yield was estimated the estimated and measured grain yields are compared in figs 6 and 7 fig 6 indicated that the slope of linear relationship is not close to 1 0 and its intercept is large whereas fig 7 showed that the slope and intercept of linear relationship is close to 1 0 and 0 therefore homaee and feddes 1999 method is appropriate in estimation of root water uptake coefficient and grain estimation with good accuracy similar results are reported by sepaskhah and beirouti 2009 for madder rubina tinctorum l 4 discussion 4 1 evapotranspiration and evaporation in general the et of the region for winter wheat is high due to high evaporative demand the value of eto for the wheat growing season was 856 mm and 880 mm in the first and second year respectively the value of et in the second year was higher than that in the first year due to higher annual rainfall and higher rainfall occurrence in the irrigation period fig 2 even though the depth of applied irrigation water in the second year was lower than that in the first year in the study area most of the rainfall occurred in winter during which there is not much et and no irrigation was applied therefore higher rainfall in the second year resulted in lower irrigation water depth furthermore with no rainfall loss by deep percolation the sum of rainfall and irrigation water should be equal to the crop et however according to fig 2 and table 5 the sum is higher than the crop et this is due to the fact that part of winter rainfall was lost by deep percolation and not used in the crop et as reported by shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2018 in the same soil in the same study area furthermore winter wheat root is shallow in winter season due to slow growth therefore water uptake or crop et is low and part of the rainfall is lost as deep percolation the values of et reduced in different irrigation regimes and these reductions were not proportional to the applied water 35 and 65 due to the fact that in deficit irrigation more rainfall water is used in et by depleting more soil water generally water salinity decreased the seasonal et allen et al 1998 in higher salinity level this decrease was higher due to lower soil osmotic potential various planting methods i e on ridge planting and in furrow planting did not influence the value of seasonal et the higher et value in the second year was due to higher rainfall and winter temperature different salinity levels and irrigation regimes reduced the mean seasonal soil surface evaporation e in general the values of e were higher due to higher rainfall and winter temperature in the second year in furrow planting compared with on ridge planting in the second year with higher rainfall and winter air temperature resulted in more frequent wetting the soil surface and higher surface evaporation and lower reduction in e furthermore different salinity levels did not influence the seasonal e data not shown since the level of salinity was not high enough to affect the soil surface evaporation results showed that in furrow planting compared with that in on ridge planting resulted in 15 and 3 reduction in e in the first and second year respectively this finding was obtained for in furrow planting due to higher lai 4 2 soil salinity the mean salinity of soil saturation extract ece in the root zone and during the growing season are close to 6 0 ds m 1 as threshold value for wheat maas and hoffman 1977 soil salinity in the second year is lower than that in the first year due to higher rainfall occurrence in the second year and the leaching more accumulated salt in soil on ridge planting in 0 35fi resulted in lower soil salinity than those obtained in fi and 0 65fi that could be due to lower depth of applied irrigation water and lesser amount of salt transfer to the furrow ridge furthermore in fi and 0 65fi irrigation regimes in the first year compared with those in the second year showed higher salinity in the upper soil layers than the mean values and their values are higher than 6 0 ds m 1 that resulted in crop yield reduction increase in soil salinity was due to the salt accumulation from saline irrigation water that was higher in the 0 0 6 m soil layer with most root density this is obtained because higher rainfall and lower irrigation water depth was applied in the second year table 5 in irrigation regimes the values of soil salinity in surface layers were higher than 6 0 ds m 1 as the threshold value for wheat maas and hoffman 1977 especially in 198 days after planting flowering stage that resulted in crop yield reduction that is described in the following section in general the soil salinity is increases with time each year however it was not increasing very much from first year to the second year due to high winter rainfall and salt leaching 4 3 yield and yield component grain yield irrigation regimes of 0 65fi and 0 35fi reduced the grain yield by 20 and 36 in the first year and 17 and 30 in the second year respectively compared with that obtained in fi similar results were reported by jiang et al 2012 and datta et al 1998 in the first year salinity levels of 5 ds m 1 7 5 ds m 1 and 10 ds m 1 reduced the grain yield by 5 11 and 18 respectively compared with that obtained in 0 6 ds m 1 these reductions are 2 5 and 19 respectively in the second year this is due to higher rainfall in the second year 439 mm compared with what occurred in the first year 363 mm which resulted in higher soil salt leaching and less salt accumulation datta et al 1998 reported 5 and 10 grain yield reduction in water salinity of 3 and 9 ds m 1 respectively faizi 2009 showed that water salinity of 4 9 and 8 2 ds m 1 reduced the grain yield by 8 and 32 respectively that was higher than our findings the mean value of grain yield reduction in two years is 18 5 that is corresponding to leaching fraction of about 20 for water salinity of 10 ds m 1 this indicated that irrigation application efficiency of 80 was sufficient to apply extra water to control the soil salinity for about 25 yield reduction as leaching fraction lf equation presented by ayars and westcot 1976 as lf eciw 5ece eciw where ece and eciw are the electrical conductivity of soil saturation extract and irrigation water respectively in furrow planting compared with on ridge planting increased the grain yield by 4 4 and 4 in the first and second year respectively this finding is due to lower soil salinity in in furrow planting especially in fi and 0 65fi irrigation regimes under full irrigation regimes salinity levels up to 5 ds m 1 are appropriate in both planting methods in the first year however the appropriate salinity level is up to 7 5 ds m 1 in the second year that is obtained due to higher seasonal rainfall 439 mm vs 363 mm when water is scarce salinity of 5 0 ds m 1 is appropriate in seasonal rainfall of 363 mm first year and in higher seasonal rainfall 439 mm second year salinity of 7 5 ds m 1 is appropriate in 0 65fi furthermore in furrow planting allowed using water with higher salinity especially in deficit irrigation regimes dry matter irrigation regimes of 0 65fi and 0 35fi was reduced dry matter dm by 17 and 32 in the first year and 17 and 27 in the second year respectively compared with that obtained in fi in the first year salinity level of 5 0 7 5 and 10 ds m 1 decreased dm by 9 11 and 19 respectively compared with that obtained in 0 6 ds m 1 table 9 these reductions were 1 5 and 17 respectively in the second year dm reduction in the second year was lower than that obtained in the first year due to higher irrigation water depth in spring season higher rainfall in fall and winter and consequently higher salt leaching in furrow planting resulted in significantly higher dm as 5 in both years compared with that obtained in on ridge planting this reduction was similar to that obtained for grain yield therefore it is indicated that planting method had similar effect on both grain yield and dm in general in furrow planting showed higher dm that is in accordance with the higher lai the higher lai and dm in in furrow planting might be due to higher soil water and temperature in furrows as reported by alborzi haghighi 2016 4 4 irrigation water productivity in scarce water conditions 0 65fi and in furrow planting resulted in higher grain and iwp therefore it is appropriate irrigation strategy with about 33 water reduction in the study region soil evaporation was subtracted from the et during the growing season to obtain transpiration the relationship between dm and transpiration was obtained by linear regression analysis as follows 25 dm 0 0312 tr r² 0 86 u 0 030 dr 0 80 where dm is the dry matter yield mg ha 1 and tr is the transpiration mm eq 25 indicates that transpiration productivity is 3 12 kg m 3 this relationship can be used in modeling wheat growth and production 4 5 wheat yield modeling the slope of the relationship between relative yield and relative et ky is used in field of irrigation water management the value of ky for grain yield was similar to that reported by doorenbos and kassam 1979 as 1 05 for non saline condition in fig 7 the slope is close to 1 0 and the intercept is close to 0 therefore the coefficient of root water uptake of homaee and feddes 1999 is more appropriate to be used in wheat yield modelling 5 conclusions in the first year grain yield was reduced by 20 and 26 in irrigation regimes of 0 65fi and 0 35fi respectively these reductions were 17 and 30 in the second year respectively the corresponding irrigation water reductions were 33 and 62 in both years in 0 65fi and 0 35fi respectively therefore it is indicated that the proportion of irrigation water reduction to the grain yield reduction is 2 1 in benefit of the deficit irrigation mostly due to the seasonal rainfall of 363 and 439 mm in the first and second year respectively results also indicated that in fi with 20 leaching fraction the salinity level of 5 0 ds m 1 produced no grain yield reduction furthermore salinity levels of 5 0 and 7 5 ds m 1 for irrigation regimes of 0 65fi and 0 35fi respectively did not show significant difference in grain yield compared with that obtained in 0 6 ds m 1 salinity level therefore by deficit irrigation higher salinity level is applicable due to lower salt accumulation in soil in furrow planting resulted in 4 statistically significant higher grain yield compared with that obtained in on ridge planting with 5 higher irrigation water productivity considering acceptable grain yield production in 0 65fi its irrigation water productivity 1 03 kg m 3 and 1 1 kg m 3 in the first and second year respectively was significantly higher than that obtained in fi 0 85 kg m 3 and 0 87 kg m 3 in the first and second year respectively in in furrow planting grain yield in a salinity level of 7 5 ds m 1 was suitable with irrigation regime of 0 65fi whereas in on ridge planting it is 5 0 ds m 1 therefore with non limited irrigation water conditions fi with salinity level of 5 0 ds m 1 and in furrow planting is the appropriate irrigation management for winter wheat however with limited water supply 0 65fi with salinity of 7 5 ds m 1 and in furrow planting would be appropriate in winter wheat irrigation management in the study region the root water uptake was predicted by using homaee feddes method with higher accuracy and its value was used in grain yield prediction with doorenbos kassam yield et function with higher accuracy acknowledgement this research supported in part by a research project

11134,shortage and salinity of irrigation water are two major constraints that influence wheat production in arid and semi arid regions of iran in this study effects of deficit furrow irrigation with different salinity levels and planting methods in furrow and on ridge as strategies for coping with water and salinity stress on yield and yield quality of winter wheat was investigated in a two year experiment irrigation treatments were full irrigation fi 0 65fi and 0 35fi and salinity levels of irrigation water were 0 6 well water 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 ds m 1 in the first year grain yield was reduced by 20 and 26 in irrigation regimes of 0 65fi 381 mm and 0 35fi 217 mm respectively these reductions were 17 and 30 in the second year respectively the corresponding irrigation water reductions were 33 and 62 in both years for 0 65fi 381 and 355 mm compared to 573 mm and 0 35fi 217 and 203 mm compared to 533 mm respectively therefore it is indicated that the proportion of irrigation water reduction to the grain yield reduction is 2 1 in benefit of the deficit irrigation mostly due to the seasonal rainfall of 363 and 439 mm in the first and second years respectively although the majority of rainfall occurred in winter the winter wheat growth is at rest results also indicated that in fi with irrigation application efficiency of 80 leaching fraction of 20 the salinity level of 3 36 ds m 1 produced no grain yield reduction furthermore salinity level of 7 5 ds m 1 for irrigation regimes of 0 65fi and 0 35fi respectively did not show significant difference in grain yield compared with that obtained in 0 6 ds m 1 salinity level therefore by deficit irrigation higher salinity level is applicable due to lower salt accumulation in soil in furrow planting resulted in 4 statistically significant higher grain yield compared with that obtained in on ridge planting with 5 higher irrigation water productivity iwp by considering acceptable grain yield production in 0 65fi its iwp 1 03 kg m 3 and 1 1 kg m 3 in the first and second year respectively was significantly higher than those obtained in fi 0 85 kg m 3 and 0 87 kg m 3 in the first and second year respectively in in furrow planting grain yield in salinity level of 7 5 ds m 1 was suitable with irrigation regime of 0 65fi whereas for on ridge planting appropriate salinity is 5 0 ds m 1 therefore in non limited irrigation water condition fi with salinity level of 5 0 ds m 1 and in furrow planting is the appropriate irrigation management for winter wheat however with limited water supply 0 65fi with salinity of 7 5 ds m 1 and in furrow planting would be appropriate in winter wheat irrigation management in the study region the root water uptake was predicted by homaee feddes method with higher accuracy and its value was used in grain yield prediction with doorenbos kassam yield et function with higher accuracy keywords salinity and irrigation interaction salinity stress water stress yield yield production function 1 introduction water scarcity and its salinity are the main factors affecting wheat production in arid and semi arid regions in iran therefore efficient use of saline water resources is essential in these areas to achieve efficient water use different methods are used to decrease the irrigation water depth and increase the benefit from higher water salinity one of these methods is in furrow planting buttar et al 2006 zhang et al 2007 shabani et al 2013 yarami and sepaskhah 2015a b in furrow irrigation crops are planted on furrow ridges and furrow bottoms are wetted by irrigation therefore the salt is accumulated on the ridge and it is reduced in the furrow bottom in ordinary furrow irrigation water is evaporated from the furrow whereas in in furrow planting crops are planted in furrow bottoms which results in soil evaporation reduction and increases the water productivity buttar et al 2006 shabani et al 2013 yarami and sepaskhah 2015a b zhang et al 2007 and li et al 2010 studied the effects of different planting patterns on wheat yield they indicated that water use efficiency in planting on raised bed and in furrow was higher than that in basin planting furthermore quanqi et al 2012 reported that in furrow planting in light loamy soil and summer monsoon climates increased wheat grain yield from 7 6 t ha 1 to 8 1 t ha 1 in comparison with yields for on ridge planting efficient water use can be achieved by deficit irrigation however optimum water depth in deficit irrigation should be determined on the other hand the optimum level of deficit irrigation could be different in various levels of irrigation water salinity panda et al 2003 used different reductions in water depth of full irrigation 10 30 45 60 and 75 for wheat in sandy loam soil in a sunhumid subtropical climate they indicated that the highest water use efficiency was obtained at 45 of water reduction furthermore mugabe and nyakatawa 2000 applied irrigation water depth with 50 75 and 100 of full irrigation for wheat in dark reddish brown clay soil and a semi arid climate they found that the reductions in grain yield were 9 and 16 by reducing 25 and 50 irrigation water respectively mahbod et al 2015 used different water depths as 0 50 80 100 and 120 of full irrigation with different rates of nitrogen application 0 46 92 and 136 kg n ha 1 for wheat in bajgah area shiraz iran with clay loam soil and semi arid climate they indicated that with 136 kg n ha 1 and 20 reduction in irrigation water depth grain yield was not reduced chauhan et al 2008 showed that supplementary irrigation of wheat in fields with irrigation water salinity of 8 12 ds m 1 resulted in 10 yield reduction furthermore hamdy et al 2005 indicated that supplementary irrigation of wheat irrigation at sensitive stages of flowering and grain filling in greenhouse with irrigation water salinity of 3 9 ds m 1 resulted in 25 reduction in grain yield interaction effects between irrigation regimes 100 80 and 60 of etc and salinity levels of irrigation water 0 65 3 2 and 6 1 ds m 1 on wheat yield were studied by jiang et al 2012 in an arid climate the soil texture consists of 0 50 cm sandy loam and 50 125 cm clay loam loam with medium fertility they indicated that the highest grain yield was obtained with 300 mm of water and salinity level of 3 2 ds m 1 and by using salinity level of 6 1 ds m 1 yield reduction was 8 10 in the crop evapotranspiration process pure soil water is extracted and salt concentration in soil solution is increased which resulted in a reduction in soil matric and osmotic potentials consequently the reduced soil matric and osmotic potentials decrease root water uptake macroscopic extraction models are readily used to determine the root water uptake by investigators feddes et al 1978 in this method the total root extraction rate under non stressed conditions is assumed to be equal to the potential transpiration by decreasing the soil water pressure head to a critical value the water uptake is decreased until the transpiration rate is ceased at the soil water wilting point feddes et al 1978 proposed a linear reduction model for root water uptake however van genuchten 1987 and dirksen et al 1993 proposed non linear osmotic and matric head functions that are additive or multiplicative functions recently homaee and feddes 1999 and homaee et al 2002 indicated that both intercept and slope of the reduction functions are increased by salinity for water uptake in vegetative growth periods of alfalfa their model was used for prediction of water uptake coefficient α in yield water relationship under different salinity levels accurately there is a strong interaction effect between salinity and irrigation regimes and the optimum irrigation regimes in different salinity levels for wheat should be determined for better management of saline irrigation water furthermore during the winter wheat growing period rainfall occurs that is stored in soil to supply some of the crop water requirement and even with excess amount of rainfall it can leach the salt in soil as accumulated by applied saline water in the semi arid region therefore for winter wheat it is important to determine the appropriate irrigation regimes salinity levels of irrigation water and planting method the objectives of this study are to investigate the effects of different irrigation regimes salinity levels and planting methods on yield yield quality and water productivity of winter wheat in a semi arid region 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment this experiment was conducted at the experimental research station in agricultural college shiraz university i r of iran in 2011 2012 and 2012 2013 growing seasons the experiment was conducted at the same place in two consecutive years the climatic conditions of the study area is semi arid mean daily minimum temperature in december 2011 and 2012 was 2 5 and 1 4 c respectively frost occurred during the plant dormancy in 2011 2012 and 2012 2013 growing season figs 1 and 2 the value of reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated based on the modified penman monteith method modified by razzaghi and sepaskhah 2012 physical and chemical properties of soil and water are shown in tables 1 and 2 physical and chemical properties of soil are obtained in the first year before planting and the same value are assumed for the second year after the first year harvest the experimental plots were leached with enough fresh water to reduce the soil salinity to the initial value experimental design was a split split plot arrangement in randomized complete block design with irrigation treatment as the main plot salinity level of water as the subplot and planting method as the sub subplot with three replications irrigation treatments included full irrigation fi 65 and 35 of full irrigation 0 65fi and 0 35fi respectively full irrigation is water requirement with irrigation application efficiency of 80 shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2016 that uses an equivalent leaching fraction of 20 however the seasonal depth of irrigation water for fi is higher in the first year due to lower seasonal rainfall 363 mm compared with that in the second year 439 mm table 3 in full irrigation the applied water provided by raising the soil water content in the root zone to the soil field capacity therefore the crop was kept under non stressed conditions irrigation water salinity levels were 0 6 well water 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 ds m 1 in the both years of study different salinity levels of water were prepared by the addition of nacl and cacl2 to the fresh water well water with equal equivalent proportion the irrigation efficiency of 80 in field may result in 20 leaching fraction that controls the salt accumulation in soil by saline water use on ridge and in furrow planting methods were used as sub subplot fig 3 each sub subplot area was 3 4 m2 with 1 0 m distance between two adjacent sub subplots to avoid water invasion from one sub subplot to another a local cultivar pishtaz of winter wheat sowed on 6 november 2011 and 11 november 2012 in eight rows with seeding rate of 250 kg ha 1 in furrow planting contained two rows in bottom of each furrow and on ridge planting contained two rows on top of each ridge with spacing of 0 15 m the spacing between ridges and furrows were 0 6 m during the main irrigation period irrigation water was applied in 10 14 day intervals irrigation water depth for each irrigation event was determined by measuring the soil water content at depths of 0 0 3 0 3 0 6 0 6 0 9 and 0 9 1 2 m before each irrigation event and it was measured eight times in the non irrigated period in fall and winter by the neutron scattering method the access tubes were installed in the middle of the furrow and the on ridge for in furrow and on ridge planting methods respectively the neutron probe was calibrated by a standard method as described by carneiro and de jong 1985 the soil water content in the root zone was raised to the soil field capacity and amount of the net irrigation water was calculated as follows 1 d n i 1 n θ f c i θ i δ z i where dn is the net irrigation water depth m өfci and өi are the volumetric soil water content in layer i at field capacity and before irrigation respectively m3 m 3 δzi is the soil layer thickness m and n is the number of soil layers depth of root was estimated by the equation proposed by borg and grimes 1986 the volume of irrigation water was determined by multiplying the gross irrigation water depth by the plot area 12 m2 and it was applied by a flexible hose connected to a flow meter uniformly to each plot even for low amount of irrigation water in 0 35fi treatment soil phosphorous was enriched by applying ammonium phosphate at a rate of 100 kg ha 1 20 kg n ha 1 46 kg p2o5 ha 1 mixed with the soil at plowing for soil nitrogen enrichment urea was applied as 150 kg ha 1 at 110 days after planting dap late winter and 158 dap early spring in 2011 2012 and at 105 dap and 158 dap in 2012 2013 respectively total of 138 kg n ha 1 for determination of soil saturation extract salinity soil samples were collected from each plot about 179 198 and 250 dap in first year and 195 and 250 dap in the second year soil samples were taken in 0 3 m increment to depth of 1 2 m to assess the soil salinity in the root zone soil samples were taken from bed of furrow in in furrow planting and were taken from top of ridge in on ridge planting method i e where the most of plant roots are growing and exposing to soil salinity the depth of furrow was 0 15 m saturated soil extract salinity was determined using the method described by the u s salinity laboratory staff richards 1954 one plant was selected in each plot and leaf length and width for this plant were measured by a ruler and converted to leaf area by the following equation mosaffa 2016 2 a 0 65l w 0 35 where a is the leaf area cm2 l and w are the leaf length and width cm respectively in eq 2 there is an intercept 0 35 for the relationship between a and l w as reported by mosaffa 2016 the leaf area index lai is calculated as 3 lai a ac where ac is the area of soil surface occupied by a plant it is determined by multiplication of row spacing and distance between plants on a row lai was measured six times in 2011 2012 and seven times in 2012 2013 plants were harvested from four middle rows with length of 2 5 m on july 4 in 2012 and july 11 in 2013 grain yield and top dry matter were determined seed nitrogen concentration was determined by kejldahl procedure bremner et al 1982 the grain protein concentration was determined by multiplying the nitrogen concentration by 5 7 irrigation water productivity kg m 3 was estimated by dividing the grain yield kg ha 1 by the volume of applied irrigation water m3 ha 1 barzegari et al 2017 as follows 4 iwp gy iw where iwp is the irrigation water productivity kg m 3 gy is the grain yield kg ha 1 and iw is the applied irrigation water m3 ha 1 2 2 crop evapotranspiration the water balance procedure was used to determine either the standard or actual crop evapotranspiration for the irrigation in dry periods and rainfall intervals in winter as follows 5 e t i p d δ s where i is the irrigation amount mm p is the precipitation mm d is the deep percolation mm and δs is the change of soil water depth between two irrigations in root zone deep percolation that mostly occurs in the rainfall season winter was estimated by the following equation between heavy rainfall events allen et al 1998 6 d i p i 1 n θ f c i θ i δ z i where d is the deep percolation other components in eq 6 are defined previously in eqs 1 and 5 the depths of d for different water balance periods were accumulated as cumulative deep percolation in the rainfall season winter the soil surface is usually wet and it is assumed that the soil water content reduction is equal to reference evapotranspiration eto farshi et al 1987 therefore soil water content before rain θi was estimated approximately this estimation was made by considering the soil water content after previous rain as field capacity and soil water depletion occurred by eto values reference evapotranspiration eto estimated by penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 which was calibrated by razzaghi and sepaskhah 2012 for semi arid environment in the study area the amounts of reference evapotranspiration eto applied irrigation water for each irrigation event for different irrigation treatments and rainfall for 2011 2012 and 2012 2013 respectively are shown in figs 1 and 2 microlysimeter was used to measure evaporation e from the soil surface one small cylinder with diameter of 0 1 m and 0 3 m height filled with the same field soil was buried in the surface soil between the crop rows the microlysimer was weighted between irrigation intervals to determine the soil surface evaporation the value of evaporation decreased by increasing the crop canopy cover crop transpiration was calculated as the difference between the estimated et from water balance and the measured e from microlysimeter 2 3 root water uptake coefficient water flow in unsaturated soils is described by the richards differential equation including a root extraction term s as follows feddes et al 1978 7 s smaxα h ho where smax is the maximum water uptake rate and α h ho is water uptake dimensionless coefficient that is a function of pressure and osmotic head the available macroscopic water uptake reduction functions for the combined stresses are divided into two categories additive and multiplicative however the most appropriate one is the multiplicative equation proposed by van dam et al 1997 as multiplication of the reduction function of feddes et al 1978 and maas and hoffman 1977 this equation was used by homaee and feddes 1999 and azizian et al 2015 the van dam et al 1997 equation is as follows 8 α h h o h h 4 h 3 h 4 b 360 h o h o where h is the soil water pressure head h3 is the soil water pressure head threshold value h4 is the soil water pressure head at wilting point and b is the yield reduction as percent per unit increase in salinity of soil water as ds m 1 the values of h3 h4 and b were determined by relationship between the relative yield and volumetric soil water content and the relationship between the relative yield and soil saturation extract salinity homaee and feddes 1999 proposed another equation that is basically a combination of linear and non linear and differs conceptually from additive and multiplicative theories in their equation it is assumed that each ds m 1 salinity beyond the threshold value ec shifts the wilting point 360 cm to the left and the equation is as follows 9 α h h o h h 4 h o h 3 h 4 h o 1 b 360 h o h o this equation is valid for ho ho and h4 ho h h3 respectively the value of 360 cm is the conversion factor of soil water salinity to osmotic pressure head cm as suggested by richards 1954 after estimation of the soil salinity osmotic head ho of the soil water was estimated by the following equation richards 1954 10 h o 360 e c e where ho is the osmotic pressure head cm and ece is the soil saturation extract ds m 1 soil water pressure head was obtained by using the soil water content in equation of the soil water retention curve as follows van genuchten 1980 11 θv 0 1 0 34 1 0 0154 h 1 279 0 218 where θv is the soil volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 and h is the soil water pressure head cm equation 11 was obtained for the soil used in this study as reported by shabani et al 2015 2 4 yield production function relative yield under water and salinity stress was estimated by the following equation doorenbos and kassam 1979 sepaskhah and yarami 2010 12 y a y m 1 k y 1 k s e t c e t c where ya is the actual crop yield mg ha 1 ym is the maximum expected crop yield mg ha 1 ky is the relative yield response factor at water stress etc is the crop evapotranspiration for standard condition no water stress mm d 1 and ks is the transpiration reduction factor which depends on soil salinity and water stress the ky can be determined by the following equation 13 1 ya ym ky 1 eta etm where eta is the actual et the value of ks is determined by the following equation as proposed by allen et al 1998 14 k s 1 b k y 100 e c e e c e t h r e s h o l d t a w d r 1 p t a w where dr is the root zone water depletion mm taw is the total available water in the root zone mm p is the fraction of taw that a crop can extract water from the root zone without suffering water stress ece is the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract ds m 1 ece th is the threshold soil saturated extract electrical conductivity ds m 1 and b is the seed yield reduction per unit saturated soil extract salinity under full irrigation condition the value of ece th is obtained by the relationship between relative grain yield and ec of soil saturation extract in fi treatment the values of p are presented by allen et al 1998 for different crops application of eq 14 is usually restricted to ece ece threshold 50 b and ky 1 0 for ky 1 0 it should predict ya 0 at ks 0 in addition the ky values are given for only 23 crops by doorenbos and kassam 1979 and where ky is unknown it is suggested to use ky 1 or may select the ky for a crop that has similar behavior there are different equations to estimate the relative yield one of them is eq 12 and another one is obtained by substituting ks in eq 12 with α h ho that is obtained by eqs 8 and 9 the resulting equation is as follows 15 y a y m 1 k y 1 α h h o e t c e t c eq 15 is used to estimate the relative yield with knowing the maximum yield ym the value of actual yield ya is estimated here the hypothesis is which equations are more appropriate for estimation of relative yield 2 5 statistical analysis results were statistically analyzed by mstat c for anova table and differences between means were compared by the duncan multiple range test at 5 level of probability soil salinity extract and leaf area were determined in two replicates therefore statistical analysis was not conducted for these traits further normalized root mean square error nrmse refined index of agreement dr theil s u inequality index were used to compare the measured and predicted values of α and yield by the following equations willmott 1982 willmott et al 2011 theil 1967 respectively 16 n r m s e 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 0 5 o 17 u 1

nrmse and d are the normalized root mean square error and the index of agreement respectively and n is the number of observations x is the measured values y is the predicted values õ is mean values of the measured data and oe is mean value of the predicted data the values of nrmse and dr approach 0 0 and 1 0 respectively for accurate simulation the closer nrmse is to 0 the model is more accurate the value of dr varies between 0 and 1 0 and the closer its value to 1 0 the model accuracy is higher the value of u varies from 0 to 1 with 0 meaning maximum agreement in addition the relationship between the measured and predicted values was compared with a 1 1 line statistically 3 results 3 1 analysis of variance results of the analysis of variance for the irrigation regimes salinity levels and planting methods and their interaction effects on the measured parameters are shown in table 3 in the first year for most of the parameters the experimental treatments influenced the measured parameters separately at 5 level of probability and there was no significant interaction effects however in the second year effects of the experimental treatments were the same as those in the first year for some of the parameters except seasonal et that salinity levels and planting methods affected differently on the seasonal et the effects of different treatments on lai were not significant data are not shown furthermore mean values of the measured parameters at different experimental treatments are compared statistically in table 4 these results are presented and discussed later in the next sections 3 2 evapotranspiration and evaporation obtained evapotranspiration et in different treatments and years are shown in tables 4 and 5 the value of et in fi and 0 6 salinity level was 690 mm and 796 mm in the first and second year respectively deficit irrigation of 0 65fi and 0 35fi reduced the et value by 18 and 28 in the first year and13 and 32 in the second year respectively the value of et reduced by salinity in the first year this reduction was 3 10 and 11 in water salinity of 5 7 5 and 10 ds m 1 compared with 0 6 ds m 1 in the second year they were 4 9 and 10 respectively the mean values of et in different salinities and irrigation treatments were 533 and 535 mm in on ridge planting and in furrow planting respectively in the first year these values were 637 mm and 640 mm respectively in the second year the mean seasonal soil surface evaporation e for different salinity levels was 149 113 and 99 mm for fi 0 65 fi and 0 35 fi respectively for in furrow planting and 166 137 and 113 mm respectively for on ridge planting respectively in the first year these values were 247 244 and 161 mm in fi 0 65fi and 0 35fi respectively for in furrow planting and 259 241 and 168 mm for on ridge planting respectively in the second year 3 3 soil salinity the mean salinity of soil saturation extract ece in the root zone and during the growing season for different treatments is shown in table 6 the highest ece was obtained in fi with 10 ds m 1 salinity level and on ridge planting as 5 8 and 4 8 ds m 1 in the first and second year respectively this highest ece was lower in the second year compared with that in the first year this is due to the fact that lower irrigation water was applied and higher rainfall occurred in the second year in both years and irrigation treatments of fi and 0 65fi soil salinity in the on ridge planting was higher than that in in furrow planting however for 0 35fi irrigation regime it is reversed soil salinity increased during the growing season results for 10 ds m 1 level different irrigation regimes and planting methods are shown in table 7 the soil salinity increased by increasing the applied water in all soil depths this increase was higher in the soil surface layer 3 4 yield and yield components grain yield deficit irrigation and salinity decreased the grain yield significantly tables 4 and 8 and grain yields were significantly different in deficit irrigation regimes for two consecutive years grain yield in water salinity level of 7 5 and 10 ds m 1 was reduced significantly in the first year compared with that in 0 6 ds m 1 however the significant reduction occurred in 10 ds m 1 in the second year compared with that in 0 6 ds m 1 in furrow planting resulted in significantly higher grain yield compared with that obtained in on ridge planting in the first and second year dry matter yield dry matter dm yield for different irrigation regimes salinity levels and planting methods are shown in tables 4 and 9 dm was reduced in deficit irrigation it was also reduced in increasing salinity levels dm was higher for in furrow planting method compared with that obtained for on ridge planting however there was no significant difference in dm in salinity levels of 0 6 5 0 and 7 5 ds m 1 in the second year grain protein concentration and harvest index grain protein concentration varied between 13 4 and 14 7 in different treatments in the first year and the difference was not statistically significant data are not shown this variation was between 14 6 and 16 5 in the second year with no significant difference however grain protein concentration in the second year is higher than that in the first year the effects of different treatments on harvest index hi were not significant hi value varied between 0 28 and 0 32 data not shown this finding might be due to the similar effects of different treatments on grain and dm yields therefore hi was not affected by different treatments 3 5 leaf area index leaf area index lai reached its highest value at 169 dap in the first year and at nearly similar time 171 dap in the second year the highest lai among different measured lai in different treatments are shown in table 10 in different treatments the highest lai was obtained in fi and salinity level of 0 6 ds m 1 deficit irrigation regimes and higher salinity levels decreased lai in the second year the lai variation was similar to that in the first year 3 6 irrigation water productivity irrigation water productivity iwp for different treatments are shown in table 11 in both years the highest iwp was obtained in 0 35fi then it was obtained in 0 65fi the lowest iwp resulted in fi regime furthermore iwp was decreased by increasing the salinity levels in both years it is indicated that iwp was higher in in furrow planting compared with that obtained in on ridge planting production function for grain yield modeling under water and salinity stress soil water matric and osmotic potentials at specific points are needed for this purpose the relationship between relative grain yield and seasonal mean volumetric soil water content at seasonal mean soil water content between 21 and 26 3 volume basis was obtained as follows 19 sya sym 0 054θv 0 418 r2 0 85 u 0 022 dr 0 82 where sya sym is the relative grain yield with respect to maximum and θv is the mean soil volumetric water content during the growing season by inserting relative grain yield equal to 1 0 in eq 19 threshold θv was obtained as 26 3 matric water potential equivalent to this θv as h3 is obtained from eq 11 as 1474 cm similar relationship for θv lower than 21 0 volume basis is 20 sya sym 0 246θv 4 27 r2 0 88 u 0 008 dr 0 86 according to eq 20 the value of θv for zero relative yield is 17 3 volume basis that is close to the pwp of the soil the water matric potential of the soil equivalent to this θv as h4 is 12 742 cm obtained from eq 11 by using the values of θv as 26 3 17 3 and θfc as 32 the value of p is obtained as 0 4 that is used in eq 14 the relationship between the relative grain yield and mean salinity of soil saturated extract at the soil surface layer in fi irrigation regime is as follows 21 sya sym 1 0 033 ece 3 36 r2 0 81 u 0 016 dr 0 79 where ece is the salinity of soil saturated extract in 0 0 3 m soil layer ds m 1 threshold value of ece is 3 36 ds m 1 that is close to that reported for wheat maas and hoffman 1977 similar equation for dm yield is obtained as follows 22 dma dmm 1 0 029 ece 2 51 r2 0 49 u 0 037 dr 0 67 where dma dmm is the relative dm yield the values of slopes and thresholds in eq 21 and 22 for grain and dm yields are close to each other and are not different very much the relationship between the relative grain and dm yields and relative et in different salinity levels are shown in table 12 these equations are site and condition specific and may not be applicable in other soils and conditions however the value of ky was not influenced by salinity levels and for grain it varied between 0 97 and 1 01 the value of ky for dm varied between 0 85 and 0 9 and it was lower than ky for grain root water uptake coefficient equations 8 and 9 used to calculate the root water uptake coefficient α necessary parameters for this calculation are obtained from our study and are shown in table 13 the relationship between the predicted α αp and measured α αm are as follows figs 4 and 5 23 αp 0 9394αm 0 0651 from eq 8 r² 0 75 u 0 05 dr 0 747 24 αp 0 9755αm 0 0246 from eq 9 r² 0 87 u 0 04 dr 0 763 the slope and intercept values are close to 1 0 and 0 respectively they indicated that eqs 8 and 9 are appropriate for α estimation equation 9 showed slope and intercept closer to 1 0 and 0 respectively with higher value of r2 and lower u value therefore eq 9 is more appropriate than eq 8 in estimating α value grain yield prediction using the values of ks obtained from eq 14 in eq 12 and α from eq 9 in eq 15 the grain yield was estimated the estimated and measured grain yields are compared in figs 6 and 7 fig 6 indicated that the slope of linear relationship is not close to 1 0 and its intercept is large whereas fig 7 showed that the slope and intercept of linear relationship is close to 1 0 and 0 therefore homaee and feddes 1999 method is appropriate in estimation of root water uptake coefficient and grain estimation with good accuracy similar results are reported by sepaskhah and beirouti 2009 for madder rubina tinctorum l 4 discussion 4 1 evapotranspiration and evaporation in general the et of the region for winter wheat is high due to high evaporative demand the value of eto for the wheat growing season was 856 mm and 880 mm in the first and second year respectively the value of et in the second year was higher than that in the first year due to higher annual rainfall and higher rainfall occurrence in the irrigation period fig 2 even though the depth of applied irrigation water in the second year was lower than that in the first year in the study area most of the rainfall occurred in winter during which there is not much et and no irrigation was applied therefore higher rainfall in the second year resulted in lower irrigation water depth furthermore with no rainfall loss by deep percolation the sum of rainfall and irrigation water should be equal to the crop et however according to fig 2 and table 5 the sum is higher than the crop et this is due to the fact that part of winter rainfall was lost by deep percolation and not used in the crop et as reported by shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2018 in the same soil in the same study area furthermore winter wheat root is shallow in winter season due to slow growth therefore water uptake or crop et is low and part of the rainfall is lost as deep percolation the values of et reduced in different irrigation regimes and these reductions were not proportional to the applied water 35 and 65 due to the fact that in deficit irrigation more rainfall water is used in et by depleting more soil water generally water salinity decreased the seasonal et allen et al 1998 in higher salinity level this decrease was higher due to lower soil osmotic potential various planting methods i e on ridge planting and in furrow planting did not influence the value of seasonal et the higher et value in the second year was due to higher rainfall and winter temperature different salinity levels and irrigation regimes reduced the mean seasonal soil surface evaporation e in general the values of e were higher due to higher rainfall and winter temperature in the second year in furrow planting compared with on ridge planting in the second year with higher rainfall and winter air temperature resulted in more frequent wetting the soil surface and higher surface evaporation and lower reduction in e furthermore different salinity levels did not influence the seasonal e data not shown since the level of salinity was not high enough to affect the soil surface evaporation results showed that in furrow planting compared with that in on ridge planting resulted in 15 and 3 reduction in e in the first and second year respectively this finding was obtained for in furrow planting due to higher lai 4 2 soil salinity the mean salinity of soil saturation extract ece in the root zone and during the growing season are close to 6 0 ds m 1 as threshold value for wheat maas and hoffman 1977 soil salinity in the second year is lower than that in the first year due to higher rainfall occurrence in the second year and the leaching more accumulated salt in soil on ridge planting in 0 35fi resulted in lower soil salinity than those obtained in fi and 0 65fi that could be due to lower depth of applied irrigation water and lesser amount of salt transfer to the furrow ridge furthermore in fi and 0 65fi irrigation regimes in the first year compared with those in the second year showed higher salinity in the upper soil layers than the mean values and their values are higher than 6 0 ds m 1 that resulted in crop yield reduction increase in soil salinity was due to the salt accumulation from saline irrigation water that was higher in the 0 0 6 m soil layer with most root density this is obtained because higher rainfall and lower irrigation water depth was applied in the second year table 5 in irrigation regimes the values of soil salinity in surface layers were higher than 6 0 ds m 1 as the threshold value for wheat maas and hoffman 1977 especially in 198 days after planting flowering stage that resulted in crop yield reduction that is described in the following section in general the soil salinity is increases with time each year however it was not increasing very much from first year to the second year due to high winter rainfall and salt leaching 4 3 yield and yield component grain yield irrigation regimes of 0 65fi and 0 35fi reduced the grain yield by 20 and 36 in the first year and 17 and 30 in the second year respectively compared with that obtained in fi similar results were reported by jiang et al 2012 and datta et al 1998 in the first year salinity levels of 5 ds m 1 7 5 ds m 1 and 10 ds m 1 reduced the grain yield by 5 11 and 18 respectively compared with that obtained in 0 6 ds m 1 these reductions are 2 5 and 19 respectively in the second year this is due to higher rainfall in the second year 439 mm compared with what occurred in the first year 363 mm which resulted in higher soil salt leaching and less salt accumulation datta et al 1998 reported 5 and 10 grain yield reduction in water salinity of 3 and 9 ds m 1 respectively faizi 2009 showed that water salinity of 4 9 and 8 2 ds m 1 reduced the grain yield by 8 and 32 respectively that was higher than our findings the mean value of grain yield reduction in two years is 18 5 that is corresponding to leaching fraction of about 20 for water salinity of 10 ds m 1 this indicated that irrigation application efficiency of 80 was sufficient to apply extra water to control the soil salinity for about 25 yield reduction as leaching fraction lf equation presented by ayars and westcot 1976 as lf eciw 5ece eciw where ece and eciw are the electrical conductivity of soil saturation extract and irrigation water respectively in furrow planting compared with on ridge planting increased the grain yield by 4 4 and 4 in the first and second year respectively this finding is due to lower soil salinity in in furrow planting especially in fi and 0 65fi irrigation regimes under full irrigation regimes salinity levels up to 5 ds m 1 are appropriate in both planting methods in the first year however the appropriate salinity level is up to 7 5 ds m 1 in the second year that is obtained due to higher seasonal rainfall 439 mm vs 363 mm when water is scarce salinity of 5 0 ds m 1 is appropriate in seasonal rainfall of 363 mm first year and in higher seasonal rainfall 439 mm second year salinity of 7 5 ds m 1 is appropriate in 0 65fi furthermore in furrow planting allowed using water with higher salinity especially in deficit irrigation regimes dry matter irrigation regimes of 0 65fi and 0 35fi was reduced dry matter dm by 17 and 32 in the first year and 17 and 27 in the second year respectively compared with that obtained in fi in the first year salinity level of 5 0 7 5 and 10 ds m 1 decreased dm by 9 11 and 19 respectively compared with that obtained in 0 6 ds m 1 table 9 these reductions were 1 5 and 17 respectively in the second year dm reduction in the second year was lower than that obtained in the first year due to higher irrigation water depth in spring season higher rainfall in fall and winter and consequently higher salt leaching in furrow planting resulted in significantly higher dm as 5 in both years compared with that obtained in on ridge planting this reduction was similar to that obtained for grain yield therefore it is indicated that planting method had similar effect on both grain yield and dm in general in furrow planting showed higher dm that is in accordance with the higher lai the higher lai and dm in in furrow planting might be due to higher soil water and temperature in furrows as reported by alborzi haghighi 2016 4 4 irrigation water productivity in scarce water conditions 0 65fi and in furrow planting resulted in higher grain and iwp therefore it is appropriate irrigation strategy with about 33 water reduction in the study region soil evaporation was subtracted from the et during the growing season to obtain transpiration the relationship between dm and transpiration was obtained by linear regression analysis as follows 25 dm 0 0312 tr r² 0 86 u 0 030 dr 0 80 where dm is the dry matter yield mg ha 1 and tr is the transpiration mm eq 25 indicates that transpiration productivity is 3 12 kg m 3 this relationship can be used in modeling wheat growth and production 4 5 wheat yield modeling the slope of the relationship between relative yield and relative et ky is used in field of irrigation water management the value of ky for grain yield was similar to that reported by doorenbos and kassam 1979 as 1 05 for non saline condition in fig 7 the slope is close to 1 0 and the intercept is close to 0 therefore the coefficient of root water uptake of homaee and feddes 1999 is more appropriate to be used in wheat yield modelling 5 conclusions in the first year grain yield was reduced by 20 and 26 in irrigation regimes of 0 65fi and 0 35fi respectively these reductions were 17 and 30 in the second year respectively the corresponding irrigation water reductions were 33 and 62 in both years in 0 65fi and 0 35fi respectively therefore it is indicated that the proportion of irrigation water reduction to the grain yield reduction is 2 1 in benefit of the deficit irrigation mostly due to the seasonal rainfall of 363 and 439 mm in the first and second year respectively results also indicated that in fi with 20 leaching fraction the salinity level of 5 0 ds m 1 produced no grain yield reduction furthermore salinity levels of 5 0 and 7 5 ds m 1 for irrigation regimes of 0 65fi and 0 35fi respectively did not show significant difference in grain yield compared with that obtained in 0 6 ds m 1 salinity level therefore by deficit irrigation higher salinity level is applicable due to lower salt accumulation in soil in furrow planting resulted in 4 statistically significant higher grain yield compared with that obtained in on ridge planting with 5 higher irrigation water productivity considering acceptable grain yield production in 0 65fi its irrigation water productivity 1 03 kg m 3 and 1 1 kg m 3 in the first and second year respectively was significantly higher than that obtained in fi 0 85 kg m 3 and 0 87 kg m 3 in the first and second year respectively in in furrow planting grain yield in a salinity level of 7 5 ds m 1 was suitable with irrigation regime of 0 65fi whereas in on ridge planting it is 5 0 ds m 1 therefore with non limited irrigation water conditions fi with salinity level of 5 0 ds m 1 and in furrow planting is the appropriate irrigation management for winter wheat however with limited water supply 0 65fi with salinity of 7 5 ds m 1 and in furrow planting would be appropriate in winter wheat irrigation management in the study region the root water uptake was predicted by using homaee feddes method with higher accuracy and its value was used in grain yield prediction with doorenbos kassam yield et function with higher accuracy acknowledgement this research supported in part by a research project
