1110,the spatio temporal distribution of geochemical fractions of phosphorus and its bio availability for asia s largest brackish water lake has been carried out one way anova analysis revealed that both iron bound phosphorus fe p p 0 05 n 360 and calcium bound phosphorus ca p p 0 05 n 360 showed a significant variation on a spatio temporal scale which may be attributed to ph and salinity of overlying water column pearson s correlation matrix revealed that sediment texture played a major role in the quantification of phosphorus species the relationship between ca p and ca was not established for the sediments of the lake chilika which suggested its authigenic origin the concentration of bio available phosphorus bap in different sectors of the lake varied in the order of northern sector 45 64 central sector 42 22 outer channel 36 63 southern sector 29 27 of total phosphorus tp this is supported by the fact that bioavailable p is comparatively higher in the freshwater zone than in the brackish water zone the principal component analysis pca revealed a good relationship between dissolved phosphate concentrations of water column with benthic population density it showed that tp availability in the sediment of the lake is mostly bounded with al fe and organic matter om positive association of total carbon tc total nitrogen tn and om with negatively loading of eh indicates towards the fact that deposition of tn and tc is largely governed by om availability in sediment keywords p fractionation sediment bio availability benthic population density brackish water lake 1 introduction phosphorus is a potentially limiting nutrient responsible for eutrophication in lake ecosystems conley et al 2009 coastal lake sediments act as significant sink of phosphorus due to their fairly high sedimentation rate and burial efficiency the said factors together play an important role in regulating the phosphorus concentration in the water column leote and epping 2015 the transformation deposition and recycling of phosphorus at the sediment water interface are mainly controlled by the reactivity of different forms of phosphorus and variety of physical geochemical and biological processes ruttenberg 1992 slomp et al 2013 phosphorus cycling and bioavailability in sediments of the coastal systems primarily depend on its speciation as non refractory phosphorus fraction may get regenerated from the degradation of organic matter as well as reduction of iron oxy hydroxides ruttenberg 1992 slomp et al 1996 many workers have observed that hypoxic and anoxic conditions facilitate the release of phosphorus from sediments to the water column ingall and jahnke 1997 mort et al 2010 it has been reported that lowering of redox potential eh increases the solubility of phosphorus ann et al 2000 anoxic sediment with low eh facilitates reduction of insoluble ferric oxy hydroxide compounds to soluble ferrous oxy hydroxide compounds increasing the sorption sites and thereby resulting in adsorption of a large amount of phosphorus however due to low bonding energy desorption potential is substantially high in contrast to aerobic sediments adsorption is relatively less but retention of phosphorus is more due to high bonding energy patrick and khalid 1974 it is also observed that in fe and ca dominated areas fe oxides mostly control the behaviour of inorganic phosphorus in aerobic conditions while ca phosphate mineral precipitation controls the solubility in anaerobic conditions moore and reddy 1994 as discussed the presence of metals such as fe al ca and mg present in sediment as well as in water column also influence the phosphorus retention capacity christophoridis and fytianos 2006 unlike terrestrial soils in wetland soils fe and al are typically found in amorphous forms having a relatively higher surface area for phosphorus sorption reactions to occur rhue and harris 1999 the phosphorus from water column may be absorbed to the particle surfaces co precipitated with iron and aluminium oxy hydroxides or ultimately transformed to authigenic mineral carbonate fluor apatite within the sediments jaisi and blake 2010 the phosphorus that remains associated with particulates may remain sequestered for a long time as a brackish water coastal lake with the substantial tidal exchange of saline water through sea mouth and freshwater input from the northern side through rivers and rivulets lake chilika gets the considerable input of phosphorus from both external and internal sources the change in ecological conditions of coastal waters such as lowering in salinity hike in organic matter and nutrients mitchell and furnas 1997 amplified algal blooms changes in bottom water condition such as hypoxia or anoxia cooper and brush 1991 welsh and eller 1991 and alteration in the phytoplankton community structure chang et al 1996 occur due to the increased input of riverine inflow and domestic sewage effluent runoff from the periphery trophic state classification of water bodies allows comparison between ecosystems within and among different ecological regions in addition to the development of an idea of the magnitude of cultural eutrophication suffered by a system dodds et al 2002 the same is also useful to evaluate the relationships among several components of the ecosystem carlson 1977 it is a shallow ecosystem where the sediment water interaction is significantly influenced by wind action and movement of fishing boats barik et al 2016 2017b mohanty et al 2017 a lot of work on spatio temporal

bap and its relation to benthic population density in order to understand the distribution transformation and bioavailability of phosphorus it is important to establish different forms of phosphorus extracted by using selective chemical extractants maintaining precise conditions the present study aims to find out the spatio temporal distribution of different forms of phosphorus establish its bioavailability and relation with benthic population density in chilika lake the largest brackish water lake of asia 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the asia s largest brackish water coastal lake chilika acknowledged as the first ramsar site in india located along the east coast of india 19 28 19 54 n latitude and 80 05 85 82 e longitude fifty two rivers and rivulets draw off into this lake fig 1 mahanadi river system i e daya bhargavi nuna and makara contribute fresh water from the northern side the important rivers such as mandakini kansari salia and other small streams from the hills located on the western side part of eastern ghats carry fresh water into the lake mostly during the monsoon period sarkar et al 2012 geologically chilika and its contiguous are classified into four geomorphic units viz fluvial denudational coastal and aeolian the fluvial landform is found with the deltaic plain on the northern side of the lake a moderate slope is marked from the alluvial plain towards the southwest denudational landforms are found nearby in the western and southern boundary of the lake which are denudational hills of eastern ghats parida et al 2017 these hills are composed of hard metamorphic precambrian rocks like gneisses quartzites and chalcocites the south eastern part of the lake consists of coastal plain in form of coastal sandbar and islands the position and width of the mouth will change due to wave action and longshore current in form of littoral drift the sand spit is morphologically divided into beach and sand dune belt the coastal sand dunes are discontinuous linear features parallel to the coast all along the north eastern part with width ranging between 1 0 and 1 8km sand dunes along with nalaban island which is positioned in the centre of the lake consists of aeolian landforms as a result of the climatic condition three principal seasons pre monsoon prm march june monsoon mon july october and post monsoon psm november february are predominant in this area 2 2 sampling and analysis the water sediment benthic fauna and macrophyte samples were collected from 15 locations distributed over four ecologically important sectors viz northern sector ns southern sector ss central sector cs and outer channel oc of chilika lake fig 1 during three different seasons i e pre monsoon post monsoon and monsoon for two consecutive years in each season sampling was done for three times in three successive months the water depth m of the lake varied from 0 84 to 3 39 with an average of 1 79 0 79 the ns was observed to be most shallow one barik et al 2017a panda et al 2006 the water quality parameters such as water depth salinity and ph were measured in situ using water quality checker toa dkk wqc24 japan soluble phosphate was measured by phosphomolybdate blue method grasshoff et al 1999 sediment samples were assembled from the top 10cm layer of the surface sediment from the lake by using van veen grab sampler kc denmark the redox potential of samples was measured in situ with orp metre hi 98201 hanna after through calibration with zobel solution samples were preserved at 4 c in sealed plastic bags prior to execution of additional analysis about 20g of sediment samples were washed with 30 h2o2 and 1n hcl in order to remove organic matter and carbonate respectively van andel and postma 1954 the samples were then washed in a 230 astm sieve mesh size 63μm repeatedly till all the silt and clay were removed the washings were collected in a 1l measuring cylinder which was further categorised as silt and clay mud in total by pipette analysis krumbein and pettijohn 1938 the material retained in the sieve was dried and weighed for a sand fraction tp in the sediment was determined by igniting the sediment at 550 10 c in a muffle furnace followed by shaking the sample with 1m h2so4 for 2h wildung and schmidt 1973 barik et al 2016 barik et al 2018 tc was estimated using mettler toledo toc analyser model thornton 5000toci while the organic matter om was calculated using walkley and black method total nitrogen tn was analysed with chns analyser perkin elmer 2400 series the dry bulk sediment samples were properly weighed for 0 25g and placed in teflon digestion vessels with the addition of acid mixture hno3 hcl and hf after microwave microwave v 4 20 6 anton paar digestion the filtrate was used for measuring the concentration of calcium ca and iron fe by icp aes icp 6500 pe and the usa the accuracy of methodology and instruments was determined with standard reference material srm 1646a estuarine sediment supplied by national institute of science and technology nist by analysing in parallel with metal determination and also reagent blanks kept for analysis in parallel with all samples and marked with recoveries ranging from 70 to115 for analysed elements ca 86 fe 80 the concentration of aluminium al for digested samples was analysed by energy dispersive x ray fluorescence spectrometry edxrf a portion of the sediment sample from different locations were placed in wide mouth bottles by adding rose bengal followed by 4 formalin solution heip et al 1985 and taken to the laboratory the samples were washed and sieved with 0 5mm mesh somerfield and warwick 1996 after sieving all the organisms were separated and counted for population density benthic population density at each sampling point all macrophytes including the roots growing within 3 replicates of 0 42 0 42m2 quadrants were collected samples were cleaned of epiphytes and sediments identified to species dried 70 c for 48h and weighed at the end of every day 2 2 1 sequential extraction the sequential extraction was carried out for phosphorus fractions with freeze dried and powdered sediment samples five different sedimentary phosphorus fractions were extracted the protocol was done according to frankowski et al 2002 and aydin et al 2009 the extractants being 1 0m nh4cl 1 0m nh4f 0 1m naoh and 1 0m h2so4 for loosely bound l p aluminium bound al p iron bound fe p and calcium bound ca p phosphorus respectively the extraction of iron and aluminium bound phosphorus fractions by the use of ammonium fluoride is ph dependent it has been reported by several authors uriyo and kesseba 1972 niskanen 1989 that ammonium fluoride at higher ph appeared to be the most selective extractant for a1 p with least impact on the elution of fe p time of contact during elution being another important factor the authors also inferred that longer elution time facilitates elution of some iron bound phosphorus therefore in the methodology nh4f was used at ph 8 82 and contact time is kept for only 1h for selective elution of only al p the phosphate content in all the fractions was estimated as mentioned above for water samples the total inorganic phosphorus tip was the sum of different inorganic fractions of phosphorus i e l p al p fe p and ca p organic phosphorus o p was calculated by taking the difference between tp and tip sanyal and de dutta 1991 the analytical grade reagents merck certipur and milli q millipore were used throughout the analytical procedures the phosphate stock standards 1000mg l solution of merck certipur were used for the preparation of working standards solution for avoiding possible analytical error the complete analytical procedure and instrument accuracy were validated after recovering 95 of the certified value by using certified reference material crm sediment crm 7001 from the czech metrology institute czech republic bio available phosphorus bap was calculated by considered l p and o p bramha et al 2014 barik et al 2016 2 3 data analysis the data on different phosphorus phases texture tc om tn tp al ca and fe in sediments and salinity ph and phosphate in water were processed by statistical analyses software statistica 8 by start soft for windows the water quality and sediment data set were examined by multivariate analysis through correlation and principal component analysis simeonova et al 2003 singh et al 2004 standardisation was done through z scale change so as to avoid misclassification due to wide variations in data dimensionality liu et al 2003 and to eliminate the influence of different units of measurement the r mode principal component analysis was executed on a correlation matrix of reorganised data for lake water and sediments the component loadings of the variables with eigenvalues were computed 3 results and discussion 3 1 water and sediment chemistry of lake a detailed spatio temporal trend in water quality parameters of the lake was observed the salinity level which represented the ionic strength was mostly controlled by ingress of sea water through the sea mouth and river discharge in the northern catchment with respect to season its variation remained in the order prm 20 4 9 0 psm 10 1 9 0 mon 6 1 5 9 in table 1a relatively higher salinity observed during prm could be due to low precipitation high evaporation and minimum freshwater dilution barik et al 2017a the ph values in different sectors were in order oc 8 5 0 7 ss 7 8 0 7 cs 7 2 1 0 ns 6 7 0 9 in table 1b the seasonal variation of ph remained in the order prm 8 2 0 9 psm 7 4 1 1 mon 6 8 0 6 in table 1a which is supported by the salinity trend in an average the water samples in prm and psm were mostly alkaline while on mon they were slightly acidic the soluble phosphate po4 concentration was observed to be in the order ns 1 3 0 8μmol l cs 0 9 0 4μmol l oc 0 7 0 4μmol l ss 0 6 0 4μmol l in table 1b the relatively higher value in the ns could be attributed to the fresh water input from the mahanadi catchment in addition in this sector wind action might be playing an important role in releasing phosphorus from the sediments due to lower depth i e shallow zone chandran and ramamoorthi 1984 the lower phosphate concentration in ss could be due to its uptake by phytoplankton sea grasses or macrophytes satpathy et al 2009 the seasonal variation remained in the order mon 1 3 0 7μmol l prm 0 9 0 3μmol l psm 0 4 0 1μmol l in table 1a the lake chilika experiences a large spatial variation in textural characteristics of the surface sediments among the sectors ns and oc were characterised by muddy and sandy types of sediment respectively as reported in table 1b in general 65 of the sediments occupied with particle size lesser than 63μm the organic matter om in an average was found to be 3 2 1 6 in prm 1 8 1 2 in mon and 2 6 2 1 in psm table 1a the one way anova revealed the significant sectoral variation of om p 0 05 n 360 the highest 3 7 2 1 and lowest 1 0 0 6 concentration were observed in cs and oc respectively table 1b it could be due to the higher sedimentation rate and shallow depth in cs and continuous tidal flux in oc gupta et al 2008 unnikrishnan et al 2009 the major elements contributed to the establishment of the observation were al fe and ca the sectoral variation of al was in the order oc cs ns ss table 1b the higher concentration in oc could be due to terrigenous input from the bay of bengal through the sea mouth the seasonal and sectorial variation of fe were presented in table 1a and table 1b the higher concentration in ns could be the reason for the release of iron in low salinity the sectoral variation of ca was in the order ns 2 5 1 3 cs 1 7 1 1 ss 1 6 1 5 oc 1 4 0 9 in table 1b the higher concentration in ns indicated towards the fact that the enrichment of ca in the sediments might not be of marine origin the seasonal variation of ca remained in the order prm 2 6 1 7 psm 1 5 1 0 mon 1 4 0 9 in table 1a it could be due to the precipitation of ca in saline water hiller et al 2013 the nutrients particularly nitrogen and carbon substantially influence sedimentary phosphorus fractions table 1b shows the sectoral variation of tn and remained in the order cs 0 18 0 13 ns 0 15 0 04 ss 0 09 0 02 oc 0 04 0 02 and table 1a shows the seasonal variation of tn was in the order psm 0 14 0 14 prm 0 12 0 05 mon 0 10 0 05 the highest availability of tn in cs could be attributed to the domestic runoff and digenetic processes zachmann et al 2009 the sectoral variation of tc was in the order cs 2 9 1 6 ns 2 6 1 1 ss 1 9 0 7 oc 1 2 0 6 in table 1b the dominance in cs could be attributed to long term deposition of decomposed macrophytes in this sector oc was highly influenced by tidal behaviour and in addition the inability of sandy sediment in the sector to accumulate the organic carbon might be responsible for the lowest value in this sector the seasonal variation of tc was in the order prm 2 8 0 9 psm 2 5 1 4 mon 1 4 0 9 in table 1a there was no significant observation in the seasonal variation of al table 1a the tp concentration remained highest in psm 956 1 385 3mg kg followed by prm 885 0 315 4mg kg and mon 788 4 295 6mg kg the ss and ns were having the lowest and highest concentration of tp among the sectors respectively table 1b it could be attributed to the precipitation of phosphorus from the water column due to the large variation of salinity among ss and ns in addition relatively large surface area of fine particles in muddy sediment hold maximum concentration of phosphorus table 2 shows the concentration of tp was found to increase significantly with vegetation while no significant difference was observed in sediment tp among vegetation types tp concentrations appears to be less affected by plant species because intensive reclamation has resulted in the short formation time and plant growth age in the study area shao et al 2013 the loadings of allochthonous and autochthonous sources in addition to sedimentary properties composition particle size distribution eh and ph are related to distribution and accumulation of p in sediment song et al 2007 zhou et al 2007 in this case the ns which is influenced by the major rivers daya bhargavi and luna and might have received anthropogenic input from terrestrial sources like agricultural activity aquaculture and urban waste the chilika lake sediments contributed relatively higher quantity of sedimentary tp compared to another lake ecosystem of india and the lake victoria which are coastal ecosystems table 3 the sector wise variation of eh was in the order oc 45 8 122 8 mv ss 130 4 56 2 mv ns 214 7 45 8 mv cs 221 7 50 5 mv in table 1b the eh variation for different seasons maintained in the order as mon 126 8 95 0 mv psm 157 0 94 8 mv prm 197 5 95 3 mv in table 1a the sediments of chilika lake were maintained in reducing condition over the seasons and sectors the outer channel sediments were characterised by relatively less reducing condition which could be due to the sandy textural characteristics the variability of benthic population density on spatio temporal scale largely depended on local climatic conditions lamptey and armah 2008 djihouessi et al 2018 physiochemical parameters carvalho et al 2005 and sediment logical parameters snelgrove and butman 1994 3 2 interactions of benthic and macrophyte diversity on phosphorus fractions the dissimilarity in allotment and diversity of macroinvertebrate communities were observed both next to spatial within sectors and temporal scales within seasons the lowest 150 20 5numbers m2 and highest 750 40 8numbers m2 value of benthic population density was found in oc and cs respectively fig 2 it could be due to the variation of organic matter content maintained in the same sequence for different sectors in the lake james et al 2002 table 1b the similar trend was also observed in lake takkobu kushiro wetland takamura et al 2009 the seasonal variation remained in the order prm mon psm fig 2 the whole lake dominated with the macro benthic invertebrate groups like gastropoda polychaete and amphipoda ansari et al 2015 influence of phosphorus species on the spatial distribution of vegetation area was studied the vegetation biomass and types of individual sectors were found to be highly influenced by phosphorus species the order in different sectors were ns 312gdry wt m2 ss 179gdry wt m2 cs 145gdry wt m2 c 119gdry wt m2 with respect to vegetation biomass table 3 the sector wise distribution of most dominant species availability was phargmatis karka in ns halopila ovalis in ss potamogeton and pectnatus in cs and halodule and halophila ovalis in oc table 3 salinity might be the factor responsible for this similarity in vegetation types in oc and ss 3 3 spatio temporal variation of phosphorus fractions loosely bound phosphorus l p refers to that fraction of phosphorus which is readily soluble in water and available for sustainable aquatic plants and animals its accessibility to overlying water column is through the release from pore water dissolution of caco3 and seepage from the decomposition of cells of bacterial biomass in deposited phyto detrital aggregates petterson 2001 kaiserli et al 2002 one way anova analysis revealed significant spatial variation p 0 05 n 360 of l p for sediments of the study area the order of availability of l p was ns 1 27 cs 0 95 ss 0 78 oc 0 52 of the total phosphorus in an average table 1b fig 3 relatively lower availability of l p in the higher saline area might be attributed to the competition between the substantial amount of dissolved anions cl so4 2 oh and br and phosphate for adsorption sites on sediments liu et al 2002 this observation is also supported by the negative correlation of l p with salinity and ph l p is positively correlated with mud finer particles and soluble phosphate in the water column while negatively correlated with sand coarser particles in table 4 supplementary material it could be due to the larger surface area of the finer particles providing higher adsorption area for phosphate wang et al 2006 and fresh water carrying more l p liu et al 2002 the seasonal variation was not significant p 0 05 n 360 the l p contribution to the tp in the study was less as compared to other ecosystems except the lake litimbo argentina 0 06 of tp the highest contribution 25 90 of tp was observed for lake kolleru which is a highly eutrophic lake in india table 3 the significant contribution 25 of tp was also observed for lake onondaga usa which could be due to the higher degree of oversaturation of l p penn et al 1995 al p is the most important fraction of phosphorus which originates from the detrital apatite of the metamorphic or igneous type of rock with other inorganic p pools the anova result showed significant variation among different seasons p 0 05 n 360 the absolute availability of al p in different seasons followed the order psm 72 7 42 9mg kg mon 72 1 33 1mg kg prm 46 1 22mg kg in table 1a and fig 3 it could be due to the relatively higher ph during prm period which expedites alteration of detrital inorganic p into authigenic forms the one way anova test employed for the horizontal distribution of different fractions of phosphorus concluded no such significant variation p 0 05 n 360 al p was strongly correlated with fe p fe o p tp and bap during the study period table 4 supplementary material it might be attributed to alkaline and oxic condition of sediment that favours al p to control the other fractions fe p o p and tp of the lake fytianos and kotzakioti 2005 the most redox sensitive algal available and potential mobile fraction is iron bound phosphorus fe p which is fe iii bound pool kaiserli et al 2002 the one way anova test showed significant seasonal variation for this pool p 0 05 n 360 the absolute values of fe bound phosphorus available in the lake sediments during the study period is mon 186 2 112 2mg kg psm 186 6 88 9mg kg prm 170 5 101 4mg kg in table 1a and fig 3 high microbial activity during prm and psm might be responsible for increasing the release tendency of phosphorus from this fraction maine et al 1992 perkins and underwood 2001 the significant variation was obtained for sectors p 0 05 n 360 the variation was in the order ns 240 9 84 9mg kg cs 190 1 103 6mg kg ss 147 2 85 5mg kg oc 134 5 98 9mg kg in table 1b and fig 3 it could be due to the much more variation of salinity and ph between the ns and oc which tends to release phosphorus from oxic sediment at low salinity favouring the mobilisation of p from the fe p as phosphate and get substituted by hydroxide in alkaline condition rippey 1977 the highest average concentration of fe p and al p were recorded in ns table 1b it is reported that al p and fe p concentrations in sediment are largely derived from pollution sources and partly proportional to the magnitude of pollution ruban et al 2001 the high fe p and al p concentrations in sediment of the ns further suggested anthropogenic impacts change in plant species composition might alter ecosystem structure e g vertical root profile and biogeochemical processes such as nutrient cycling and carbon allocation liao et al 2008 ehrenfeld 2010 sediment nutrient concentrations and p species consequently might change with different plant species zhao et al 2009 shao et al 2013 the significant positive relationship established among fe p fe mud tn tp om bap and o p while fe p was negatively correlated with sand and eh table 4 supplementary material it showed that muddy sediments were rich with both organic matter and minerals which propagated the role of fe for establishment of dynamic equilibrium between the sediment and water po4 3 levels and led to create fe dependent threshold limit for the sediment to bind phosphate søndergaard et al 2001 in the present study ca p emerged as the most dominant fraction among the inorganic fractions contributing almost 50 or more of the total inorganic phosphorus irrespective of seasons and 33 28 of tp this pool posed as the most dominant fraction after the op for the lake similar observations have also been reported for other coastal ecosystems paludan and morris 1999 andrieux loyer and aminot 2001 it could be due to the extremely stable nature of the ca p in alkaline ecosystems diaz et al 1994 in this pool p remained associated with calcium in solids of different types and origin that included basically two groups viz i detrital fluoroapatite of igneous and metamorphic origin ii biogenic skeletal debris and carbonate fluoroapatite precipitations ruttenberg 1992 the first group is stable in both oxidising and reducing conditions and considered as permanent burial jin et al 2006 which is non bioavailable while the second group has been revealed to represent a sink for reactive phosphorus ruttenberg 1992 the anova test performed to examine the significant variation of the ca p fraction on spatio temporal scale showed a significant level of variation for both different seasons and sectors p 0 05 n 360 the seasonal variation for absolute ca p remained in the order as prm 414 7 218 2mg kg psm 308 7 156 1mg kg mon 151 9 121 1mg kg in table 1a and fig 3 the higher concentration of ca p during prm and psm may be attributed to the relatively higher salinity which facilitates phosphate precipitation with caco3 gunnars et al 2004 anshumali and ramanathan 2007 hou et al 2009 in addition high ph i e the alkaline condition of the water column in prm and psm also favoured calcite precipitation leading to adsorption and co precipitation of phosphorus into the bottom sediments of the lake stumm and leckie 1971 wetzel 1975 the positive correlation among ca p tp salinity and ph supported the above observation table 4 supplementary material apart from this negative correlation with soluble phosphate also in accordance with the observation the lower concentration of ca p during mon could be due to declining ph level of water column breaking the bond in between caco3 and p hakanson and jansson 1983 in addition to this the grazing effect by zooplankton could be the cause for a drop of the concentration of ca p in the mon season penn et al 1995 the sectoral variation for absolute values of ca p followed the order as ss 382 0 286 9mg kg oc 376 2 91 4mg kg cs 238 8 160 5mg kg ns 191 1 122 3mg kg in table 1b the water salinity of ss and the adjacent area along with the oc is always high favouring formation of calcite through precipitation and biological activity acting as adsorption substrates for phosphate this might be the reason behind the possible dominance of ca p in ss and oc the relationship between ca p and ca was not established for the sediments of the lake table 4 supplementary material which suggested authigenic origin the similar type of observation was also reported by others jensen et al 1992 andrieux loyer and aminot 2001 also in mixed water ecosystems in general total phosphorus is obtained from marine sediments which is mainly ca p the accumulation here could be attributed to adsorption and precipitation rather than biological processes picard et al 2005 comparison with other lake ecosystems table 2 brings the remark that the lake chilika sediments are calcareous by characteristics penn et al 1995 the fraction of phosphorus associated with organic matter forms organically bound phosphorus o p it is formed due to the mineralisation of organic substance in precise environmental conditions of the aquatic ecosystems the one way anova test showed that it was not so significantly varied p 0 05 n 360 on both spatial and temporal scales the ns and ss contributed with highest and lowest concentration of o p respectively table 1b and fig 2 it could be due to the fact that in ns vegetated sediments are capable of absorbing p from water and enhance p storage as organic p species mainly humic acid associated p coelho et al 2004 the variation for seasons were psm 380 4 233 7mg kg mon 369 7 218 8mg kg prm 246 1 127 2mg kg in table 1a it might be attributed to a relatively high rate of mineralisation in the mon relative to psm and prm seasons the organic fraction of p in surface sediments appeared to be resistant to prevailing environmental conditions in psm and prm this indicates that the organic matter in chilika lake shows heterogeneity with respect to a sedimentary organic matter that is the result of variable sources aquatic and terrestrial organic matter and extent of degradation of macrophytes the positive correlation was established among the o p tp tn bap and fe table 4 supplementary material it could be due to the points towards the fact that o p accounted for variation of tp in general an increase in vegetation biomass can add a source of org p to sediments hou et al 2008 tong et al 2010 the o p is the most dominant fraction 37 88 of tp among other fractions of tp in the lake table 3 it could be due to the dominance of macrophytes and shallowness of the lake chilika where the lake victoria australia contributed 50 of tp in table 3 3 4 bioavailable phosphorus bap the phosphorus that can be desorbed from sediment to the pore water by natural phenomena like physical chemical and biological is termed as bioavailable phosphorus wang et al 2009 phosphorus fractionation study greatly helps in assessing the optimum limit of potentially bioavailable phosphorus in the aquatic ecosystem l p is readily available to water column whereas authigenic and detrital phosphorus is almost insoluble under the physico chemical conditions of coastal water lake apatite formation is a kinetically slow process and therefore apatites may not be considered as a major source of interstitial water enrichment andrieux and aminot 1997 bioavailability of fe p depends on the redox intensity of sediments in areas such as tidal flat which is subjected to a frequent change of redox potential facilitates intermittent reduction of fe bound p and its subsequent desorbed to the pelagic water column coelho et al 2004 microbial remineralisation may make o p bioavailable andrieux and aminot 1997 in the study area l p and o p have been considered to be the potentially bio available barik et al 2016 one way anova of the bap in surface sediments didn t show any significant seasonal variation p 0 05 n 360 however a significant variation was observed with respect to sectors p 0 05 n 360 the bap in surface sediments accounted for 28 7 of the tp in prm 48 in mon and 40 60 in psm table 1a the concentration of bap in different sectors of the lake varied in the order of ns 45 64 of tp cs 42 22 of tp oc 36 63 of tp ss 29 30 of tp in table 1b this was supported by the fact that bioavailable p is comparatively higher in the freshwater zone than in the brackish water zone hou et al 2009 further study is looked for to quantitatively explain the relationship between bap and benthic organisms combined with p cycling and pelagic ecosystem processes in the study area 3 5 principal component analysis pca among multivariate statistical analysis pca is one of the powerful statistical tools which reduces a large number of inter related variables to a systematic dimensionality of data set singh et al 2004 jianqin et al 2010 in addition it allows to assess the association between variables since they indicate participation of individual chemicals in several influence factors vega et al 1998 in this context pca was performed to understand interrelationship and the major factors highlighting each principal axis to draw a conclusion on the present scenario of the ecosystem in the present study different p fractions along with physiochemical parameters of sediment and water were processed for principal component analysis the factors with an eigen value 1 0 were only considered for interpretation the pca analysis described for the six principal axes accounting for 78 12 of the total variance table 5 supplementary material the pc1 axis accounts for 18 73 of the total variance and is positively correlated with al p o p fe p bap and tp it revelled that total phosphorus availability in the sediment of the lake remained mostly bounded with al fe and organic matter this factor may be considered as a natural factor the pc2 axis accounted for 15 63 of the total variance and was positively associated with tc tn om and negatively loaded with eh it showed that deposition of tn and tc was largely governed by organic matter availability in sediment the pc3 axis accounted for 14 64 of the total variance and was positively associated with l p mud and negatively loaded with sand this might be due to the fact that the l p remained mainly adsorbed to fine particles having the large surface area this axis might be considered as a granulometric factor reddy et al 1999 the pc4 axis accounted for 14 47 of the total variance and was positively associated with ca p ph and salinity and negatively loaded with fe it also showed that ca p was significantly correlated with ph and salinity in alkaline condition an increase of salinity facilitated co precipitation of p with caco3 huanxin et al 1994 solid calcium carbonates were also influenced by salinity and ph calcite was produced at high salinities through precipitation reactions and biological activity both in estuarine and marine environments forming an adsorption substrate for dissolved phosphate calcite transported upstream through tidal currents dissolves because of the lower ph releasing phosphate to the water column de jonge and villerius 1989 the pc5 axis accounted for 7 72 of the total variance and was positively associated with po4 3 and benthic population density the similar observations also reported by a number of researcher holdren and armstrong 1980 wisniewski and planter 1985 starkel 1985 the benthic fluxes of oxygen and dissolved nutrients were controlled by the macrofauna through their metabolism this fluxes of oxygen actively support the respiration of benthic invertebrate and releases phosphate as end product of the metabolism process which is excreted directly to the water column or into the burrow water and later flushed to the water column during burrow irrigation welsh 2003 the pc6 axis accounted for 6 93 of the total variance and is positively associated with ca al and fe it is qualifying the nature of common origin to the lake paludan and morris 1999 4 conclusions the northern sector ns is having the highest concentration of tp which may be attributed to the precipitation of phosphorus from water column with salinity gradient and in addition relatively large surface area of fine particles in muddy sediment to capture phosphorus the ca p dominated over all other fractions of the phosphorus amounting to about 50 of tp which could be due to the extremely stable nature of the ca p in alkaline ecosystems statistical analyses showed that tp availability in the sediment of the lake is mostly bounded with al fe and om the origin of ca p is authigenic l p remains mainly adsorbed to fine particles due to the large surface area it also revealed that deposition of tn and tc were largely governed by om availability in sediment organic matter in chilika lake shows heterogeneity with respect to a sedimentary organic matter that is the result of variable sources aquatic and terrestrial organic matter and extent of degradation of macrophytes the bap has a significant role in biota vegetation biomass and benthic population density for the lake chilika the concentration of bap is observed to be highest in the ns which is 45 64 of tp while the same is lowest in the southern sector ss with a value of 29 27 of tp it is a matter of general observation that bap is comparatively higher in the freshwater zone than in the brackish water zone further study is looked for quantitative relationship between bap and benthic organisms combined with p cycling and

1110,the spatio temporal distribution of geochemical fractions of phosphorus and its bio availability for asia s largest brackish water lake has been carried out one way anova analysis revealed that both iron bound phosphorus fe p p 0 05 n 360 and calcium bound phosphorus ca p p 0 05 n 360 showed a significant variation on a spatio temporal scale which may be attributed to ph and salinity of overlying water column pearson s correlation matrix revealed that sediment texture played a major role in the quantification of phosphorus species the relationship between ca p and ca was not established for the sediments of the lake chilika which suggested its authigenic origin the concentration of bio available phosphorus bap in different sectors of the lake varied in the order of northern sector 45 64 central sector 42 22 outer channel 36 63 southern sector 29 27 of total phosphorus tp this is supported by the fact that bioavailable p is comparatively higher in the freshwater zone than in the brackish water zone the principal component analysis pca revealed a good relationship between dissolved phosphate concentrations of water column with benthic population density it showed that tp availability in the sediment of the lake is mostly bounded with al fe and organic matter om positive association of total carbon tc total nitrogen tn and om with negatively loading of

water lake 1 introduction phosphorus is a potentially limiting nutrient responsible for eutrophication in lake ecosystems conley et al 2009 coastal lake sediments act as significant sink of phosphorus due to their fairly high sedimentation rate and burial efficiency the said factors together play an important role in regulating the phosphorus concentration in the water column leote and epping 2015 the transformation deposition and recycling of phosphorus at the sediment water interface are mainly controlled by the reactivity of different forms of phosphorus and variety of physical geochemical and biological processes ruttenberg 1992 slomp et al 2013 phosphorus cycling and bioavailability in sediments of the coastal systems primarily depend on its speciation as non refractory phosphorus fraction may get regenerated from the degradation of organic matter as well as reduction of iron oxy hydroxides ruttenberg 1992 slomp et al 1996 many workers have observed that hypoxic and anoxic conditions facilitate the release of phosphorus from sediments to the water column ingall and jahnke 1997 mort et al 2010 it has been reported that lowering of redox potential eh increases the solubility of phosphorus ann et al 2000 anoxic sediment with low eh facilitates reduction of insoluble ferric oxy hydroxide compounds to soluble ferrous oxy hydroxide compounds increasing the sorption sites and thereby resulting in adsorption of a large amount of phosphorus however due to low bonding energy desorption potential is substantially high in contrast to aerobic sediments adsorption is relatively less but retention of phosphorus is more due to high bonding energy patrick and khalid 1974 it is also observed that in fe and ca dominated areas fe oxides mostly control the behaviour of inorganic phosphorus in aerobic conditions while ca phosphate mineral precipitation controls the solubility in anaerobic conditions moore and reddy 1994 as discussed the presence of metals such as fe al ca and mg present in sediment as well as in water column also influence the phosphorus retention capacity christophoridis and fytianos 2006 unlike terrestrial soils in wetland soils fe and al are typically found in amorphous forms having a relatively higher surface area for phosphorus sorption reactions to occur rhue and harris 1999 the phosphorus from water column may be absorbed to the particle surfaces co precipitated with iron and aluminium oxy hydroxides or ultimately transformed to authigenic mineral carbonate fluor apatite within the sediments jaisi and blake 2010 the phosphorus that remains associated with particulates may remain sequestered for a long time as a brackish water coastal lake with the substantial tidal exchange of saline water through sea mouth and freshwater input from the northern side through rivers and rivulets lake chilika gets the considerable input of phosphorus from both external and internal sources the change in ecological conditions of coastal waters such as lowering in salinity hike in organic matter and nutrients mitchell and furnas 1997 amplified algal blooms changes in bottom water condition such as hypoxia or anoxia cooper and brush 1991 welsh and eller 1991 and alteration in the phytoplankton community structure chang et al 1996 occur due to the increased input of riverine inflow and domestic sewage effluent runoff from the periphery trophic state classification of water bodies allows comparison between ecosystems within and among different ecological regions in addition to the development of an idea of the magnitude of cultural eutrophication suffered by a system dodds et al 2002 the same is also useful to evaluate the relationships among several components of the ecosystem carlson 1977 it is a shallow ecosystem where the sediment water interaction is significantly influenced by wind action and movement of fishing boats barik et al 2016 2017b mohanty et al 2017 a lot of work on spatio temporal

bap and its relation to benthic population density in order to understand the distribution transformation and bioavailability of phosphorus it is important to establish different forms of phosphorus extracted by using selective chemical extractants maintaining precise conditions the present study aims to find out the spatio temporal distribution of different forms of phosphorus establish its bioavailability and relation with benthic population density in chilika lake the largest brackish water lake of asia 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the asia s largest brackish water coastal lake chilika acknowledged as the first ramsar site in india located along the east coast of india 19 28 19 54 n latitude and 80 05 85 82 e longitude fifty two rivers and rivulets draw off into this lake fig 1 mahanadi river system i e daya bhargavi nuna and makara contribute fresh water from the northern side the important rivers such as mandakini kansari salia and other small streams from the hills located on the western side part of eastern ghats carry fresh water into the lake mostly during the monsoon period sarkar et al 2012 geologically chilika and its contiguous are classified into four geomorphic units viz fluvial denudational coastal and aeolian the fluvial landform is found with the deltaic plain on the northern side of the lake a moderate slope is marked from the alluvial plain towards the southwest denudational landforms are found nearby in the western and southern boundary of the lake which are denudational hills of eastern ghats parida et al 2017 these hills are composed of hard metamorphic precambrian rocks like gneisses quartzites and chalcocites the south eastern part of the lake consists of coastal plain in form of coastal sandbar and islands the position and width of the mouth will change due to wave action and longshore current in form of littoral drift the sand spit is morphologically divided into beach and sand dune belt the coastal sand dunes are discontinuous linear features parallel to the coast all along the north eastern part with width ranging between 1 0 and 1 8km sand dunes along with nalaban island which is positioned in the centre of the lake consists of aeolian landforms as a result of the climatic condition three principal seasons pre monsoon prm march june monsoon mon july october and post monsoon psm november february are predominant in this area 2 2 sampling and analysis the water sediment benthic fauna and macrophyte samples were collected from 15 locations distributed over four ecologically important sectors viz northern sector ns southern sector ss central sector cs and outer channel oc of chilika lake fig 1 during three different seasons i e pre monsoon post monsoon and monsoon for two consecutive years in each season sampling was done for three times in three successive months the water depth m of the lake varied from 0 84 to 3 39 with an average of 1 79 0 79 the ns was observed to be most shallow one barik et al 2017a panda et al 2006 the water quality parameters such as water depth salinity and ph were measured in situ using water quality checker toa dkk wqc24 japan soluble phosphate was measured by phosphomolybdate blue method grasshoff et al 1999 sediment samples were assembled from the top 10cm layer of the surface sediment from the lake by using van veen grab sampler kc denmark the redox potential of samples was measured in situ with orp metre hi 98201 hanna after through calibration with zobel solution samples were preserved at 4 c in sealed plastic bags prior to execution of additional analysis about 20g of sediment samples were washed with 30 h2o2 and 1n hcl in order to remove organic matter and carbonate respectively van andel and postma 1954 the samples were then washed in a 230 astm sieve mesh size 63μm repeatedly till all the silt and clay were removed the washings were collected in a 1l measuring cylinder which was further categorised as silt and clay mud in total by pipette analysis krumbein and pettijohn 1938 the material retained in the sieve was dried and weighed for a sand fraction tp in the sediment was determined by igniting the sediment at 550 10 c in a muffle furnace followed by shaking the sample with 1m h2so4 for 2h wildung and schmidt 1973 barik et al 2016 barik et al 2018 tc was estimated using mettler toledo toc analyser model thornton 5000toci while the organic matter om was calculated using walkley and black method total nitrogen tn was analysed with chns analyser perkin elmer 2400 series the dry bulk sediment samples were properly weighed for 0 25g and placed in teflon digestion vessels with the addition of acid mixture hno3 hcl and hf after microwave microwave v 4 20 6 anton paar digestion the filtrate was used for measuring the concentration of calcium ca and iron fe by icp aes icp 6500 pe and the usa the accuracy of methodology and instruments was determined with standard reference material srm 1646a estuarine sediment supplied by national institute of science and technology nist by analysing in parallel with metal determination and also reagent blanks kept for analysis in parallel with all samples and marked with recoveries ranging from 70 to115 for analysed elements ca 86 fe 80 the concentration of aluminium al for digested samples was analysed by energy dispersive x ray fluorescence spectrometry edxrf a portion of the sediment sample from different locations were placed in wide mouth bottles by adding rose bengal followed by 4 formalin solution heip et al 1985 and taken to the laboratory the samples were washed and sieved with 0 5mm mesh somerfield and warwick 1996 after sieving all the organisms were separated and counted for population density benthic population density at each sampling point all macrophytes including the roots growing within 3 replicates of 0 42 0 42m2 quadrants were collected samples were cleaned of epiphytes and sediments identified to species dried 70 c for 48h and weighed at the end of every day 2 2 1 sequential extraction the sequential extraction was carried out for phosphorus fractions with freeze dried and powdered sediment samples five different sedimentary phosphorus fractions were extracted the protocol was done according to frankowski et al 2002 and aydin et al 2009 the extractants being 1 0m nh4cl 1 0m nh4f 0 1m naoh and 1 0m h2so4 for loosely bound l p aluminium bound al p iron bound fe p and calcium bound ca p phosphorus respectively the extraction of iron and aluminium bound phosphorus fractions by the use of ammonium fluoride is ph dependent it has been reported by several authors uriyo and kesseba 1972 niskanen 1989 that ammonium fluoride at higher ph appeared to be the most selective extractant for a1 p with least impact on the elution of fe p time of contact during elution being another important factor the authors also inferred that longer elution time facilitates elution of some iron bound phosphorus therefore in the methodology nh4f was used at ph 8 82 and contact time is kept for only 1h for selective elution of only al p the phosphate content in all the fractions was estimated as mentioned above for water samples the total inorganic phosphorus tip was the sum of different inorganic fractions of phosphorus i e l p al p fe p and ca p organic phosphorus o p was calculated by taking the difference between tp and tip sanyal and de dutta 1991 the analytical grade reagents merck certipur and milli q millipore were used throughout the analytical procedures the phosphate stock standards 1000mg l solution of merck certipur were used for the preparation of working standards solution for avoiding possible analytical error the complete analytical procedure and instrument accuracy were validated after recovering 95 of the certified value by using certified reference material crm sediment crm 7001 from the czech metrology institute czech republic bio available phosphorus bap was calculated by considered l p and o p bramha et al 2014 barik et al 2016 2 3 data analysis the data on different phosphorus phases texture tc om tn tp al ca and fe in sediments and salinity ph and phosphate in water were processed by statistical analyses software statistica 8 by start soft for windows the water quality and sediment data set were examined by multivariate analysis through correlation and principal component analysis simeonova et al 2003 singh et al 2004 standardisation was done through z scale change so as to avoid misclassification due to wide variations in data dimensionality liu et al 2003 and to eliminate the influence of different units of measurement the r mode principal component analysis was executed on a correlation matrix of reorganised data for lake water and sediments the component loadings of the variables with eigenvalues were computed 3 results and discussion 3 1 water and sediment chemistry of lake a detailed spatio temporal trend in water quality parameters of the lake was observed the salinity level which represented the ionic strength was mostly controlled by ingress of sea water through the sea mouth and river discharge in the northern catchment with respect to season its variation remained in the order prm 20 4 9 0 psm 10 1 9 0 mon 6 1 5 9 in table 1a relatively higher salinity observed during prm could be due to low precipitation high evaporation and minimum freshwater dilution barik et al 2017a the ph values in different sectors were in order oc 8 5 0 7 ss 7 8 0 7 cs 7 2 1 0 ns 6 7 0 9 in table 1b the seasonal variation of ph remained in the order prm 8 2 0 9 psm 7 4 1 1 mon 6 8 0 6 in table 1a which is supported by the salinity trend in an average the water samples in prm and psm were mostly alkaline while on mon they were slightly acidic the soluble phosphate po4 concentration was observed to be in the order ns 1 3 0 8μmol l cs 0 9 0 4μmol l oc 0 7 0 4μmol l ss 0 6 0 4μmol l in table 1b the relatively higher value in the ns could be attributed to the fresh water input from the mahanadi catchment in addition in this sector wind action might be playing an important role in releasing phosphorus from the sediments due to lower depth i e shallow zone chandran and ramamoorthi 1984 the lower phosphate concentration in ss could be due to its uptake by phytoplankton sea grasses or macrophytes satpathy et al 2009 the seasonal variation remained in the order mon 1 3 0 7μmol l prm 0 9 0 3μmol l psm 0 4 0 1μmol l in table 1a the lake chilika experiences a large spatial variation in textural characteristics of the surface sediments among the sectors ns and oc were characterised by muddy and sandy types of sediment respectively as reported in table 1b in general 65 of the sediments occupied with particle size lesser than 63μm the organic matter om in an average was found to be 3 2 1 6 in prm 1 8 1 2 in mon and 2 6 2 1 in psm table 1a the one way anova revealed the significant sectoral variation of om p 0 05 n 360 the highest 3 7 2 1 and lowest 1 0 0 6 concentration were observed in cs and oc respectively table 1b it could be due to the higher sedimentation rate and shallow depth in cs and continuous tidal flux in oc gupta et al 2008 unnikrishnan et al 2009 the major elements contributed to the establishment of the observation were al fe and ca the sectoral variation of al was in the order oc cs ns ss table 1b the higher concentration in oc could be due to terrigenous input from the bay of bengal through the sea mouth the seasonal and sectorial variation of fe were presented in table 1a and table 1b the higher concentration in ns could be the reason for the release of iron in low salinity the sectoral variation of ca was in the order ns 2 5 1 3 cs 1 7 1 1 ss 1 6 1 5 oc 1 4 0 9 in table 1b the higher concentration in ns indicated towards the fact that the enrichment of ca in the sediments might not be of marine origin the seasonal variation of ca remained in the order prm 2 6 1 7 psm 1 5 1 0 mon 1 4 0 9 in table 1a it could be due to the precipitation of ca in saline water hiller et al 2013 the nutrients particularly nitrogen and carbon substantially influence sedimentary phosphorus fractions table 1b shows the sectoral variation of tn and remained in the order cs 0 18 0 13 ns 0 15 0 04 ss 0 09 0 02 oc 0 04 0 02 and table 1a shows the seasonal variation of tn was in the order psm 0 14 0 14 prm 0 12 0 05 mon 0 10 0 05 the highest availability of tn in cs could be attributed to the domestic runoff and digenetic processes zachmann et al 2009 the sectoral variation of tc was in the order cs 2 9 1 6 ns 2 6 1 1 ss 1 9 0 7 oc 1 2 0 6 in table 1b the dominance in cs could be attributed to long term deposition of decomposed macrophytes in this sector oc was highly influenced by tidal behaviour and in addition the inability of sandy sediment in the sector to accumulate the organic carbon might be responsible for the lowest value in this sector the seasonal variation of tc was in the order prm 2 8 0 9 psm 2 5 1 4 mon 1 4 0 9 in table 1a there was no significant observation in the seasonal variation of al table 1a the tp concentration remained highest in psm 956 1 385 3mg kg followed by prm 885 0 315 4mg kg and mon 788 4 295 6mg kg the ss and ns were having the lowest and highest concentration of tp among the sectors respectively table 1b it could be attributed to the precipitation of phosphorus from the water column due to the large variation of salinity among ss and ns in addition relatively large surface area of fine particles in muddy sediment hold maximum concentration of phosphorus table 2 shows the concentration of tp was found to increase significantly with vegetation while no significant difference was observed in sediment tp among vegetation types tp concentrations appears to be less affected by plant species because intensive reclamation has resulted in the short formation time and plant growth age in the study area shao et al 2013 the loadings of allochthonous and autochthonous sources in addition to sedimentary properties composition particle size distribution eh and ph are related to distribution and accumulation of p in sediment song et al 2007 zhou et al 2007 in this case the ns which is influenced by the major rivers daya bhargavi and luna and might have received anthropogenic input from terrestrial sources like agricultural activity aquaculture and urban waste the chilika lake sediments contributed relatively higher quantity of sedimentary tp compared to another lake ecosystem of india and the lake victoria which are coastal ecosystems table 3 the sector wise variation of eh was in the order oc 45 8 122 8 mv ss 130 4 56 2 mv ns 214 7 45 8 mv cs 221 7 50 5 mv in table 1b the eh variation for different seasons maintained in the order as mon 126 8 95 0 mv psm 157 0 94 8 mv prm 197 5 95 3 mv in table 1a the sediments of chilika lake were maintained in reducing condition over the seasons and sectors the outer channel sediments were characterised by relatively less reducing condition which could be due to the sandy textural characteristics the variability of benthic population density on spatio temporal scale largely depended on local climatic conditions lamptey and armah 2008 djihouessi et al 2018 physiochemical parameters carvalho et al 2005 and sediment logical parameters snelgrove and butman 1994 3 2 interactions of benthic and macrophyte diversity on phosphorus fractions the dissimilarity in allotment and diversity of macroinvertebrate communities were observed both next to spatial within sectors and temporal scales within seasons the lowest 150 20 5numbers m2 and highest 750 40 8numbers m2 value of benthic population density was found in oc and cs respectively fig 2 it could be due to the variation of organic matter content maintained in the same sequence for different sectors in the lake james et al 2002 table 1b the similar trend was also observed in lake takkobu kushiro wetland takamura et al 2009 the seasonal variation remained in the order prm mon psm fig 2 the whole lake dominated with the macro benthic invertebrate groups like gastropoda polychaete and amphipoda ansari et al 2015 influence of phosphorus species on the spatial distribution of vegetation area was studied the vegetation biomass and types of individual sectors were found to be highly influenced by phosphorus species the order in different sectors were ns 312gdry wt m2 ss 179gdry wt m2 cs 145gdry wt m2 c 119gdry wt m2 with respect to vegetation biomass table 3 the sector wise distribution of most dominant species availability was phargmatis karka in ns halopila ovalis in ss potamogeton and pectnatus in cs and halodule and halophila ovalis in oc table 3 salinity might be the factor responsible for this similarity in vegetation types in oc and ss 3 3 spatio temporal variation of phosphorus fractions loosely bound phosphorus l p refers to that fraction of phosphorus which is readily soluble in water and available for sustainable aquatic plants and animals its accessibility to overlying water column is through the release from pore water dissolution of caco3 and seepage from the decomposition of cells of bacterial biomass in deposited phyto detrital aggregates petterson 2001 kaiserli et al 2002 one way anova analysis revealed significant spatial variation p 0 05 n 360 of l p for sediments of the study area the order of availability of l p was ns 1 27 cs 0 95 ss 0 78 oc 0 52 of the total phosphorus in an average table 1b fig 3 relatively lower availability of l p in the higher saline area might be attributed to the competition between the substantial amount of dissolved anions cl so4 2 oh and br and phosphate for adsorption sites on sediments liu et al 2002 this observation is also supported by the negative correlation of l p with salinity and ph l p is positively correlated with mud finer particles and soluble phosphate in the water column while negatively correlated with sand coarser particles in table 4 supplementary material it could be due to the larger surface area of the finer particles providing higher adsorption area for phosphate wang et al 2006 and fresh water carrying more l p liu et al 2002 the seasonal variation was not significant p 0 05 n 360 the l p contribution to the tp in the study was less as compared to other ecosystems except the lake litimbo argentina 0 06 of tp the highest contribution 25 90 of tp was observed for lake kolleru which is a highly eutrophic lake in india table 3 the significant contribution 25 of tp was also observed for lake onondaga usa which could be due to the higher degree of oversaturation of l p penn et al 1995 al p is the most important fraction of phosphorus which originates from the detrital apatite of the metamorphic or igneous type of rock with other inorganic p pools the anova result showed significant variation among different seasons p 0 05 n 360 the absolute availability of al p in different seasons followed the order psm 72 7 42 9mg kg mon 72 1 33 1mg kg prm 46 1 22mg kg in table 1a and fig 3 it could be due to the relatively higher ph during prm period which expedites alteration of detrital inorganic p into authigenic forms the one way anova test employed for the horizontal distribution of different fractions of phosphorus concluded no such significant variation p 0 05 n 360 al p was strongly correlated with fe p fe o p tp and bap during the study period table 4 supplementary material it might be attributed to alkaline and oxic condition of sediment that favours al p to control the other fractions fe p o p and tp of the lake fytianos and kotzakioti 2005 the most redox sensitive algal available and potential mobile fraction is iron bound phosphorus fe p which is fe iii bound pool kaiserli et al 2002 the one way anova test showed significant seasonal variation for this pool p 0 05 n 360 the absolute values of fe bound phosphorus available in the lake sediments during the study period is mon 186 2 112 2mg kg psm 186 6 88 9mg kg prm 170 5 101 4mg kg in table 1a and fig 3 high microbial activity during prm and psm might be responsible for increasing the release tendency of phosphorus from this fraction maine et al 1992 perkins and underwood 2001 the significant variation was obtained for sectors p 0 05 n 360 the variation was in the order ns 240 9 84 9mg kg cs 190 1 103 6mg kg ss 147 2 85 5mg kg oc 134 5 98 9mg kg in table 1b and fig 3 it could be due to the much more variation of salinity and ph between the ns and oc which tends to release phosphorus from oxic sediment at low salinity favouring the mobilisation of p from the fe p as phosphate and get substituted by hydroxide in alkaline condition rippey 1977 the highest average concentration of fe p and al p were recorded in ns table 1b it is reported that al p and fe p concentrations in sediment are largely derived from pollution sources and partly proportional to the magnitude of pollution ruban et al 2001 the high fe p and al p concentrations in sediment of the ns further suggested anthropogenic impacts change in plant species composition might alter ecosystem structure e g vertical root profile and biogeochemical processes such as nutrient cycling and carbon allocation liao et al 2008 ehrenfeld 2010 sediment nutrient concentrations and p species consequently might change with different plant species zhao et al 2009 shao et al 2013 the significant positive relationship established among fe p fe mud tn tp om bap and o p while fe p was negatively correlated with sand and eh table 4 supplementary material it showed that muddy sediments were rich with both organic matter and minerals which propagated the role of fe for establishment of dynamic equilibrium between the sediment and water po4 3 levels and led to create fe dependent threshold limit for the sediment to bind phosphate søndergaard et al 2001 in the present study ca p emerged as the most dominant fraction among the inorganic fractions contributing almost 50 or more of the total inorganic phosphorus irrespective of seasons and 33 28 of tp this pool posed as the most dominant fraction after the op for the lake similar observations have also been reported for other coastal ecosystems paludan and morris 1999 andrieux loyer and aminot 2001 it could be due to the extremely stable nature of the ca p in alkaline ecosystems diaz et al 1994 in this pool p remained associated with calcium in solids of different types and origin that included basically two groups viz i detrital fluoroapatite of igneous and metamorphic origin ii biogenic skeletal debris and carbonate fluoroapatite precipitations ruttenberg 1992 the first group is stable in both oxidising and reducing conditions and considered as permanent burial jin et al 2006 which is non bioavailable while the second group has been revealed to represent a sink for reactive phosphorus ruttenberg 1992 the anova test performed to examine the significant variation of the ca p fraction on spatio temporal scale showed a significant level of variation for both different seasons and sectors p 0 05 n 360 the seasonal variation for absolute ca p remained in the order as prm 414 7 218 2mg kg psm 308 7 156 1mg kg mon 151 9 121 1mg kg in table 1a and fig 3 the higher concentration of ca p during prm and psm may be attributed to the relatively higher salinity which facilitates phosphate precipitation with caco3 gunnars et al 2004 anshumali and ramanathan 2007 hou et al 2009 in addition high ph i e the alkaline condition of the water column in prm and psm also favoured calcite precipitation leading to adsorption and co precipitation of phosphorus into the bottom sediments of the lake stumm and leckie 1971 wetzel 1975 the positive correlation among ca p tp salinity and ph supported the above observation table 4 supplementary material apart from this negative correlation with soluble phosphate also in accordance with the observation the lower concentration of ca p during mon could be due to declining ph level of water column breaking the bond in between caco3 and p hakanson and jansson 1983 in addition to this the grazing effect by zooplankton could be the cause for a drop of the concentration of ca p in the mon season penn et al 1995 the sectoral variation for absolute values of ca p followed the order as ss 382 0 286 9mg kg oc 376 2 91 4mg kg cs 238 8 160 5mg kg ns 191 1 122 3mg kg in table 1b the water salinity of ss and the adjacent area along with the oc is always high favouring formation of calcite through precipitation and biological activity acting as adsorption substrates for phosphate this might be the reason behind the possible dominance of ca p in ss and oc the relationship between ca p and ca was not established for the sediments of the lake table 4 supplementary material which suggested authigenic origin the similar type of observation was also reported by others jensen et al 1992 andrieux loyer and aminot 2001 also in mixed water ecosystems in general total phosphorus is obtained from marine sediments which is mainly ca p the accumulation here could be attributed to adsorption and precipitation rather than biological processes picard et al 2005 comparison with other lake ecosystems table 2 brings the remark that the lake chilika sediments are calcareous by characteristics penn et al 1995 the fraction of phosphorus associated with organic matter forms organically bound phosphorus o p it is formed due to the mineralisation of organic substance in precise environmental conditions of the aquatic ecosystems the one way anova test showed that it was not so significantly varied p 0 05 n 360 on both spatial and temporal scales the ns and ss contributed with highest and lowest concentration of o p respectively table 1b and fig 2 it could be due to the fact that in ns vegetated sediments are capable of absorbing p from water and enhance p storage as organic p species mainly humic acid associated p coelho et al 2004 the variation for seasons were psm 380 4 233 7mg kg mon 369 7 218 8mg kg prm 246 1 127 2mg kg in table 1a it might be attributed to a relatively high rate of mineralisation in the mon relative to psm and prm seasons the organic fraction of p in surface sediments appeared to be resistant to prevailing environmental conditions in psm and prm this indicates that the organic matter in chilika lake shows heterogeneity with respect to a sedimentary organic matter that is the result of variable sources aquatic and terrestrial organic matter and extent of degradation of macrophytes the positive correlation was established among the o p tp tn bap and fe table 4 supplementary material it could be due to the points towards the fact that o p accounted for variation of tp in general an increase in vegetation biomass can add a source of org p to sediments hou et al 2008 tong et al 2010 the o p is the most dominant fraction 37 88 of tp among other fractions of tp in the lake table 3 it could be due to the dominance of macrophytes and shallowness of the lake chilika where the lake victoria australia contributed 50 of tp in table 3 3 4 bioavailable phosphorus bap the phosphorus that can be desorbed from sediment to the pore water by natural phenomena like physical chemical and biological is termed as bioavailable phosphorus wang et al 2009 phosphorus fractionation study greatly helps in assessing the optimum limit of potentially bioavailable phosphorus in the aquatic ecosystem l p is readily available to water column whereas authigenic and detrital phosphorus is almost insoluble under the physico chemical conditions of coastal water lake apatite formation is a kinetically slow process and therefore apatites may not be considered as a major source of interstitial water enrichment andrieux and aminot 1997 bioavailability of fe p depends on the redox intensity of sediments in areas such as tidal flat which is subjected to a frequent change of redox potential facilitates intermittent reduction of fe bound p and its subsequent desorbed to the pelagic water column coelho et al 2004 microbial remineralisation may make o p bioavailable andrieux and aminot 1997 in the study area l p and o p have been considered to be the potentially bio available barik et al 2016 one way anova of the bap in surface sediments didn t show any significant seasonal variation p 0 05 n 360 however a significant variation was observed with respect to sectors p 0 05 n 360 the bap in surface sediments accounted for 28 7 of the tp in prm 48 in mon and 40 60 in psm table 1a the concentration of bap in different sectors of the lake varied in the order of ns 45 64 of tp cs 42 22 of tp oc 36 63 of tp ss 29 30 of tp in table 1b this was supported by the fact that bioavailable p is comparatively higher in the freshwater zone than in the brackish water zone hou et al 2009 further study is looked for to quantitatively explain the relationship between bap and benthic organisms combined with p cycling and pelagic ecosystem processes in the study area 3 5 principal component analysis pca among multivariate statistical analysis pca is one of the powerful statistical tools which reduces a large number of inter related variables to a systematic dimensionality of data set singh et al 2004 jianqin et al 2010 in addition it allows to assess the association between variables since they indicate participation of individual chemicals in several influence factors vega et al 1998 in this context pca was performed to understand interrelationship and the major factors highlighting each principal axis to draw a conclusion on the present scenario of the ecosystem in the present study different p fractions along with physiochemical parameters of sediment and water were processed for principal component analysis the factors with an eigen value 1 0 were only considered for interpretation the pca analysis described for the six principal axes accounting for 78 12 of the total variance table 5 supplementary material the pc1 axis accounts for 18 73 of the total variance and is positively correlated with al p o p fe p bap and tp it revelled that total phosphorus availability in the sediment of the lake remained mostly bounded with al fe and organic matter this factor may be considered as a natural factor the pc2 axis accounted for 15 63 of the total variance and was positively associated with tc tn om and negatively loaded with eh it showed that deposition of tn and tc was largely governed by organic matter availability in sediment the pc3 axis accounted for 14 64 of the total variance and was positively associated with l p mud and negatively loaded with sand this might be due to the fact that the l p remained mainly adsorbed to fine particles having the large surface area this axis might be considered as a granulometric factor reddy et al 1999 the pc4 axis accounted for 14 47 of the total variance and was positively associated with ca p ph and salinity and negatively loaded with fe it also showed that ca p was significantly correlated with ph and salinity in alkaline condition an increase of salinity facilitated co precipitation of p with caco3 huanxin et al 1994 solid calcium carbonates were also influenced by salinity and ph calcite was produced at high salinities through precipitation reactions and biological activity both in estuarine and marine environments forming an adsorption substrate for dissolved phosphate calcite transported upstream through tidal currents dissolves because of the lower ph releasing phosphate to the water column de jonge and villerius 1989 the pc5 axis accounted for 7 72 of the total variance and was positively associated with po4 3 and benthic population density the similar observations also reported by a number of researcher holdren and armstrong 1980 wisniewski and planter 1985 starkel 1985 the benthic fluxes of oxygen and dissolved nutrients were controlled by the macrofauna through their metabolism this fluxes of oxygen actively support the respiration of benthic invertebrate and releases phosphate as end product of the metabolism process which is excreted directly to the water column or into the burrow water and later flushed to the water column during burrow irrigation welsh 2003 the pc6 axis accounted for 6 93 of the total variance and is positively associated with ca al and fe it is qualifying the nature of common origin to the lake paludan and morris 1999 4 conclusions the northern sector ns is having the highest concentration of tp which may be attributed to the precipitation of phosphorus from water column with salinity gradient and in addition relatively large surface area of fine particles in muddy sediment to capture phosphorus the ca p dominated over all other fractions of the phosphorus amounting to about 50 of tp which could be due to the extremely stable nature of the ca p in alkaline ecosystems statistical analyses showed that tp availability in the sediment of the lake is mostly bounded with al fe and om the origin of ca p is authigenic l p remains mainly adsorbed to fine particles due to the large surface area it also revealed that deposition of tn and tc were largely governed by om availability in sediment organic matter in chilika lake shows heterogeneity with respect to a sedimentary organic matter that is the result of variable sources aquatic and terrestrial organic matter and extent of degradation of macrophytes the bap has a significant role in biota vegetation biomass and benthic population density for the lake chilika the concentration of bap is observed to be highest in the ns which is 45 64 of tp while the same is lowest in the southern sector ss with a value of 29 27 of tp it is a matter of general observation that bap is comparatively higher in the freshwater zone than in the brackish water zone further study is looked for quantitative relationship between bap and benthic organisms combined with p cycling and

1111,searching for and identification of water bodies wbs constitute an integral part of many ecological studies because field observations or sophisticated and costly remote sensing techniques rsts cannot always be used simple methods using freely available data are proposed the reliability of these techniques in identifying wbs has not yet been experimentally verified however this study compares the reliability within various landscape types of five methods tools in searching for wbs google earth landsat 7 sentinel 2 open street map osm digital water management database dibavod and merged layer dosm osm dibavod the determined numbers and areas of wbs were compared with values determined by field observation control the reliability of all methods improved with increasing wb area none of the methods was sufficiently accurate to identify wbs smaller than 500m2 images from the landsat 7 and sentinel 2 satellites were demonstrated to be entirely unusable due to low resolution within various landscape types reliability of the methods was comparable when working with various techniques it is necessary to be aware of the limitations of each to increase reliability we

1 introduction freshwater water bodies wbs i e bodies of water forming a physiographical feature stevenson 2010 have important functions in a landscape such as to provide water resources microclimate maintenance landscape connectivity and ecosystem services e g amoros and bornette 2002 biggs et al 2017 among other things they provide crucial habitats for many taxa such as aquatic plants invertebrates amphibians and birds e g degtyarev 2007 ramirez et al 2012 tebbs et al 2013 on the other hand freshwaters suffer greater biodiversity decline than do terrestrial habitats sala et al 2000 mainly because of habitat degradation water pollution overexploitation species invasion and flow modification reviewed in dudgeon et al 2006 therefore the number of works devoted to the importance of wbs has increased in recent decades e g prausová et al 2015 rybak 2013 sokol et al 2015 sun et al 2018 vad et al 2017 regardless of the focus of these studies they often include a description of wb characteristics such as area slope of shores vegetation coverage and chemical and physical properties of water the first necessary step however is to identify these habitats in the field this need not be a major problem in the case of large wbs but the identification of small wbs e g tiny pools water saturated ditches ruts in unpaved roadways etc is far more problematic in the field and in mapping pekel et al 2016 quite small wbs with areas on the order of a few or tens of square metres are essential to promote the diversity of many groups of organisms reviewed in biggs et al 2017 hassall 2014 wbs can be identified on the basis of field observations e g olivier et al 2016 schmidt et al 2016 waters and burridge 2016 wauters et al 2016 examining available maps using remote sensing rs data e g chen et al 2018 gómez rodríguez et al 2008 verpoorter et al 2014 xiong et al 2018 yang et al 2017 or various combinations of these data the advantage of direct field wb identification is the higher probability of finding even tiny wbs on the other hand it is possible to explore only relatively small areas in such detail these methods are therefore used for studies on a local scale e g olivier et al 2016 wauters et al 2016 rs on the other hand allow the processing of much larger areas up to even a global scale because rs collects data of different types multispectral and hyperspectral satellite and aerial images orthophoto images lidar data etc their accuracy depends on the types of data and the technology used due to the different operating principles of individual methods varying reliability can be expected in identifying wbs another important factor influencing reliability could be the type of environment within which wbs are being identified there are at least two reasons for this first the spectral symptoms of aquatic habitats are highly variable this can be caused by variable chemistry of water the littoral vegetation water blooms and in shallow waters by the colouring of the bottom secondly the reliability of methods could be negatively affected by the surroundings especially shading by surrounding vegetation terrain or clouds pekel et al 2016 it therefore appears that the interaction between environment and methods could have a significant effect on a given method s reliability this is essentially analogous to the imperfect detection in the case of monitoring of organisms where different species are detected with different probability according to the ecology of these species the methodology used the character of the site the size of the population etc bailey et al 2004 pellet and schmidt 2005 petitot et al 2014 none of the available works experimentally assesses the reliability of individual rs techniques and data analysis methods by comparing their results with direct field observations this study is the first of its kind and addresses unresolved issues regarding the reliability in searching for wbs using rs data that is available at no charge and is easy to use although some studies on rs using free data already have been published these studies most commonly use purchased data and sophisticated processing methods that a standard ecology biology worker does not control e g guo et al 2016 slave et al 2013 thanapongtharm et al 2013 the aims of our study therefore were to i compare the reliability of evaluated methods based on the number of wbs identified and overall water surface calculated in a model area ii ascertain whether the reliability of methods differs in various landscapes with different vegetation cover because vegetation can negatively affect wb identification by rs pekel et al 2016 and iii find the smallest wb size detectable by particular evaluated methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and field methods the study was conducted in seven particular areas within the czech republic representing different types of landscapes mountains agricultural forests steppes ponds succession dumps and reclaimed dumps resulting from brown coal surface mining the selected landscape types lts are described in detail in table 1 the locations of the lts are shown in fig 1 six study areas were located in northern bohemia and one pond landscape in the chrudim district fig 1 northern bohemia was chosen mainly because of the high lt diversity in this region in addition high quality field data describing properties of the environment are available from previous field surveys for this area doležalová et al 2012 this means the actual distribution of wbs there is known chrudim district was included because there is no pond landscape in northern bohemia another objective was to compare the landscape of northern bohemia with an extensively managed landscape of higher biological value a square grid with 1km 1km square size was laid over each the northern bohemia and chrudim district area squares within this grid that contained town residential areas or were not completely filled by a given type of landscape were excluded from further consideration ten squares were then selected for each lt using a random number generator albeit with two exceptions in pond landscape chrudim district 20 squares were explored this is an area twice as large in comparison to the other lts so the number of squares reflects about twice as much area within this landscape thus the relative abundances of squares were similar across all lts in agricultural landscape 10 squares were explored but for one square there was available only one orthophoto image in which the landscape is covered with snow it also was necessary to reduce the area of squares on the succession dumps type the individual parts of succession dumps are too small to fill squares of full size to compare the reliability of wb detection by individual methods we carried out ground reconnaissance in each of the 79 monitored squares within the model area during spring 2013 in order to identify there all wbs wb monitoring always was done systematically across the square by a pair of experienced workers each wb was put into the control layer as a point designated by gps coordinates the reasons for using the point format are discussed the area of each wb in m2 was also recorded the areas of small wbs up to ca 1000m2 were measured directly in situ by tape measure the areas of larger wbs were measured by vectorizing orthophoto images the numbers of wbs obtained in the field were later used as a control for the comparison with numbers of wbs identified by the tested methods the numbers of wbs in particular lts varied between 19 and 432 in total we identified 822 wbs table 2 in an overall area of 1959624m2 table 3 2 2 evaluated methods as stated in the introduction only methods that do not require a specially qualified rs worker and for which data are available at no cost were selected for the comparison human based visual analysis hereinafter google earth manual searches were performed on orthophoto images in the visible part of the spectrum provided through google earth images were analyzed square by square by a single worker unexperienced in rs and who did not participate in the field survey because one of our aims was to simulate the work of a research team without an rs professional furthermore it was intended to simulate a situation wherein the worker does not know the study area in advance the worker marked by a polygon anything that he evaluated to be a wb this method had been used by e g szostak et al 2014 supervised maximum likelihood classification of satellite images this process was carried out in an environment of arcgis and envi for multispectral satellite images from landsat 7 with a resolution of 30m usgs 2017 and simultaneously for multispectral satellite images from sentinel 2 with a resolution of 10m esa 2018 landsat 7 images used were from 2013 in which year the field survey had been conducted sentinel 2 images used were from 2014 when the mission of this satellite began it was originally intended to use sentinel 1 images from 2013 but the images from the time of the field survey are covered by clouds that s why we used the year s younger images of the same season because the wbs are associated with two regions relatively remote from one another analysis of the images had to be performed for each area separately landsat 7 images were available in a form usable for analysis and with atmospheric corrections already having been made in the case of sentinel 2 images atmospheric corrections had to be made for the analysis of all images a synthesis of the second third and fourth channels i e the green red and near infrared zone was used the supervised maximum likelihood classification method was followed kantakumar and neelamsetti 2015 sarmiento et al 2016 this method uses so called training sites that precisely define the parameters of the searched type of land cover the last option was to use freely available vector data specifically these were data sets from open street map hereinafter osm and digital water management database digitální báze vodohospodářských dat dibavod osm is a freely available set of global geographic data provided under open database license in shapefile format geofabrik gmbh 2018 the origins of these data are not always the same rather this is a fusion of data from terrain mapping satellite imaging aerial imaging prototype global shoreline data and integrated geographic encoding and referencing data updates are made not on a consistent basis but according to the availability of current data blog open street map 2017 dibavod too is a freely available data set in shapefile format but it is created for the area of the czech republic only by t g masaryk water research institute wri a public research institution dibavod was created in 2008 on the basis of a basic map of the czech republic at a scale of 1 10000 for hydrological purposes wri 2017 a database created on a national basis should theoretically provide more reliable data than does its global counterparts because the smaller national scope allows for easier data collection and validation there is no need to analyze or edit osm and dibavod data because they already show the distribution of water bodies for comparison purposes a layer was created by merging osm and dibavod hereinafter dosm we have also considered the use of the glowabo database but it contains only wbs larger than 2000m2 wwf 2018 what makes it useless for the purposes of this study 2 3 data analysis data from all methods were validated in arcgis prior to statistical analysis a 25m buffer was created around every point in the control layer this size was chosen because it corresponds approximately to the accuracy of the gnss device used in closed canopy vegetation if a wb specified by the method intersected the buffer it was marked as a true positive tp if not it was marked as a false positive fp distinguishing between tps and fps is important because mere comparisons of wb numbers as determined by the method and during a field survey can be misleading fps artificially overestimate the determined number of wbs for this reason it is necessary to monitor the numbers of tps and fps separately to ensure that numbers of tps and fps are comparable among the methods lts and size categories two types of errors were calculated on their basis i error rate er the proportion of unidentified wbs in comparison to the control er was determined based on the following formula n c number of wb according to the control n tp number of tps 1 er n c n tp n c it is therefore the inverse of the true positive rate monitored in another studies e g sarmiento et al 2016 k yang et al 2015 ii due to the character of the data used it was not possible to track the false positive rate or other parameters commonly monitored using a performance matrix as a replacement the probability of falsely positive wb identification p fp was monitored the p fp value was determined as follows n fp number of fp n t total number of wb identifiable by the method 2 p fp n fp n t it was not necessary further to evaluate these two values statistically possible effects of detection method lt wb size and their two way interactions explanatory variables on reliability of wb identification were analyzed the reliability was expressed as the number frequency and total area of correctly identified wbs per square to account for pseudoreplication caused by use of multiple detection methods on the same mapping squares linear mixed effects models lmm with squares set as a random effect were used detection method was a categorical explanatory variable with the six detection techniques i e levels described above google earth landsat 7 open street map dibavod dosm and field survey as a control lt was further used as a categorical explanatory variable based on the prevailing lt in a given square mountain agricultural forest steppe pond succession dump and reclaimed dump wbs were divided into five categories levels according to their size 200m2 200 500m2 500 2000m2 2000 5000m2 5000m2 because the categories were chosen to be approximately on a logarithmic scale the mean area of wbs was log transformed in order to linearize this relationship the number of tps was also log transformed to satisfy the assumptions of the chosen statistical model the p values were produced using type ii wald chi square tests all statistical analyses were performed in r 3 3 1 team 2015 with the help of packages lme4 bates et al 2015 and car fox and weisberg 2011 3 results 3 1 reliability in counting detected water bodies the numbers of tps differed among the methods table 4 the smallest er was for google earth about 72 5 see table 5 for the majority of other tested methods ers were in the range of about 82 85 of wbs the er for landsat 7 and sentinel 2 however were more than 97 of wbs these methods were evaluated in the model area as being overall unreliable and therefore they were excluded from further analyses the frequency of identified wbs differed significantly also according to their size across all lts and methods and among lts i e there were different numbers of wbs in the various landscapes these two main variables are relevant for the purpose of this study however only in interactions with the method variable 3 1 1 interaction between method and size of water body in general er and p fp of all methods decreased with growing wb size there were evident differences among the methods however see table 6 in terms of er and p fp google earth was the most reliable method in almost all size categories 3 1 2 interaction between method and landscape type the effect of this interaction on tp was not significant the lowest er was recorded by google earth on almost all lts there were two exceptions to this for pond and mountain landscapes but differences in er between methods were minimal on these lts at the same time this method had the lowest p fp table 7 there were three exceptions in this case agricultural landscape succession dumps and reclaimed dumps it can be said generally that using of tested methods is inappropriate on mountain agricultural forest and steppe landscapes where all of them had high er values 78 3 2 reliability in determining total area of water bodies the proportion of wb area actually discovered in the studied squares was affected by all main explanatory factors table 8 from the effect of the wb size variable it can be concluded that the total found wbs area differed according to the wb size category the effect of the method means there are differences in the accuracy of determining the total wbs area in a landscape fig 2 shows that google earth was closest to the control but the differences among google earth osm and dosm were not large the effect of the interaction wb size landscape type proves that the total wbs area differs among the categories for at least some of the lts 3 2 1 total area of water bodies by category and landscape type as can be seen in fig 3 the total wbs area on mountain agricultural forest and steppe landscapes is minimal the graph was created from data obtained in six randomly selected squares for each type of landscape the reason was the comparability of the obtained values wbs are rather substantially represented only on agricultural and steppe landscapes in the size category 5000m2 significant wb representation in a landscape has been identified on pond reclaimed dump and succession dump landscapes the sum of the wb areas on these three lts increases together with their size categories 4 discussion 4 1 discussion of methods an ideal methodological solution of this study would be to verify the identification of each of the individual wbs this is not possible however due to the point format of the reference data during the field survey 822 wbs were identified within an area of almost 70km2 and it was beyond our capabilities to locate all of them in a polygon format using the precise gnss device in addition many wbs are located in very dense vegetation and that reduces measurement accuracy and substantially complicates transport of the large gnss device therefore less precise but more compact tourist gnss devices and a point data format were used this of course also influences the choice of method for statistical processing of the data despite these complications the acquired data were successfully validated the selected validation method nevertheless demonstrated errors in certain cases i in a situation where a wb polygon encroached into several squares it was automatically divided into a corresponding number of smaller polygons usually only one polygon could be marked as tp this artificially increased the number of fps subsequent merging of polygons was impossible because it was not possible to determine to which square the resulting polygon should be assigned ii in places with high wbs density there occurred intersections of several polygons with a buffer of just a single point this increased the number of tps iii in certain cases one wb was designated by the method as several smaller wbs this increased the number of fps the occurrences of all the stated cases were in single digits however and thus could not fundamentally influence the results of the analyses data validation made it possible to monitor the methods error rates in several directions er showed how many wbs the method could not identify correctly in comparison to the control in the case of a possible study it can therefore be estimated how much higher is the number of wbs actually existing in the area of interest as compared to the data determined by the particular method used using p fp it can be determined how large a part of wbs identified by a given method were identified erroneously in a potential study one may just subtract the anticipated incorrectly identified wbs p fp from the determined number of wbs and estimate the real number of wbs n a using the following formula 3 n a n t n t p fp er the analysis utilized the numbers of wbs and total wb area determined in a landscape the numbers of wbs after analysis thus provide information as to a method s reliability in identifying wbs the information on total determined wb area within a landscape in comparison with the control indicates the given method s accuracy also in this respect this can be useful in for example estimating the total amount of water in a landscape this analysis was further complicated by the point format of the control data it cannot be determined using point data whether a wb crosses the boundary of the model area and the size of the overlapping part wb polygons determined using the methods tested were on the other hand limited by the borders of squares total wb areas determined by the tested methods were thus underestimated and therefore only data about wbs which lay entirely within the model area was included into the analyses on the steppe agriculture and reclaimed dump lts there occurred a problem in the analyses due to small numbers of wbs this caused substantial fluctuations in the results and so these had to be interpreted with care an ideal situation would be if the same set of wbs would be repeated in all lts but this is impossible in practice due to the nature of these lts a possible solution would be to increase the size of the model area for problematic lts 4 2 discussion of results 4 2 1 number of water bodies it is evident that none of the tested methods were reliable in identifying wbs smaller than 500m2 er 50 if some future study is to deal better with such small wbs it needs to account for two things in the preparation phases first it would need to allocate funds to acquire and pay for high quality high resolution data such as images from the worldview 4 satellite having resolution of 1px 1 24m satellite imaging corporation 2017 another variant would be to acquire custom made images taken from an aeroplane or a drone the importance of fine scale data was also confirmed by šímová et al 2018 second it is necessary to have a team member who is an rs professional at high resolution a wb image only several px in size is strongly affected by the vegetation around and inside the wb and by other factors which complicate wb detection but do not make it impossible pekel et al 2016 there is a possibility of identifying aquatic vegetation and subsequent indirect wb identification but this assumes accurate in situ measurement of spectral symptoms of vegetation in situ collected data could be than used as training data for supervised classification we do not recommend using of water indexes in this situation because they demonstrate different type of information song et al 2014 all this shows that an amateur is unable to compensate for these influences during data analysis the er of all methods tested decreased with wb area as attested also in another study blaschke 2010 in choosing an rs technique one needs also to consider the lts in the area of interest because there are lts for which any rs technique is difficult to use in this study mountain agricultural forest and steppe landscapes demonstrated this in mountains and forests this can be explained by high representation of the associated vegetation this complicates wb detection pekel et al 2016 possibilities of identifying wb in satellite images had been examined e g by acharya et al 2016 mishra and prasad 2015 xiong et al 2018 l yang et al 2015 but in their cases they used advanced data processing techniques that only an rs professional can manage properly for the present study a not too sophisticated technique of supervised maximum likelihood classification was used when using this method images from landsat 7 and sentinel 2 can be regarded as entirely unsuitable for the tested purposes this is due to their low image resolution 1px 30m resp 1px 10m although it is theoretically possible to identify wbs with areas as small as 900m2 in landsat 7 images and 100m2 in sentinel 2 images blaschke 2010 in actual practice the minimum discernible area will probably be larger a clear solution would be to use higher resolution images on the other hand higher resolution does not have to mean more tps this was also reflected in this study when several small wbs identified by landsat 7 were identified by sentinel 2 as one large wb an overview of suitable satellites and the resolutions of their sensors is provided by nath and deb 2010 the possibility of using google earth orthophoto images for identifying wbs was tested sarmiento et al 2016 their study used data in the bitmaps format which was further processed using supervised classification for the purposes of this study only data from google earth software which does not allow machine analysis of images was available therefore a less accurate but also less knowledge demanding human based visual analysis was selected time demandingness is the disadvantage of this method for instance searching for wbs in the model area required approximately 5h from the er perspective google earth seems partially reliable for a pond landscape but vector layers would be more suitable for a potential study in this lt vector layers demonstrated lower er and are much easier to work with on the other hand google earth manifests the lowest p fp in pond landscape google earth is a good choice for succession dumps where it demonstrates the lowest er by a large margin on the other hand this method generates more fps than do the other methods the advisability of using this method on reclaimed dumps is thus debatable although this method recorded the lowest er there with a safe margin it also created many fps because there are many areas in this lt that seem like wbs from a bird s eye view osm has two crucial advantages the maps are easy to work with and are available with global coverage their disadvantage is that they are community created data like wikipedia without wide scale and regular updates blog open street map 2017 this was demonstrated also in this study as there was a relatively large number of fps in the osm data the use of this method can only be recommended for the pond landscape where it had the lowest er of all the methods at the same time however a high number of fps must be expected working with dibavod is as easy as with osm but the disadvantage is that it has coverage only within the czech republic wri 2017 in comparison with osm this method generally has higher er but fewer fps occurred when it was used the choice between these two methods therefore depends primarily on the character of the given study in the sense of which error type is more important in the given case of all the vector methods dosm achieved the lowest er in general dosm results are closer to those of osm than to those of dibavod it can be judged from this that the contribution of dibavod during merger of the two layers is not large in certain cases such as on succession dumps this merger nevertheless demonstrated a lower p fp this could have occurred in a situation when some method could not identify the entire wb area and it was therefore evaluated as an fp after a merger of layers the wb area was completed and then evaluated as a tp 4 2 2 total area of water bodies none of the tested methods can be recommended for determining the total wbs area in a landscape all tested methods correctly determined less than half of the total wbs area found during the field survey fig 2 the reasons for this inaccuracy can be found in the rs themselves even the wbs identification itself is difficult in cases of dense vegetation cover pekel et al 2016 let alone the exact determination of their total area large differences in total wb area among lts can be noted the small total area of wb on the agricultural landscape and steppes stems from the natural character of these lts in the case of mountains and forests and as was confirmed earlier see table 7 this is due to the difficulty of detecting wbs on these lts the direct proportionality between total wb area within a size category and wb size corresponds to the data obtained during the field survey where the same is shown see table 3 this result is nevertheless only supplemental and it is irrelevant to the main goals of the study 5 conclusions it can be said that none of the tested methods succeeded in producing wholly reliable results either in identifying wbs or determining their sizes it can be recommended that for further research a larger model area and additional lts should be used greatly advantageous too would be to use polygon format of the control layer with its more precise orientation the entire analysis would thereby be simplified made more precise and enabled to obtain new

reliability can be expected in identifying wbs another important factor influencing reliability could be the type of environment within which wbs are being identified there are at least two reasons for this first the spectral symptoms of aquatic habitats are highly variable this can be caused by variable chemistry of water the littoral vegetation water blooms and in shallow waters by the colouring of the bottom secondly the reliability of methods could be negatively affected by the surroundings especially shading by surrounding vegetation terrain or clouds pekel et al 2016 it

validation there is no need to analyze or edit osm and dibavod data because they already show the distribution of water bodies for comparison purposes a layer was created by merging osm and dibavod hereinafter dosm we have also considered the use of the glowabo database but it contains only wbs larger than 2000m2 wwf 2018 what makes it useless for the purposes of this study 2 3 data analysis data from all methods were validated in arcgis prior to statistical analysis a 25m buffer was created around every point in the control layer this size was chosen because it corresponds approximately to the accuracy of the gnss device used in closed canopy vegetation if a wb specified by the method intersected the buffer it was marked as a true positive tp if not it was marked as a false positive fp distinguishing between tps and fps is important because mere comparisons of wb numbers as determined by the method and during a field survey can be misleading fps artificially overestimate the determined number of wbs for this reason it is necessary to monitor the numbers of tps and fps separately to ensure that numbers of tps and fps are comparable among the methods lts and size categories two types of errors were calculated on their basis i error rate er the proportion of unidentified wbs in comparison to the control er was determined based on the following formula n c number of wb according to the control n tp number of tps 1 er n c n tp n c it is therefore the inverse of the true positive rate monitored in another studies e g sarmiento et al 2016 k yang et al 2015 ii due to the character of the data used it was not possible to track the false positive rate or other parameters commonly monitored using a performance matrix as a replacement the probability of falsely positive wb identification p fp was monitored the p fp value was determined as follows n fp number of fp n t total number of wb identifiable by the method 2 p fp n fp n t it was not necessary further to evaluate these two values statistically possible effects of detection method lt wb size and their two way interactions explanatory variables on reliability of wb identification were analyzed the reliability was expressed as the number frequency and total area of correctly identified wbs per square to account for pseudoreplication caused by use of multiple detection methods on the same mapping squares linear mixed effects models lmm with squares set as a random effect were used detection method was a categorical explanatory variable with the six detection techniques i e levels described above google earth landsat 7 open street map dibavod dosm and field survey as a control lt was further used as a categorical explanatory variable based on the prevailing lt in a given square mountain agricultural forest steppe pond succession dump and reclaimed dump wbs were divided into five categories levels according to their size 200m2 200 500m2 500 2000m2 2000 5000m2 5000m2 because the categories were chosen to be approximately on a logarithmic scale the mean area of wbs was log transformed in order to linearize this relationship the number of tps was also log transformed to satisfy the assumptions of the chosen statistical model the p values were produced using type ii wald chi square tests all statistical analyses were performed in r 3 3 1 team 2015 with the help of packages lme4 bates et al 2015 and car fox and weisberg 2011 3 results 3 1 reliability in counting detected water bodies the numbers of tps differed among the methods table 4 the smallest er was for google earth about 72 5 see table 5 for the majority of other tested methods ers were in the range of about 82 85 of wbs the er for landsat 7 and sentinel 2 however were more than 97 of wbs these methods were evaluated in the model area as being overall unreliable and therefore they were excluded from further analyses the frequency of identified wbs differed significantly also according to their size across all lts and methods and among lts i e there were different numbers of wbs in the various landscapes these two main variables are relevant for the purpose of this study however only in interactions with the method variable 3 1 1 interaction between method and size of water body in general er and p fp of all methods decreased with growing wb size there were evident differences among the methods however see table 6 in terms of er and p fp google earth was the most reliable method in almost all size categories 3 1 2 interaction between method and landscape type the effect of this interaction on tp was not significant the lowest er was recorded by google earth on almost all lts there were two exceptions to this for pond and mountain landscapes but differences in er between methods were minimal on these lts at the same time this method had the lowest p fp table 7 there were three exceptions in this case agricultural landscape succession dumps and reclaimed dumps it can be said generally that using of tested methods is inappropriate on mountain agricultural forest and steppe landscapes where all of them had high er values 78 3 2 reliability in determining total area of water bodies the proportion of wb area actually discovered in the studied squares was affected by all main explanatory factors table 8 from the effect of the wb size variable it can be concluded that the total found wbs area differed according to the wb size category the effect of the method means there are differences in the accuracy of determining the total wbs area in a landscape fig 2 shows that google earth was closest to the control but the differences among google earth osm and dosm were not large the effect of the interaction wb size landscape type proves that the total wbs area differs among the categories for at least some of the lts 3 2 1 total area of water bodies by category and landscape type as can be seen in fig 3 the total wbs area on mountain agricultural forest and steppe landscapes is minimal the graph was created from data obtained in six randomly selected squares for each type of landscape the reason was the comparability of the obtained values wbs are rather substantially represented only on agricultural and steppe landscapes in the size category 5000m2 significant wb representation in a landscape has been identified on pond reclaimed dump and succession dump landscapes the sum of the wb areas on these three lts increases together with their size categories 4 discussion 4 1 discussion of methods an ideal methodological solution of this study would be to verify the identification of each of the individual wbs this is not possible however due to the point format of the reference data during the field survey 822 wbs were identified within an area of almost 70km2 and it was beyond our capabilities to locate all of them in a polygon format using the precise gnss device in addition many wbs are located in very dense vegetation and that reduces measurement accuracy and substantially complicates transport of the large gnss device therefore less precise but more compact tourist gnss devices and a point data format were used this of course also influences the choice of method for statistical processing of the data despite these complications the acquired data were successfully validated the selected validation method nevertheless demonstrated errors in certain cases i in a situation where a wb polygon encroached into several squares it was automatically divided into a corresponding number of smaller polygons usually only one polygon could be marked as tp this artificially increased the number of fps subsequent merging of polygons was impossible because it was not possible to determine to which square the resulting polygon should be assigned ii in places with high wbs density there occurred intersections of several polygons with a buffer of just a single point this increased the number of tps iii in certain cases one wb was designated by the method as several smaller wbs this increased the number of fps the occurrences of all the stated cases were in single digits however and thus could not fundamentally influence the results of the analyses data validation made it possible to monitor the methods error rates in several directions er showed how many wbs the method could not identify correctly in comparison to the control in the case of a possible study it can therefore be estimated how much higher is the number of wbs actually existing in the area of interest as compared to the data determined by the particular method used using p fp it can be determined how large a part of wbs identified by a given method were identified erroneously in a potential study one may just subtract the anticipated incorrectly identified wbs p fp from the determined number of wbs and estimate the real number of wbs n a using the following formula 3 n a n t n t p fp er the analysis utilized the numbers of wbs and total wb area determined in a landscape the numbers of wbs after analysis thus provide information as to a method s reliability in identifying wbs the information on total determined wb area within a landscape in comparison with the control indicates the given method s accuracy also in this respect this can be useful in for example estimating the total amount of water in a landscape this analysis was further complicated by the point format of the control data it cannot be determined using point data whether a wb crosses the boundary of the model area and the size of the overlapping part wb polygons determined using the methods tested were on the other hand limited by the borders of squares total wb areas determined by the tested methods were thus underestimated and therefore only data about wbs which lay entirely within the model area was included into the analyses on the steppe agriculture and reclaimed dump lts there occurred a problem in the analyses due to small numbers of wbs this caused substantial fluctuations in the results and so these had to be interpreted with care an ideal situation would be if the same set of wbs would be repeated in all lts but this is impossible in practice due to the nature of these lts a possible solution would be to increase the size of the model area for problematic lts 4 2 discussion of results 4 2 1 number of water bodies it is evident that none of the tested methods were reliable in identifying wbs smaller than 500m2 er 50 if some future study is to deal better with such small wbs it needs to account for two things in the preparation phases first it would need to allocate funds to acquire and pay for high quality high resolution data such as images from the worldview 4 satellite having resolution of 1px 1 24m satellite imaging corporation 2017 another variant would be to acquire custom made images taken from an aeroplane or a drone the importance of fine scale data was also confirmed by šímová et al 2018 second it is necessary to have a team member who is an rs professional at high resolution a wb image only several px in size is strongly affected by the vegetation around and inside the wb and by other factors which complicate wb detection but do not make it impossible pekel et al 2016 there is a possibility of identifying aquatic vegetation and subsequent indirect wb identification but this assumes accurate in situ measurement of spectral symptoms of vegetation in situ collected data could be than used as training data for supervised classification we do not recommend using of water indexes in this situation because they demonstrate different type of information song et al 2014 all this shows that an amateur is unable to compensate for these influences during data analysis the er of all methods tested decreased with wb area as attested also in another study blaschke 2010 in choosing an rs technique one needs also to consider the lts in the area of interest because there are lts for which any rs technique is difficult to use in this study mountain agricultural forest and steppe landscapes demonstrated this in mountains and forests this can be explained by high representation of the associated vegetation this complicates wb detection pekel et al 2016 possibilities of identifying wb in satellite images had been examined e g by acharya et al 2016 mishra and prasad 2015 xiong et al 2018 l yang et al 2015 but in their cases they used advanced data processing techniques that only an rs professional can manage properly for the present study a not too sophisticated technique of supervised maximum likelihood classification was used when using this method images from landsat 7 and sentinel 2 can be regarded as entirely unsuitable for the tested purposes this is due to their low image resolution 1px 30m resp 1px 10m although it is theoretically possible to identify wbs with areas as small as 900m2 in landsat 7 images and 100m2 in sentinel 2 images blaschke 2010 in actual practice the minimum discernible area will probably be larger a clear solution would be to use higher resolution images on the other hand higher resolution does not have to mean more tps this was also reflected in this study when several small wbs identified by landsat 7 were identified by sentinel 2 as one large wb an overview of suitable satellites and the resolutions of their sensors is provided by nath and deb 2010 the possibility of using google earth orthophoto images for identifying wbs was tested sarmiento et al 2016 their study used data in the bitmaps format which was further processed using supervised classification for the purposes of this study only data from google earth software which does not allow machine analysis of images was available therefore a less accurate but also less knowledge demanding human based visual analysis was selected time demandingness is the disadvantage of this method for instance searching for wbs in the model area required approximately 5h from the er perspective google earth seems partially reliable for a pond landscape but vector layers would be more suitable for a potential study in this lt vector layers demonstrated lower er and are much easier to work with on the other hand google earth manifests the lowest p fp in pond landscape google earth is a good choice for succession dumps where it demonstrates the lowest er by a large margin on the other hand this method generates more fps than do the other methods the advisability of using this method on reclaimed dumps is thus debatable although this method recorded the lowest er there with a safe margin it also created many fps because there are many areas in this lt that seem like wbs from a bird s eye view osm has two crucial advantages the maps are easy to work with and are available with global coverage their disadvantage is that they are community created data like wikipedia without wide scale and regular updates blog open street map 2017 this was demonstrated also in this study as there was a relatively large number of fps in the osm data the use of this method can only be recommended for the pond landscape where it had the lowest er of all the methods at the same time however a high number of fps must be expected working with dibavod is as easy as with osm but the disadvantage is that it has coverage only within the czech republic wri 2017 in comparison with osm this method generally has higher er but fewer fps occurred when it was used the choice between these two methods therefore depends primarily on the character of the given study in the sense of which error type is more important in the given case of all the vector methods dosm achieved the lowest er in general dosm results are closer to those of osm than to those of dibavod it can be judged from this that the contribution of dibavod during merger of the two layers is not large in certain cases such as on succession dumps this merger nevertheless demonstrated a lower p fp this could have occurred in a situation when some method could not identify the entire wb area and it was therefore evaluated as an fp after a merger of layers the wb area was completed and then evaluated as a tp 4 2 2 total area of water bodies none of the tested methods can be recommended for determining the total wbs area in a landscape all tested methods correctly determined less than half of the total wbs area found during the field survey fig 2 the reasons for this inaccuracy can be found in the rs themselves even the wbs identification itself is difficult in cases of dense vegetation cover pekel et al 2016 let alone the exact determination of their total area large differences in total wb area among lts can be noted the small total area of wb on the agricultural landscape and steppes stems from the natural character of these lts in the case of mountains and forests and as was confirmed earlier see table 7 this is due to the difficulty of detecting wbs on these lts the direct proportionality between total wb area within a size category and wb size corresponds to the data obtained during the field survey where the same is shown see table 3 this result is nevertheless only supplemental and it is irrelevant to the main goals of the study 5 conclusions it can be said that none of the tested methods succeeded in producing wholly reliable results either in identifying wbs or determining their sizes it can be recommended that for further research a larger model area and additional lts should be used greatly advantageous too would be to use polygon format of the control layer with its more precise orientation the entire analysis would thereby be simplified made more precise and enabled to obtain new

1112,globally estuaries are among the most productive ecosystems with many threatened by anthropogenic activities zooplankton is a bioindicator of ecosystem integrity the spatial and temporal composition of zooplankton communities were quantified and compared within and between three estuaries umvoti thukela and amatikulu nyoni estuaries with different levels of human pressure in kwazulu natal south africa additional effects of some physico chemical variables and seasonal flow patterns to zooplankton community structuring were analyzed the amatikulu nyoni estuary was selected as a reference site due to its good ecological state sampling dates represented high flow march and april and low flow august and september from 2014 to 2016 following amatikulu nyoni highest abundance was recorded in thukela and then umvoti estuary with copepod pseudodiaptomus hessei and acartia natalensis dominating the three estuaries highest abundance was recorded during low flow in the umvoti and thukela estuaries redundancy analysis revealed higher salinity and oxygen as environmental determinants of zooplankton community structure in the amatikulu nyoni while turbidity and ph were the determinants of zooplankton community structures in umvoti and thukela estuaries elevated concentrations of din in the thukela estuary during high flow identifies the thukela river as an important source of nitrogen to this estuary our findings suggest that these estuaries be managed to ensure sufficient freshwater supply which controls primary production although the three estuaries were from the same biogeographical region with a similar river dominated function high variability in their zooplankton communities could be explained by differing water quality due to differing human pressure

selected as the reference site for the present study zooplankton is highly sensitive to environmental change and variation in their abundance biomass and diversity depict that it is ecologically important gorokhova et al 2016 however zooplankton has been generally less considered when studying biological responses to changes in environment mialet et al 2011 gorokhova et al 2016 the labour intensity needed to study zooplankton in generally turbid systems like estuaries is one reason for a low number of studies following response of zooplankton to environmental change mialet et al 2011 previous studies have reported negative effect on zooplankton as a result of hypoxic and anoxic conditions in polluted systems e g soetaert and van rijswijk 1993 albaina et al 2009 however in south africa studies on the response of zooplankton to altered water quality and quantity as a result of different levels of human pressure are scarce there is a paucity of data on the zooplankton of kzn estuaries with only few systems investigated e g kibirige and perissinotto 2003 jerling 2005 perissinotto et al 2003 montoya maya and strydom 2009 and there is hardly any seasonal flow studies the zooplankton of the umvoti thukela and amatikulu estuaries in kzn for the period of august 2014 to september 2016 was analyzed to determine the response of zooplankton to contrasting levels of water quality e g oxygen turbidity nutrients and chl a as well as seasonal flow changes we aimed to quantify and compare spatial and temporal composition of zooplankton communities within and between the three estuaries umvoti thukela and amatikulu estuaries in kzn with different ecological states and different levels of human pressure in their catchments additionally effects of some physico chemical variables and seasonal flow patterns to zooplankton community structuring were analyzed we posed the following questions i how zooplankton community structure changes along the salinity gradient during high and low flow periods and ii which environmental variables were most important in structuring zooplankton communities in the three estuaries studied these estuaries are similar in function and geographical area we hypothesized that zooplankton abundances and taxa composition among the three estuaries would differ and that the differences would be related to varying water quality in their catchments 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites three estuaries umvoti mv thukela th and amatikulu ny along the kzn north coast south africa fig 1 were selected for this study as a

analysis zooplankton samples were collected in the umvoti thukela and amatikulu estuary during 2014 15 august 2015 13 march and 17 august and 2016 18 april and 20 september sampling dates were selected for high flow march and april and low flow august and september as referred to hereafter three sites were sampled in umvoti and thukela estuaries and four sites in amatikulu estuary which has

between years p 0 05 there was also a significant difference between flows p 0 05 although with both flows having a more or less equal influence on the community structure fig 5a water quality variables responsible for structuring the zooplankton community assemblages in the umvoti thukela and amatikulu estuaries are shown in fig 4b the rda plot showed that higher salinity and oxygen contributed to the structuring of the zooplankton community in the amatikulu estuary while turbidity and ph contributed to the structuring of zooplankton community in the umvoti and thukela estuaries fig 4b the triplot explained 66 of variation in the data 42 2 on axis 1 and 23 8 on axis 2 the influence of water quality variables in structuring the zooplankton assemblages was significant p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 environmental variables in the current study some physico chemical parameters between the three estuaries were highly variable although the three estuaries studied occur in the same geographical area and are geomorphologically similar harrison et al 2000 the variability in water quality conditions can be attributed to different levels of human pressure on these systems lower temperatures recorded during low flow were associated with the winter season of south africa where there is low rainfall and cold weather conditions the amatikulu estuary had the highest oxygen concentrations while the umvoti estuary displayed the lowest anthropogenic threats that might be affecting oxygen concentrations in the amatikulu estuary are restricted to sedimentation and water quality alteration primarily sources of stressors in the amatikulu system include one sugar mill and associated agricultural activities upstream the umvoti river catchment in comparison is highly utilized and affected by multiple upstream sources including industries waste water treatment works agricultural activities water abstraction and urban and peri urban communities anthropogenic threats associated with these users might have resulted in reduction in oxygen levels in this system during the current study the low to moderate oxygen levels in the thukela estuary may also be attributable to local catchment human pressure including industries mining agriculture recreation paper mill and waste water treatment works water quality of umvoti system has been identified as grossly polluted as early as 1964 begg 1978 other studies have also reported water quality alteration in this system including reduced oxygen and increased chemical oxygen demand malherbe et al 2010 venter 2013 high chemical oxygen demand originates from biodegradable wastes such as those from sewage pulp and paper industries and chemical industry kanu and achi 2011 all these different anthropogenic pressures act in the upper catchment of the umvoti estuary thus affecting its water quality high variability in salinity levels between the three estuaries studied was observed the lower salinity values recorded from the thukela and umvoti systems are attributed to the river dominated nature of these systems marine water has a very little influence on these estuaries the umvoti estuary has a limited potential for significant tidal exchange badenhorst 1990 furthermore the sea water intrusion in the thukela estuary is only effective on spring high tide when the river flow is low whitfield and harrison 2003 salinities recorded in the three estuaries were within the ranges of river dominated estuaries in south africa whitfield 1992 turbidity values varied largely between the three estuaries with the highest turbidity levels recorded from the thukela and the lowest from the amatikulu estuary generally higher turbidity levels were recorded during high flow and this can be explained by associated higher rainfall which results in sediment disturbance increasing the levels of total suspended solids froneman 2002 the thukela system is facing pressure on its structure and function due to increasing anthropogenic demand for water resource services king and pienaar 2011 this was evident in this study as high loads of soft sediments accumulated in the estuary accompanied by poor flushing of the river as a result of reduced flow this sediment accumulation thus increased the turbidity levels on the thukela estuary the elevated concentrations of din during high flow in the thukela estuary were a result of higher rainfall and high flows leading to increased nutrient input from inland the amatikulu estuary had higher din concentration when compared with the umvoti and thukela estuaries low concentrations of din in the umvoti and thukela estuaries can be attributed to the freshwater abstractions in the catchments of umvoti and thukela rivers leading to limited nutrient input the exhibition of elevated din concentrations in the thukela estuary when the river flow is high identifies thukela river as a viable source of nitrogen to this estuary such flow dependent patterns highlight the importance of adequate release policy and adherence to this policy for this heavily utilized estuary during high flow dilution effect of din and dip was evident in the amatikulu and umvoti estuaries dilution of nutrients during high flow has previously been reported in other south african poes mackay 1993 scharler and baird 2003 such fluctuations in nutrient concentrations in estuaries largely depend on the quality and quantity of freshwater inflow palmer et al 2011 during low flow conditions seepage from the agricultural land in the upper reaches generally becomes the primary source of nitrogen in estuaries snow et al 2000 higher nitrogen concentrations during low flow in umvoti and amatikulu are likely to have come from agricultural seepage associated with the agricultural activities upstream of these estuaries furthermore higher primary productivity high chl a concentrations was evident in the upper reaches of the umvoti estuary during 2016 low flow highlighting sufficient nutrients for the primary producers in this region of the estuary although some chl a data for some sampling sessions are absent due to sample volume chl a values in the study area were expected to be low because these estuaries are river dominated with little resident time to allow for sufficient primary productivity available chl a data support this expectation as most chl a values were generally low in all estuaries although higher values were sometimes recorded during low flow higher concentrations of nutrients promote primary productivity in poes perissinotto et al 2003 while there was an increase in nutrient concentration in the umvoti and amatikulu estuaries during low flow there was also an increase in chl a concentrations a phytoplankton bloom is defined as chl a concentration greater than 20μgl 1 adams and bate 1999 chlorophyll a concentrations measured in the umvoti estuary during 2015 low flow were greater than 20μgl 1 and this depicts that this system experienced a phytoplankton bloom during this period the current study suggests that the three estuaries studied have little potential for high primary production the thukela estuary had the lowest chl a values out of the three estuaries studied although both umvoti and thukela estuaries are impacted by water abstraction activities upstream the lower phytoplankton biomass chl a in the thukela estuary is likely to have been a result of higher turbidity levels in this system turbid waters of the thukela estuary may limit light penetration and this may prohibit primary productivity in addition the thukela estuary is classified as river mouth according to whitfield 2000 and such systems have short residence time which limits phytoplankton accumulation the significance of retention time on phytoplankton biomass has also been reported in other studies hilmer and bate 1990 cromar and fallowfield 1997 phosphate may be limiting to phytoplankton production in the thukela estuary owing to its low concentrations during the current study reduced pelagic chl a values in the three estuaries during high flow maybe due to strong river flow which might reduce water residence time essential for nutrient utilization by phytoplankton 4 2 zooplankton information on zooplankton communities in the umvoti thukela and amatikulu estuaries is sparse zooplankton abundances in the umvoti and thukela estuaries were higher during low flow as opposed to the amatikulu estuary which exhibited higher abundance during high flow freshwater flow is one of the main parameters controlling zooplankton seasonal variations in estuaries chicharo et al 2006 low abundance of zooplankton during high flow in the umvoti and thukela estuaries could be a result of outflow of estuarine water flushing away the zooplankton into the adjacent sea throughout the study calanoid copepods particularly a natalensis and p hessei remained the most dominant species in all the three estuaries studied the next most abundant taxa during the present study were chironomidae nematoda and m africana in the umvoti thukela and amatikulu estuaries respectively dominance of copepods in these estuaries studied is a typical phenomenon for estuaries of south africa jerling 2005 the umvoti and thukela estuaries had salinities of less than 4 for most of the study period this explained the relative dominance of freshwater taxa chironomidae and nematoda on these systems as supported by previous reports typical estuarine species dominate mesohaline waters while freshwater organisms dominate oligohaline and limnetic waters wooldridge and bailey 1982 wooldridge 1999 the mean zooplankton abundance recorded in the amatikulu estuary during the present study was higher than that previously recorded in other south african estuaries montoya maya and strydom 2009 zooplankton abundances recorded in both umvoti and thukela were lower than those previously recorded in other south african estuaries montoya maya and strydom 2009 vezi 2013 as observed in the amatikulu estuary during the current study dissolved oxygen also controlled estuarine zooplankton community structure in other parts of the world e g bilbao and urdaibai albaina et al 2009 belgium mialet et al 2011 and brazil almeida et al 2012 higher zooplankton abundance and taxa composition in the amatikulu estuary could be attributed to higher oxygen levels in this system as opposed to umvoti and thukela estuaries which exhibited lower oxygen levels and lower abundances and diversities salinity was identified as the key environmental variable in structuring plankton communities in south african estuaries wooldridge 1999 similarly salinity was one of the environmental parameters structuring zooplankton community in the amatikulu estuary during the current study turbidity and ph were determinants structuring zooplankton communities in the umvoti and thukela estuaries as determined by the rda results of the present study similar to the current study zooplankton community structures were controlled by ph salinity dissolved oxygen and turbidity in other parts of the world laprise and dodson 1994 pandey and verma 2004 tackx et al 2004 uriarte and villate 2004 david et al 2005 albaina et al 2009 mialet et al 2011 almeida et al 2012 farhadian and pouladi 2014 available chl a data from the current study displayed relationship with the zooplankton abundance in the umvoti and thukela estuaries zooplankton abundance increased with phytoplankton biomass chl a in the lower reaches of the umvoti and thukela estuaries during 2015 low flow in these systems zooplankton abundance decreased with decreasing chl a concentrations during high flow such relationship between the zooplankton abundance and chl a concentrations suggests the potential effect of phytoplankton availability on the zooplankton abundance such pattern was also reported in the great fish sundays and kariega estuaries wooldridge and bailey 1982 jerling and wooldridge 1991 grange et al 2000 and in other parts of the world e g scheldt estuary in belgium mialet et al 2011 and golden horn estuary in turkey dorak and albay 2016 as zooplankton is a link between primary producers and larger organisms on the aquatic food chain any negative impact on their abundance or community structure is expected to adversely affect higher trophic level taxa no clear relationship was observed between zooplankton abundance and chl a concentrations in the amatikulu estuary this might suggest that the generally high chl a concentration in this estuary was not a limiting factor to zooplankton abundance this might also suggest that chl a may be less important in controlling zooplankton abundance compared with water quality in this estuary a similar trend was reported in the scheldt estuary mialet et al 2011 high turbidity levels in estuaries may affect zooplankton survival by restricting selective feeding and fecundity of these organisms sellner and bundy 1987 gasparini and castel 1999 in addition sediments have high oxygen demand and have been reported to sequester as much as 16 times their volume of aerated water bruton 1985 donohue and molinos 2009 high turbidity levels in the thukela estuary might have resulted in the lower zooplankton abundance in this system when compared with the amatikulu estuary most estuaries in south africa experience reduced zooplankton abundance during low flow due to reduced nutrient input and reduced primary production wooldridge 1999 higher zooplankton abundance in the amatikulu estuary during high flow was consistent with this pattern this pattern was similarly observed in other south african permanently open estuaries montoya maya and strydom 2009 although the umvoti had higher chl a concentrations when compared with the thukela and amatikulu estuaries the lower zooplankton abundances in this system are likely attributable to the short residence time in this system together with low oxygen concentrations which reflected the higher degree of pollution in this system copepods which were the main dominant group in this system are known to have low tolerance to reduced oxygen levels roman et al 1993 hence their low abundances when compared with the other two estuaries studied higher zooplankton abundance in the amatikulu estuary was likely to be attributed to the relatively higher phytoplankton biomass higher nutrient levels higher oxygen concentrations as well as sufficient residence time for both phytoplankton to utilize nutrients and zooplankton to utilize phytoplankton efficiently numbers of a natalensis in the amatikulu estuary were very low when compared with p hessei and m africana unlike vertically migrating species a natalensis is a permanent resident of the water column kibirige and perissinotto 2003 this may get these organisms washed to the sea during high flow salinity values recorded in the amatikulu estuary ranged from 1 4 to 53 9 such variation in salinity may explain the low numbers of a natalensis as these organisms are vulnerable to fluctuations in salinity as supported by jerling and cyrus 1999 the mysid m africana displays an opportunistic behavioural response to low salinity as a result of freshwater inflow kibirige and perissinotto 2003 similarly this species was recorded in high numbers during high flow in the amatikulu estuary during the current study mysids particularly mesopodopsis species were positively correlated with salinity in the gironde estuary france david et al 2005 similarly this species is known to be controlled by salinity in other north european estuaries mees et al 1993 azeiteiro and marques 1999 mouny et al 2000 5 conclusions the spatial variability in the zooplankton distribution taxa composition and abundance can be explained by the horizontal salinity gradient in the three estuaries studied the results of the current study showed that spatial and temporal variation in the water physico chemical parameters of the three estuaries has an effect on the structure and abundance of zooplankton assemblages we conclude that the environmental variability and seasonality in river inflow are the important factors influencing zooplankton distribution taxa composition and abundance in the umvoti thukela and amatikulu estuaries changes in the environmental variables e g oxygen turbidity nutrients and chl a as a result of human activities need to be monitored and these activities need to be properly managed to reduce their impacts on the estuarine systems following human activities management response of zooplankton to improving water quality is expected and must also be monitored estuary management plans are urgently needed for these three estuaries so as to establish protection conservation and management measures needed to minimize impacts restoration of riparian vegetation of these estuaries can aid in improving water quality and aquatic habitats of these systems development of riparian buffers may be another important strategy to reduce sediment loading and erosion into these impacted estuaries conflict of interest none

1112,globally estuaries are among the most productive ecosystems with many threatened by anthropogenic activities zooplankton is a bioindicator of ecosystem integrity the spatial and temporal composition of zooplankton communities were quantified and compared within and between three estuaries umvoti thukela and amatikulu nyoni estuaries with different levels of human pressure in kwazulu natal south africa additional effects of some physico chemical variables and seasonal flow patterns to zooplankton community structuring were analyzed the amatikulu nyoni estuary was selected as a reference site due to its good ecological state sampling dates represented high flow march and april and low flow august and september from 2014 to 2016 following amatikulu nyoni highest abundance was recorded in thukela and then umvoti estuary with copepod pseudodiaptomus hessei and acartia natalensis dominating the three estuaries highest abundance was recorded during low flow in the umvoti and thukela estuaries redundancy analysis revealed higher salinity and oxygen as environmental determinants of zooplankton community structure in the amatikulu nyoni while turbidity and ph were the determinants of zooplankton community structures in umvoti and thukela estuaries elevated concentrations of din in the thukela estuary during high flow identifies the thukela river as an important source of nitrogen to this estuary our findings suggest that these estuaries be managed to ensure sufficient freshwater supply which controls primary production although the three estuaries were from the same biogeographical region with a similar river dominated function high variability in their zooplankton communities could be explained by differing water quality due to differing human pressure in their catchments keywords zooplankton human pressure estuaries flows pollution water quality 1 introduction estuaries provide nursery grounds for many marine species vasconcelos et al 2010 there is spatial variation in zooplankton community structures in estuaries as a result of highly dynamic conditions experienced by organisms in these systems such as salinity fluctuation and variation in water temperature allen et al 2008 barros et al 2015 zooplankton plays a significant role in energy transfer from primary producers to higher trophic levels degerman et al 2018 zooplankton also serves as a good indicator of biodiversity because of its high sensitivity to environmental change gorokhova et al 2016 zooplankton communities in south african permanently open estuaries poe are mostly dominated by copepods and mysids with copepods making a substantial contribution to abundance wooldridge 1999 as it is nutrient rich from land drainage river inflow is one of the drivers structuring estuarine zooplankton communities venkataramana et al 2017 globally there has been a deterioration in the ecological health of many estuaries as a result of excessive anthropogenic water abstraction agricultural activities and industrial effluents quinton and catt 2007 zhang et al 2012 wang et al 2014 liu et al 2015 many estuaries along the north coast of the kwazulu natal kzn province south africa are affected by the reduced flows poor water quality and habitat alterations originating from different levels of human pressure king and pienaar 2011 the umvoti estuary is regarded as a polluted system o brien et al 2009 there has been a deterioration in the ecological health of the thukela estuary over the last few decades lamberth et al 2009 the amatikulu nyoni estuary hereafter referred to as amatikulu estuary is in a good ecological condition although siltation from the catchment is of concern whitfield 2000 as a consequence of its good condition the amatikulu estuary was selected as the reference site for the present study zooplankton is highly sensitive to environmental change and variation in their abundance biomass and diversity depict that it is ecologically important gorokhova et al 2016 however zooplankton has been generally less considered when studying biological responses to changes in environment mialet et al 2011 gorokhova et al 2016 the labour intensity needed to study zooplankton in generally turbid systems like estuaries is one reason for a low number of studies following response of zooplankton to environmental change mialet et al 2011 previous studies have reported negative effect on zooplankton as a result of hypoxic and anoxic conditions in polluted systems e g soetaert and van rijswijk 1993 albaina et al 2009 however in south africa studies on the response of zooplankton to altered water quality and quantity as a result of different levels of human pressure are scarce there is a paucity of data on the zooplankton of kzn estuaries with only few systems investigated e g kibirige and perissinotto 2003 jerling 2005 perissinotto et al 2003 montoya maya and strydom 2009 and there is hardly any seasonal flow studies the zooplankton of the umvoti thukela and amatikulu estuaries in kzn for the period of august 2014 to september 2016 was analyzed to determine the response of zooplankton to contrasting levels of water quality e g oxygen turbidity nutrients and chl a as well as seasonal flow changes we aimed to quantify and compare spatial and temporal composition of zooplankton communities within and between the three estuaries umvoti thukela and amatikulu estuaries in kzn with different ecological states and different levels of human pressure in their catchments additionally effects of some physico chemical variables and seasonal flow patterns to zooplankton community structuring were analyzed we posed the following questions i how zooplankton community structure changes along the salinity gradient during high and low flow periods and ii which environmental variables were most important in structuring zooplankton communities in the three estuaries studied these estuaries are similar in function and geographical area we hypothesized that zooplankton abundances and taxa composition among the three estuaries would differ and that the differences would be related to varying water quality in their catchments 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites three estuaries umvoti mv thukela th and amatikulu ny along the kzn north coast south africa fig 1 were selected for this study as a consequence of its relatively good ecological state the amatikulu system was selected as a reference site 2 1 1 umvoti estuary the umvoti estuary 29 23 s 31 20 e fig 1 is a subtropical river mouth

the estuary begg 1978 the large quantities of silt transported into the thukela estuary have resulted in a vertical shelf leading to minimal sea water penetration de lecea and cooper 2016 2 1 3 amatikulu nyoni estuary the amatikulu estuary 36 06 s 31 37 e fig 1 is a subtropical permanently open estuary whitfield 2000 with a surface area of approximately 2 6km2 the amatikulu river joins the nyoni river and flows parallel to the indian ocean before it empties into this ocean approximately 105km north of durban the amatikulu estuary was usually shallow during the present study with a mean depth of 0 6m there are sugar cane plantations upstream of the amatikulu river in the lower reaches the estuary is disturbed by agricultural activities but the fauna generally remains in good condition harrison et al 2000 the amatikulu estuary has a good ichthyofauna water quality and aesthetics harrison et al 2000 this system is described as a system that shares a common mouth and should be conserved as an item heydorn 1986 the amatikulu estuary forms part of the amatikulu nature reserve managed by the ezemvelo kwazulu natal wildlife ekznw authority 2 2 sampling and laboratory analysis zooplankton samples were collected in the umvoti thukela and amatikulu estuary during 2014 15 august 2015 13 march and 17 august and 2016 18 april and 20 september sampling dates were selected for high flow march and april and low flow august and september as referred to hereafter three sites were sampled in umvoti and thukela estuaries and four sites in amatikulu estuary which has a greater length than the other two estuaries fig 1 during each sampling occasion daytime sampling was conducted using a hyperbenthic zooplankton sled mesh size 200μm towing distance 20m volume filtered 1m 3 kibirige et al 2006 in each estuary three replicate samples were collected at each site during all sampling sessions the zooplankton samples were preserved in 10 formalin containing rose bengal dye in situ physico chemical data including oxygen salinity temperature ph and turbidity were recorded during each survey in each site using a calibrated portable metre eutech instruments cyberscan series 600 thermo fisher usa water quality samples were collected from the water column using polyethylene bottles these were thereafter sent to umgeni water laboratory an accredited

in data from these two middle sites in the amatikulu estuary during this year occur some water quality data from the same sites and dates were obtained from the department of water and sanitation south africa data for din dip and chl a are absent for april 2016 in the umvoti estuary because of insufficient sample volume in the laboratory zooplankton samples were diluted to 1 5l solutions depending on the concentration of the sample organisms in each sample were kept in suspension by thorough stirring of the sample and three sub samples for identification and enumeration withdrawn using a 20ml scoop attached to a metal rod after penetrating the entire depth jerling and wooldridge 1995 carrasco et al 2010 the coefficient of variation between subsamples was below 10 organisms in

metre ind m 3 2 3 statistical analysis the canoco software package version 4 5 ter braak 1994 was used ordination techniques were applied using the original zooplankton community data sets main samples in each site which allowed for intepretation of zooplankton community structures with regards to taxa recorded during the study van den brink et al 2003 these practises evaluated changes in zooplankton community structures and then tested the statistical significance of differences in communities after incorporated with monte carlo permutation testing ter braak and smillauer 2004 redundancy analysis rda was adopted to accomplish this ter braak 1994 because zooplankton abundance data were available the data were transformed using a log x 2 transformation van den brink et al

location of the values in the diagram after incorporating available environmental data tri plots were constructed these tri plots displayed arrows of environmental data which were directed to higher values where there was existence of correlations between sites and environmental variables van den brink et al 2003 3 results 3 1 environmental variables measurements of the physico chemical variables

structuring zooplankton communities fig 5b this triplot explained 73 1 of variation in the data 51 4 on axis 1 and 21 7 on axis 2 there was a significant difference in zooplankton community structure

variables responsible for structuring the zooplankton community assemblages in the umvoti thukela and amatikulu estuaries are shown in fig 4b the rda plot showed that higher salinity and oxygen contributed to the structuring of the zooplankton community in the amatikulu estuary while turbidity and ph contributed to the structuring of zooplankton community in the umvoti and thukela estuaries fig 4b the triplot explained 66 of variation in the data 42 2 on axis 1 and 23 8 on axis 2 the influence of water quality variables in structuring the zooplankton assemblages was significant p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 environmental variables in the current study some physico chemical parameters between the three estuaries were highly variable although the three estuaries studied occur in the same geographical area and are geomorphologically similar harrison et al 2000 the variability in water quality conditions can be attributed to different levels of human pressure on these systems lower temperatures recorded during low flow were associated with the winter season of south africa where there is low rainfall and cold weather conditions the amatikulu estuary had the highest oxygen concentrations while the umvoti estuary displayed the lowest anthropogenic threats that might be affecting oxygen concentrations in the amatikulu estuary are restricted to sedimentation and water quality alteration primarily sources of stressors in the amatikulu system include one sugar mill and associated agricultural activities upstream the umvoti river catchment in comparison is highly utilized and affected by multiple upstream sources including industries waste water treatment works agricultural activities water abstraction and urban and peri urban communities anthropogenic threats associated with these users might have resulted in reduction in oxygen levels in this system during the current study the low to moderate oxygen levels in the thukela estuary may also be attributable to local catchment human pressure including industries mining agriculture recreation paper mill and waste water treatment works water quality of umvoti system has been identified as grossly polluted as early as 1964 begg 1978 other studies have also reported water quality alteration in this system including reduced oxygen and increased chemical oxygen demand malherbe et al 2010 venter 2013 high chemical oxygen demand originates from biodegradable wastes such as those from sewage pulp and paper industries and chemical industry kanu and achi 2011 all these different anthropogenic pressures act in the upper catchment of the umvoti estuary thus affecting its water quality high variability in salinity levels between the three estuaries studied was observed the lower salinity values recorded from the thukela and umvoti systems are attributed to the river dominated nature of these systems marine water has a very little influence on these estuaries the umvoti estuary has a limited potential for significant tidal exchange badenhorst 1990 furthermore the sea water intrusion in the thukela estuary is only effective on spring high tide when the river flow is low whitfield and harrison 2003 salinities recorded in the three estuaries were within the ranges of river dominated estuaries in south africa whitfield 1992 turbidity values varied largely between the three estuaries with the highest turbidity levels recorded from the thukela and the lowest from the amatikulu estuary generally higher turbidity levels were recorded during high flow and this can be explained by associated higher rainfall which results in sediment disturbance increasing the levels of total suspended solids froneman 2002 the thukela system is facing pressure on its structure and function due to increasing anthropogenic demand for water resource services king and pienaar 2011 this was evident in this study as high loads of soft sediments accumulated in the estuary accompanied by poor flushing of the river as a result of reduced flow this sediment accumulation thus increased the turbidity levels on the thukela estuary the elevated concentrations of din during high flow in the thukela estuary were a result of higher rainfall and high flows leading to increased nutrient input from inland the amatikulu estuary had higher din concentration when compared with the umvoti and thukela estuaries low concentrations of din in the umvoti and thukela estuaries can be attributed to the freshwater abstractions in the catchments of umvoti and thukela rivers leading to limited nutrient input the exhibition of elevated din concentrations in the thukela estuary when the river flow is high identifies thukela river as a viable source of nitrogen to this estuary such flow dependent patterns highlight the importance of adequate release policy and adherence to this policy for this heavily utilized estuary during high flow dilution effect of din and dip was evident in the amatikulu and umvoti estuaries dilution of nutrients during high flow has previously been reported in other south african poes mackay 1993 scharler and baird 2003 such fluctuations in nutrient concentrations in estuaries largely depend on the quality and quantity of freshwater inflow palmer et al 2011 during low flow conditions seepage from the agricultural land in the upper reaches generally becomes the primary source of nitrogen in estuaries snow et al 2000 higher nitrogen concentrations during low flow in umvoti and amatikulu are likely to have come from agricultural seepage associated with the agricultural activities upstream of these estuaries furthermore higher primary productivity high chl a concentrations was evident in the upper reaches of the umvoti estuary during 2016 low flow highlighting sufficient nutrients for the primary producers in this region of the estuary although some chl a data for some sampling sessions are absent due to sample volume chl a values in the study area were expected to be low because these estuaries are river dominated with little resident time to allow for sufficient primary productivity available chl a data support this expectation as most chl a values were generally low in all estuaries although higher values were sometimes recorded during low flow higher concentrations of nutrients promote primary productivity in poes perissinotto et al 2003 while there was an increase in nutrient concentration in the umvoti and amatikulu estuaries during low flow there was also an increase in chl a concentrations a phytoplankton bloom is defined as chl a concentration greater than 20μgl 1 adams and bate 1999 chlorophyll a concentrations measured in the umvoti estuary during 2015 low flow were greater than 20μgl 1 and this depicts that this system experienced a phytoplankton bloom during this period the current study suggests that the three estuaries studied have little potential for high primary production the thukela estuary had the lowest chl a values out of the three estuaries studied although both umvoti and thukela estuaries are impacted by water abstraction activities upstream the lower phytoplankton biomass chl a in the thukela estuary is likely to have been a result of higher turbidity levels in this system turbid waters of the thukela estuary may limit light penetration and this may prohibit primary productivity in addition the thukela estuary is classified as river mouth according to whitfield 2000 and such systems have short residence time which limits phytoplankton accumulation the significance of retention time on phytoplankton biomass has also been reported in other studies hilmer and bate 1990 cromar and fallowfield 1997 phosphate may be limiting to phytoplankton production in the thukela estuary owing to its low concentrations during the current study reduced pelagic chl a values in the three estuaries during high flow maybe due to strong river flow which might reduce water residence time essential for nutrient utilization by phytoplankton 4 2 zooplankton information on zooplankton communities in the umvoti thukela and amatikulu estuaries is sparse zooplankton abundances in the umvoti and thukela estuaries were higher during low flow as opposed to the amatikulu estuary which exhibited higher abundance during high flow freshwater flow is one of the main parameters controlling zooplankton seasonal variations in estuaries chicharo et al 2006 low abundance of zooplankton during high flow in the umvoti and thukela estuaries could be a result of outflow of estuarine water flushing away the zooplankton into the adjacent sea throughout the study calanoid copepods particularly a natalensis and p hessei remained the most dominant species in all the three estuaries studied the next most abundant taxa during the present study were chironomidae nematoda and m africana in the umvoti thukela and amatikulu estuaries respectively dominance of copepods in these estuaries studied is a typical phenomenon for estuaries of south africa jerling 2005 the umvoti and thukela estuaries had salinities of less than 4 for most of the study period this explained the relative dominance of freshwater taxa chironomidae and nematoda on these systems as supported by previous reports typical estuarine species dominate mesohaline waters while freshwater organisms dominate oligohaline and limnetic waters wooldridge and bailey 1982 wooldridge 1999 the mean zooplankton abundance recorded in the amatikulu estuary during the present study was higher than that previously recorded in other south african estuaries montoya maya and strydom 2009 zooplankton abundances recorded in both umvoti and thukela were lower than those previously recorded in other south african estuaries montoya maya and strydom 2009 vezi 2013 as observed in the amatikulu estuary during the current study dissolved oxygen also controlled estuarine zooplankton community structure in other parts of the world e g bilbao and urdaibai albaina et al 2009 belgium mialet et al 2011 and brazil almeida et al 2012 higher zooplankton abundance and taxa composition in the amatikulu estuary could be attributed to higher oxygen levels in this system as opposed to umvoti and thukela estuaries which exhibited lower oxygen levels and lower abundances and diversities salinity was identified as the key environmental variable in structuring plankton communities in south african estuaries wooldridge 1999 similarly salinity was one of the environmental parameters structuring zooplankton community in the amatikulu estuary during the current study turbidity and ph were determinants structuring zooplankton communities in the umvoti and thukela estuaries as determined by the rda results of the present study similar to the current study zooplankton community structures were controlled by ph salinity dissolved oxygen and turbidity in other parts of the world laprise and dodson 1994 pandey and verma 2004 tackx et al 2004 uriarte and villate 2004 david et al 2005 albaina et al 2009 mialet et al 2011 almeida et al 2012 farhadian and pouladi 2014 available chl a data from the current study displayed relationship with the zooplankton abundance in the umvoti and thukela estuaries zooplankton abundance increased with phytoplankton biomass chl a in the lower reaches of the umvoti and thukela estuaries during 2015 low flow in these systems zooplankton abundance decreased with decreasing chl a concentrations during high flow such relationship between the zooplankton abundance and chl a concentrations suggests the potential effect of phytoplankton availability on the zooplankton abundance such pattern was also reported in the great fish sundays and kariega estuaries wooldridge and bailey 1982 jerling and wooldridge 1991 grange et al 2000 and in other parts of the world e g scheldt estuary in belgium mialet et al 2011 and golden horn estuary in turkey dorak and albay 2016 as zooplankton is a link between primary producers and larger organisms on the aquatic food chain any negative impact on their abundance or community structure is expected to adversely affect higher trophic level taxa no clear relationship was observed between zooplankton abundance and chl a concentrations in the amatikulu estuary this might suggest that the generally high chl a concentration in this estuary was not a limiting factor to zooplankton abundance this might also suggest that chl a may be less important in controlling zooplankton abundance compared with water quality in this estuary a similar trend was reported in the scheldt estuary mialet et al 2011 high turbidity levels in estuaries may affect zooplankton survival by restricting selective feeding and fecundity of these organisms sellner and bundy 1987 gasparini and castel 1999 in addition sediments have high oxygen demand and have been reported to sequester as much as 16 times their volume of aerated water bruton 1985 donohue and molinos 2009 high turbidity levels in the thukela estuary might have resulted in the lower zooplankton abundance in this system when compared with the amatikulu estuary most estuaries in south africa experience reduced zooplankton abundance during low flow due to reduced nutrient input and reduced primary production wooldridge 1999 higher zooplankton abundance in the amatikulu estuary during high flow was consistent with this pattern this pattern was similarly observed in other south african permanently open estuaries montoya maya and strydom 2009 although the umvoti had higher chl a concentrations when compared with the thukela and amatikulu estuaries the lower zooplankton abundances in this system are likely attributable to the short residence time in this system together with low oxygen concentrations which reflected the higher degree of pollution in this system copepods which were the main dominant group in this system are known to have low tolerance to reduced oxygen levels roman et al 1993 hence their low abundances when compared with the other two estuaries studied higher zooplankton abundance in the amatikulu estuary was likely to be attributed to the relatively higher phytoplankton biomass higher nutrient levels higher oxygen concentrations as well as sufficient residence time for both phytoplankton to utilize nutrients and zooplankton to utilize phytoplankton efficiently numbers of a natalensis in the amatikulu estuary were very low when compared with p hessei and m africana unlike vertically migrating species a natalensis is a permanent resident of the water column kibirige and perissinotto 2003 this may get these organisms washed to the sea during high flow salinity values recorded in the amatikulu estuary ranged from 1 4 to 53 9 such variation in salinity may explain the low numbers of a natalensis as these organisms are vulnerable to fluctuations in salinity as supported by jerling and cyrus 1999 the mysid m africana displays an opportunistic behavioural response to low salinity as a result of freshwater inflow kibirige and perissinotto 2003 similarly this species was recorded in high numbers during high flow in the amatikulu estuary during the current study mysids particularly mesopodopsis species were positively correlated with salinity in the gironde estuary france david et al 2005 similarly this species is known to be controlled by salinity in other north european estuaries mees et al 1993 azeiteiro and marques 1999 mouny et al 2000 5 conclusions the spatial variability in the zooplankton distribution taxa composition and abundance can be explained by the horizontal salinity gradient in the three estuaries studied the results of the current study showed that spatial and temporal variation in the water physico chemical parameters of the three estuaries has an effect on the structure and abundance of zooplankton assemblages we conclude that the environmental variability and seasonality in river inflow are the important factors influencing zooplankton distribution taxa composition and abundance in the umvoti thukela and amatikulu estuaries changes in the environmental variables e g oxygen turbidity nutrients and chl a as a result of human activities need to be monitored and these activities need to be properly managed to reduce their impacts on the estuarine systems following human activities management response of zooplankton to improving water quality is expected and must also be monitored estuary management plans are urgently needed for these three estuaries so as to establish protection conservation and management measures needed to minimize impacts restoration of riparian vegetation of these estuaries can aid in improving water quality and aquatic habitats of these systems development of riparian buffers may be another important strategy to reduce sediment loading and erosion into these impacted estuaries conflict of interest none

1113,the paper deals with the study of the influence of hydrodynamic factors current water level fluctuations and wind driven wave on the structure of epiphyton occurring on macrophytes of various ecological groups in the kanev reservoir the dnieper river ukraine the reservoir is subdivided into the river and lake sections including the transit and non transit zones it has been found that the main factors inhibiting the development of epiphyton in the main riverbed of the river section include high current velocities conditioned by discharge currents and water level fluctuations in the bays of the river section water level fluctuations whereas in the transit zone of the lake section wind driven wave the performed investigations have shown that the increase in water movement conditioned by high current velocities water level fluctuations and wind driven wave results in the decrease in epiphyton species richness in changes in its species composition taxonomic structure dominant complex dimensional structure and its numbers and biomass structure and also in the decrease in the quantitative indices of its development it has been found that the average number of species in a sample and epiphyton numbers and biomass depended inversely on current velocity water level fluctuations and wind driven wave as a consequence the increase in water movement can result in the lower oxygen release and organic matter production by this community and the decrease of nutrient uptake and pollutants accumulation thus limiting the role of epiphyton in water bodies self purification at the same time it has been shown that water movement variously influenced algal communities occurring on the substrates of different types including epiphyton found on macrophytes and periphyton registered on solid artificial inorganic substrates the obtained data can be used in predicting the ecological state of the designed water bodies keywords epiphyton reservoir hydrodynamic factors current water level fluctuations wind driven wave 1 introduction the regulation of rivers and their transformation into the cascade of reservoirs along with beneficial economic effect results in a set of adverse consequences conditioned by changes in their hydrological hydrochemical and hydrobiological regimes thus the study of the response of the biota to such transformations is of considerable importance in this case the study of the structure and functioning of the communities of freshwater algae is of crucial significance with regard to their role in the processes of organic matter production and water quality regulation it has been known that the formation of epiphyton structure depends on many factors including the macrophyte habitat and specific plant architecture

zhang et al 2013 trbojević et al 2017 the strength and form of epiphyton attachment wunsam et al 2002 passy 2007 water chemical composition in macrophyte beds klochenko et al 2014 2015 light intensity bourassa and cattaneo 2000 liboriussen and jeppesen 2003 etc water dynamics are one of the main ecological factors influencing many characteristics of the vital activity of hydrobionts timchenko 2006 among hydrodynamic factors water level fluctuations are of considerable importance coops et al 2003 zębek 2013 rios pulgarin et al 2016 even small changes of water level may result in a large shift in plant communities one example is that of littoral helophyte communities which can be completely dependent on slight water level fluctuations exposing substrate for germination and or flooding seedlings furthermore high water levels in spring may limit submersed plant expansion inducing a shift to a sparsely vegetated state whereas a substantial reduction in spring lake level may encourage expansion of submersed plants coops et al 2003 water level fluctuations and a large movement of the water column affected the substrates and maintained the assemblages of epiphyton in early stages of development rios pulgarin et al 2016 as it was experimentally established asaeda and son 2000 flow velocity is a key factor in epiphyton erosion it has been found wilby et al 1998 špoljar and zhang 2017 that increased flow velocities enhanced macrophyte growth and limited epiphyton development many studies report an inverse relationship between the flow and epiphyton biomass antoine and benson evans 1982 lamb and lowe 1987 ghosh and gaur 1998 asaeda and son 2000 ryder et al 2006 rovira et al 2016 rusanov and khromov 2016 hydrological regime of water bodies influences not only epiphyton biomass but also physiological and biochemical processes in algal cells biggs and hickey 1994 biggs and smith 2002 hondzo and wang 2002 rios pulgarin et al 2016 for example under conditions of laboratory experiments the periphyton growth measured in terms of the chlorophyll a concentrations and its metabolism characterized by dissolved oxygen concentrations measurements were the lowest in a stagnant fluid these indices increased in a moving fluid and decreased under critical conditions corresponding to the detachment of periphyton hondzo and wang 2002 the results of experiments showed no significant differences in gross primary production between two periphyton communities of different biomass but indicated a slightly decreasing trend with increasing velocity in contrast community respiration increased greatly with mat biomass and also as a function of increased water velocity biggs and hickey 1994 despite the fact that a set of publications deals with the study of the influence of hydrodynamics on the vital activity of epiphyton this problem is not clearly understood the objective of the present work was to study the influence of hydrodynamic factors current water level fluctuations and wind driven wave on the structure of epiphyton occurring on macrophytes of various ecological groups in the kanev reservoir 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study site the infracascade kanev reservoir 49 58 n 31 14 e belongs to large plain reservoirs on the dnieper river fig 1 according to ecological and hydrodynamic principles of its zoning timchenko 2010 it is subdivided into the river and lake sections in terms of morphometric characteristics and in terms of a predominance of river and lake hydrological conditions including the transit and non transit zones in terms of the intensity of discharge current the river kiev section of the reservoir is 43km long it includes the main riverbed of the dnieper river 600 800m wide and 8 10m deep and also numerous bays branches and tributaries forming the additional system of the reservoir on the whole the area of the additional system is almost equal to the area of the main riverbed however in the main riverbed water volume is as twice as larger than that in the additional system timchenko 2010 the hydrological regime of the river section of the kanev reservoir depends to a large extent on the operating conditions of the kiev hydro electric power station located upstream of it its releases are responsible for intraday fluctuations of water level up to 1 2m in the non transit zones bays branches etc fluctuations of water level are almost synchronous with those in the main riverbed timchenko and dubnyak 2001 during the period of releases discharge current velocity in the transit zone the main riverbed accounts for 0 3 1 0m s whereas in the non transit zone it is 0 05 0 10m s the intensity of wind driven wave in the river section of the kanev reservoir is insignificant for the most part wave height is not more than 0 1m the lake section of the reservoir is 80km long it includes three stretches the first stretch to 5km wide located near the town of ukrainka is rather shallow mainly to 3m deep it is followed by a rather narrow section about 25km long and 2 3km wide including numerous islands and shallow water zones outside of the shallow water zones this section is 3 8m deep the second stretch is 8km wide and 4 8m deep whereas the third stretch adjacent to the dam of the kanev hydro electric power station is 11km wide and 6 9m deep in the lake section of the kanev reservoir the transit zone is adjacent to the high right bank which is conditioned by the peculiarities of the structure of the drowned dnieper valley rather narrow mainly 30 50m wide shallow waters the hydrodynamics of which entirely depend on the processes occurring in the transit zone have been formed along the high right bank the non transit zone situated along the left bank represents vast from several hundreds meters to 2 3km shallow waters occupied by higher aquatic plants formed mainly on the drowned floodplain and on the terrace of the dnieper river above the floodplain and also in the bays representing tributary estuaries drowned by the reservoir in the lake section of the reservoir discharge current velocity is mainly not more than 0 1 0 3m s wind currents are also registered in this section their velocity is closely similar to that of discharge currents the intraday water level fluctuations are about 0 05m for the most part wave height in the transit zone is not more than 0 40m whereas in the non transit zone 0 10m gidrologiya 1989 2 2 material field observations in the kanev reservoir were carried out in summer 2003 2006 2009 2011 2012 and 2014 at 24 stations fig 1 in the river and lake sections of the reservoir algal samples were taken in the transit and non transit zones on the whole 267 samples were taken and processed 89 and 84 samples in the transit zone of the river and lake sections of the reservoir and 94 samples in the bays and shallow waters of the non transit zone the samples of epiphyton were taken from 19 species of higher aquatic plants

processed following the commonly accepted hydrobiological procedures arsan et al 2006 epiphyton was collected with substratum the fragments of higher aquatic plants were cut with scissors placed into polyethylene bags kept in an ice box and transported to the laboratory under laboratory conditions fouling was washed off the sampled plants with tap water using a special brush the volume of a sample was 50ml some samples were studied in the living state whereas others were fixed by 40 solution of formaldehyde the fragments of higher aquatic plants were dried in the air and than weighted to obtain their dry mass the numbers of algae were determined using a special counting plate in the drop of 0 1ml volume taken using a piston pipette biomass was calculated by the count cell volume method arsan et al 2006 the numbers and biomass of epiphyton were calculated per 1g of air dry mass of plant substratum the species the contribution of which to the total biomass of epiphyton in the sample was 25 were assigned to dominants algal samples were studied at 200 400 and 1000 magnification using a zeiss axio imager a1 microscope the following manuals were used to identify algal taxa komárek and fott

2005 the latin names and the volume of algal taxa are given in accordance with the classification systems tsarenko et al 2006 2015 the species composition of algae found in various sections of the reservoir was compared using the sørensen coefficient of community similarity by the following formula k 2 c a b 100 where a and b are number of species found in each of the compared groups of organisms c is number of common species arsan et al 2006 taxonomic analysis was carried out using the methods accepted for the comparison of floras shmidt 1980 the kendall coefficient of rank correlation was calculated by the following formula τ 2 s n n 1 where s the sum of ranks n the number of pairs of the compared ranks shmidt 1980 hydrodynamic characteristics were determined based on results of field observations carried out following standard hydrological procedures arsan et al 2006 and also based on the data of stationary hydrological observations of the hydrometeorological agency of ukraine water velocity was measured using the gr 21m current meter values more than 0 04m s bykov and vasilyev 1977 at a lower water velocity and also in the beds of higher aquatic plants the pneumatic method was used pikush 1971 this method widely used in performing ecohydrological investigations in various water bodies was elaborated at the institute of hydrobiology of the national academy of sciences of ukraine water level fluctuations conditioned by the releases of the kiev hydro electric power station were measured using the valday water level chart recorder and water level staff arsan et al 2006 the height of waves was measured using wave height pole nastavleniye 1978 investigations were carried out following methodical recommendations given in the guide to hydrological practices guide 1975 to establish relationship between the indices of epiphyton development and hydrodynamic factors correlation analysis was carried out the averaged for two years 2012 and 2014 data on current velocity water level fluctuations and wind driven wave were used the data on the number of species in a sample and on the numbers and biomass of epiphyton were also averaged for each station the same number of samples was averaged at each station six samples including two samples taken from typha angustifolia two samples from nuphar lutea and two samples from potamogeton perfoliatus the obtained data were processed using the ms excel 2010 3 results 3 1 main cenosis forming macrophytes during the period of investigations the most frequent plant species found at all stations of the kanev reservoir were typha angustifolia nuphar lutea and potamogeton perfoliatus in the transit zone of the river section of the reservoir the main cenosis forming plant species were typha angustifolia and potamogeton perfoliatus trapa natans and potamogeton pectinatus prevailed only at same stations in the non transit zone of the river section the dominant complex of macrophytes was represented by nuphar lutea trapa natans typha angustifolia and scirpus lacustris in the transit zone of the lake section of the reservoir the main cenosis forming plant species were typha angustifolia phragmites australis potamogeton perfoliatus and potamogeton pectinatus in the non transit zone of the lake section they included typha angustifolia nuphar lutea and ceratophyllum demersum 3 2 species richness and taxonomic structure on the whole 329 algal species represented by 343 infraspecific taxa including those containing nomenclatural types of species were found in the fouling of higher aquatic plants in the kanev reservoir bacillariophyta chlorophyta and charophyta 82 9 of the total number of species were highly diverse in their species composition table 1 the distribution of epiphyton over different zones of the reservoir was non uniform in the non transit zones the number of their species was higher than that in the transit zones table 1 bacillariophyta and chlorophyta were represented by the largest number of species in all sections and zones of the reservoir in the transit zones the third place was occupied by cyanoprokaryota whereas the fourth place by charophyta in the non transit zones vice versa the third place was occupied by charophyta whereas the fourth place by cyanoprokaryota it should be noted that in the transit zones of both sections of the reservoir the contribution of bacillariophyta and cyanoprokaryota to the total number of species was higher whereas the contribution of chlorophyta and charophyta was lower than that in the non transit zones table 1 at the level of leading families the taxonomic structure of epiphyton differed which is supported by rather low values of the kendall coefficient of rank correlation τ 0 30 0 56 in both sections the first rank place was occupied by the family scenedesmaceae and only in the non transit zone of the lake section by the family desmidiaceae among the leading genera in the transit zone of the river section the first rank place was occupied by the genus nitzschia hass whereas in the transit zone of the lake section by the genus navicula bory in the non transit zones the first rank place was occupied by the genus cosmarium corda ex ralfs the values of the kendall coefficient of rank correlation τ calculated in terms of the leading genera varied from 0 30 to 0 67 3 3 species composition the species composition of epiphyton of the reservoir was closely similar in comparing the main riverbed and the bays of the river section the values of the sørensen coefficient of community similarity accounted for 73 at the same time it was rather similar in comparing other sections of the reservoir the values of the sørensen coefficient of community similarity were 57 60 the taxonomic structure and species composition of epiphyton found in various sections of the kanev reservoir were discussed at greater length in our previous publications tarashchuk et al 2011 klochenko et al 2016 2017 3 4 average number of species in a sample the average number of species of epiphyton in a sample on the main cenosis forming species of higher aquatic plants occurring in various sections and zones of the reservoir differed in this case the largest number of species was found in the non transit zone of the lake section of the reservoir whereas their lowest number in the transit zone of the lake section table 2 3 5 quantitative indices the quantitative indices of epiphyton development in various sections and zones of the reservoir also essentially differed on plants of all ecological groups the lowest numbers and biomass of epiphyton were registered in the transit zones of both sections of the reservoir whereas their highest values in the non transit zone of the lake section of the reservoir table 2 3 6 structure of epiphyton numbers and biomass the structure of epiphyton numbers and biomass in various sections and zones of the reservoir also differed in all sections and zones on macrophytes of all ecological groups bacillariophyta prevailed in terms of their numbers 70 7 81 5 and biomass 71 3 87 6 chlorophyta 11 4 20 9 of the total numbers and 7 7 22 8 of the total biomass were next to them the third place in terms of numbers in both sections and in terms of biomass in the transit zone of the reservoir was occupied by cyanoprokaryota in the non transit zones the third rank place in terms of biomass was occupied by charophyta it should be noted that in the transit zones of the reservoir the contribution of bacillariophyta and cyanoprokaryota to the total numbers and biomass of epiphyton was higher whereas the contribution of chlorophyta and charophyta was lower than that in the non transit zones table 3 3 7 dimensional structure in various sections and zones of the kanev reservoir differing in hydrodynamic conditions the dimensional structure of epiphyton varied in the non transit zones algal cells were mainly larger for example on submerged plants in the bays of the river section relationship between the average biomass of epiphyton and their numbers accounted for 2 2 whereas in the main riverbed it was 1 6 in the non transit and transit zones of the lake section these values accounted for 1 0 and 0 6 respectively table 2 3 8 dominant complex the dominant complex of epiphyton included 29 algal species with a predominance of bacillariophyta 26 species cyanoprokaryota chlorophyta and charophyta were represented by one species each division only four algal species melosira varians с agardh staurosira construens ehrenb cocconeis placentula ehrenb and oedogonium sp st dominated in all sections and zones of the reservoir table 4 in various sections and zones of the reservoir the dominant complex of epiphyton mainly differed the sørensen coefficient of community similarity was 41 50 3 9 relationship between the indices of epiphyton development and hydrodynamic factors the influence of current velocity on the indices of epiphyton development was studied in the non transit stations 2 3 4 6 7 11 and transit stations 1 5 8 9 10 12 13 zones of the river section of the reservoir fig 1 the studied stations significantly differed in current velocity 0 05 0 10m s in the non transit zone and 0 40 0 60m s in the transit zone as it is evident from table 2 in the non transit zone of the river section of the reservoir on plants of all ecological groups the average number of species in a sample and the average numbers and biomass of epiphyton were higher than those registered in the transit zone for example on submerged plants the average number of species in a sample was higher by 8 species the average numbers of epiphyton were higher by a factor of 3 9 whereas its biomass was one order of magnitude higher than that in the transit zone as a result of the performed correlation analysis it has been found that the number of species in a sample and the numbers and biomass of epiphyton on macrophytes of all ecological groups depended inversely on current velocity in this case the coefficients of correlation varied from 0 57 to 0 84 p 0 05 the influence water level fluctuations on the indices of epiphyton development was studied in the non transit zones of the river stations 2 3 4 6 7 11 and lake stations 16 19 20 21 24 sections of the reservoir fig 1 the studied zones essentially differed in the range water level fluctuations 0 40 0 50m in the river section and 0 02 0 05m in the lake section in the non transit zone of the lake section of the reservoir on plants of all ecological groups the average number of species in a sample and the average numbers and biomass of epiphyton were higher than those registered in the non transit zone of the river section in particular on submerged plants the average number of species in a sample was higher by 8 species the average numbers of epiphyton were higher by a factor of 2 9 whereas its biomass was higher by a factor 1 4 compared to those registered in the non transit zone of the river section table 2 the performed correlation analysis has shown that the number of species in a sample and the numbers and biomass of epiphyton on macrophytes of all ecological groups depended inversely on the range water level fluctuations the coefficients of correlation varied from 0 60 to 0 72 p 0 05 the influence of the intensity of wind driven wave on the indices of epiphyton development was studied in the transit stations 14 15 17 18 22 23 and non transit stations 16 19 20 21 24 zones of the lake section of the reservoir fig 1 the studied stations differed in the intensity of wind driven wave in the open area of water wave height was 0 30 0 40m whereas in the shallow waters 0 05 0 10m as it is evident from table 2 in the non transit zone of the lake section of the reservoir on plants of all ecological groups the average number of species in a sample and the average numbers and biomass of epiphyton were higher than those registered in the transit zone for example on submerged plants the average number of species in a sample was higher by 18 species whereas the average numbers and biomass of epiphyton were one order of magnitude higher than those in the transit zone as a result of the performed correlation analysis it has been found that the number of species in a sample and the numbers and biomass of epiphyton on macrophytes of all ecological groups depended inversely on wave height the coefficients of correlation ranged from 0 59 to 0 90 p 0 05 thus the most favorable conditions to the development of epiphyton were observed in the non transit zone of the lake section of the kanev reservoir where on macrophytes of all ecological groups it was represented by the largest number of species in a sample and characterized by the highest numbers and biomass in the bays of the river section the intensity of epiphyton development was somewhat lower in the main riverbed of the river section and in the transit zone of the lake section intensive hydrodynamics significantly limited the development of epiphyton the main factors inhibiting the development of epiphyton in the main riverbed of the river section include high current velocities conditioned by discharge currents and water level fluctuations in the bays of the river section water level fluctuations whereas in the transit zone of the lake section wind driven wave 4 discussion 4 1 influence of hydrodynamic factors on epiphyton structure as a result of the performed investigations it has been found that hydrodynamic factors significantly influence epiphyton structure including its species richness species composition taxonomic structure dominant complex dimensional structure and its numbers and biomass structure and also the quantitative indices of its development in particular the increase in the intensity of water movement results in the decrease in the species richness of epiphyton in the transit zones of the reservoir in the non transit zones epiphyton was represented by a larger number of species the obtained results correlate well with literature data thus epiphyton species richness and diversity decreased in the sections of the moscow river with a high current velocity and increased in the sections with a low current velocity rusanov and khromov 2016 the number of algal species decreased with increasing water discharge during the period of flood in the danube river ács and kiss 1993 rather low values of the sørensen coefficient of community similarity are indicative of the difference in the species composition and complex of dominants in various sections and zones of the reservoir differing in hydrodynamic conditions the taxonomic structure of epiphyton also differed in the transit zones of the reservoir the contribution of bacillariophyta and cyanoprokaryota to the total number of species was higher whereas the contribution of chlorophyta and charophyta lower than that in the bays and shallow waters it is likely that this phenomenon is conditioned by the fact that moderate water velocity favor the development of chlorophyta and charophyta lugue and martinez de fabricius 2003 at the same time bacillariophyta have morphological characteristics that prevent their detachment and improve their resistance capability in flow fluctuations or during conditions of water movement roldan and ramires 2008 a predominance of representatives of the family desmidiaceae and of the genus cosmarium registered in the bays and shallow waters of the kanev reservoir is typical to the taxonomic structure of epiphyton of small lakes klochenko et al 2012 2013 2014 in this case in the transit zone of the river section the first rank place was occupied by the genus nitzschia whereas in the transit zone of the lake section by the genus navicula literature data rios pulgarin et al 2016 suggest that the genera nitzschia and navicula are tolerant to high hydrological disturbances in different zones of the reservoir the structure of epiphyton numbers and biomass differed in the transit zones the contribution of bacillariophyta and cyanoprokaryota to the total numbers and biomass was higher whereas the contribution of chlorophyta and charophyta for the most part less strongly attached to the substratum and more sensitive to desiccation and thus to water level fluctuations and high current velocities was lower than that in the non transit zones original investigations carried out previously shevchenko 2008 suggest that periphyton algae communities with a predominance of cyanoprokaryota and bacillariophyta tolerant to desiccation and capable of occurring not only in aquatic ecosystems but also beyond them were registered above water edge and in the splash over zone of solid artificial inorganic substrates in this case the communities with a predominance of green filamentous algae were observed only below water edge it has been known that cyanoprokaryota are tolerant to dehydration in this case the ultrastructure of their cells remains unchanged vice versa dehydration of green algae results in irreversible changes in their cells wasser et al 1989 an adverse effect of current on the abundance of green algae in the composition of periphyton was observed in natural watercourses and under conditions of laboratory experiments rusanov et al 2009 ryder et al 2006 the abundance of diatoms strongly attached to the substratum increased whereas the abundance of loosely packed motile diatoms and plankton green algae decreased with increasing water velocity rusanov and khromov 2016 passy 2007 passy and larson 2011 in the transit zones of the kanev reservoir the dimensions of algal cells decreased it has been known that the communities occurring at various current velocities differed in their structure and architecture at low current velocity algal communities are loosely packed whereas the contribution of unattached cells and colonial forms is rather high keithan and lowe 1985 at medium and high current velocities algal species are in a prostrate position and attach more strongly such communities are characterized by a predominance of small sized cells the mucilage content of these communities is greater to aid attachment and counteract drag from the current biggs and smith 2002 biggs et al 2005 passy 2007 raunio and soininen 2007 wunsam et al 2002 rusanov and khromov 2016 the quantitative indices of epiphyton development in the transit zones of the kanev reservoir were lower than those in the non transit zones a decrease in epiphyton biomass with increasing current velocity was observed by other researches rusanov and khromov 2016 lamb and lowe 1987 ryder et al 2006 it has been found that epiphyton biomass depended inversely on current velocity within the range from 2 to 60cm s rusanov and khromov 2016 4 2 influence of hydrodynamic factors on algal communities occurring on the substrates of different types as it was mentioned above high current velocities water level fluctuations and wind driven wave inhibit epiphyton development at the same time original investigations carried out previously shevchenko 2008 suggest that intensive wind and wave influence and significant water level fluctuations stimulated the development of periphyton algae with a predominance of cyanoprokaryota the genus phormidium kütz ex gomont and bacillariophyta occurring in the fouling of solid artificial inorganic substrates on the embankments paved with concrete dams sluice walls and mooring buoys thus in the lake section of the kanev reservoir at wave height of 0 4m the width of the zone formed by the communities of periphyton algae ranged up to 0 3 0 5m whereas in its river section at wave height of 0 1m it was 0 10 0 15m wide on sluice walls at significant water level fluctuations up to 12m periphyton algae formed almost the entire zone up to 5m wide 5 conclusion the performed investigations have shown that the increase in water movement conditioned by high current velocities water level fluctuations and wind driven wave results in the decrease in epiphyton species richness in changes in its species composition taxonomic structure dominant complex dimensional structure and its numbers and biomass structure and also in the decrease in the quantitative indices of its development this can result in the decrease in the amount of the released oxygen and organic matter produced by this community and also in the decrease in the intensity of the utilization of nutrients and accumulation of pollutants as a consequence the role of epiphyton in the processes of water body self purification can sharply decrease at the same time it has been shown that water movement variously influenced algal communities occurring on the substrates of different types significant water level fluctuations and intensive wind and wave inhibited the development of epiphyton on macrophytes of all ecological groups and stimulated the development of periphyton with a predominance of cyanoprokaryota and bacillariophyta occurring on solid artificial inorganic substrates this phenomenon can be considered as compensatory mechanism of homeostasis maintenance due to which aquatic ecosystems are capable of withstanding an adverse effect of the consequences of

1113,the paper deals with the study of the influence of hydrodynamic factors current water level fluctuations and wind driven wave on the structure of epiphyton occurring on macrophytes of various ecological groups in the kanev reservoir the dnieper river ukraine the reservoir is subdivided into the river and lake sections including the transit and non transit zones it has been found that the main factors inhibiting the development of epiphyton in the main riverbed of the river section include high current velocities conditioned by discharge currents and water level fluctuations in the bays of the river section water level fluctuations whereas in the transit zone of the lake section wind driven wave the performed investigations have shown that the increase in water movement conditioned by high current velocities water level fluctuations and wind driven wave results in the decrease in epiphyton species richness in changes in its species composition taxonomic structure dominant complex dimensional structure and its numbers and biomass structure and also in the decrease in the quantitative indices of its development it has been found that the average number of species in a sample and epiphyton numbers and biomass depended inversely on current velocity water level fluctuations and wind driven wave as a consequence the increase in water movement can result in the lower oxygen release and organic matter production by this community and the decrease of nutrient uptake and pollutants accumulation thus limiting the role of epiphyton in water bodies self purification at the same time it has been shown that water movement variously influenced algal communities occurring on the substrates of different types including epiphyton found on macrophytes and periphyton registered on solid artificial inorganic substrates the obtained data can be used in predicting the ecological state of the designed water bodies keywords epiphyton reservoir hydrodynamic factors current water level fluctuations wind driven wave 1 introduction the regulation of rivers and their transformation into the cascade of reservoirs along with beneficial economic effect results in a set of adverse consequences conditioned by changes in their hydrological hydrochemical and hydrobiological regimes thus the study of the response of the biota to such transformations is of considerable importance in this case the study of the structure and functioning of the communities of freshwater algae is of crucial significance with regard to their role in the processes of organic matter production and water quality regulation it has been known that the formation of epiphyton structure depends on many factors including the macrophyte habitat and specific plant architecture

zhang et al 2013 trbojević et al 2017 the strength and form of epiphyton attachment wunsam et al 2002 passy 2007 water chemical composition in macrophyte beds klochenko et al 2014 2015 light intensity bourassa and cattaneo 2000 liboriussen and jeppesen 2003 etc water dynamics are one of the main ecological factors influencing many characteristics of the vital activity of hydrobionts timchenko 2006 among hydrodynamic factors water level fluctuations are of considerable importance coops et al 2003 zębek 2013 rios pulgarin et al 2016 even small changes of water level may result in a large shift in plant communities one example is that of littoral helophyte communities which can be completely dependent on slight water level fluctuations exposing substrate for germination and or flooding seedlings furthermore high water levels in spring may limit submersed plant expansion inducing a shift to a sparsely vegetated state whereas a substantial reduction in spring lake level may encourage expansion of submersed plants coops et al 2003 water level fluctuations and a large movement of the water column affected the substrates and maintained the assemblages of epiphyton in early stages of development rios pulgarin et al 2016 as it was experimentally established asaeda and son 2000 flow velocity is a key factor in epiphyton erosion it has been found wilby et al 1998 špoljar and zhang 2017 that increased flow velocities enhanced macrophyte growth and limited epiphyton development many studies report an inverse relationship between the flow and epiphyton biomass antoine and benson evans 1982 lamb and lowe 1987 ghosh and gaur 1998 asaeda and son 2000 ryder et al 2006 rovira et al 2016 rusanov and khromov 2016 hydrological regime of water bodies influences not only epiphyton biomass but also physiological and biochemical processes in algal cells biggs and hickey 1994 biggs and smith 2002 hondzo and wang 2002 rios pulgarin et al 2016 for example under conditions of laboratory experiments the periphyton growth measured in terms of the chlorophyll a concentrations and its metabolism characterized by dissolved oxygen concentrations measurements were the lowest in a stagnant fluid these indices increased in a moving fluid and decreased under critical conditions corresponding to the detachment of periphyton hondzo and wang 2002 the results of experiments showed no significant differences in gross primary production between two periphyton communities of different biomass but indicated a slightly decreasing trend with increasing velocity in contrast community respiration increased greatly with mat biomass and also as a function of increased water velocity biggs and hickey 1994 despite the fact that a set of publications deals with the study of the influence of hydrodynamics on the vital activity of epiphyton this problem is not clearly understood the objective of the present work was to study the influence of hydrodynamic factors current water level fluctuations and wind driven wave on the structure of epiphyton occurring on macrophytes of various ecological groups in the kanev reservoir 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study site the infracascade kanev reservoir 49 58 n 31 14 e belongs to large plain reservoirs on the dnieper river fig 1 according to ecological and hydrodynamic principles of its zoning timchenko 2010 it is subdivided into the river and lake sections in terms of morphometric characteristics and in terms of a predominance of river and lake hydrological conditions including the transit and non transit zones in terms of the intensity of discharge current the river kiev section of the reservoir is 43km long it includes the main riverbed of the dnieper river 600 800m wide and 8 10m deep and also numerous bays branches and tributaries forming the additional system of the reservoir on the whole the area of the additional system is almost equal to the area of the main riverbed however in the main riverbed water volume is as twice as larger than that in the additional system timchenko 2010 the hydrological regime of the river section of the kanev reservoir depends to a large extent on the operating conditions of the kiev hydro electric power station located upstream of it its releases are responsible for intraday fluctuations of water level up to 1 2m in the non transit zones bays branches etc fluctuations of water level are almost synchronous with those in the main riverbed timchenko and dubnyak 2001 during the period of releases discharge current velocity in the transit zone the main riverbed accounts for 0 3 1 0m s whereas in the non transit zone it is 0 05 0 10m s the intensity of wind driven wave in the river section of the kanev reservoir is insignificant for the most part wave height is not more than 0 1m the lake section of the reservoir is 80km long it includes three stretches the first stretch to 5km wide located near the town of ukrainka is rather shallow mainly to 3m deep it is followed by a rather narrow section about 25km long and 2 3km wide including numerous islands and shallow water zones outside of the shallow water zones this section is 3 8m deep the second stretch is 8km wide and 4 8m deep whereas the third stretch adjacent to the dam of the kanev hydro electric power station is 11km wide and 6 9m deep in the lake section of the kanev reservoir the transit zone is adjacent to the high right bank which is conditioned by the peculiarities of the structure of the drowned dnieper valley rather narrow mainly 30 50m wide shallow waters the hydrodynamics of which entirely depend on the processes occurring in the transit zone have been formed along the high right bank the non transit zone situated along the left bank represents vast from several hundreds meters to 2 3km shallow waters occupied by higher aquatic plants formed mainly on the drowned floodplain and on the terrace of the dnieper river above the floodplain and also in the bays representing tributary estuaries drowned by the reservoir in the lake section of the reservoir discharge current velocity is mainly not more than 0 1 0 3m s wind currents are also registered in this section their velocity is closely similar to that of discharge currents the intraday water level fluctuations are about 0 05m for the most part wave height in the transit zone is not more than 0 40m whereas in the non transit zone 0 10m gidrologiya 1989 2 2 material field observations in the kanev reservoir were carried out in summer 2003 2006 2009 2011 2012 and 2014 at 24 stations fig 1 in the river and lake sections of the reservoir algal samples were taken in the transit and non transit zones on the whole 267 samples were taken and processed 89 and 84 samples in the transit zone of the river and lake sections of the reservoir and 94 samples in the bays and shallow waters of the non transit zone the samples of epiphyton were taken from 19 species of higher aquatic plants

processed following the commonly accepted hydrobiological procedures arsan et al 2006 epiphyton was collected with substratum the fragments of higher aquatic plants were cut with scissors placed into polyethylene bags kept in an ice box and transported to the laboratory under laboratory conditions fouling was washed off the sampled plants with tap water using a special brush the volume of a sample was 50ml some samples were studied in the living state whereas others were fixed by 40 solution of formaldehyde the fragments of higher aquatic plants were dried in the air and than weighted to obtain their dry mass the numbers of algae were determined using a special counting plate in the drop of 0 1ml volume taken using a piston pipette biomass was calculated by the count cell volume method arsan et al 2006 the numbers and biomass of epiphyton were calculated per 1g of air dry mass of plant substratum the species the contribution of which to the total biomass of epiphyton in the sample was 25 were assigned to dominants algal samples were studied at 200 400 and 1000 magnification using a zeiss axio imager a1 microscope the following manuals were used to identify algal taxa komárek and fott

2005 the latin names and the volume of algal taxa are given in accordance with the classification systems tsarenko et al 2006 2015 the species composition of algae found in various sections of the reservoir was compared using the sørensen coefficient of community similarity by the following formula k 2 c a b 100 where a and b are number of species found in each of the compared groups of organisms c is number of common species arsan et al 2006 taxonomic analysis was carried out using the methods accepted for the comparison of floras shmidt 1980 the kendall coefficient of rank correlation was calculated by the following formula τ 2 s n n 1 where s the sum of ranks n the number of pairs of the compared ranks shmidt 1980 hydrodynamic characteristics were determined based on results of field observations carried out following standard hydrological procedures arsan et al 2006 and also based on the data of stationary hydrological observations of the hydrometeorological agency of ukraine water velocity was measured using the gr 21m current meter values more than 0 04m s bykov and vasilyev 1977 at a lower water velocity and also in the beds of higher aquatic plants the pneumatic method was used pikush 1971 this method widely used in performing ecohydrological investigations in various water bodies was elaborated at the institute of hydrobiology of the national academy of sciences of ukraine water level fluctuations conditioned by the releases of the kiev hydro electric power station were measured using the valday water level chart recorder and water level staff arsan et al 2006 the height of waves was measured using wave height pole nastavleniye 1978 investigations were carried out following methodical recommendations given in the guide to hydrological practices guide 1975 to establish relationship between the indices of epiphyton development and hydrodynamic factors correlation analysis was carried out the averaged for two years 2012 and 2014 data on current velocity water level fluctuations and wind driven wave were used the data on the number of species in a sample and on the numbers and biomass of epiphyton were also averaged for each station the same number of samples was averaged at each station six samples including two samples taken from typha angustifolia two samples from nuphar lutea and two samples from potamogeton perfoliatus the obtained data were processed using the ms excel 2010 3 results 3 1 main cenosis forming macrophytes during the period of investigations the most frequent plant species found at all stations of the kanev reservoir were typha angustifolia nuphar lutea and potamogeton perfoliatus in the transit zone of the river section of the reservoir the main cenosis forming plant species were typha angustifolia and potamogeton perfoliatus trapa natans and potamogeton pectinatus prevailed only at same stations in the non transit zone of the river section the dominant complex of macrophytes was represented by nuphar lutea trapa natans typha angustifolia and scirpus lacustris in the transit zone of the lake section of the reservoir the main cenosis forming plant species were typha angustifolia phragmites australis potamogeton perfoliatus and potamogeton pectinatus in the non transit zone of the lake section they included typha angustifolia nuphar lutea and ceratophyllum demersum 3 2 species richness and taxonomic structure on the whole 329 algal species represented by 343 infraspecific taxa including those containing nomenclatural types of species were found in the fouling of higher aquatic plants in the kanev reservoir bacillariophyta chlorophyta and charophyta 82 9 of the total number of species were highly diverse in their species composition table 1 the distribution of epiphyton over different zones of the reservoir was non uniform in the non transit zones the number of their species was higher than that in the transit zones table 1 bacillariophyta and chlorophyta were represented by the largest number of species in all sections and zones of the reservoir in the transit zones the third place was occupied by cyanoprokaryota whereas the fourth place by charophyta in the non transit zones vice versa the third place was occupied by charophyta whereas the fourth place by cyanoprokaryota it should be noted that in the transit zones of both sections of the reservoir the contribution of bacillariophyta and cyanoprokaryota to the total number of species was higher whereas the contribution of chlorophyta and charophyta was lower than that in the non transit zones table 1 at the level of leading families the taxonomic structure of epiphyton differed which is supported by rather low values of the kendall coefficient of rank correlation τ 0 30 0 56 in both sections the first rank place was occupied by the family scenedesmaceae and only in the non transit zone of the lake section by the family desmidiaceae among the leading genera in the transit zone of the river section the first rank place was occupied by the genus nitzschia hass whereas in the transit zone of the lake section by the genus navicula bory in the non transit zones the first rank place was occupied by the genus cosmarium corda ex ralfs the values of the kendall coefficient of rank correlation τ calculated in terms of the leading genera varied from 0 30 to 0 67 3 3 species composition the species composition of epiphyton of the reservoir was closely similar in comparing the main riverbed and the bays of the river section the values of the sørensen coefficient of community similarity accounted for 73 at the same time it was rather similar in comparing other sections of the reservoir the values of the sørensen coefficient of community similarity were 57 60 the taxonomic structure and species composition of epiphyton found in various sections of the kanev reservoir were discussed at greater length in our previous publications tarashchuk et al 2011 klochenko et al 2016 2017 3 4 average number of species in a sample the average number of species of epiphyton in a sample on the main cenosis forming species of higher aquatic plants occurring in various sections and zones of the reservoir differed in this case the largest number of species was found in the non transit zone of the lake section of the reservoir whereas their lowest number in the transit zone of the lake section table 2 3 5 quantitative indices the quantitative indices of epiphyton development in various sections and zones of the reservoir also essentially differed on plants of all ecological groups the lowest numbers and biomass of epiphyton were registered in the transit zones of both sections of the reservoir whereas their highest values in the non transit zone of the lake section of the reservoir table 2 3 6 structure of epiphyton numbers and biomass the structure of epiphyton numbers and biomass in various sections and zones of the reservoir also differed in all sections and zones on macrophytes of all ecological groups bacillariophyta prevailed in terms of their numbers 70 7 81 5 and biomass 71 3 87 6 chlorophyta 11 4 20 9 of the total numbers and 7 7 22 8 of the total biomass were next to them the third place in terms of numbers in both sections and in terms of biomass in the transit zone of the reservoir was occupied by cyanoprokaryota in the non transit zones the third rank place in terms of biomass was occupied by charophyta it should be noted that in the transit zones of the reservoir the contribution of bacillariophyta and cyanoprokaryota to the total numbers and biomass of epiphyton was higher whereas the contribution of chlorophyta and charophyta was lower than that in the non transit zones table 3 3 7 dimensional structure in various sections and zones of the kanev reservoir differing in hydrodynamic conditions the dimensional structure of epiphyton varied in the non transit zones algal cells were mainly larger for example on submerged plants in the bays of the river section relationship between the average biomass of epiphyton and their numbers accounted for 2 2 whereas in the main riverbed it was 1 6 in the non transit and transit zones of the lake section these values accounted for 1 0 and 0 6 respectively table 2 3 8 dominant complex the dominant complex of epiphyton included 29 algal species with a predominance of bacillariophyta 26 species cyanoprokaryota chlorophyta and charophyta were represented by one species each division only four algal species melosira varians с agardh staurosira construens ehrenb cocconeis placentula ehrenb and oedogonium sp st dominated in all sections and zones of the reservoir table 4 in various sections and zones of the reservoir the dominant complex of epiphyton mainly differed the sørensen coefficient of community similarity was 41 50 3 9 relationship between the indices of epiphyton development and hydrodynamic factors the influence of current velocity on the indices of epiphyton development was studied in the non transit stations 2 3 4 6 7 11 and transit stations 1 5 8 9 10 12 13 zones of the river section of the reservoir fig 1 the studied stations significantly differed in current velocity 0 05 0 10m s in the non transit zone and 0 40 0 60m s in the transit zone as it is evident from table 2 in the non transit zone of the river section of the reservoir on plants of all ecological groups the average number of species in a sample and the average numbers and biomass of epiphyton were higher than those registered in the transit zone for example on submerged plants the average number of species in a sample was higher by 8 species the average numbers of epiphyton were higher by a factor of 3 9 whereas its biomass was one order of magnitude higher than that in the transit zone as a result of the performed correlation analysis it has been found that the number of species in a sample and the numbers and biomass of epiphyton on macrophytes of all ecological groups depended inversely on current velocity in this case the coefficients of correlation varied from 0 57 to 0 84 p 0 05 the influence water level fluctuations on the indices of epiphyton development was studied in the non transit zones of the river stations 2 3 4 6 7 11 and lake stations 16 19 20 21 24 sections of the reservoir fig 1 the studied zones essentially differed in the range water level fluctuations 0 40 0 50m in the river section and 0 02 0 05m in the lake section in the non transit zone of the lake section of the reservoir on plants of all ecological groups the average number of species in a sample and the average numbers and biomass of epiphyton were higher than those registered in the non transit zone of the river section in particular on submerged plants the average number of species in a sample was higher by 8 species the average numbers of epiphyton were higher by a factor of 2 9 whereas its biomass was higher by a factor 1 4 compared to those registered in the non transit zone of the river section table 2 the performed correlation analysis has shown that the number of species in a sample and the numbers and biomass of epiphyton on macrophytes of all ecological groups depended inversely on the range water level fluctuations the coefficients of correlation varied from 0 60 to 0 72 p 0 05 the influence of the intensity of wind driven wave on the indices of epiphyton development was studied in the transit stations 14 15 17 18 22 23 and non transit stations 16 19 20 21 24 zones of the lake section of the reservoir fig 1 the studied stations differed in the intensity of wind driven wave in the open area of water wave height was 0 30 0 40m whereas in the shallow waters 0 05 0 10m as it is evident from table 2 in the non transit zone of the lake section of the reservoir on plants of all ecological groups the average number of species in a sample and the average numbers and biomass of epiphyton were higher than those registered in the transit zone for example on submerged plants the average number of species in a sample was higher by 18 species whereas the average numbers and biomass of epiphyton were one order of magnitude higher than those in the transit zone as a result of the performed correlation analysis it has been found that the number of species in a sample and the numbers and biomass of epiphyton on macrophytes of all ecological groups depended inversely on wave height the coefficients of correlation ranged from 0 59 to 0 90 p 0 05 thus the most favorable conditions to the development of epiphyton were observed in the non transit zone of the lake section of the kanev reservoir where on macrophytes of all ecological groups it was represented by the largest number of species in a sample and characterized by the highest numbers and biomass in the bays of the river section the intensity of epiphyton development was somewhat lower in the main riverbed of the river section and in the transit zone of the lake section intensive hydrodynamics significantly limited the development of epiphyton the main factors inhibiting the development of epiphyton in the main riverbed of the river section include high current velocities conditioned by discharge currents and water level fluctuations in the bays of the river section water level fluctuations whereas in the transit zone of the lake section wind driven wave 4 discussion 4 1 influence of hydrodynamic factors on epiphyton structure as a result of the performed investigations it has been found that hydrodynamic factors significantly influence epiphyton structure including its species richness species composition taxonomic structure dominant complex dimensional structure and its numbers and biomass structure and also the quantitative indices of its development in particular the increase in the intensity of water movement results in the decrease in the species richness of epiphyton in the transit zones of the reservoir in the non transit zones epiphyton was represented by a larger number of species the obtained results correlate well with literature data thus epiphyton species richness and diversity decreased in the sections of the moscow river with a high current velocity and increased in the sections with a low current velocity rusanov and khromov 2016 the number of algal species decreased with increasing water discharge during the period of flood in the danube river ács and kiss 1993 rather low values of the sørensen coefficient of community similarity are indicative of the difference in the species composition and complex of dominants in various sections and zones of the reservoir differing in hydrodynamic conditions the taxonomic structure of epiphyton also differed in the transit zones of the reservoir the contribution of bacillariophyta and cyanoprokaryota to the total number of species was higher whereas the contribution of chlorophyta and charophyta lower than that in the bays and shallow waters it is likely that this phenomenon is conditioned by the fact that moderate water velocity favor the development of chlorophyta and charophyta lugue and martinez de fabricius 2003 at the same time bacillariophyta have morphological characteristics that prevent their detachment and improve their resistance capability in flow fluctuations or during conditions of water movement roldan and ramires 2008 a predominance of representatives of the family desmidiaceae and of the genus cosmarium registered in the bays and shallow waters of the kanev reservoir is typical to the taxonomic structure of epiphyton of small lakes klochenko et al 2012 2013 2014 in this case in the transit zone of the river section the first rank place was occupied by the genus nitzschia whereas in the transit zone of the lake section by the genus navicula literature data rios pulgarin et al 2016 suggest that the genera nitzschia and navicula are tolerant to high hydrological disturbances in different zones of the reservoir the structure of epiphyton numbers and biomass differed in the transit zones the contribution of bacillariophyta and cyanoprokaryota to the total numbers and biomass was higher whereas the contribution of chlorophyta and charophyta for the most part less strongly attached to the substratum and more sensitive to desiccation and thus to water level fluctuations and high current velocities was lower than that in the non transit zones original investigations carried out previously shevchenko 2008 suggest that periphyton algae communities with a predominance of cyanoprokaryota and bacillariophyta tolerant to desiccation and capable of occurring not only in aquatic ecosystems but also beyond them were registered above water edge and in the splash over zone of solid artificial inorganic substrates in this case the communities with a predominance of green filamentous algae were observed only below water edge it has been known that cyanoprokaryota are tolerant to dehydration in this case the ultrastructure of their cells remains unchanged vice versa dehydration of green algae results in irreversible changes in their cells wasser et al 1989 an adverse effect of current on the abundance of green algae in the composition of periphyton was observed in natural watercourses and under conditions of laboratory experiments rusanov et al 2009 ryder et al 2006 the abundance of diatoms strongly attached to the substratum increased whereas the abundance of loosely packed motile diatoms and plankton green algae decreased with increasing water velocity rusanov and khromov 2016 passy 2007 passy and larson 2011 in the transit zones of the kanev reservoir the dimensions of algal cells decreased it has been known that the communities occurring at various current velocities differed in their structure and architecture at low current velocity algal communities are loosely packed whereas the contribution of unattached cells and colonial forms is rather high keithan and lowe 1985 at medium and high current velocities algal species are in a prostrate position and attach more strongly such communities are characterized by a predominance of small sized cells the mucilage content of these communities is greater to aid attachment and counteract drag from the current biggs and smith 2002 biggs et al 2005 passy 2007 raunio and soininen 2007 wunsam et al 2002 rusanov and khromov 2016 the quantitative indices of epiphyton development in the transit zones of the kanev reservoir were lower than those in the non transit zones a decrease in epiphyton biomass with increasing current velocity was observed by other researches rusanov and khromov 2016 lamb and lowe 1987 ryder et al 2006 it has been found that epiphyton biomass depended inversely on current velocity within the range from 2 to 60cm s rusanov and khromov 2016 4 2 influence of hydrodynamic factors on algal communities occurring on the substrates of different types as it was mentioned above high current velocities water level fluctuations and wind driven wave inhibit epiphyton development at the same time original investigations carried out previously shevchenko 2008 suggest that intensive wind and wave influence and significant water level fluctuations stimulated the development of periphyton algae with a predominance of cyanoprokaryota the genus phormidium kütz ex gomont and bacillariophyta occurring in the fouling of solid artificial inorganic substrates on the embankments paved with concrete dams sluice walls and mooring buoys thus in the lake section of the kanev reservoir at wave height of 0 4m the width of the zone formed by the communities of periphyton algae ranged up to 0 3 0 5m whereas in its river section at wave height of 0 1m it was 0 10 0 15m wide on sluice walls at significant water level fluctuations up to 12m periphyton algae formed almost the entire zone up to 5m wide 5 conclusion the performed investigations have shown that the increase in water movement conditioned by high current velocities water level fluctuations and wind driven wave results in the decrease in epiphyton species richness in changes in its species composition taxonomic structure dominant complex dimensional structure and its numbers and biomass structure and also in the decrease in the quantitative indices of its development this can result in the decrease in the amount of the released oxygen and organic matter produced by this community and also in the decrease in the intensity of the utilization of nutrients and accumulation of pollutants as a consequence the role of epiphyton in the processes of water body self purification can sharply decrease at the same time it has been shown that water movement variously influenced algal communities occurring on the substrates of different types significant water level fluctuations and intensive wind and wave inhibited the development of epiphyton on macrophytes of all ecological groups and stimulated the development of periphyton with a predominance of cyanoprokaryota and bacillariophyta occurring on solid artificial inorganic substrates this phenomenon can be considered as compensatory mechanism of homeostasis maintenance due to which aquatic ecosystems are capable of withstanding an adverse effect of the consequences of

1114,up to now only a fraction of all living organisms in the world has been identified organisms are identified using morphological characteristics which is laborious and requires specialized knowledge barcoding dna helps to solve the limitations of traditional species identification the nucleotide sequence obtained using specific primers is presented in the form of a strip resembling a bar code which allows comparing and distinguishing species the standard sequence used for the barcoding of almost all animal groups is derived from the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase gene cox1 for fungi cox1 and its internal transcribed spacers were proposed as barcodes in contrast the world of plants does not have a single standard sequence for identifying species the ideal marker should consist of a highly variable region enabling species discrimination and be flanked by highly conserved regions allowing universal primer design for the dna barcodes standardization this paper describes the markers used to identify eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms their properties advantages and disadvantages and the proposed standard dna barcodes this work focuses on microalgae and macroalgae which are of great ecological importance and are widely used in food pharmaceutical or energy industries where they fast correct and reliable identification is crucial keywords dna barcoding algae taxonomy biodiversity 1 introduction diversity of life is the base of all biological research in fact up to now only a fraction of all living organisms number of which is hotly debated e g hammond 1992 hebert et al 2003 guiry 2012 mann and vanormelingen 2013 in the world has been identified identification of species has four important limitations first both the phenotypic plasticity and the genetic variation used to identify species may lead to incorrect identifications second putatively cryptic taxa are common in many groups knowlton 1993 third morphological keys are often effective at a particular stage of life or sex only thus many individuals cannot be identified finally the use of keys often requires a high level of expertise and there are cases where they can still be misinterpreted limitations associated with morphological species determination led to the need for a new approach in the identification of organisms problems with morphological taxonomy were enough to start developing dna based identification systems the number of cases in which such systems are used is continually increasing brown et al 1999 the genomic approach to taxonomic diagnosis uses diversity within dna sequences to identify organisms kurtzman 1994 wilson 1995 this paper describes the markers used to identify plant organisms their properties advantages and disadvantages and the proposed standard dna barcodes for photosynthetic organisms this work focuses on microalgae and macroalgae which are of great ecological importance in aquatic environments and are widely used in food pharmaceutical or energy industries 2 barcoding dna as a tool for describing biodiversity in 2003 hebert proposed barcoding dna as a way of identifying species in barcoding a short genetic sequence from the standard part of the genome is used to mark an organism barcoding dna helps to solve the limitations of traditional species identification this does not mean that traditional taxonomy has become less important on the contrary dna barcoding has become for taxonomists a new tool complementing their knowledge and an innovative device for non experts who need to quickly identify the organism species identification by barcode dna starts from the specimen samples can be taken from various sources e g strains from collections of various institutions sediments or water samples in the laboratory small fragments of thallus or just a several cells of microorganisms are used to isolate dna the barcode region is amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr and then sequenced the obtained sequence is a representation of a unique species specific serious of four nucleotides i e adenine cytosine guanine thymine denoted by a series of letters acgt respectively fig 1 the use of dna barcodes to describe life has not been without criticism mallet and willmott 2003 for example were concerned that differences in dna sequences between closely related species were not sufficient to enable their identification other researchers worried that with barcoding dna potentially replacing traditional taxonomic practice new species could never be formally described robba et al 2006 the dna barcoding posed a number of other problems a serious limitation of the usefulness of barcoding as a molecular diagnostics is the human error and uncertainty in the creation of reference libraries collins and cruickshank 2013 the idea of creating such libraries is the ability to identify unknown species using existing sequences of previously marked taxa contrary to these arguments dna barcode designs have already achieved positive results and brought benefits to ecologists conservationists and diverse agencies committed to control the use of pests food safety and monitor the occurrence of invasive species hebert and gregory 2005 robba et al 2006 furthermore hebert et al 2003 also emphasized that dna barcoding in conjunction with traditional taxonomy is a valuable tool in revealing hidden diversity only a few areas of the genome are considered to be suitable for the use as dna barcodes there are several requirements for selecting the appropriate dna markers firstly low intra specific nucleotide variation less than 2 and high variability among species mirek et al 2007 secondly and equally important the marker should be universally reproducible for different taxa which means that there should be a high success of amplification and sequencing preferably with a universal set of pcr primers taking into account sanger sequencing technique it is also desirable that the dna barcode tag should be short enough to be sequenced in a single reading 700bp longer fragments may also be sequenced but this requires more financial effort as well as time and work markers that may have microsatellite or regions rich in long repeats of or one or two base pairs are not beneficial because they cause problems with direct pcr product sequencing pečnikar and buzan 2014 a good marker should contain a small number of insertions and or deletions these mutations impede the alignment of sequences obtained from different organisms and in genetic analysis are generally not regarded as diagnostic nucleotide substitutions are preferred however kress and erickson 2007 rejected this requirement by stating that dna barcodes are intended for species identification not for phylogenetic analyses any mutation whether it is insertion or deletion or substitution is a feature of the organism and is equally good if it allows for identification mirek et al 2007 furthermore the ideal marker should consist of a highly variable region that provides enough information for species discrimination and be flanked by highly conserved regions which allow universal primer design as well as dna barcodes standardization it should also appear in the genome in a large number of copies which is of great importance when it comes to working with small thallus fragments or with fossil material the greater the number of copies of the target sequence in the genome the greater the chance that some of them have survived intact pečnikar and buzan 2014 3 markers used to identify algae the standard sequence used for barcoding of almost all animal groups was derived from the gene 5 fragment of cytochrome c oxidase subunit i of mtdna cox1 hebert et al 2003 for fungi cox1 and nuclear its sequences internal transcribed spacers were proposed as barcodes in contrast the world of photosynthetic organisms does not have a single standard dna fragment for species identification it is estimated that in the world there are over 72 500 species of algae while only 44 000 of them have been described guiry 2012 fig 2 there are still many undiscovered species so a new system of identification is needed to make the description of algae more efficient currently intensive research is conducted on the identification of algae and vascular plants the work continues on the selection of molecular markers that will be successfully used in a wide spectrum of organisms for dna barcoding plant working group deals with the development of a standard for the description of plant dna barcodes the standard cox1 sequence for animals shows insufficient variation in vascular plants kress et al 2005 but can be used for some algal groups it has been successfully applied in red algae research saunders 2005 robba et al 2006 le gall and saunders 2010 saunders and kucera 2010 while for green algae it has shown insufficient amplification outcome hall et al 2010 saunders and kucera 2010 the mitochondrial dna mtdna of plants is also not suitable source of barcodes because of frequent rearrangements and gene replacements with the nuclear genome hebert et al 2003 the genes of nuclear dna ndna which are being present in very low copy number may cause difficulties in sequencing of degraded dna regarding the above mentioned reasons researchers began to use chloroplast dna cpdna which is present in plant cells in multiple copies this type of dna consists of both low variability coding and much more variable non coding parts at the current state of knowledge it is not possible to indicate the ideal dna barcode sequence in any of the plant genomes ndna cpdna mtdna thus it is necessary to use several less variable sequences forming a dna barcode kress et al 2005 one universal sequence which could enable establishing of a single sequence dna barcode system seems to be not possible it is also argued that the use of several target sequences may not be sufficient for the identification of all photosynthetic organisms therefore it is expected that in the case of particular taxonomic groups occupying different phylogenetic positions dna barcoding will operate on different standard sequences mirek et al 2007 in 2006 newmaster and his colleagues proposed to identify organisms based on two sequences the first sequence would allow classifying an organism into a systematically higher unit while the second one would enable species identification within the higher systematic unit to which an object has been included by means of the primary sequence kress and erickson 2007 further developed this idea by evaluating sequences that could potentially be used as the barcode of plant dna through the prism of two criteria universality of amplification and the ability to differentiate genres regarding macroalgae cox1 dna region was proposed as the main primary marker for brown and red algae whereas tufa elongation factor as the main marker of green algae kress and erickson 2012 as the secondary marker lsu d2 d3 region of the large ribosomal subunit was chosen as it has been proven to be effective in estimating the phylogenetic relationship of organisms at interspecific and intraspecific level kress and erickson 2007 2012 armeli minicante et al 2014 so far most of the molecular research on algae has used a fairly limited range of markers such as rbcl plastid rubisco large subunit its mitochondrial cox2 3 or ribosomal and nuclear dna provan et al 2004 chase et al 2007 the lack of available markers was particularly problematic in the study of species variations and overall there is still a need for universal markers that can be used for a wide range of species provan et al 2004 mirek et al 2007 4 sequencing methods initially in order to identify the organism using the dna barcoding sequencing of the obtained material was performed using the sanger method 1977 in the last decade various studies have been carried out to develop alternative approaches for biodiversity assessment using methods based on dna sequences such as molecular phylogenetics and dna barcoding hajibabaei et al 2011 continuous development and linking of dna reference libraries will provide a database for a dna based identification system the application of new generation sequencing ngs methods in biodiversity science may further extend the use of dna information for biomonitoring at an unprecedented scale ngs technologies are characterized by enormous bandwidth which significantly reduces the cost of reading the nucleotide sequence in comparison with the standard sanger method shokralla et al 2012 heather and chain 2016 analysis of edna environmental e environment using dna barcodes is a key application for ngs sequencing in ecological research parallel access to huge amounts of sequences as well as subsequent improvements in reading the length and bandwidth of various sequential platforms have led to a wider representation biodiversity of the environmental samples tested the latest achievements of nanotechnology allow direct reading of sequences from a single molecule sequencing sms without the need for its amplification third generation sequencing mikheyev and tin 2014 oxford nanopore minion is the first portable ngs platform this pocket sized device allows to obtain sequences anywhere requiring only a connection to a laptop other benefits include low cost and real time data production jain et al 2016 portable genomics have enormous potential and can allow dna barcoding in the field hollingsworth et al 2016 new technologies are growing rapidly and have the potential to radically extend environmental research and thus our knowledge of the environmental taberler et al 2012 5 reference databases one of the most important elements of the dna barcoding initiative is to establish a public reference library containing taxa identifiers that can be used to assign unknown individuals to known species currently there are two main databases containing dna barcoding sequences that fulfill this role i e bold and genbank however regarding reference sequences for algae and more specifically diatoms one of the most important databases is r syst diatom the genbank reference database contains more than 200 million sequences from different organisms collected mainly through the direct deposition submission of sequences by individual laboratories originating from large scale sequencing projects including those related to whole genomes and those from nucleotide archive and japan data bank makes the content of the database available worldwide costa and carvalho 2007 benson et al 2018 genbank can be accessed via the ncbi database national environmental sampling benson et al 2018 daily data exchange with the european nuclecenter for biotechnology information which integrates data from all major dna and protein databases including taxonomy genomes mapping and protein structure information pruitt et al 2008 as well as biomedical literature via pubmed the blast algorithm provides search for sequence similarity in genbank and other databases ncbi also offers a wide range of search and analysis services based on genbank data sharma et al 2018 the genbank database and associated resources are freely available on the ncbi home page benson et al 2018 every year more and more reference sequences are coming up as demonstrated by the benson study 1994 2018 data from 1994 indicates that the genbank database contained 182 753 sequences while the data from 2018 show a significant increase to more than 200 million sequences the more information is gathered the faster and more credible the interpretation of the obtained results will be information systems such as bold barcode of life database support the acquisition storage analysis and publication of dna barcode records strugnell and lindgren 2007 bold is mining dna barcodes from genbank this program provides an integrated bioinformatic platform that supports all stages of the analytical path from sampling to a strictly verified barcode library stoeckle and hebert 2008 bold is freely available to any researcher interested in dna barcoding and contains more than 6 million dna barcode sequences providing specialized services it facilitates the compilation of records that meet the standards required to obtain a dna barcode in global sequence databases costa and carvalho 2007 owning to its online data delivery system bold can support projects involving extensive research initiatives ratnasingham and hebert 2007 reference barcode database for diatoms r syst diatom developed within the framework of r syst the network of systematic supported by inra french national institute for agricultural research rimet et al 2016 r syst diatom is used to identify barcodes from natural samples the data comes from two sources a culture collection of freshwater algae maintained in inra in which new strains are regularly deposited and codified and from the ncbi nucleotide database two molecular markers were selected for database support 18s and rbcl due to their effectiveness rimet et al 2016 vasselon et al 2017 data are developed using innovative and classic bioinformatic tools blast classic phylogenesis and current taxonomy rimet et al 2016 6 dna qua net project in the fast changing world and progressing destruction of the natural environment protection preservation and restoration of aquatic ecosystems and their functions are of crucial importance for european countries those actions have become legally binding mainly through the eu water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec and the marine strategy framework directive 2008 56 ec leese et al 2016 the current approach to the assessment and monitoring of biodiversity is based on morphological taxonomy this approach has many disadvantages but the key is the possibility of making an error by an analyst leese et al 2018 new genomic tools may bypass imperfections of morphological identifications and be complementary to traditional biomonitoring methods however there are many various approaches that are independently developed in different institutions preventing their universal application and for that reason the dna qua net project was created the aim of this project is to determine gold standard genomic tools and new eco genomic indicators that can be utilized in the assessment of biodiversity and in biomonitoring of european water reservoirs researchers have been working on the development and use of markers among else for algae which are a very important group used in bioindication and biomonitoring of the aquatic environment furthermore this project is also to provide a platform for training of future researchers together with water managers politicians and other interested parties a conceptual framework for the use of eco genomic tools is being developed for their subsequent implementation as a part of legally binding assessments leese et al 2016 lefrançois et al 2018 7 problems with algae identification microalgae include very diverse groups of organisms from single celled forms to complex multicellular forms occurring commonly in the marine environment around the world microalgae are among the main primary producers in the marine environment robba et al 2006 new species are being discovered every year and molecular research has discovered many cryptic species and unexpected phylogenetic connections hall et al 2010 identification of microalgae is problematic due to the fact that many species do not have obvious structural features and some traits may differ between the same taxa typically taxonomic diagnosis was made by electron microscopy hall et al 2010 however many groups contain taxa that have not yet been described and the exact number of species remains undetermined this is because they are extremely difficult to identify and classify solely on the basis of morphological characteristics their morphology can be extremely variable within and between species and characteristic features that allow for easy identification are often lacking provan et al 2004 in addition convergent morphology is common and often conceals mysterious species that have only just been revealed on the basis of molecular data mirek et al 2007 in the case of microalgae barcoding dna has been tested on several molecular markers each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages table 1 due to the use of diatoms in the bioindication of the environment and biological research or industry where it is necessary to determine their exact taxonomy they are a very important group in the aquatic environment in the case of diatoms barcoding dna has been tested on several molecular markers e g evans et al 2007 moniz and kaczmarska 2010 pniewski et al 2010 zimmermann et al 2011 there are three main problems here first of all the diversity of diatoms is unknown mann and vanormelingen 2013 rimet et al 2016 secondly identification has become increasingly difficult because existing taxonomic aids are obsolete by new discoveries thirdly contrary to the long standing belief that all taxa are cosmopolitan vyverman et al 2007 kooistra et al 2008 they may have biogeography the traditional taxonomic diagnosis of diatoms was based on their morphological characteristics but exclusive reliance on these traits may lead to erroneous determination of the taxon due to the widespread cryptic species in this group evans et al 2007 identifying macroalgae is also very difficult due to the fact that macroalgae show a very simple morphology and a certain degree of phenotypic plasticity which is influenced by environmental conditions age of the thallus and life style armeli minicante et al 2014 macroalgae were differentiated mainly based on gametangia positions and the mezosporous membrane ornamentation hall et al 2010 moreover the occurrence of cryptic taxa makes identification difficult only on the basis of morphological features therefore communities from the mediterranean were largely underestimated due to the presence of genetically different but morphologically similar species for this reason taxonomists are increasingly using molecular tools to identify individuals discover species and other related taxonomic tasks armeli minicante et al 2014 in case of macroalgae barcoding dna has been tested on several molecular markers table 2 8 cox1 and cox2 3 for algae the mitochondrial intergenic spacer between the cytochrome oxidase subunits 2 and 3 cox2 3 amplified by primers designed by zuccarello et al 1999 is a potentially universal marker of non coding dna the 300 350 bp sequence was found to be useful in many systematic and phytogeographic studies of red algae provan et al 2004 however the success of sequencing and amplification of the cox1 marker in comparison to the others used for the molecular identification of red algae turned out to be fairly small sherwood et al 2014 in the case of biodiversity research where the red algae strains must be successfully amplified and sequenced the cox1 marker should be supplemented with additional markers as for the usefulness of the cox1 marker for the identification of green algae its amplification has not been effective in most of taxa the marker is difficult to amplify in green algae due to the fact that this gene contains several introns which exact number and positions are not known in many species moniz and kaczmarska 2009 for diatoms cox1 is variable enough to distinguish between previously identified taxa to reveal potentially cryptic species and it may work in some cases as a geographical marker evans et al 2007 mann et al 2010 for some species cox1 can provide useful information on the structure of the population or racial differences according to evans et al 2007 cox1 has a higher degree of variation than other markers used in research on diatom biodiversity rbcl its 18s on the other hand the evolution of the mitochondrial genomes of algae is unclear evans et al 2007 it can also pose major problems in amplification and sequencing moniz and kaczmarska 2009 mann et al 2010 therefore it seems that cox1 may be valuable only in special cases such as for example sellaphora unless the problem of the universality of this marker is solved in the future the main disadvantage of cox1 is the current absence of universal amplification primers original primers for algae are successful in some groups but show mixed results in other lines which may result from heterogeneity within the species at positions near the 3 end of the primers clarkston and saunders 2010 the sequence of cox1 due to the lack of sufficient information for different groups of macroalgae in a data bank requires additional use of another marker to assign the organisms to the specific species manghisi et al 2010 studies have confirmed the effectiveness of the cox1 marker in the differentiation of closely related species belonging to different families of brown and red algae mcdevit and saunders 2009 saunders 2005 9 tufa the cox1 and tufa markers are often used to identify macroalgae and they can be very successful in delineation of new species as shown by armeli minicante et al 2014 who described two new species ulva ohnoi and pyropia yezoensis occurring on the sicilian coast both markers showed great power to differentiate closely related species and the success of the amplification was satisfactory the tufa marker is characterized by high universality and ease of amplification hall et al 2010 it is moderately variable and it may pose challenges in some lines where the gene is encoded in the nucleus hall et al 2010 the tufa gene was probably transferred to the nucleus after separation of the main classes of green algae as they all seem to have at least the remainder of the gene in their cpdna but before the emergence of terrestrial plants which are lacking tufa in their chloroplast genome if this is the case then the transfer must have occurred in the line leading to terrestrial plants charophyceae baldauf et al 1990 it may results in the appearance of paralogs paralogs are genes created by duplication within a genome and may evolve new functions which may complicate the identification of species in some lines hall et al 2010 nevertheless the marker appears to be promising at the species level in chlorophytes saunders and kucera 2010 10 ribosomal rna genes there is no doubt that molecular techniques have radically changed the face of phycological research especially in the field of biodiversity and systematics mirek et al 2007 in the early years the researchers concentrated strongly on two commonly used markers i e rbcl freshwater et al 1994 chase et al 2007 and a small rdna subunit ragan et al 1994 harper and saunders 2001 sequencing of ribosomal rna genes rdna has been used as a standard in microbial ecology to describe the structure and diversity of their population the most commonly used gene is the small ribosomal subunit ssu 16s for bacteria and 18s for eukaryotes unfortunately the slow evolution of 18s does not allow distinguishing of closely related species evans et al 2007 however the large ribosomal subunit lsu gene 23s for bacteria and 28s for eukaryotes may also be used to determine phylogeny and taxonomy of studied taxa gutell et al 1994 harper and saunders 2001 sherwood and presting 2007 lsu genes potentially encode more phylogenetic information due to greater length and sequence variability gutell et al 1994 another advantage of lsu sequences is its greater database representation about 2 1 compared to ssu genes gutell et al 1994 the tested lsu markers have shown great success in amplification and sequencing in the case of red algae but due to the more conservative nature they are not sufficient to distinguish closely related species which is crucial for barcoding dna sherwood et al 2010 hall in his research 2010 tested the utility of various markers in the identification of algae from the chlorophyceae cluster including the plastid 23s rdna upa also 18s rbcl its1 its2 and cox1 these studies suggest that 18s is not the best choice when it comes to creating a dna barcode because the region is not sufficiently variable similar conclusions were drawn by moniz and kaczmarska 2009 who investigated the possibility of using 18s as a barcode in diatoms 18s is less variable than rbcl and cox1 and is relatively rarely used as a diatom dna barcode mann et al 2010 however according to zimmermann et al 2011 the subregion of 18s rdna v4 turned out to be a good candidate for a diatom dna barcoding it exhibits sufficient variability to differentiate organisms in environmental trials and shows very high amplification success however in the case of cryptic species it still shows insufficient variability therefore it has been postulated that it should be supplemented with additional markers zimmermann et al 2011 in case of macroalgae the lsu d2 d3 region gives very good results in terms of universality ease of amplification and discriminating power the resulting sequence quality is satisfactory kress and erickson 2012 however when it comes to green algae pcr amplification caused problems saunders and kucera 2010 these problems could result from the high frequency of introns within the green algae in addition the presence and amplification of contaminations in the samples is an additional explanation of the encountered difficulties van oppen et al 1993 bhattacharya et al 1996 saunders and kucera 2010 further development of primers can solve the problem with poor amplification efficiency saunders and kucera 2010 11 upa a universal dna barcode for the identification of photosynthetic organisms was recently proposed sherwood and presting 2007 used the plastid 23s rdna gene upa universal amplicon as a universal algal marker claiming that a single pair of primers could discover sequences from a wide taxonomic range of photosynthetic organisms including higher plants diatoms green algae brown algae red algae and even cyanobacteria this marker has been used in biodiversity research of natural algal communities both benthic and planktonic and the distribution of species indeed in 2014 sherwood and colleagues based on the 23s rdna markers conducted research on the identification of algae in the koolau mountain range in hawaii the marker has also been successfully used to evaluate the distribution of algae and macrophytes wallace et al 2015 in addition the tested marker was also used to identify species present in fossil sludge also with good results hou et al 2014 the upa marker showed great success of amplification and sequencing in the case of red algae also but due to the more conservative nature it was not sufficient to distinguish closely related species which is crucial for barcoding dna sherwood et al 2010 the upa marker was also used in studies on the spread of species in the coast region of brazil the review of species based on the analysis of molecular marker sequences and supported with morphology revealed the occurrence of five different taxa in the pyropia genus milstein et al 2015 the specificity of upa universal primers is undoubtedly influenced by the origin of plastids sherwood and presting 2007 this marker has a very high amplification success for different groups of micro and macroalgae due to its universality it is more often used in research on plant communities algae used in industry or bioindication hou et al 2014 milstein et al 2015 wallace et al 2015 although upa had a relatively high success in pcr amplification it turned out that some of the samples were contaminated or the resulting sequences were not of satisfactory quality it is possible that the epiphytic or endophytic contaminations present in the samples were preferentially or simultaneously amplified with the target organism for one of the following reasons the upa primers matched the contaminations better than the target organism or the dna extraction was more effective for contaminations than for the target organism markers with highly universal primers such as upa are particularly susceptible to these problems and effective isolation of target dna becomes extremely important saunders and kucera 2010 however the possibility remains that the upa may not have a differentiating power among closely related species which may lead to underestimation of diversity and although this has not been observed yet this is an attribute that requires further research for upa as a potential marker for dna barcoding clarkston and saunders 2010 the usability of the 23s rdna gene is potentially limited due to the relatively small amount of information in the databases their constraints are likely to fall sharply with increasing genomic sequencing particularly given the interest in using algae for biofuel production grossman 2007 therefore the ability to use 23s rdna gene sequencing to describe complex algal groups should grow rapidly this increase will occur with the development of descriptions of genetic diversity of algae 12 its most phytogeographic studies used internal transcribed spacer its a non coding domain located between the small and large ribosome subunit the popularity of the its region can be attributed to its relatively high nucleotide substitution rate which allows comparisons of relatively recent divergent taxa in addition the its region can be readily amplified by pcr and sequenced with conservative primers however many earlier studies used a set of primers published by white et al 1990 for fungi that frequently amplified false algae sequences provan et al 2004 plant working group excluded this sequence as a standard dna barcode in view of possibility of multiple copies of this domain in one organism and the uncertainty in its evolution mirek et al 2007 its was also proposed as a barcode for algae and terrestrial plants and was widely used in phylogenetics of green algae species the its1 and its2 markers are sufficiently variable to differentiate the strains of algae within species evans et al 2007 hall et al 2010 mann et al 2010 moniz and kaczmarska 2010 the success of sequencing and amplification is low for the its marker in green algae while for other taxonomic groups the universality of primers has been more successful in contrast to the 18s its is highly variable and is often chosen for intra population diatom studies however direct sequencing of its was not possible in several species including nitzschia achnanthes eunotia navicula pseudo nitzschia and sellaphora mann et al 2010 furthermore matching the rdna sequence is not straightforward and becomes increasingly difficult because there are many copies of its sequences in plant genomes it is questionable whether the sequence obtained by pcr would be stable and representative gao et al 2010 the main problem is that its alignment can be reach with insertion deletions therefore the alignment of variably fragments can be highly biased multiple or banded pcr products are often obtained which makes sequencing impossible it is likely that these primers strengthen contaminating organisms leading to a multiband or banded pcr product saunders and kucera 2010 however when the dna barcodes are used to discover the species and for identification which is desirable given the current state of the taxonomy of diatoms the question of sequences alignment is an important practical matter mann et al 2010 13 rbcl region of genes between the large and small subunits of rubisco rbcl rbcs spacer is widely used in molecular studies of algae red green and brown algae brodie et al 1998 the protein coding for the plastid gene rbcl was proposed as a potential barcode of dna for plant organisms by many researchers usually combined with one or more other markers chase et al 2007 one of the advantages of this region is the rich library of information chase et al 2007 this sequence allows for a high probability of placing the examined organism into the genus or family kress and erickson 2007 the rbcl marker is sufficiently variable to differentiate the strains of green algae within species however according to hall et al 2010 it is not enough to identify all tested strains furthermore if rbcl is chosen as the preferred marker used in diatom dna barcoding or any other plastid marker whose function is to code the proteins involved in photosynthesis it will not work for species that lack a functional plastid and are obligatory heterotrophs such as nitzschia alba mann et al 2010 the usefulness of rbcl as a barcode dna was the basis for several taxonomic and phylogenetic studies in marine macroalgae hommersand et al 1994 wang et al 2010 saunders and kucera 2010 du et al 2014 unfortunately the presence of introns in the rbcl of some marine species may negatively affect the universality of rbcl as a barcode marker because obtaining the whole fragment of 1300bp using only both way sequencing may be difficult and use of internal primer may be necessary saunders and kucera 2010 du et al 2014 considering the fact that green algae are particularly susceptible to the acquisition of intron sequences van oppen et al 1993 bhattacharya et al 1996 and that the extent to which introns are present in their genes is unknown in spite of that according to saunders and kucera 2010 rbcl is still a good candidate for barcode dna of green algae due to the high degree of universality and low levels of contamination and high sequence quality in comparison with other tested markers in the case of red algae rbcl shows a low level of sequence discrepancy between closely related taxa furthermore the lack of insertion or deletion mutations eliminates the problems of alignment in the case of red algae freshwater and rueness 1994 according to poong et al 2014 the rbcl loci are more useful in explaining phylogeny than in dna barcoding there is no one specific sequence that would be suitable as a standard dna barcode for algae nevertheless there are some promising barcode sequences candidates as those mentioned above which have proven to be useful in many cases 14 conclusion the development of dna barcoding has helped taxonomic research and is of great value because the molecular assessment of the diversity of organisms plays an increasingly important role in controlling and detecting invasive species identifying organisms for environment monitoring testing commercial algae products and characterizing organisms hebert and gregory 2005 sherwood and presting 2007 there is no doubt that algae dna barcodes will improve as pcr amplification and dna sequencing progresses sequencing technology has improved dramatically over the past 25 years and more recently sequencing systems have been available to produce large quantities of dna sequences in a very short period of time these techniques are very suitable for dna barcoding of environmental samples consisting of a mixtures of multiple species such as sediment soil or seawater samples krishnamurthy and francis 2012 point out that establishing robust species identification thresholds is a key element of the dna barcoding process because it is only after determining the threshold in the target group that cryptic species can be identified today it is known that no single classification technique can be widely used to identify algal species however in cases where a single dna area is not sufficient for species identification a combination of two or more dna regions should be used new sequencing techniques enable faster and cheaper analysis of dna barcodes which in turn will become available in other branches of science such as medicine or pharmacy the development of new sequencing techniques made it possible to obtain whole genomes nuclear mitochondrial plastid whole transcripts for wide range organisms and these techniques are nowadays used on daily bases generating a lot of data this data can provide valuable information about more suitable genes markers for dna barcoding the usefulness of these techniques requires the development of the proper barcode libraries conflict

1114,up to now only a fraction of all living organisms in the world has been identified organisms are identified using morphological characteristics which is laborious and requires specialized knowledge barcoding dna helps to solve the limitations of traditional species identification the nucleotide sequence obtained using specific primers is presented in the form of a strip resembling a bar code which allows comparing and distinguishing species the standard sequence used for the barcoding of almost all animal groups is derived from the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase gene cox1 for fungi cox1 and its internal transcribed spacers were proposed as barcodes in contrast the world of plants does not have a single standard sequence for identifying species the ideal marker should consist of a highly variable region enabling species discrimination and be flanked by highly conserved regions allowing universal primer design for the dna barcodes standardization this paper describes the markers used to identify eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms their properties advantages and disadvantages and the proposed standard dna barcodes this work focuses on microalgae and macroalgae which are of great ecological importance and are widely used in food pharmaceutical or energy industries where they fast correct and reliable identification is crucial keywords dna barcoding algae taxonomy biodiversity 1 introduction diversity of life is the base of all biological research in fact up to now only a fraction of all living organisms number of which is hotly debated e g hammond 1992 hebert et al 2003 guiry 2012 mann and vanormelingen 2013 in the world has been identified identification of species has four important limitations first both the phenotypic plasticity and the genetic variation used to identify species may lead to incorrect identifications second putatively cryptic taxa are common in many groups knowlton 1993 third morphological keys are often effective at a particular stage of life or sex only thus many individuals cannot be identified finally the use of keys often requires a high level of expertise and there are cases where they can still be misinterpreted limitations associated with morphological species determination led to the need for a new approach in the identification of organisms problems with morphological taxonomy were enough to start developing dna based identification systems the number of cases in which such systems are used is continually increasing brown et al 1999 the genomic approach to taxonomic diagnosis uses diversity within dna sequences to identify organisms kurtzman 1994 wilson 1995 this paper describes the markers used to identify plant organisms their properties advantages and disadvantages and the proposed standard dna barcodes for photosynthetic organisms this work focuses on microalgae and macroalgae which are of great ecological importance in aquatic environments and are widely used in food pharmaceutical or energy industries 2 barcoding dna as a tool for describing biodiversity in 2003 hebert proposed barcoding dna as a way of identifying species in barcoding a short genetic sequence from the standard part of the genome is used to mark an organism barcoding dna helps to solve the limitations of traditional species identification this does not mean that traditional taxonomy has become less important on the contrary dna barcoding has become for taxonomists a new tool complementing their knowledge and an innovative device for non experts who need to quickly identify the organism species identification by barcode dna starts from the specimen samples can be taken from various sources e g strains from collections of various institutions sediments or water samples in the laboratory small fragments of thallus or just a several cells of microorganisms are used to isolate dna the barcode region is amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr and then sequenced the obtained sequence is a representation of a unique species specific serious of four nucleotides i e adenine cytosine guanine thymine denoted by a series of letters acgt respectively fig 1 the use of dna barcodes to describe life has not been without criticism mallet and willmott 2003 for example were concerned that differences in dna sequences between closely related species were not sufficient to enable their identification other researchers worried that with barcoding dna potentially replacing traditional taxonomic practice new species could never be formally described robba et al 2006 the dna barcoding posed a number of other problems a serious limitation of the usefulness of barcoding as a molecular diagnostics is the human error and uncertainty in the creation of reference libraries collins and cruickshank 2013 the idea of creating such libraries is the ability to identify unknown species using existing sequences of previously marked taxa contrary to these arguments dna barcode designs have already achieved positive results and brought benefits to ecologists conservationists and diverse agencies committed to control the use of pests food safety and monitor the occurrence of invasive species hebert and gregory 2005 robba et al 2006 furthermore hebert et al 2003 also emphasized that dna barcoding in conjunction with traditional taxonomy is a valuable tool in revealing hidden diversity only a few areas of the genome are considered to be suitable for the use as dna barcodes there are several requirements for selecting the appropriate dna markers firstly low intra specific nucleotide variation less than 2 and high variability among species mirek et al 2007 secondly and equally important the marker should be universally reproducible for different taxa which means that there should be a high success of amplification and sequencing preferably with a universal set of pcr primers taking into account sanger sequencing technique it is also desirable that the dna barcode tag should be short enough to be sequenced in a single reading 700bp longer fragments may also be sequenced but this requires more financial effort as well as time and work markers that may have microsatellite or regions rich in long repeats of or one or two base pairs are not beneficial because they cause problems with direct pcr product sequencing pečnikar and buzan 2014 a good marker should contain a small number of insertions and or deletions these mutations impede the alignment of sequences obtained from different organisms and in genetic analysis are generally not regarded as diagnostic nucleotide substitutions are preferred however kress and erickson 2007 rejected this requirement by stating that dna barcodes are intended for species identification not for phylogenetic analyses any mutation whether it is insertion or deletion or substitution is a feature of the organism and is equally good if it allows for identification mirek et al 2007 furthermore the ideal marker should consist of a highly variable region that provides enough information for species discrimination and be flanked by highly conserved regions which allow universal primer design as well as dna barcodes standardization it should also appear in the genome in a large number of copies which is of great importance when it comes to working with small thallus fragments or with fossil material the greater the number of copies of the target sequence in the genome the greater the chance that some of them have survived intact pečnikar and buzan 2014 3 markers used to identify algae the standard sequence used for barcoding of almost all animal groups was derived from the gene 5 fragment of cytochrome c oxidase subunit i of mtdna cox1 hebert et al 2003 for fungi cox1 and nuclear its sequences internal transcribed spacers were proposed as barcodes in contrast the world of photosynthetic organisms does not have a single standard dna fragment for species identification it is estimated that in the world there are over 72 500 species of algae while only 44 000 of them have been described guiry 2012 fig 2 there are still many undiscovered species so a new system of identification is needed to make the description of algae more efficient currently intensive research is conducted on the identification of algae and vascular plants the work continues on the selection of molecular markers that will be successfully used in a wide spectrum of organisms for dna barcoding plant working group deals with the development of a standard for the description of plant dna barcodes the standard cox1 sequence for animals shows insufficient variation in vascular plants kress et al 2005 but can be used for some algal groups it has been successfully applied in red algae research saunders 2005 robba et al 2006 le gall and saunders 2010 saunders and kucera 2010 while for green algae it has shown insufficient amplification outcome hall et al 2010 saunders and kucera 2010 the mitochondrial dna mtdna of plants is also not suitable source of barcodes because of frequent rearrangements and gene replacements with the nuclear genome hebert et al 2003 the genes of nuclear dna ndna which are being present in very low copy number may cause difficulties in sequencing of degraded dna regarding the above mentioned reasons researchers began to use chloroplast dna cpdna which is present in plant cells in multiple copies this type of dna consists of both low variability coding and much more variable non coding parts at the current state of knowledge it is not possible to indicate the ideal dna barcode sequence in any of the plant genomes ndna cpdna mtdna thus it is necessary to use several less variable sequences forming a dna barcode kress et al 2005 one universal sequence which could enable establishing of a single sequence dna barcode system seems to be not possible it is also argued that the use of several target sequences may not be sufficient for the identification of all photosynthetic organisms therefore it is expected that in the case of particular taxonomic groups occupying different phylogenetic positions dna barcoding will operate on different standard sequences mirek et al 2007 in 2006 newmaster and his colleagues proposed to identify organisms based on two sequences the first sequence would allow classifying an organism into a systematically higher unit while the second one would enable species identification within the higher systematic unit to which an object has been included by means of the primary sequence kress and erickson 2007 further developed this idea by evaluating sequences that could potentially be used as the barcode of plant dna through the prism of two criteria universality of amplification and the ability to differentiate genres regarding macroalgae cox1 dna region was proposed as the main primary marker for brown and red algae whereas tufa elongation factor as the main marker of green algae kress and erickson 2012 as the secondary marker lsu d2 d3 region of the large ribosomal subunit was chosen as it has been proven to be effective in estimating the phylogenetic relationship of organisms at interspecific and intraspecific level kress and erickson 2007 2012 armeli minicante et al 2014 so far most of the molecular research on algae has used a fairly limited range of markers such as rbcl plastid rubisco large subunit its mitochondrial cox2 3 or ribosomal and nuclear dna provan et al 2004 chase et al 2007 the lack of available markers was particularly problematic in the study of species variations and overall there is still a need for universal markers that can be used for a wide range of species provan et al 2004 mirek et al 2007 4 sequencing methods initially in order to identify the organism using the dna barcoding sequencing of the obtained material was performed using the sanger method 1977 in the last decade various studies have been carried out to develop alternative approaches for biodiversity assessment using methods based on dna sequences such as molecular phylogenetics and dna barcoding hajibabaei et al 2011 continuous development and linking of dna reference libraries will provide a database for a dna based identification system the application of new generation sequencing ngs methods in biodiversity science may further extend the use of dna information for biomonitoring at an unprecedented scale ngs technologies are characterized by enormous bandwidth which significantly reduces the cost of reading the nucleotide sequence in comparison with the standard sanger method shokralla et al 2012 heather and chain 2016 analysis of edna environmental e environment using dna barcodes is a key application for ngs sequencing in ecological research parallel access to huge amounts of sequences as well as subsequent improvements in reading the length and bandwidth of various sequential platforms have led to a wider representation biodiversity of the environmental samples tested the latest achievements of nanotechnology allow direct reading of sequences from a single molecule sequencing sms without the need for its amplification third generation sequencing mikheyev and tin 2014 oxford nanopore minion is the first portable ngs platform this pocket sized device allows to obtain sequences anywhere requiring only a connection to a laptop other benefits include low cost and real time data production jain et al 2016 portable genomics have enormous potential and can allow dna barcoding in the field hollingsworth et al 2016 new technologies are growing rapidly and have the potential to radically extend environmental research and thus our knowledge of the environmental taberler et al 2012 5 reference databases one of the most important elements of the dna barcoding initiative is to establish a public reference library containing taxa identifiers that can be used to assign unknown individuals to known species currently there are two main databases containing dna barcoding sequences that fulfill this role i e bold and genbank however regarding reference sequences for algae and more specifically diatoms one of the most important databases is r syst diatom the genbank reference database contains more than 200 million sequences from different organisms collected mainly through the direct deposition submission of sequences by individual laboratories originating from large scale sequencing projects including those related to whole genomes and those from nucleotide archive and japan data bank makes the content of the database available worldwide costa and carvalho 2007 benson et al 2018 genbank can be accessed via the ncbi database national environmental sampling benson et al 2018 daily data exchange with the european nuclecenter for biotechnology information which integrates data from all major dna and protein databases including taxonomy genomes mapping and protein structure information pruitt et al 2008 as well as biomedical literature via pubmed the blast algorithm provides search for sequence similarity in genbank and other databases ncbi also offers a wide range of search and analysis services based on genbank data sharma et al 2018 the genbank database and associated resources are freely available on the ncbi home page benson et al 2018 every year more and more reference sequences are coming up as demonstrated by the benson study 1994 2018 data from 1994 indicates that the genbank database contained 182 753 sequences while the data from 2018 show a significant increase to more than 200 million sequences the more information is gathered the faster and more credible the interpretation of the obtained results will be information systems such as bold barcode of life database support the acquisition storage analysis and publication of dna barcode records strugnell and lindgren 2007 bold is mining dna barcodes from genbank this program provides an integrated bioinformatic platform that supports all stages of the analytical path from sampling to a strictly verified barcode library stoeckle and hebert 2008 bold is freely available to any researcher interested in dna barcoding and contains more than 6 million dna barcode sequences providing specialized services it facilitates the compilation of records that meet the standards required to obtain a dna barcode in global sequence databases costa and carvalho 2007 owning to its online data delivery system bold can support projects involving extensive research initiatives ratnasingham and hebert 2007 reference barcode database for diatoms r syst diatom developed within the framework of r syst the network of systematic supported by inra french national institute for agricultural research rimet et al 2016 r syst diatom is used to identify barcodes from natural samples the data comes from two sources a culture collection of freshwater algae maintained in inra in which new strains are regularly deposited and codified and from the ncbi nucleotide database two molecular markers were selected for database support 18s and rbcl due to their effectiveness rimet et al 2016 vasselon et al 2017 data are developed using innovative and classic bioinformatic tools blast classic phylogenesis and current taxonomy rimet et al 2016 6 dna qua net project in the fast changing world and progressing destruction of the natural environment protection preservation and restoration of aquatic ecosystems and their functions are of crucial importance for european countries those actions have become legally binding mainly through the eu water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec and the marine strategy framework directive 2008 56 ec leese et al 2016 the current approach to the assessment and monitoring of biodiversity is based on morphological taxonomy this approach has many disadvantages but the key is the possibility of making an error by an analyst leese et al 2018 new genomic tools may bypass imperfections of morphological identifications and be complementary to traditional biomonitoring methods however there are many various approaches that are independently developed in different institutions preventing their universal application and for that reason the dna qua net project was created the aim of this project is to determine gold standard genomic tools and new eco genomic indicators that can be utilized in the assessment of biodiversity and in biomonitoring of european water reservoirs researchers have been working on the development and use of markers among else for algae which are a very important group used in bioindication and biomonitoring of the aquatic environment furthermore this project is also to provide a platform for training of future researchers together with water managers politicians and other interested parties a conceptual framework for the use of eco genomic tools is being developed for their subsequent implementation as a part of legally binding assessments leese et al 2016 lefrançois et al 2018 7 problems with algae identification microalgae include very diverse groups of organisms from single celled forms to complex multicellular forms occurring commonly in the marine environment around the world microalgae are among the main primary producers in the marine environment robba et al 2006 new species are being discovered every year and molecular research has discovered many cryptic species and unexpected phylogenetic connections hall et al 2010 identification of microalgae is problematic due to the fact that many species do not have obvious structural features and some traits may differ between the same taxa typically taxonomic diagnosis was made by electron microscopy hall et al 2010 however many groups contain taxa that have not yet been described and the exact number of species remains undetermined this is because they are extremely difficult to identify and classify solely on the basis of morphological characteristics their morphology can be extremely variable within and between species and characteristic features that allow for easy identification are often lacking provan et al 2004 in addition convergent morphology is common and often conceals mysterious species that have only just been revealed on the basis of molecular data mirek et al 2007 in the case of microalgae barcoding dna has been tested on several molecular markers each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages table 1 due to the use of diatoms in the bioindication of the environment and biological research or industry where it is necessary to determine their exact taxonomy they are a very important group in the aquatic environment in the case of diatoms barcoding dna has been tested on several molecular markers e g evans et al 2007 moniz and kaczmarska 2010 pniewski et al 2010 zimmermann et al 2011 there are three main problems here first of all the diversity of diatoms is unknown mann and vanormelingen 2013 rimet et al 2016 secondly identification has become increasingly difficult because existing taxonomic aids are obsolete by new discoveries thirdly contrary to the long standing belief that all taxa are cosmopolitan vyverman et al 2007 kooistra et al 2008 they may have biogeography the traditional taxonomic diagnosis of diatoms was based on their morphological characteristics but exclusive reliance on these traits may lead to erroneous determination of the taxon due to the widespread cryptic species in this group evans et al 2007 identifying macroalgae is also very difficult due to the fact that macroalgae show a very simple morphology and a certain degree of phenotypic plasticity which is influenced by environmental conditions age of the thallus and life style armeli minicante et al 2014 macroalgae were differentiated mainly based on gametangia positions and the mezosporous membrane ornamentation hall et al 2010 moreover the occurrence of cryptic taxa makes identification difficult only on the basis of morphological features therefore communities from the mediterranean were largely underestimated due to the presence of genetically different but morphologically similar species for this reason taxonomists are increasingly using molecular tools to identify individuals discover species and other related taxonomic tasks armeli minicante et al 2014 in case of macroalgae barcoding dna has been tested on several molecular markers table 2 8 cox1 and cox2 3 for algae the mitochondrial intergenic spacer between the cytochrome oxidase subunits 2 and 3 cox2 3 amplified by primers designed by zuccarello et al 1999 is a potentially universal marker of non coding dna the 300 350 bp sequence was found to be useful in many systematic and phytogeographic studies of red algae provan et al 2004 however the success of sequencing and amplification of the cox1 marker in comparison to the others used for the molecular identification of red algae turned out to be fairly small sherwood et al 2014 in the case of biodiversity research where the red algae strains must be successfully amplified and sequenced the cox1 marker should be supplemented with additional markers as for the usefulness of the cox1 marker for the identification of green algae its amplification has not been effective in most of taxa the marker is difficult to amplify in green algae due to the fact that this gene contains several introns which exact number and positions are not known in many species moniz and kaczmarska 2009 for diatoms cox1 is variable enough to distinguish between previously identified taxa to reveal potentially cryptic species and it may work in some cases as a geographical marker evans et al 2007 mann et al 2010 for some species cox1 can provide useful information on the structure of the population or racial differences according to evans et al 2007 cox1 has a higher degree of variation than other markers used in research on diatom biodiversity rbcl its 18s on the other hand the evolution of the mitochondrial genomes of algae is unclear evans et al 2007 it can also pose major problems in amplification and sequencing moniz and kaczmarska 2009 mann et al 2010 therefore it seems that cox1 may be valuable only in special cases such as for example sellaphora unless the problem of the universality of this marker is solved in the future the main disadvantage of cox1 is the current absence of universal amplification primers original primers for algae are successful in some groups but show mixed results in other lines which may result from heterogeneity within the species at positions near the 3 end of the primers clarkston and saunders 2010 the sequence of cox1 due to the lack of sufficient information for different groups of macroalgae in a data bank requires additional use of another marker to assign the organisms to the specific species manghisi et al 2010 studies have confirmed the effectiveness of the cox1 marker in the differentiation of closely related species belonging to different families of brown and red algae mcdevit and saunders 2009 saunders 2005 9 tufa the cox1 and tufa markers are often used to identify macroalgae and they can be very successful in delineation of new species as shown by armeli minicante et al 2014 who described two new species ulva ohnoi and pyropia yezoensis occurring on the sicilian coast both markers showed great power to differentiate closely related species and the success of the amplification was satisfactory the tufa marker is characterized by high universality and ease of amplification hall et al 2010 it is moderately variable and it may pose challenges in some lines where the gene is encoded in the nucleus hall et al 2010 the tufa gene was probably transferred to the nucleus after separation of the main classes of green algae as they all seem to have at least the remainder of the gene in their cpdna but before the emergence of terrestrial plants which are lacking tufa in their chloroplast genome if this is the case then the transfer must have occurred in the line leading to terrestrial plants charophyceae baldauf et al 1990 it may results in the appearance of paralogs paralogs are genes created by duplication within a genome and may evolve new functions which may complicate the identification of species in some lines hall et al 2010 nevertheless the marker appears to be promising at the species level in chlorophytes saunders and kucera 2010 10 ribosomal rna genes there is no doubt that molecular techniques have radically changed the face of phycological research especially in the field of biodiversity and systematics mirek et al 2007 in the early years the researchers concentrated strongly on two commonly used markers i e rbcl freshwater et al 1994 chase et al 2007 and a small rdna subunit ragan et al 1994 harper and saunders 2001 sequencing of ribosomal rna genes rdna has been used as a standard in microbial ecology to describe the structure and diversity of their population the most commonly used gene is the small ribosomal subunit ssu 16s for bacteria and 18s for eukaryotes unfortunately the slow evolution of 18s does not allow distinguishing of closely related species evans et al 2007 however the large ribosomal subunit lsu gene 23s for bacteria and 28s for eukaryotes may also be used to determine phylogeny and taxonomy of studied taxa gutell et al 1994 harper and saunders 2001 sherwood and presting 2007 lsu genes potentially encode more phylogenetic information due to greater length and sequence variability gutell et al 1994 another advantage of lsu sequences is its greater database representation about 2 1 compared to ssu genes gutell et al 1994 the tested lsu markers have shown great success in amplification and sequencing in the case of red algae but due to the more conservative nature they are not sufficient to distinguish closely related species which is crucial for barcoding dna sherwood et al 2010 hall in his research 2010 tested the utility of various markers in the identification of algae from the chlorophyceae cluster including the plastid 23s rdna upa also 18s rbcl its1 its2 and cox1 these studies suggest that 18s is not the best choice when it comes to creating a dna barcode because the region is not sufficiently variable similar conclusions were drawn by moniz and kaczmarska 2009 who investigated the possibility of using 18s as a barcode in diatoms 18s is less variable than rbcl and cox1 and is relatively rarely used as a diatom dna barcode mann et al 2010 however according to zimmermann et al 2011 the subregion of 18s rdna v4 turned out to be a good candidate for a diatom dna barcoding it exhibits sufficient variability to differentiate organisms in environmental trials and shows very high amplification success however in the case of cryptic species it still shows insufficient variability therefore it has been postulated that it should be supplemented with additional markers zimmermann et al 2011 in case of macroalgae the lsu d2 d3 region gives very good results in terms of universality ease of amplification and discriminating power the resulting sequence quality is satisfactory kress and erickson 2012 however when it comes to green algae pcr amplification caused problems saunders and kucera 2010 these problems could result from the high frequency of introns within the green algae in addition the presence and amplification of contaminations in the samples is an additional explanation of the encountered difficulties van oppen et al 1993 bhattacharya et al 1996 saunders and kucera 2010 further development of primers can solve the problem with poor amplification efficiency saunders and kucera 2010 11 upa a universal dna barcode for the identification of photosynthetic organisms was recently proposed sherwood and presting 2007 used the plastid 23s rdna gene upa universal amplicon as a universal algal marker claiming that a single pair of primers could discover sequences from a wide taxonomic range of photosynthetic organisms including higher plants diatoms green algae brown algae red algae and even cyanobacteria this marker has been used in biodiversity research of natural algal communities both benthic and planktonic and the distribution of species indeed in 2014 sherwood and colleagues based on the 23s rdna markers conducted research on the identification of algae in the koolau mountain range in hawaii the marker has also been successfully used to evaluate the distribution of algae and macrophytes wallace et al 2015 in addition the tested marker was also used to identify species present in fossil sludge also with good results hou et al 2014 the upa marker showed great success of amplification and sequencing in the case of red algae also but due to the more conservative nature it was not sufficient to distinguish closely related species which is crucial for barcoding dna sherwood et al 2010 the upa marker was also used in studies on the spread of species in the coast region of brazil the review of species based on the analysis of molecular marker sequences and supported with morphology revealed the occurrence of five different taxa in the pyropia genus milstein et al 2015 the specificity of upa universal primers is undoubtedly influenced by the origin of plastids sherwood and presting 2007 this marker has a very high amplification success for different groups of micro and macroalgae due to its universality it is more often used in research on plant communities algae used in industry or bioindication hou et al 2014 milstein et al 2015 wallace et al 2015 although upa had a relatively high success in pcr amplification it turned out that some of the samples were contaminated or the resulting sequences were not of satisfactory quality it is possible that the epiphytic or endophytic contaminations present in the samples were preferentially or simultaneously amplified with the target organism for one of the following reasons the upa primers matched the contaminations better than the target organism or the dna extraction was more effective for contaminations than for the target organism markers with highly universal primers such as upa are particularly susceptible to these problems and effective isolation of target dna becomes extremely important saunders and kucera 2010 however the possibility remains that the upa may not have a differentiating power among closely related species which may lead to underestimation of diversity and although this has not been observed yet this is an attribute that requires further research for upa as a potential marker for dna barcoding clarkston and saunders 2010 the usability of the 23s rdna gene is potentially limited due to the relatively small amount of information in the databases their constraints are likely to fall sharply with increasing genomic sequencing particularly given the interest in using algae for biofuel production grossman 2007 therefore the ability to use 23s rdna gene sequencing to describe complex algal groups should grow rapidly this increase will occur with the development of descriptions of genetic diversity of algae 12 its most phytogeographic studies used internal transcribed spacer its a non coding domain located between the small and large ribosome subunit the popularity of the its region can be attributed to its relatively high nucleotide substitution rate which allows comparisons of relatively recent divergent taxa in addition the its region can be readily amplified by pcr and sequenced with conservative primers however many earlier studies used a set of primers published by white et al 1990 for fungi that frequently amplified false algae sequences provan et al 2004 plant working group excluded this sequence as a standard dna barcode in view of possibility of multiple copies of this domain in one organism and the uncertainty in its evolution mirek et al 2007 its was also proposed as a barcode for algae and terrestrial plants and was widely used in phylogenetics of green algae species the its1 and its2 markers are sufficiently variable to differentiate the strains of algae within species evans et al 2007 hall et al 2010 mann et al 2010 moniz and kaczmarska 2010 the success of sequencing and amplification is low for the its marker in green algae while for other taxonomic groups the universality of primers has been more successful in contrast to the 18s its is highly variable and is often chosen for intra population diatom studies however direct sequencing of its was not possible in several species including nitzschia achnanthes eunotia navicula pseudo nitzschia and sellaphora mann et al 2010 furthermore matching the rdna sequence is not straightforward and becomes increasingly difficult because there are many copies of its sequences in plant genomes it is questionable whether the sequence obtained by pcr would be stable and representative gao et al 2010 the main problem is that its alignment can be reach with insertion deletions therefore the alignment of variably fragments can be highly biased multiple or banded pcr products are often obtained which makes sequencing impossible it is likely that these primers strengthen contaminating organisms leading to a multiband or banded pcr product saunders and kucera 2010 however when the dna barcodes are used to discover the species and for identification which is desirable given the current state of the taxonomy of diatoms the question of sequences alignment is an important practical matter mann et al 2010 13 rbcl region of genes between the large and small subunits of rubisco rbcl rbcs spacer is widely used in molecular studies of algae red green and brown algae brodie et al 1998 the protein coding for the plastid gene rbcl was proposed as a potential barcode of dna for plant organisms by many researchers usually combined with one or more other markers chase et al 2007 one of the advantages of this region is the rich library of information chase et al 2007 this sequence allows for a high probability of placing the examined organism into the genus or family kress and erickson 2007 the rbcl marker is sufficiently variable to differentiate the strains of green algae within species however according to hall et al 2010 it is not enough to identify all tested strains furthermore if rbcl is chosen as the preferred marker used in diatom dna barcoding or any other plastid marker whose function is to code the proteins involved in photosynthesis it will not work for species that lack a functional plastid and are obligatory heterotrophs such as nitzschia alba mann et al 2010 the usefulness of rbcl as a barcode dna was the basis for several taxonomic and phylogenetic studies in marine macroalgae hommersand et al 1994 wang et al 2010 saunders and kucera 2010 du et al 2014 unfortunately the presence of introns in the rbcl of some marine species may negatively affect the universality of rbcl as a barcode marker because obtaining the whole fragment of 1300bp using only both way sequencing may be difficult and use of internal primer may be necessary saunders and kucera 2010 du et al 2014 considering the fact that green algae are particularly susceptible to the acquisition of intron sequences van oppen et al 1993 bhattacharya et al 1996 and that the extent to which introns are present in their genes is unknown in spite of that according to saunders and kucera 2010 rbcl is still a good candidate for barcode dna of green algae due to the high degree of universality and low levels of contamination and high sequence quality in comparison with other tested markers in the case of red algae rbcl shows a low level of sequence discrepancy between closely related taxa furthermore the lack of insertion or deletion mutations eliminates the problems of alignment in the case of red algae freshwater and rueness 1994 according to poong et al 2014 the rbcl loci are more useful in explaining phylogeny than in dna barcoding there is no one specific sequence that would be suitable as a standard dna barcode for algae nevertheless there are some promising barcode sequences candidates as those mentioned above which have proven to be useful in many cases 14 conclusion the development of dna barcoding has helped taxonomic research and is of great value because the molecular assessment of the diversity of organisms plays an increasingly important role in controlling and detecting invasive species identifying organisms for environment monitoring testing commercial algae products and characterizing organisms hebert and gregory 2005 sherwood and presting 2007 there is no doubt that algae dna barcodes will improve as pcr amplification and dna sequencing progresses sequencing technology has improved dramatically over the past 25 years and more recently sequencing systems have been available to produce large quantities of dna sequences in a very short period of time these techniques are very suitable for dna barcoding of environmental samples consisting of a mixtures of multiple species such as sediment soil or seawater samples krishnamurthy and francis 2012 point out that establishing robust species identification thresholds is a key element of the dna barcoding process because it is only after determining the threshold in the target group that cryptic species can be identified today it is known that no single classification technique can be widely used to identify algal species however in cases where a single dna area is not sufficient for species identification a combination of two or more dna regions should be used new sequencing techniques enable faster and cheaper analysis of dna barcodes which in turn will become available in other branches of science such as medicine or pharmacy the development of new sequencing techniques made it possible to obtain whole genomes nuclear mitochondrial plastid whole transcripts for wide range organisms and these techniques are nowadays used on daily bases generating a lot of data this data can provide valuable information about more suitable genes markers for dna barcoding the usefulness of these techniques requires the development of the proper barcode libraries conflict
