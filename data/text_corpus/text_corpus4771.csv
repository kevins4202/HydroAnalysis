23855,the intensity of major tropical cyclones has increased during the past decade their effect is particularly acute in coastal areas where they cause extensive damage leading to an influx of debris sediments and waste to the sea however most operational coastal ocean models do not represent heavy wind transport processes correctly if the hydrodynamics is not coupled with the wind generated waves this may lead to significant errors in ocean simulations under tropical cyclone conditions here we investigate current wave interactions during a major hurricane and assess their impact on transport processes we do that by coupling the unstructured mesh coastal ocean model slim with the spectral wave model swan and applying it to the florida reef tract during hurricane irma september 2017 we show that the coupled model successfully reproduces the wave behavior the storm surge and the ocean currents during the passage of the hurricane we then use the coupled and uncoupled wave current model to simulate the transport of passive drifters we show that the wave radiation stress gradient alone can lead to changes of up to 1 m s in the modeled currents which in turn leads to differences of up to 5 km in the position of drifting material over the duration of the hurricane the stokes drift however appears to cause deflections up to 4 times larger and hence dominates wave induced transport wave current interactions therefore strongly impact the transport of drifting material such as sediments and debris in the aftermath of a hurricane they should thus be taken into account in order to correctly assess its overall impact keywords hurricane ocean transport wave current interactions stokes drift unstructured mesh ocean model 1 introduction major hurricanes are becoming more intense under the effect of global warming bhatia et al 2019 knutson et al 2020 better understanding their repercussions on coastal areas becomes therefore critical however estimating the impact of hurricanes on the coastal ocean circulation remains a challenge understanding wave current interactions and representing their impact on coastal ocean transport processes is central to many coastal activities such as dredging erosion management oil and gas activities search and rescue and insurance bever and macwilliams 2013 li and johns 1998 breivik et al 2013 all these activities require wave current models to predict the impact of tropical cyclones on the coastal circulation and on the sea surface elevation wave current interactions during a cyclone are highly nonlinear and vary significantly in space and time wu et al 2011 wave induced currents are generated by wave radiation stress gradients longuet higgins 1970 affecting water levels near shorelines and wave breaking points longuet higgins and stewart 1964 changes in water levels and currents in turn affect the motion and evolution of the waves sikirić et al 2013 coupled wave current models hence require the calculation of the full directional wave spectrum in order to correctly reproduce the dynamics of wind driven surface waves this is usually achieved by spectral wave models which describe the evolution of the wave energy spectrum as of today the most popular spectral wave models are the wave model wam wamdi group 1988 simulating wave nearshore swan booij et al 1999 and wavewatch iii tolman et al 2009 among these models swan has been specifically developed for coastal applications as it represents depth induced wave breaking and triad wave wave interactions using numerical techniques adapted to small scale shallow water regions booij et al 1999 wavewatch iii has also recently been equipped with new parallelization algorithm domain decomposition and numerical schemes for high resolution coastal applications ww3dg 2019 abdolali et al 2020 coastal oceans are characterized by the complex topography of the coastline and the presence of islands reefs and artificial structures traditional structured grid models lack the flexibility to simulate near shore processes at a sufficiently small scale although the use of nested structured grids allows local grid refinement warner et al 2010 staircase like representation of complex coastal topographies cannot be avoided instead unstructured mesh models easily adapt to the topography and are hence better suited to coastal processes fringer et al 2019 capturing the impact of the topography on wave interactions becomes even more important in the case of tropical cyclones heavy winds generate large wind waves and disturb ocean conditions liu et al 2020 by causing coastal upwellings on continental shelves smith 1982 and inducing strong currents waves and storm surges in nearshore and coastal regions dietrich et al 2010 weisberg and zheng 2006 ocean waves act as the dynamical interface between the atmosphere and the ocean through this interface tropical cyclones cause a cooling of the upper ocean layer by vertical mixing and heat transfer aijaz et al 2017 varlas et al 2020 by altering the structure of the upper ocean hurricane can cause the disruption of major ocean currents such as the florida current and gulf stream oey et al 2007 interaction with hurricanes alters the thermal structure of these currents and can cause a significant decline of their flow resulting in delayed increased coastal levels along their path even in locations out of reach of the hurricane itself ezer et al 2017 ezer 2018 2020 near the storm heavy wind conditions also affect material transport at the ocean surface the transport of drifting objects or substances that are locally released is often best represented by a lagrangian individual based model such an approach is routinely used to model the dispersal of larvae pollutants sediments and many other tracers e g le hénaff et al 2012 liubartseva et al 2018 figueiredo et al 2013 frys et al 2020 although some transport model might take wave induced currents into account most of them neglect wave current interactions which can lead to significant errors in storm conditions röhrs et al 2012 curcic et al 2016 niu and xia 2017 and mao and xia 2018 2020 investigated the impact of wave current interactions during storm event in lakes and inlets however to our knowledge there have been no similar studies on the impact of hurricane induced wave current interactions in coastal environments such as the florida reef tract frt where changes in transport processes might significantly impact the biological connectivity the main questions we want to answer in this study are the following 1 how important are wave current interactions during a tropical cyclone 2 what effect do they have on the transport of drifting material we tackle these issues by investigating the transport of drifting particles on the florida shelf during hurricane irma one of the strongest and costliest tropical cyclones on record in the atlantic basin xian et al 2018 which made landfall in florida in september 2017 to do that we developed an unstructured mesh coupled wave current model of the whole frt to simulate the ocean circulation under hurricane conditions both modeled currents and waves were validated against field measurements and then used to simulate the transport of drifting material in the florida keys and over the florida inner shelf model outputs were then compared with uncoupled simulation results in order to assess the impact of the radiation stress gradient and stokes drift on the modeled currents and transport 2 methods 2 1 study area and observational data we study the ocean circulation in an area that covers the whole frt and includes the northwestern end of the gulf of mexico and the straits of florida fig 1 the large scale ocean circulation around south florida is dominated by the florida current fc which originates from the loop current lc where it enters the florida straits from the gulf of mexico and downstream forms the gulf stream the fc is a major western boundary current characterized by spatial variability and meandering associated with the presence of cyclonic eddies between the core of the current and the complex reef topography of the frt lee et al 1995 kourafalou and kang 2012 the variability of the fc extends over a large range of spatial and temporal scales with periods of 30 70 days in the lower keys lee et al 1995 and shorter periods of 2 21 days in the upper keys lee and mayer 1977 and exhibits significant seasonal and interannual cycles johns and schott 1987 lee and williams 1988 schott et al 1988 circulation on the west florida shelf wfs on the other hand is forced by local winds and tidal fluctuations lee and smith 2002 liu and weisberg 2012 furthermore due to its location relative to the warm waters of the north atlantic florida is particularly vulnerable to tropical cyclones on average the state is hit by a hurricane every two years and strong hurricanes some of which are among the most destructive on record strike florida on average once every four years malmstadt et al 2009 the state of the ocean around florida is monitored by an extensive array of tide gauges current meters and buoys in this study we used sea surface elevation measurements from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa tides and currents dataset these measurements were taken at four locations two in the florida keys key west and vaca key one on the east coast of florida virginia key and one on the west coast naples for the currents we used adcp measurements from the university of south florida s college of marine science s usf cms coastal ocean monitoring and prediction system comps for the wfs weisberg et al 2009 more specifically we used measurements from moorings c10 c12 and c13 respectively located at the 25 50 and 50 m isobaths of the wfs liu et al 2020 finally for the waves we used measurements from four buoys of the noaa s national data buoy center ndbc two on florida s eastern shelf and two on the wfs the locations of all measurement stations are shown in fig 1 2 2 wind and atmospheric pressure during hurricane irma hurricane irma made landfall in florida on 10 september 2017 as a category 4 hurricane at cudjoe key florida keys and later as a category 3 hurricane on marco island south of naples see hurricane track in fig 1 it then weakened to a category 2 hurricane as it moved further inland cangialosi et al 2018 the storm damaged up to 75 of the buildings at its landfall point in the florida keys making it one of the strongest and costliest hurricanes on record in the atlantic basin xian et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the strongest reported sustained winds on marco island were 50 m s while the highest recorded storm surge was 2 3 m although larger wind speed likely occurred in the florida keys pinelli et al 2018 to reproduce the wind profile of irma in our model we used high resolution h wind wind fields powell et al 1998 as these data represent 1 min averaged wind speeds we multiplied them by a factor 0 93 to obtain 10 min averaged wind speeds harper et al 2010 this operation reduces the erratic values caused by the greater variance of mean winds measured over periods shorter than 10 minutes furthermore h wind wind profiles did not cover the whole model extent during the passage of the hurricane and were thus blended within a coarser wind field extracted from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era 5 dataset fig 2a the pressure field during the passage of hurricane irma was also reconstructed using era 5 data however the coarse resolution of the dataset smoothes out the depression at the center of the hurricane leading to an underestimation of the pressure gradient fig 2b to better capture the central depression of irma we therefore built a hybrid pressure field using the position and the minimal pressure of the core of the hurricane based on its track as recorded in the hurricane databases hurdat 2 landsea and franklin 2013 based on this information the hybrid pressure field was constructed by combining an idealized holland pressure profile lin and chavas 2012 within the radius of maximum wind speed of irma knaff et al 2018 with era 5 pressure field the transition from the holland profile to era 5 data outside the radius of maximum wind speed data was performed using a smooth step function fig 2 2 3 hydrodynamic model ocean currents generated during hurricane irma around south florida were modeled using the 2d barotropic version of the unstructured mesh second generation louvain la neuve ice ocean model 1 1 https www slim ocean be slim lambrechts et al 2008 the model mesh covers an area similar to the model extent of dobbelaere et al 2020 that includes the frt but also the florida straits and part of the gulf of mexico fig 1 however this area has been slightly extended northeastward and westward in order to include the noaa ndbc buoys furthermore to withstand potential cell drying during the hurricane we solved the conservative shallow water equations with wetting drying 1 h t u 0 u t u u h f e z u α g h h h 1 ρ p atm 1 ρ τ s ν u c

coordinate ocean model hycom product goml0 04 2 2 https www hycom org data goml0pt04 chassignet et al 2007 in regions where the water depth exceeds 50 m hycom s 3d currents were depth integrated into 2d transports to be used as forcing in the model moreover these transports as well as hycom s sea surface elevation were used as boundary condition in the model we adapted the parameterization of the wind induced surface stress to storm conditions at very high wind speeds the white cap is blown off the crest of the waves this phenomenon also known as spume has been hypothesized to generate a layer of droplets that acts as a slip layer for the winds at the ocean atmosphere interface holthuijsen et al 2012 it causes a saturation of the wind drag coefficient for strong winds powell et al 2003 donelan et al 2004 curcic and haus 2020 we take this saturation effect into account by using the wind drag parameterization of moon et al 2007 in this parameterization the drag coefficient c d depends on the wind speed at 10 m height u 10 according to 2 c d κ 2 log 10 z 0 2 where κ is the von karman constant and z 0 is the roughness length expressed as 3 z 0 0 0185 g u 2 if u 10 12 5 m s 0 085 0 56 u 2 20 255 u if u 10 12 5 m s 2 458 0 58 1 0 3 with u the friction velocity the relation between u 10 and u is given by 4 u 10 0 56 u 2 20 255 u 2 458 the mesh resolution depends on the distance to the coastlines and reefs following the approach of dobbelaere et al 2020 the mesh is then further refined according to bathymetry value and gradient as suggested in the swan user guide 3 3 http swanmodel sourceforge net unswan unswan htm such an approach improves the model efficiency as the mesh resolution is only increased where required by the currents and waves dynamics the mesh was generated with the seamsh 4 4 https pypi org project seamsh python library which is based on the open source mesh generator gmsh geuzaine and remacle 2009 it is composed of approximately 7 7 10 5 elements the coarsest elements far away from the frt have a characteristic length of about 5 km whereas the finest elements have a characteristic length of about 100 m along the coastlines and over the reefs fig 1 2 4 wave model waves were modeled using the parallel unstructured mesh version of the simulating waves nearshore swan model booij et al 1999 one of the most popular wave models for coastal areas and inland waters it solves the action balance equation mei 1989 5 n t x c g u n θ c θ n σ c σ n s i n s d s s n l σ where n e σ is the wave action density and e is the wave energy spectrum θ is the wave propagation direction σ is the intrinsic wave frequency c g is the wave group velocity u u h is slim depth averaged current velocity c θ and c σ are the propagation velocities in spectral space due to refraction and shifting in frequency due to variations in depth and currents and s i n s d s and s n l respectively represent wave growth by wind wave decay and nonlinear transfers of wave energy through four and three wave interactions i e quadruplets and triplets the wave spectra were discretized with 48 direction bins and 50 frequency bins logarithmically distributed from 0 03 to 2 hz exponential wind growth was parameterized using the formulation of janssen 1991 while dissipations by whitecapping and bottom dissipation followed the formulations of komen et al 1984 and madsen et al 1989 respectively coefficients for exponential wind growth and whitecapping parameterizations were based on the results of siadatmousavi et al 2011 and significantly differ from swan s default settings by default swan implements the wind input formulation of komen et al 1984 and the steepness dependent coefficient governing dissipation by whitecapping is a linear function of the wavenumber in this study this steepness dependent coefficient is a quadratic function of the wavenumber as it showed better predictions of the significant wave height in the study of siadatmousavi et al 2011 the choice of these formulations was motivated by the appearance of numerical instabilities in the region of the gulf stream when using swan s default parameter values finally era 5 wave spectra was used as boundary condition for swan wave spectra is obtained from the ocean wave model wam and is given on a 1 1 grid with 24 directions and 36 frequencies surface waves induce a net drift in the direction of the wave propagation known as the stokes drift van den bremer and breivik 2018 stokes 1880 this net drift has a significant impact on sediment transport in nearshore regions hoefel and elgar 2003 on the formation of langmuir cells langmuir 1938 craik and leibovich 1976 as well as on the transport of heat salt or pollutants such as oil or micro plastic in the upper ocean layer mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 röhrs et al 2012 drivdal et al 2014 to correctly model the stokes drift profile in mixed wind driven sea and swell conditions the full two dimensional wave spectrum must be represented by a spectral wave model within a wave current coupling van den bremer and breivik 2018 we therefore used swan modeled spectra to compute the stokes drift as follows 6 u s 0 2 π 0 σ 3 h tanh 2 k h e σ θ cos θ sin θ d σ d θ where k is the norm of the wave vector h is the water depth and e σ θ is the wave energy density the computed stokes drift velocity is then added to slim depth averaged current velocity to transport drifting particles in the experiments described in section 2 6 2 5 coupled model slim and swan are coupled so that they run on the same computational core and the same unstructured mesh slim is run first and passes the wind velocity u 10 water level η h h and depth averaged current u u h fields to swan as well as a roughness length z 0 for the bottom dissipation formulation of madsen et al 1989 this roughness length is computed from slim s bulk drag coefficient c b following the approach of dietrich et al 2011 so that both models have consistent bottom dissipation parameterizations swan then uses these quantities to compute the wave radiation stress gradient that is then passed to slim as the force exerted by waves on currents τ wave fig 3 slim then uses this quantity to update the value of the surface stress τ s in eq 1 that now becomes the sum of wind and wave induced stresses τ s τ wind τ wave here the momentum flux from the atmosphere to the ocean is taken as the usual full wind stress τ wind doing so we neglect the momentum advected away from the storm by the waves leading to a 10 15 overestimation of the momentum flux in hurricane winds curcic 2015 we followed the approach of dietrich et al 2012 by characterizing the wave induced forces on currents using the radiation stress rs gradient formalism which has been successfully applied in both 2d and 3d coupled wave current models under storm conditions hope et al 2013 sebastian et al 2014 brown et al 2013 an alternative formalism is the vortex force vf representation mcwilliams et al 2004 that provides a clearer decomposition of the wave effect lane et al 2007 although both approaches were adopted by coastal modeling communities there is an ongoing scientific debate over the correctness and applicability of the two concepts ardhuin et al 2008 mellor 2013 2015 ardhuin et al 2017 xia et al 2020 recently implemented the two formalisms in a 3d unstructured grid model and compared them in three typical coastal systems showing that the 3d rs algorithm could generate unrealistic offshore currents near shorelines despite these shortcomings the 3d rs method reproduced most wave induced currents and the 2d rs formalism remains a well validated modeling approach furthermore mellor 2013 showed that the rs approach was valid when h x sinh k h 2 is smaller or of the same order as k a 2 where a is the wave amplitude we evaluated these quantities and verified that the validity criterion was met in our model domain additionally since the vf and rs approaches are formally equivalent lane et al 2007 we selected the 2d rs formalism as it has the advantage of summarizing the impact of waves on the currents in a single additional stress term in the hydrodynamic model equations slim s governing equations are integrated using an implicit time integration scheme while swan is unconditionally stable dietrich et al 2012 allowing both models to be run with relatively large time steps in this study the stationary version of swan was used i e the first term of eq 5 was set to zero this resulted in reduced scaling and convergence rates than with the nonstationary version of swan but increased the model stability the wave spectra at each node of the mesh was saved at the end of each iteration to serve as initial conditions for the next one both models were run sequentially using a time step of 600 s so that each computational core was alternatively running either slim or swan as in the coupling between swan and the advanced circulation model adcirc dietrich et al 2012 both models use the same local sub mesh allowing for a one to one correspondence between the geographic locations of the mesh vertices no interpolation is therefore needed when passing the discretized variables from one model to the other which allows an efficient inter model communication however as slim is based on a discontinuous galerkin finite element method an additional conversion step to a continuous framework was required to transfer slim nodal quantities to swan the coupling increases the computation time by 3 as compared to the sum of the uncoupled slim and swan simulations wall clock times for the same number of cpus and the same simulation period 2 6 quantifying the effect of wave current interactions on transport to quantify the impact of wave current interactions on transport processes we compared the trajectories of passive particles advected by the uncoupled slim and coupled slim swan currents during the passage of irma in the lower keys furthermore the depth averaged stokes drift was computed using the wave spectra of the coupled model slim swan run as well as those of an uncoupled swan run particles were released on the inner and outer shelves at the points highlighted by red and blue dots in fig 4 on sept 7 at 0000 utc and then tracked until sept 15 these initial particle positions were found using backtracking methods spivakovskaya et al 2005 to ensure that the release particles would intersect the path of irma during its passage through the florida keys we first defined two 25 km 2 circular regions on the trajectory of the hurricane see red and blue circles in fig 4 particles within these two regions were then tracked backward in time using uncoupled slim currents from the exact time of the passage of the hurricane until sept 7 at 0000 utc their positions at the end of the backward simulation see red and blue particle clouds in fig 4 corresponds to the initial condition of the forward transport simulations described below we then compared the trajectories of particles originating from these regions and advected forward in time by different sets of currents i uncoupled slim currents alone ii coupled slim swan currents iii slim currents with the addition of the depth averaged stokes drift computed with the coupled wave current model stokes c iv slim swan currents with stokes c and v slim currents with the depth averaged stokes drift computed with the uncoupled wave model stokes u the different combinations of eulerian currents and stokes drifts used to model the transport of passive drifters in the lower keys during the passage of irma are summarized in table 1 particle trajectories are compared by computing the distances between the centers of mass of the particle clouds through time 3 results we first validated the reconstructed atmospheric fields of hurricane irma as well as the outputs of our coupled wave current model against field measurements we then used the validated model outputs to simulate the transport of passive particles in the lower keys during the passage of hurricane irma these particles were advected by the sets of currents described in table 1 and their trajectories were compared to evaluate the impact of the wave current interactions and the stokes drift on the transport processes during the passage of irma 3 1 model validation h wind winds and hybrid pressure field agree well with station measurements at vaca key station fig 5 the hybrid pressure field shows a better agreement with observations than era 5 pressure as it successfully reproduces the storm depression era 5 fields on the other hand fail to reproduce the low pressure at the core of the hurricane due to their coarser grid leading to an overestimation of 8 mbar of the storm depression both h wind and era 5 agree well with observed wind speeds although both data sets tend to slightly overestimate the width and intensity of the wind peak however h wind profiles better reproduce the timing of the observed peak as era 5 winds tend to anticipate it h wind also exhibits a slightly narrower peak in wind speed which better agrees with observations hydrodynamic outputs of the coupled wave current model agree well with tide gauge fig 6 and adcp measurements fig 7 the coupled model reproduces well the timing of the positive and negative storm surges at all tide gauge locations the amplitude of the positive surges are especially well captured at naples and vaca key with errors of 2 and 6 centimeters respectively however the model underestimates the positive surges at virginia key and key west by 24 and 15 at the peak respectively the amplitude of the negative surge at naples is also underestimated by about 16 at the peak nonetheless on average the absolute error between the model and observations does not exceed 10 cm table 2 modeled 2d currents were validated against depth averaged adcp measurements at mooring stations c10 c12 and c13 fig 7 as in liu et al 2020 we performed the vector correlation analysis of kundu 1976 to compare modeled and observed current velocity vectors correlation coefficients ρ between simulated and observed depth averaged currents are 0 87 0 84 and 0 81 at stations c10 c12 and c13 respectively the average veering angles are below 12 as in liu et al 2020 furthermore the positive bias in table 2 indicates that our model tends to underestimate the southward component of the currents at the different stations as expected from a depth averaged model the best fit with observations is obtained at the shallowest mooring c10 located on the 25 m isobath the simulated significant wave height agrees well with observations at all buoy locations fig 8 the timing of the peak in wave height is well captured at all buoys while the amplitude is better reproduced on the wfs buoys 42036 and 42097 with errors below 10 the error on the peak amplitude on florida s eastern shelf is of 13 and 21 at buoys 4114 and 4113 respectively on average observed significant wave height and wave period are better reproduced on the wfs while wave direction is better captured by the model on florida s eastern shelf table 2 the fit is especially good at buoy 41113 where the mostly westward northwestward wave propagation is less perturbed by irma s wind field 3 2 impact of waves on currents and transport we evaluated the impact of the rs gradient on the modeled currents during the passage of irma in the lower keys between sept 7 and 13 2017 first we computed the maximum difference between currents modeled by slim and slim swan during this period fig 9a the largest differences in current speed were observed over the reefs on the shelf break and around islands they locally reach 1 m s with the coupled slim swan model yielding the largest amplitudes the regions where the differences were the largest correspond to areas that experienced large maximum values of the rs gradient τ wave fig 9b these areas of large rs gradient are located on the shelf break and over coral reefs where important wave energy dissipation occurred through depth induced wave breaking and bottom dissipation longuet higgins and stewart 1964 this highlights the important protective role of the barrier formed by the offshore reefs that require a fine spatial resolution to be accurately represented by the model rs induced differences in current speed were amplified by the action of the wind stress τ wind fig 9c wind speeds were larger in the front right quadrant of the hurricane zedler et al 2009 yielding larger differences on the right hand side of the storm trajectory this is especially clear in the area between the florida keys and the everglades where relatively small values of τ wave produce current speed differences larger than 0 5 m s because of the wind stress our results suggest that the rs gradient alone can deflect particle trajectories by up to 1 km on the inner shelf and 5 km on the outer shelf fig 10a b the rs mainly affects transport processes during the passage of the hurricane as the distance between particle cloud advected by slim and slim swan currents remains roughly constant afterwards the stokes drift however has a longer lasting effect on the particle trajectories on the outer shelf when adding a stokes drift component to the eulerian currents the distances between the particle cloud centers keeps increasing during 2 days after the passage of irma fig 10b under the effect of the stokes drift particles from the outer shelf can be moved inshore on the passage of the hurricane this motion is less pronounced for particles that are advected by eulerian currents only the particle cloud thus moves quickly northeastward under the action of the fc after 2 days the particles advected inshore under the action of the stokes drift are in turn entrained by the fc and the distance between the clouds of particles starts decreasing the impact of the stokes drift on particle motion appears to be five times larger than the one of the rs on the inner shelf fig 10a however both processes yield a similar impact on the particle trajectories at the moment of the passage of hurricane irma on the outer shelf fig 10b taking wave currents interactions into account appears to significantly impact the modeled stokes drift fig 10c d our results suggest that neglecting the wave current coupling when computing the stokes drift in storm conditions can yield deflections of the particle trajectories by up to 5 km on both the inner and outer shelves on the outer shelf differences in particle trajectories mostly appear during the two days following the passage of the hurricane this is explained by the stronger shoreward component of the coupled slim swan stokes drift compared to the uncoupled one on the inner shelf however differences in particle trajectories of up to 5 km occur at the moment of the passage of hurricane irma the distance between the particle clouds then stabilizes directly after the passage of the hurricane 4 discussion the coupled slim swan model correctly reproduced the hydrodynamics and wave dynamics during hurricane irma such good agreement with field measurements could only be achieved using accurate forcings and adequate wave parameterizations by comparing coupled and uncoupled model runs we showed that neglecting wave radiation stress gradient can induce differences of up to 1 m s in modeled current velocities the radiation stress gradient during the hurricane was especially large over the shelf break where waves are strongly dissipated by the offshore coral reef barrier the radiation stress gradient alone can deflect drifting particles by up to 5 km during the passage of the hurricane the impact of the stokes drift dominates the effects of the radiation stress gradient on transport processes except during the passage of the hurricane when both contributions are similar on the outer shelf the stokes drift induces a shoreward transport during the passage of the hurricane that moves particles towards the inner shelf and hence away from the fc finally neglecting wave current interactions when computing stokes drift leads to variations of up to 5 km in modeled trajectories on the passage of the hurricane the coupled wave current model correctly reproduced the timing of the observed storm surges and captured the elevation peaks with a 15 accuracy at every tide gauge except virginia key such accuracy is key to predict the damages caused by the hurricane as they were mostly due to the storm surge and high waves xian et al 2018 furthermore by using a high resolution model we can explicitly reproduce the circulation between all the reefs and islands of the florida keys the fine scale details of the storm surge and hence the associated risk are thus accurately represented in addition to accurately capturing positive surges the model also reproduced the observed negative surge in naples this result is of interest from a biological point of view as negative surges although less studied affect water exchanges between the estuaries and the coastal ocean and disturb the benthic ecosystems liu et al 2020 such rapid decrease in water level followed by a positive surge cause massive freshwater inflows causing a significant decrease in water salinity wachnicka et al 2019 surface waters are also significantly impacted by storms and hurricanes through induced cooling upwelling and mixing varlas et al 2020 but these processes were not accounted for in our model strong currents such as the gulf stream affect waves through refraction over gradients in current velocity shoaling and breaking of opposing waves or lengthening of following waves hegermiller et al 2019 under hurricane conditions these interactions can cause numerical instabilities in the wave model if the parameterizations are not appropriate and the model resolution not sufficient hegermiller et al 2019 for instance used a 5 km model grid and 48 directional bins to capture spatial gradients in wave height induced by wave currents interactions in the gulf stream during hurricane matthew 2016 we followed these guidelines when defining the coarsest mesh resolution as the wave model spectral discretization boundary conditions and directional spreading of the incident waves also play a significant role when modeling wave current interactions at meso and submesoscales villas bôas et al 2020 which motivated our choice of imposing full spectra on the boundary of the wave model instead of bulk parameters tropical cyclones interact with the gulf stream and the fc through cooling and mixing of the upper ocean these interactions can momentarily disrupt these currents and cause a significant reduction of their transport oey et al 2007 ezer et al 2017 ezer 2020 as a 2d barotropic model slim does not explicitly capture the vertical structure of the fc and gulf stream furthermore a coupling with an atmospheric model would be required to represent heat fluxes between the upper ocean and the hurricane however we argue that a 2d model is sufficient for the scope of this study that focuses on nearshore processes on the shelf and the shelf slope furthermore by coupling the model with hycom slim is able to represent indirectly the baroclinic features such as the meandering of the fc and eddie formation frys et al 2020 furthermore using a 2d model allows us to capture the impact of wave current interactions on transport processes at the reef scale in the topologically complex coastal system of the frt such a fine resolution is key to estimate the amount of wave energy dissipated over offshore reefs and accurately capture the generated rs gradient the rs gradient significantly impacts currents during the passage of the hurricane it can induce differences of up to 1 m s in the current speed on the shelf break in this region waves are strongly dissipated due to action of depth induced breaking and bottom dissipation on coral reefs this link between wave breaking rs gradient and wave induced nearshore currents is consistent with previous studies on wave current dynamics during storms mao and xia 2017 2018 2020 furthermore our results highlight the protective role of coral reefs against strong incoming waves lowe et al 2005 which requires a sufficiently fine spatial resolution to be explicitly represented in the model as wave energy mostly dissipates on the shelf break the impact of the rs gradient on transport processes is 5 times larger on the outer shelf in the sheltered area of the inner shelf wave impact on transport processes is dominated by the stokes drift trajectory deflection under the influence of wave induced motions mostly occurs at the moment of the passage of the hurricane on the inner shelf after that moment the distance between the clouds of particles remained roughly constant through time on the outer shelf rs and stokes drift have a similar impact on transport processes at the moment of the passage of the cyclone and deflect particle trajectories by up to 5 km however by inducing shoreward transport the stokes drift delayed the advection of particles by the fc therefore causing differences in trajectories of up to 20 km during the days following the passage of the hurricane the dominance of the stokes drift on particle transport in storm conditions was also observed in lake michigan by mao and xia 2020 finally neglecting wave current coupling in stokes drift computation leads to differences in modeled trajectories of the order of 5 km on both the inner and the outer shelves this fact coupled with the impact of rs induced currents strongly advocates for the use of coupled wave current models when studying transport processes in storm conditions 5 conclusion we developed a coupled wave current model to study the impact of waves on transport processes during hurricane irma in order to accurately represent the wind and pressure profiles of the hurricane we built hybrid fields by combining coarser era 5 data with high resolution h wind data for the wind speed and idealized holland profiles for the pressure comparing these hybrid profiles with field observations showed that they were better at reproducing the observed central depression of the hurricane as well as the peak in wind speed than era 5 data using these hybrid fields as forcings our coupled model accurately reproduced the storm surge at tide gauge locations and produced currents and wave parameters in good agreement with field observations the modeled currents and stokes drift were then used to evaluate the impact of wave current coupling on the modeled trajectories of passive drifters on the passage of the hurricane through the florida keys our results show that waves had a significant impact on heavy wind transport processes and caused deflections of the drifters trajectories by more than 20 km on the outer shelf despite its good agreement with observations our model could be further refined by improving the representation of wind wave interactions in particular we did not consider the momentum loss due to the action of surface waves which can lead to overestimations of the momentum flux from the atmosphere to the ocean under hurricane conditions our model could therefore be further improved by using a wave dissipative stress instead of the full wind stress as the momentum flux from the atmosphere to the ocean as a 2d barotropic model slim does not explicitly represent heat fluxes between the ocean and the atmosphere and the vertical structure of the ocean however our study focused on relatively shallow and vertically homogeneous coastal waters using a reef scale resolution throughout the whole frt such fine resolution allows to explicitly represent wave dissipation over coral reefs and is only achievable using a 2d model due to computational resource limitations wave coupling needs to be taken into account during heavy wind events but not necessarily in milder conditions while the rs gradient plays an important role and can lead to differences of up to 5 km the stokes drift is about 4 times more intense and is thus the most important wave induced transport process nonetheless neglecting wave current coupling through rs when modeling stokes drift leads to differences of up to 5 km in predicted drifter trajectories such discrepancies reveal the strong influence of wave current interactions on transport under storm conditions this study brings new insight on the impact of waves on the transport processes nearshore during a tropical cyclone due to its fine spatial resolution our coupled wave current model can be used to accurately represent the dispersal of pollutants

23855,the intensity of major tropical cyclones has increased during the past decade their effect is particularly acute in coastal areas where they cause extensive damage leading to an influx of debris sediments and waste to the sea however most operational coastal ocean models do not represent heavy wind transport processes correctly if the hydrodynamics is not coupled with the wind generated waves this may lead to significant errors in ocean simulations under tropical cyclone conditions here we investigate current wave interactions during a major hurricane and assess their impact on transport processes we do that by coupling the unstructured mesh coastal ocean model slim with the spectral wave model swan and applying it to the florida reef tract during hurricane irma september 2017 we show that the coupled model successfully reproduces the wave behavior the storm surge and the ocean currents during the passage of the hurricane we then use the coupled and uncoupled wave current model to simulate the transport of passive drifters we show that the wave radiation stress gradient alone can lead to changes of up to 1 m s in the modeled currents which in turn leads to differences of up to 5 km in the position of drifting material over the duration of the hurricane the stokes drift however appears to cause deflections up to 4 times larger and hence dominates wave induced transport wave current interactions therefore strongly impact the transport of drifting material such as sediments and debris in the aftermath of a hurricane they should thus be taken into account in order to correctly assess its overall impact keywords hurricane ocean transport wave current interactions stokes drift unstructured mesh ocean model 1 introduction major hurricanes are becoming more intense under the effect of global warming bhatia et al 2019 knutson et al 2020 better understanding their repercussions on coastal areas becomes therefore critical however estimating the impact of hurricanes on the coastal ocean circulation remains a challenge understanding wave current interactions and representing their impact on coastal ocean transport processes is central to many coastal activities such as dredging erosion management oil and gas activities search and rescue and insurance bever and macwilliams 2013 li and johns 1998 breivik et al 2013 all these activities require wave current models to predict the impact of tropical cyclones on the coastal circulation and on the sea surface elevation wave current interactions during a cyclone are highly nonlinear and vary significantly in space and time wu et al 2011 wave induced currents are generated by wave radiation stress gradients longuet higgins 1970 affecting water levels near shorelines and wave breaking points longuet higgins and stewart 1964 changes in water levels and currents in turn affect the motion and evolution of the waves sikirić et al 2013 coupled wave current models hence require the calculation of the full directional wave spectrum in order to correctly reproduce the dynamics of wind driven surface waves this is usually achieved by spectral wave models which describe the evolution of the wave energy spectrum as of today the most popular spectral wave models are the wave model wam wamdi group 1988 simulating wave nearshore swan booij et al 1999 and wavewatch iii tolman et al 2009 among these models swan has been specifically developed for coastal applications as it represents depth induced wave breaking and triad wave wave interactions using numerical techniques adapted to small scale shallow water regions booij et al 1999 wavewatch iii has also recently been equipped with new parallelization algorithm domain decomposition and numerical schemes for high resolution coastal applications ww3dg 2019 abdolali et al 2020 coastal oceans are characterized by the complex topography of the coastline and the presence of islands reefs and artificial structures traditional structured grid models lack the flexibility to simulate near shore processes at a sufficiently small scale although the use of nested structured grids allows local grid refinement warner et al 2010 staircase like representation of complex coastal topographies cannot be avoided instead unstructured mesh models easily adapt to the topography and are hence better suited to coastal processes fringer et al 2019 capturing the impact of the topography on wave interactions becomes even more important in the case of tropical cyclones heavy winds generate large wind waves and disturb ocean conditions liu et al 2020 by causing coastal upwellings on continental shelves smith 1982 and inducing strong currents waves and storm surges in nearshore and coastal regions dietrich et al 2010 weisberg and zheng 2006 ocean waves act as the dynamical interface between the atmosphere and the ocean through this interface tropical cyclones cause a cooling of the upper ocean layer by vertical mixing and heat transfer aijaz et al 2017 varlas et al 2020 by altering the structure of the upper ocean hurricane can cause the disruption of major ocean currents such as the florida current and gulf stream oey et al 2007 interaction with hurricanes alters the thermal structure of these currents and can cause a significant decline of their flow resulting in delayed increased coastal levels along their path even in locations out of reach of the hurricane itself ezer et al 2017 ezer 2018 2020 near the storm heavy wind conditions also affect material transport at the ocean surface the transport of drifting objects or substances that are locally released is often best represented by a lagrangian individual based model such an approach is routinely used to model the dispersal of larvae pollutants sediments and many other tracers e g le hénaff et al 2012 liubartseva et al 2018 figueiredo et al 2013 frys et al 2020 although some transport model might take wave induced currents into account most of them neglect wave current interactions which can lead to significant errors in storm conditions röhrs et al 2012 curcic et al 2016 niu and xia 2017 and mao and xia 2018 2020 investigated the impact of wave current interactions during storm event in lakes and inlets however to our knowledge there have been no similar studies on the impact of hurricane induced wave current interactions in coastal environments such as the florida reef tract frt where changes in transport processes might significantly impact the biological connectivity the main questions we want to answer in this study are the following 1 how important are wave current interactions during a tropical cyclone 2 what effect do they have on the transport of drifting material we tackle these issues by investigating the transport of drifting particles on the florida shelf during hurricane irma one of the strongest and costliest tropical cyclones on record in the atlantic basin xian et al 2018 which made landfall in florida in september 2017 to do that we developed an unstructured mesh coupled wave current model of the whole frt to simulate the ocean circulation under hurricane conditions both modeled currents and waves were validated against field measurements and then used to simulate the transport of drifting material in the florida keys and over the florida inner shelf model outputs were then compared with uncoupled simulation results in order to assess the impact of the radiation stress gradient and stokes drift on the modeled currents and transport 2 methods 2 1 study area and observational data we study the ocean circulation in an area that covers the whole frt and includes the northwestern end of the gulf of mexico and the straits of florida fig 1 the large scale ocean circulation around south florida is dominated by the florida current fc which originates from the loop current lc where it enters the florida straits from the gulf of mexico and downstream forms the gulf stream the fc is a major western boundary current characterized by spatial variability and meandering associated with the presence of cyclonic eddies between the core of the current and the complex reef topography of the frt lee et al 1995 kourafalou and kang 2012 the variability of the fc extends over a large range of spatial and temporal scales with periods of 30 70 days in the lower keys lee et al 1995 and shorter periods of 2 21 days in the upper keys lee and mayer 1977 and exhibits significant seasonal and interannual cycles johns and schott 1987 lee and williams 1988 schott et al 1988 circulation on the west florida shelf wfs on the other hand is forced by local winds and tidal fluctuations lee and smith 2002 liu and weisberg 2012 furthermore due to its location relative to the warm waters of the north atlantic florida is particularly vulnerable to tropical cyclones on average the state is hit by a hurricane every two years and strong hurricanes some of which are among the most destructive on record strike florida on average once every four years malmstadt et al 2009 the state of the ocean around florida is monitored by an extensive array of tide gauges current meters and buoys in this study we used sea surface elevation measurements from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa tides and currents dataset these measurements were taken at four locations two in the florida keys key west and vaca key one on the east coast of florida virginia key and one on the west coast naples for the currents we used adcp measurements from the university of south florida s college of marine science s usf cms coastal ocean monitoring and prediction system comps for the wfs weisberg et al 2009 more specifically we used measurements from moorings c10 c12 and c13 respectively located at the 25 50 and 50 m isobaths of the wfs liu et al 2020 finally for the waves we used measurements from four buoys of the noaa s national data buoy center ndbc two on florida s eastern shelf and two on the wfs the locations of all measurement stations are shown in fig 1 2 2 wind and atmospheric pressure during hurricane irma hurricane irma made landfall in florida on 10 september 2017 as a category 4 hurricane at cudjoe key florida keys and later as a category 3 hurricane on marco island south of naples see hurricane track in fig 1 it then weakened to a category 2 hurricane as it moved further inland cangialosi et al 2018 the storm damaged up to 75 of the buildings at its landfall point in the florida keys making it one of the strongest and costliest hurricanes on record in the atlantic basin xian et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the strongest reported sustained winds on marco island were 50 m s while the highest recorded storm surge was 2 3 m although larger wind speed likely occurred in the florida keys pinelli et al 2018 to reproduce the wind profile of irma in our model we used high resolution h wind wind fields powell et al 1998 as these data represent 1 min averaged wind speeds we multiplied them by a factor 0 93 to obtain 10 min averaged wind speeds harper et al 2010 this operation reduces the erratic values caused by the greater variance of mean winds measured over periods shorter than 10 minutes furthermore h wind wind profiles did not cover the whole model extent during the passage of the hurricane and were thus blended within a coarser wind field extracted from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era 5 dataset fig 2a the pressure field during the passage of hurricane irma was also reconstructed using era 5 data however the coarse resolution of the dataset smoothes out the depression at the center of the hurricane leading to an underestimation of the pressure gradient fig 2b to better capture the central depression of irma we therefore built a hybrid pressure field using the position and the minimal pressure of the core of the hurricane based on its track as recorded in the hurricane databases hurdat 2 landsea and franklin 2013 based on this information the hybrid pressure field was constructed by combining an idealized holland pressure profile lin and chavas 2012 within the radius of maximum wind speed of irma knaff et al 2018 with era 5 pressure field the transition from the holland profile to era 5 data outside the radius of maximum wind speed data was performed using a smooth step function fig 2 2 3 hydrodynamic model ocean currents generated during hurricane irma around south florida were modeled using the 2d barotropic version of the unstructured mesh second generation louvain la neuve ice ocean model 1 1 https www slim ocean be slim lambrechts et al 2008 the model mesh covers an area similar to the model extent of dobbelaere et al 2020 that includes the frt but also the florida straits and part of the gulf of mexico fig 1 however this area has been slightly extended northeastward and westward in order to include the noaa ndbc buoys furthermore to withstand potential cell drying during the hurricane we solved the conservative shallow water equations with wetting drying 1 h t u 0 u t u u h f e z u α g h h h 1 ρ p atm 1 ρ τ s ν u c

wet grid cells that may become dry under the influence of the hurricane as in frys et al 2020 and dobbelaere et al 2020 slim currents were gradually relaxed towards the operational navy hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom product goml0 04 2 2 https www hycom org data goml0pt04 chassignet et al 2007 in regions where the water depth exceeds 50 m hycom s 3d currents were depth integrated into 2d transports to be used as forcing in the model moreover these transports as well as hycom s sea surface elevation were used as boundary condition in the model we adapted the parameterization of the wind induced surface stress to storm conditions at very high wind speeds the white cap is blown off the crest of the waves this phenomenon also known as spume has been hypothesized to generate a layer of droplets that acts as a slip layer for the winds at the ocean atmosphere interface holthuijsen et al 2012 it causes a saturation of the wind drag coefficient for strong winds powell et al 2003 donelan et al 2004 curcic and haus 2020 we take this saturation effect into account by using the wind drag parameterization of moon et al 2007 in this parameterization the drag coefficient c d depends on the wind speed at 10 m height u 10 according to 2 c d κ 2 log 10 z 0 2 where κ is the von karman constant and z 0 is the roughness length expressed as 3 z 0 0 0185 g u 2 if u 10 12 5 m s 0 085 0 56 u 2 20 255 u if u 10 12 5 m s 2 458 0 58 1 0 3 with u the friction velocity the relation between u 10 and u is given by 4 u 10 0 56 u 2 20 255 u 2 458 the mesh resolution depends on the distance to the coastlines and reefs following the approach of dobbelaere et al 2020 the mesh is then further refined according to bathymetry value and gradient as suggested in the swan user guide 3 3 http swanmodel sourceforge net unswan unswan htm such an approach improves the model efficiency as the mesh resolution is only increased where required by the currents and waves dynamics the mesh was generated with the seamsh 4 4 https pypi org project seamsh python library which is based on the open source mesh generator gmsh geuzaine and remacle 2009 it is composed of approximately 7 7 10 5 elements the coarsest elements far away from the frt have a characteristic length of about 5 km whereas the finest elements have a characteristic length of about 100 m along the coastlines and over the reefs fig 1 2 4 wave model waves were modeled using the parallel unstructured mesh version of the simulating waves nearshore swan model booij et al 1999 one of the most popular wave models for coastal areas and inland waters it solves the action balance equation mei 1989 5 n t x c g u n θ c θ n σ c σ n s i n s d s s n l σ where n e σ is the wave action density and e is the wave energy spectrum θ is the wave propagation direction σ is the intrinsic wave frequency c g is the wave group velocity u u h is slim depth averaged current velocity c θ and c σ are the propagation velocities in spectral space due to refraction and shifting in frequency due to variations in depth and currents and s i n s d s and s n l respectively represent wave growth by wind wave decay and nonlinear transfers of wave energy through four and three wave interactions i e quadruplets and triplets the wave spectra were discretized with 48 direction bins and 50 frequency bins logarithmically distributed from 0 03 to 2 hz exponential wind growth was parameterized using the formulation of janssen 1991 while dissipations by whitecapping and bottom dissipation followed the formulations of komen et al 1984 and madsen et al 1989 respectively coefficients for exponential wind growth and whitecapping parameterizations were based on the results of siadatmousavi et al 2011 and significantly differ from swan s default settings by default swan implements the wind input formulation of komen et al 1984 and the steepness dependent coefficient governing dissipation by whitecapping is a linear function of the wavenumber in this study this steepness dependent coefficient is a quadratic function of the wavenumber as it showed better predictions of the significant wave height in the study of siadatmousavi et al 2011 the choice of these formulations was motivated by the appearance of numerical instabilities in the region of the gulf stream when using swan s default parameter values finally era 5 wave spectra was used as boundary condition for swan wave spectra is obtained from the ocean wave model wam and is given on a 1 1 grid with 24 directions and 36 frequencies surface waves induce a net drift in the direction of the wave propagation known as the stokes drift van den bremer and breivik 2018 stokes 1880 this net drift has a significant impact on sediment transport in nearshore regions hoefel and elgar 2003 on the formation of langmuir cells langmuir 1938 craik and leibovich 1976 as well as on the transport of heat salt or pollutants such as oil or micro plastic in the upper ocean layer mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 röhrs et al 2012 drivdal et al 2014 to correctly model the stokes drift profile in mixed wind driven sea and swell conditions the full two dimensional wave spectrum must be represented by a spectral wave model within a wave current coupling van den bremer and breivik 2018 we therefore used swan modeled spectra to compute the stokes drift as follows 6 u s 0 2 π 0 σ 3 h tanh 2 k h e σ θ cos θ sin θ d σ d θ where k is the norm of the wave vector h is the water depth and e σ θ is the wave energy density the computed stokes drift velocity is then added to slim depth averaged current velocity to transport drifting particles in the experiments described in section 2 6 2 5 coupled model slim and swan are coupled so that they run on the same computational core and the same unstructured mesh slim is run first and passes the wind velocity u 10 water level η h h and depth averaged current u u h fields to swan as well as a roughness length z 0 for the bottom dissipation formulation of madsen et al 1989 this roughness length is computed from slim s bulk drag coefficient c b following the approach of dietrich et al 2011 so that both models have consistent bottom dissipation parameterizations swan then uses these quantities to compute the wave radiation stress gradient that is then passed to slim as the force exerted by waves on currents τ wave fig 3 slim then uses this quantity to update the value of the surface stress τ s in eq 1 that now becomes the sum of wind and wave induced stresses τ s τ wind τ wave here the momentum flux from the atmosphere to the ocean is taken as the usual full wind stress τ wind doing so we neglect the momentum advected away from the storm by the waves leading to a 10 15 overestimation of the momentum flux in hurricane winds curcic 2015 we followed the approach of dietrich et al 2012 by characterizing the wave induced forces on currents using the radiation stress rs gradient formalism which has been successfully applied in both 2d and 3d coupled wave current models under storm conditions hope et al 2013 sebastian et al 2014 brown et al 2013 an alternative formalism is the vortex force vf representation mcwilliams et al 2004 that provides a clearer decomposition of the wave effect lane et al 2007 although both approaches were adopted by coastal modeling communities there is an ongoing scientific debate over the correctness and applicability of the two concepts ardhuin et al 2008 mellor 2013 2015 ardhuin et al 2017 xia et al 2020 recently implemented the two formalisms in a 3d unstructured grid model and compared them in three typical coastal systems showing that the 3d rs algorithm could generate unrealistic offshore currents near shorelines despite these shortcomings the 3d rs method reproduced most wave induced currents and the 2d rs formalism remains a well validated modeling approach furthermore mellor 2013 showed that the rs approach was valid when h x sinh k h 2 is smaller or of the same order as k a 2 where a is the wave amplitude we evaluated these quantities and verified that the validity criterion was met in our model domain additionally since the vf and rs approaches are formally equivalent lane et al 2007 we selected the 2d rs formalism as it has the advantage of summarizing the impact of waves on the currents in a single additional stress term in the hydrodynamic model equations slim s governing equations are integrated using an implicit time integration scheme while swan is unconditionally stable dietrich et al 2012 allowing both models to be run with relatively large time steps in this study the stationary version of swan was used i e the first term of eq 5 was set to zero this resulted in reduced scaling and convergence rates than with the nonstationary version of swan but increased the model stability the wave spectra at each node of the mesh was saved at the end of each iteration to serve as initial conditions for the next one both models were run sequentially using a time step of 600 s so that each computational core was alternatively running either slim or swan as in the coupling between swan and the advanced circulation model adcirc dietrich et al 2012 both models use the same local sub mesh allowing for a one to one correspondence between the geographic locations of the mesh vertices no interpolation is therefore needed when passing the discretized variables from one model to the other which allows an efficient inter model communication however as slim is based on a discontinuous galerkin finite element method an additional conversion step to a continuous framework was required to transfer slim nodal quantities to swan the coupling increases the computation time by 3 as compared to the sum of the uncoupled slim and swan simulations wall clock times for the same number of cpus and the same simulation period 2 6 quantifying the effect of wave current interactions on transport to quantify the impact of wave current interactions on transport processes we compared the trajectories of passive particles advected by the uncoupled slim and coupled slim swan currents during the passage of irma in the lower keys furthermore the depth averaged stokes drift was computed using the wave spectra of the coupled model slim swan run as well as those of an uncoupled swan run particles were released on the inner and outer shelves at the points highlighted by red and blue dots in fig 4 on sept 7 at 0000 utc and then tracked until sept 15 these initial particle positions were found using backtracking methods spivakovskaya et al 2005 to ensure that the release particles would intersect the path of irma during its passage through the florida keys we first defined two 25 km 2 circular regions on the trajectory of the hurricane see red and blue circles in fig 4 particles within these two regions were then tracked backward in time using uncoupled slim currents from the exact time of the passage of the hurricane until sept 7 at 0000 utc their positions at the end of the backward simulation see red and blue particle clouds in fig 4 corresponds to the initial condition of the forward transport simulations described below we then compared the trajectories of particles originating from these regions and advected forward in time by different sets of currents i uncoupled slim currents alone ii coupled slim swan currents iii slim currents with the addition of the depth averaged stokes drift computed with the coupled wave current model stokes c iv slim swan currents with stokes c and v slim currents with the depth averaged stokes drift computed with the uncoupled wave model stokes u the different combinations of eulerian currents and stokes drifts used to model the transport of passive drifters in the lower keys during the passage of irma are summarized in table 1 particle trajectories are compared by computing the distances between the centers of mass of the particle clouds through time 3 results we first validated the reconstructed atmospheric fields of hurricane irma as well as the outputs of our coupled wave current model against field measurements we then used the validated model outputs to simulate the transport of passive particles in the lower keys during the passage of hurricane irma these particles were advected by the sets of currents described in table 1 and their trajectories were compared to evaluate the impact of the wave current interactions and the stokes drift on the transport processes during the passage of irma 3 1 model validation h wind winds and hybrid pressure field agree well with station measurements at vaca key station fig 5 the hybrid pressure field shows a better agreement with observations than era 5 pressure as it successfully reproduces the storm depression era 5 fields on the other hand fail to reproduce the low pressure at the core of the hurricane due to their coarser grid leading to an overestimation of 8 mbar of the storm depression both h wind and era 5 agree well with observed wind speeds although both data sets tend to slightly overestimate the width and intensity of the wind peak however h wind profiles better reproduce the timing of the observed peak as era 5 winds tend to anticipate it h wind also exhibits a slightly narrower peak in wind speed which better agrees with observations hydrodynamic outputs of the coupled wave current model agree well with tide gauge fig 6 and adcp measurements fig 7 the coupled model reproduces well the timing of the positive and negative storm surges at all tide gauge locations the amplitude of the positive surges are especially well captured at naples and vaca key with errors of 2 and 6 centimeters respectively however the model underestimates the positive surges at virginia key and key west by 24 and 15 at the peak respectively the amplitude of the negative surge at naples is also underestimated by about 16 at the peak nonetheless on average the absolute error between the model and observations does not exceed 10 cm table 2 modeled 2d currents were validated against depth averaged adcp measurements at mooring stations c10 c12 and c13 fig 7 as in liu et al 2020 we performed the vector correlation analysis of kundu 1976 to compare modeled and observed current velocity vectors correlation coefficients ρ between simulated and observed depth averaged currents are 0 87 0 84 and 0 81 at stations c10 c12 and c13 respectively the average veering angles are below 12 as in liu et al 2020 furthermore the positive bias in table 2 indicates that our model tends to underestimate the southward component of the currents at the different stations as expected from a depth averaged model the best fit with observations is obtained at the shallowest mooring c10 located on the 25 m isobath the simulated significant wave height agrees well with observations at all buoy locations fig 8 the timing of the peak in wave height is well captured at all buoys while the amplitude is better reproduced on the wfs buoys 42036 and 42097 with errors below 10 the error on the peak amplitude on florida s eastern shelf is of 13 and 21 at buoys 4114 and 4113 respectively on average observed significant wave height and wave period are better reproduced on the wfs while wave direction is better captured by the model on florida s eastern shelf table 2 the fit is especially good at buoy 41113 where the mostly westward northwestward wave propagation is less perturbed by irma s wind field 3 2 impact of waves on currents and transport we evaluated the impact of the rs gradient on the modeled currents during the passage of irma in the lower keys between sept 7 and 13 2017 first we computed the maximum difference between currents modeled by slim and slim swan during this period fig 9a the largest differences in current speed were observed over the reefs on the shelf break and around islands they locally reach 1 m s with the coupled slim swan model yielding the largest amplitudes the regions where the differences were the largest correspond to areas that experienced large maximum values of the rs gradient τ wave fig 9b these areas of large rs gradient are located on the shelf break and over coral reefs where important wave energy dissipation occurred through depth induced wave breaking and bottom dissipation longuet higgins and stewart 1964 this highlights the important protective role of the barrier formed by the offshore reefs that require a fine spatial resolution to be accurately represented by the model rs induced differences in current speed were amplified by the action of the wind stress τ wind fig 9c wind speeds were larger in the front right quadrant of the hurricane zedler et al 2009 yielding larger differences on the right hand side of the storm trajectory this is especially clear in the area between the florida keys and the everglades where relatively small values of τ wave produce current speed differences larger than 0 5 m s because of the wind stress our results suggest that the rs gradient alone can deflect particle trajectories by up to 1 km on the inner shelf and 5 km on the outer shelf fig 10a b the rs mainly affects transport processes during the passage of the hurricane as the distance between particle cloud advected by slim and slim swan currents remains roughly constant afterwards the stokes drift however has a longer lasting effect on the particle trajectories on the outer shelf when adding a stokes drift component to the eulerian currents the distances between the particle cloud centers keeps increasing during 2 days after the passage of irma fig 10b under the effect of the stokes drift particles from the outer shelf can be moved inshore on the passage of the hurricane this motion is less pronounced for particles that are advected by eulerian currents only the particle cloud thus moves quickly northeastward under the action of the fc after 2 days the particles advected inshore under the action of the stokes drift are in turn entrained by the fc and the distance between the clouds of particles starts decreasing the impact of the stokes drift on particle motion appears to be five times larger than the one of the rs on the inner shelf fig 10a however both processes yield a similar impact on the particle trajectories at the moment of the passage of hurricane irma on the outer shelf fig 10b taking wave currents interactions into account appears to significantly impact the modeled stokes drift fig 10c d our results suggest that neglecting the wave current coupling when computing the stokes drift in storm conditions can yield deflections of the particle trajectories by up to 5 km on both the inner and outer shelves on the outer shelf differences in particle trajectories mostly appear during the two days following the passage of the hurricane this is explained by the stronger shoreward component of the coupled slim swan stokes drift compared to the uncoupled one on the inner shelf however differences in particle trajectories of up to 5 km occur at the moment of the passage of hurricane irma the distance between the particle clouds then stabilizes directly after the passage of the hurricane 4 discussion the coupled slim swan model correctly reproduced the hydrodynamics and wave dynamics during hurricane irma such good agreement with field measurements could only be achieved using accurate forcings and adequate wave parameterizations by comparing coupled and uncoupled model runs we showed that neglecting wave radiation stress gradient can induce differences of up to 1 m s in modeled current velocities the radiation stress gradient during the hurricane was especially large over the shelf break where waves are strongly dissipated by the offshore coral reef barrier the radiation stress gradient alone can deflect drifting particles by up to 5 km during the passage of the hurricane the impact of the stokes drift dominates the effects of the radiation stress gradient on transport processes except during the passage of the hurricane when both contributions are similar on the outer shelf the stokes drift induces a shoreward transport during the passage of the hurricane that moves particles towards the inner shelf and hence away from the fc finally neglecting wave current interactions when computing stokes drift leads to variations of up to 5 km in modeled trajectories on the passage of the hurricane the coupled wave current model correctly reproduced the timing of the observed storm surges and captured the elevation peaks with a 15 accuracy at every tide gauge except virginia key such accuracy is key to predict the damages caused by the hurricane as they were mostly due to the storm surge and high waves xian et al 2018 furthermore by using a high resolution model we can explicitly reproduce the circulation between all the reefs and islands of the florida keys the fine scale details of the storm surge and hence the associated risk are thus accurately represented in addition to accurately capturing positive surges the model also reproduced the observed negative surge in naples this result is of interest from a biological point of view as negative surges although less studied affect water exchanges between the estuaries and the coastal ocean and disturb the benthic ecosystems liu et al 2020 such rapid decrease in water level followed by a positive surge cause massive freshwater inflows causing a significant decrease in water salinity wachnicka et al 2019 surface waters are also significantly impacted by storms and hurricanes through induced cooling upwelling and mixing varlas et al 2020 but these processes were not accounted for in our model strong currents such as the gulf stream affect waves through refraction over gradients in current velocity shoaling and breaking of opposing waves or lengthening of following waves hegermiller et al 2019 under hurricane conditions these interactions can cause numerical instabilities in the wave model if the parameterizations are not appropriate and the model resolution not sufficient hegermiller et al 2019 for instance used a 5 km model grid and 48 directional bins to capture spatial gradients in wave height induced by wave currents interactions in the gulf stream during hurricane matthew 2016 we followed these guidelines when defining the coarsest mesh resolution as the wave model spectral discretization boundary conditions and directional spreading of the incident waves also play a significant role when modeling wave current interactions at meso and submesoscales villas bôas et al 2020 which motivated our choice of imposing full spectra on the boundary of the wave model instead of bulk parameters tropical cyclones interact with the gulf stream and the fc through cooling and mixing of the upper ocean these interactions can momentarily disrupt these currents and cause a significant reduction of their transport oey et al 2007 ezer et al 2017 ezer 2020 as a 2d barotropic model slim does not explicitly capture the vertical structure of the fc and gulf stream furthermore a coupling with an atmospheric model would be required to represent heat fluxes between the upper ocean and the hurricane however we argue that a 2d model is sufficient for the scope of this study that focuses on nearshore processes on the shelf and the shelf slope furthermore by coupling the model with hycom slim is able to represent indirectly the baroclinic features such as the meandering of the fc and eddie formation frys et al 2020 furthermore using a 2d model allows us to capture the impact of wave current interactions on transport processes at the reef scale in the topologically complex coastal system of the frt such a fine resolution is key to estimate the amount of wave energy dissipated over offshore reefs and accurately capture the generated rs gradient the rs gradient significantly impacts currents during the passage of the hurricane it can induce differences of up to 1 m s in the current speed on the shelf break in this region waves are strongly dissipated due to action of depth induced breaking and bottom dissipation on coral reefs this link between wave breaking rs gradient and wave induced nearshore currents is consistent with previous studies on wave current dynamics during storms mao and xia 2017 2018 2020 furthermore our results highlight the protective role of coral reefs against strong incoming waves lowe et al 2005 which requires a sufficiently fine spatial resolution to be explicitly represented in the model as wave energy mostly dissipates on the shelf break the impact of the rs gradient on transport processes is 5 times larger on the outer shelf in the sheltered area of the inner shelf wave impact on transport processes is dominated by the stokes drift trajectory deflection under the influence of wave induced motions mostly occurs at the moment of the passage of the hurricane on the inner shelf after that moment the distance between the clouds of particles remained roughly constant through time on the outer shelf rs and stokes drift have a similar impact on transport processes at the moment of the passage of the cyclone and deflect particle trajectories by up to 5 km however by inducing shoreward transport the stokes drift delayed the advection of particles by the fc therefore causing differences in trajectories of up to 20 km during the days following the passage of the hurricane the dominance of the stokes drift on particle transport in storm conditions was also observed in lake michigan by mao and xia 2020 finally neglecting wave current coupling in stokes drift computation leads to differences in modeled trajectories of the order of 5 km on both the inner and the outer shelves this fact coupled with the impact of rs induced currents strongly advocates for the use of coupled wave current models when studying transport processes in storm conditions 5 conclusion we developed a coupled wave current model to study the impact of waves on transport processes during hurricane irma in order to accurately represent the wind and pressure profiles of the hurricane we built hybrid fields by combining coarser era 5 data with high resolution h wind data for the wind speed and idealized holland profiles for the pressure comparing these hybrid profiles with field observations showed that they were better at reproducing the observed central depression of the hurricane as well as the peak in wind speed than era 5 data using these hybrid fields as forcings our coupled model accurately reproduced the storm surge at tide gauge locations and produced currents and wave parameters in good agreement with field observations the modeled currents and stokes drift were then used to evaluate the impact of wave current coupling on the modeled trajectories of passive drifters on the passage of the hurricane through the florida keys our results show that waves had a significant impact on heavy wind transport processes and caused deflections of the drifters trajectories by more than 20 km on the outer shelf despite its good agreement with observations our model could be further refined by improving the representation of wind wave interactions in particular we did not consider the momentum loss due to the action of surface waves which can lead to overestimations of the momentum flux from the atmosphere to the ocean under hurricane conditions our model could therefore be further improved by using a wave dissipative stress instead of the full wind stress as the momentum flux from the atmosphere to the ocean as a 2d barotropic model slim does not explicitly represent heat fluxes between the ocean and the atmosphere and the vertical structure of the ocean however our study focused on relatively shallow and vertically homogeneous coastal waters using a reef scale resolution throughout the whole frt such fine resolution allows to explicitly represent wave dissipation over coral reefs and is only achievable using a 2d model due to computational resource limitations wave coupling needs to be taken into account during heavy wind events but not necessarily in milder conditions while the rs gradient plays an important role and can lead to differences of up to 5 km the stokes drift is about 4 times more intense and is thus the most important wave induced transport process nonetheless neglecting wave current coupling through rs when modeling stokes drift leads to differences of up to 5 km in predicted drifter trajectories such discrepancies reveal the strong influence of wave current interactions on transport under storm conditions this study brings new insight on the impact of waves on the transport processes nearshore during a tropical cyclone due to its fine spatial resolution our coupled wave current model can be used to accurately represent the dispersal of pollutants

23856,in this study we present a new parameterization for the enhancement of vertical mixing brought by the inclusion of the stokes drift for the turbulent mixing schemes in ocean circulation models the new scheme kpp lt uses the k profile parameterization large et al 1994 as a template and attempts to include the effect of the penetration decay scale of the stokes drift δ and the misalignment between the wind stress and stokes drift θ w w the effect of the wind wave angle of misalignment is guided by a set of idealized large eddy simulations les and the langmuir turbulence lt parameterization is developed based on les of the ocean surface boundary layer at ocean weather station papa for a period of 20 days under observed atmospheric and oceanic conditions the kpp lt model is implemented in the navy coastal ocean model ncom and compared to in situ oceanographic measurements les and other second moment closure smc schemes available in ncom namely the model of kantha and clayson 2004 and harcourt 2013 2015 comparisons with temperature observations suggest better performance of the kpp lt model over smc models within the boundary layer which are supported by comparisons of inertially averaged eddy viscosity profiles estimated from les keywords langmuir turbulence kpp ncom ocean surface boundary layer vertical mixing 1 introduction ocean models based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations use turbulence parameterizations to model the effect of unresolved motions on the mean flow turbulence models aimed at simulating the dynamics of the upper ocean determine the extent and relative influence that surface fluxes heat and freshwater and temperature distributions have on turbulent motions and how these redistribute momentum and heat in the past few decades langmuir turbulence lt has been recognized as an important source of turbulent energy in the upper ocean significantly affecting the mean velocity and scalar flux profiles within the mixed layer mcwilliams et al 1997 2012 although lt is now regarded as a contributing and often dominant factor driving turbulent processes that transport heat and momentum in the upper layers of oceans and lakes global simulations using different lt closure schemes show significant discrepancies in the resulting temperature distributions li et al 2019 several different parameterizations have been proposed based on second moment closure smc models e g kantha and clayson 2004 harcourt 2013 2015 and models based on the k profile parameterization kpp mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 smyth et al 2002 van roekel et al 2018 li and fox kemper 2017 to simulate the effects of lt this study aims to assess the performance of different turbulent parameterization models that seek to simulate the effects of lt using the navy coastal ocean model ncom under realistic forcing conditions and propose a parameterization for the enhancement i e the additional turbulent mixing of the turbulent eddy viscosity in the presence of lt based on large eddy simulations les forced by observed wind and waves the proposed model presented here hereafter kpp lt is based on the kpp model large et al 1994 as well as subsequent model improvements that account for lt e g smyth et al 2002 li and fox kemper 2017 and further attempts to take into account the effects of wind wave angle of misalignment van roekel et al 2012 and stokes drift decay scale kukulka and harcourt 2017 we find that the effect of misaligned stokes drift and wind direction has significant impact on the diagnosed eddy viscosity profiles in idealized les under weakly convective conditions this is obscured in realistic les configurations where strong convection is often dominant over lt but important differences in turbulent intensities are still observed between aligned and misaligned wind waves in realistic les experiments fan et al 2020 to assess the overall performance of the models results are validated with observed sea surface temperature sst and mixed layer depth mld which provide a bulk measure of the total mixing strength however we also emphasize the shape and magnitude of inertially averaged eddy viscosity profiles to elucidate local mixing effects especially in contrast to smc models although we recognize that non local transport effects are important we focus on local transport since the models considered here formulate fluxes as downgradient large et al 2019a b a drawback of some turbulence closure models attempting to simulate the effects of lt in the ocean is the use of idealized les experiments in the development of the model parameterization and tuning of model constants these approximations are useful because they significantly reduce the complexity of ocean dynamics that facilitates the development of turbulence parameterizations and are necessary in understanding the dynamics of turbulent components individually however in practice ocean models using turbulence parameterizations developed under idealized conditions are expected to simulate ocean dynamics under realistic forcing conditions accurately with the implication that the ocean model solution is only weakly affected by these approximations for example the model developed by kantha and clayson 1994 2004 tunes its constants to constant forcing simulations in contrast kpp models are more empirical in nature using ocean observations to tune model constants for example the kpp of large et al 1994 uses ocean weather station papa ows p data in the original formulation by tuning model constants to match observations the kpp scheme also has the downside of obscuring physically relevant effects such as lt which results in ocean models including unknown effects implicitly additionally turbulence models may be biased towards the conditions under which they were developed for example the lt parameterization by reichl et al 2016 that aims to simulate the dynamics of the ocean under hurricane conditions in which rapid ml deepening is expected yields good results under those conditions but significantly overestimates the mixed layer deepening in global simulations li et al 2019 therefore turbulence models may benefit from being developed and tuned under the conditions that they are expected to simulate due to the large computational cost associated with high resolution les simulations we choose to follow similar studies large et al 2019a to test and tune our parameterization under a wide range typical oceanic forcing conditions using surface fluxes computed from in situ observations more recently numerical les experiments have addressed some of the complexities of ocean conditions namely characterizing waves from an observed spectrum non constant wind forcing and misaligned wind waves failing to account for directional wave spreading and multidirectional wave effects can lead to overestimating the mean stokes drift magnitude by 20 40 in addition to a directional veer with depth webb and fox kemper 2015 characterizing broadband waves with a langmuir number based on a stokes drift profile is a significant complication from a modeling standpoint but appears to provide sufficient information about the wave forcing to be an effective independent variable large et al 2019a numerical studies under tropical cyclone conditions show the importance of explicitly including sea state dependent impact of lt especially wind wave misalignment reichl et al 2016 and further suggest the use of lagrangian instead of eulerian currents to characterize the combined wind wave effects van roekel et al 2012 intercomparison of the most recent kpp modifications van roekel et al 2018 li et al 2019 clearly show that there is no clear way to characterize wave effects under all possible situations and significant uncertainty remains regarding the nonlocal flux parameterization due to these uncertainties in our study we choose to focus on the local flux parameterization and follow the suggestions from recent literature van roekel et al 2018 li et al 2019 large et al 2019a to test and tune our parameterization under a wide range typical oceanic forcing conditions using surface fluxes computed from in situ observations this study presents the results of les experiments at ocean weather station papa hereafter ows p during a 20 day period with a range of oceanic and atmospheric conditions representative of the combined langmuir and convective turbulence dominant in the global ocean li et al 2019 fig 12 the model is initialized by measured temperature and salinity with surface fluxes computed from observed wind and wave measurements experiments with and without the effect of lt are performed to elucidate the enhancement of turbulence in the presence of the wave generated stokes drift these simulations are used to develop a model for the enhancement of the eddy viscosity brought by the presence of lt that is instead of parameterizing the eddy viscosity k we aim to parameterize the difference in eddy viscosity δ k between simulations with and without wave forcing the parameterization is based on the non local kpp scheme large et al 1994 now commonly used in ocean models where we reconsider the original assumptions and approximations made by the authors and how they stand up to the numerical les experiments under realistic forcing conditions in addition to the enhancement of turbulent energy and modifications to the turbulent velocity scale w x as suggested previously mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 smyth et al 2002 mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 first attempted to account for lt in kpp by introducing an enhancement factor to the turbulent velocity scale based on the turbulent langmuir number l a t mcwilliams et al 1997 smyth et al 2002 improved their scheme by adding a stratification effect to restrain magnify the turbulence enhancement under weak strong stratification conditions to account for the effect of misaligned wind and waves van roekel et al 2012 proposed a projected langmuir number reflecting the effect of wind wave misalignment angle while these studies improved the representation of boundary layer turbulence in our ocean circulation models they all suggest enhanced turbulence with lt under all conditions in this study reduced turbulence was observed at large wind wave misalignment thus we attempt to better represent the effects of the wind wave angle of misalignment that not only enhance mixing at smaller angles but can also reduce mixing at large angles ncom was used by the naval oceanographic office navoceano for operational global simulations and is still currently used at the naval research laboratory nrl and by the fleet numerical meteorology and oceanography center fnmoc for regional domains through this study the original kpp scheme large et al 1994 is implemented in ncom for the first time and the implementation will be validated without the effects of lt or any additional modifications large et al 1994 against observations the performance of the original kpp scheme will also be compared with the mellor yamada level 2 5 1982 and the kantha and clayson 1994 models the new kpp lt scheme presented here is then compared with other lt parameterizations namely the smc models by kantha and clayson 2004 harcourt 2015 and the more recent kpp model of li and fox kemper 2017 performance is evaluated by comparing the eddy viscosity from ncom with les estimates and further validated with observed sst and mld this paper is organized as follows section 2 outlines

our interpretations on the model results limitations and future work 2 method a critical component in the study and development of turbulent parameterizations for the oceanic surface boundary layer osbl is the use of les that explicitly calculates the grid scale reynold stresses and model sub grid stresses sgs moeng 1984 les that solve the phase averaged craik leibovich equations have been shown to quantitatively simulate important characteristics of lt observed in the ocean namely decreased downwind mean shear z u e g price and sundermeyer 1999 an increase of near surface crosswind wave normalized turbulent kinetic energy tke v r m s u 2 e g gargett et al 2004 and mixed layer vertical tke w r m s u 2 e g d asaro 2001 thus providing a good benchmark for parameterizations used in large scale circulation models zikanov et al 2003 idealized les studies have been used to characterize lt under a wide range of oceanic conditions including steady moderate winds with weakly convective surface forcing skyllingstad and denbo 1995 mcwilliams et al 1997 li et al 2005 tropical cyclones sullivan et al 2012 reichl et al 2016 and very strong swells mcwilliams et al 2014 in this study we emphasize the importance of using observed oceanic and meteorological condition in les simulations for the purpose of parameter development for turbulence closure models 2 1 large eddy simulations the les model used here solves the filtered craik leibovich craik and leibovich 1976 momentum and continuity equations 1 d u d t f z ˆ u u s π g z ˆ ρ ρ 0 u s ω s g s 2 d ρ d t u s ρ s g s 3 u 0 where g is the gravitational acceleration d d t t u the eulerian velocity vector is denoted by u u v w the resolved vorticity is ω ω x ω y ω z u the stokes drift velocity is u s u s v s 0 ρ is the water density with ρ 0 being its reference density f is the coriolis parameter π p ρ 0 1 2 u u s 2 u 2 is a generalized pressure and z ˆ denotes the vertical coordinate the prognostic equation for the subgrid scale sgs model in the les takes the same form as the turbulent kinetic equation except the fluxes are parameterized instead of being resolved the details on the sgs model can be found in sullivan et al 2007 and the appendix 2 2 model idealizations in the context of turbulent parameterizations for the osbl three approximations are commonly used in les experiments seeking to understand the effects of lt steady state surface forcing monochromatic waves and aligned wind wave directions experiments using steady state surface forcing of heat and momentum fluxes seek equilibrium solutions to understand the individual contributions from shear convection and lt to the total tke budget and their effects on the equilibrium velocity and temperature distributions although quasi steady states have been observed in the ocean their persistence over long term periods is questionable consequently les experiments assuming a steady state surface forcing are mostly useful from a theoretical standpoint but have limited applicability to the real ocean in the study of kantha and clayson kantha and clayson 2004 the authors replicate the idealized conditions in the les experiments by mcwilliams et al 1997 in order to tune the model parameter e 6 which sets the relative contribution of the craik leibovich vortex force term in the prognostic equation for q 2 l and consequently the turbulent eddy viscosity k m s m q l where s m is a stability function for momentum q is the turbulent velocity scale and l is the turbulent length scale mellor and yamada 1982 harcourt 2015 when setting e 6 1 both tke and dissipation levels agree well with les results by mcwilliams but the turbulent eddy viscosity is underestimated kantha and clayson 2004 choose to set e 6 7 2 see kantha et al 2010 in order to match the turbulent eddy viscosity to les estimated values presumably overestimating tke and dissipation levels while tuning the model constants for the mellor yamada level 2 5 model mellor and yamada 1982 the basis of all general length scale models umlauf and burchard 2003 such as the model by kantha and clayson 2004 the authors warn that a bias to any one set of data will result in that set being well predicted while being less skillful for other sets invoking steady surface forcing is therefore useful in the development of turbulent parameterizations to provide a theoretical framework from the equilibrium solutions and low order statistics but ultimately ocean models should be tuned under realistic surface conditions to avoid possible biases towards the unrealistic stationary state although the stationary i e time independent solution is certainly important and physically relevant ocean models are significantly affected by the transient conditions ubiquitous in the real ocean another idealization commonly made in les experiments to study lt is the monochromatic wave approximation that facilitates the estimation of the stokes drift even in this idealized form a surface gravity wave field as a steady monochromatic deep water wave equation 2 4 in mcwilliams et al 1997 the stokes drift u s is a function of two variables the surface stokes drift u s and its wavelength l 2 π k k is the wave number with the implication that the stokes drift profile can only be uniquely defined by using a minimum of two parameters consequently the turbulent langmuir number l a t u u s where u is the water side friction velocity is apt to characterize the effects of lt under this idealization i e monochromatic waves but shows no explicit sensitivity to the stokes drift decay scale or the angle between stokes drift and wind stress in contrast the hoenikker number defined as h o 4 b 0 u s δ u 2 li et al 2005 where b 0 is the surface buoyancy flux and δ 2 k 1 is the stokes drift decay scale or e folding scale also referred to as penetration depth does take into account the wavelength through δ to measure the relative effects of convective and langmuir turbulence the monochromatic wave approximation has been made mostly on grounds of simplicity and the assumption that turbulence dynamics in the osbl are only weakly dependent on the dimensionless depth ratio k h li et al 2005 where k is the wavenumber of a monochromatic wave with stokes drift decay length δ and h is the boundary layer depth bld however more recent studies mcwilliams et al 2014 kukulka and harcourt 2017 show important differences in turbulent statistics and buoyancy entrainment rates between short equilibrium wind waves and longer swell waves les experiments of lt in pure wind seas harcourt and d asaro 2008 show that using a scale equivalent monochromatic wave does not accurately reproduce the results using a full surface wave spectrum with the same penetration depth in their study harcourt and d asaro suggest a surface layer averaged langmuir number l a s l to consider the different penetration depths of the stokes drift estimated from both monochromatic and broadband spectra further numerical experiments show that under nonequilibrium swell conditions the osbl does not restratify despite low wind and strong solar radiation kukulka et al 2013 and wind wave equilibrium can significantly affect the vertical distribution of passive buoyant tracers through near surface enhanced tke due to wave breaking and lt kukulka and brunner 2015 therefore turbulence models developed and tuned under the assumption of a monochromatic wave field cannot be expected to perform well in the real ocean and the non dimensional numbers used to characterize lt under these idealized conditions have significant limitations in characterizing lt under realistic forcing conditions perhaps the most commonly used approximation in lt parameterizations is the assumption that the wind stress and stokes drift act in the same direction in this approximation the waves are assumed to be in equilibrium with the local wind i e c p u 10 1 2 where c p is the phase speed of the waves at the peak of the wave spectrum and u 10 is the wind velocity at 10 m height the wave number is usually used to estimate the stokes drift when there is no observed or modeled data of the wave field however surface gravity waves often propagate long distances in form of swells where the wind is rarely in equilibrium with the waves hanely et al 2010 les experiments in swell show an amplification of the lagrangian mean current an enhancement of the turbulent variance and buoyancy entrainment rate from the pycnocline compared to an equilibrium wind sea mcwilliams et al 2014 the relative importance of wind and wave directions is obscured by the difficultness in measuring turbulent shear and stokes drift simultaneously but the study of kantha et al 2010 suggests a scaling proportional to the dot product of stokes drift and wind stress at the surface les experiments simulating the effect of misaligned stokes drift and wind direction show that the axial direction and rotation of the langmuir cell pairs changes significantly with the wind wave angle as well the vertical variance and scaling of the turbulent langmuir number van roekel et al 2012 these findings are supported by les experiments of tropical cyclones which show that misaligned winds and waves result in vertical momentum fluxes that counter the gradient of the stokes drift so that the potency of lt depends on the turbulent langmuir number the wind stokes drift alignment and the relative penetration scale k h of the stokes drift sullivan et al 2012 attempts to include the effect of wind wave misalignment in lt parameterizations suggest the use of the lagrangian velocity u l u s u and shear to direct part of the momentum flux down the stokes shear mcwilliams et al 2012 reichl et al 2016 2 3 les at ows p the first set of les experiments consists of two simulations at ows p one with the effect of lt and the other without the effect of lt unless otherwise specified simulations with the effect of lt will be labeled lt for example the difference in eddy viscosity between simulations with lt and without lt are computed as δ k k l t k where the eddy viscosity from simulations without lt are subtracted from simulations with the effect of lt ows p is located 850 miles off the british columbia canadian coast at 14 5 e and 5 0 n simulations span a period of 20 days starting on november 14 2011 at 1 utc and ending on december 4 2011 at 1 utc the horizontal domain is set to be 300 m in both directions which is 4 5 times of the mixed layer depth that varied between 60 m to 80 m during our simulation period and thus is wide enough to permit multiple coherent largest scale structures to develop independent of the periodic side wall boundary conditions imposed the vertical extent of the domain is 200 m which is more than twice of maximum mixed layer depth and thus can permit a smooth transition between the turbulent and stably stratified layers below a vertical grid with 128 grid points stretched towards the surface starting at 0 2 meter depth is used to better resolve the surface fluxes and the rapid vertical decay of the stokes drift profiles the model starts from rest u 0 with temperature and salinity profiles initialized from measurements at 17 levels from 1 meter to 300 meters depth which are linearly interpolated to the vertical grid both temperature and salinity profiles at initialization are vertically uniform in the upper 60 meters with a sharp thermocline halocline at the base of the mixed layer hourly wind stress τ was calculated from observed 10 m winds using the vectorized coare 3 5 algorithm modified from fairall et al 2003 and net heat flux q was computed using the sensible and latent heat fluxes from the coare 3 0 bulk algorithm as well as observations of the net shortwave and longwave radiation concurrent detailed two dimensional wave spectra e σ θ were collected near ocean station papa by the applied physics laboratory at the university of washington using a 0 9 m datawell directional waverider thomson et al 2013 where σ and θ are the frequency and direction of the spectra the hourly stokes drift profile time series were computed following kenyon 1969 4 u s z 2 ω k e ω θ e 2 k z d σ d θ where k is the wave number vector of the spectra surface fluxes and stokes drift are shown in fig 1 along with the wind wave angle of misalignment θ w w and stokes e folding depth δ note that during this 20 day period wind stress ranges between 0 and 1 2 pa 0 25 ms 1 and heat flux ranges from 450 wm 2 strongly convective to 175 wm 2 stable providing a wide range of surface forcing conditions for testing our model the dashed lines in fig 1 indicate the 10 inertial periods t 1 t 10 from november 16 at 07 12 utc to november 22 at 19 25 utc used to guide our parameterization which is then tested for the entire 20 day period 2 4 les with varying wind wave wind wave angles the second set of les experiments consists on a suite of idealized experiments with wind wave misalignment angles ranging from 0 to 135 degrees used to guide the lt parameterization under different angles of misalignment stratified ocean initial conditions are prescribed for the idealized experiments with a constant density layer in top 20 m below that layer stable stratification of d θ d z 0 01 k m is prescribed with a constant thermal expansion coefficient α 2 10 4 k 1 constant forcing is applied for all experiments following mcwilliams et al 1997 with wind stress τ 0 037 nm 2 corresponding to a wind speed of about 5 m s 1 a weak heat flux into the ocean of q 5 wm 2 and a stokes drift profile from a sinusoidal wave with an amplitude of 0 8 m and length of 60 m corresponding to stokes drift with surface value of u s 0 068 m s 1 this implies a l a t equal to 0 3 the x ˆ direction in the model is defined as the along wind direction the boundary layer environment is uniformly rotating for all experiments with f 8 5867 10 5 s 1 corresponding to 36 17 n latitude all model runs are spun up from rest to a statistical equilibrium state after one inertial period 20 3 h for more details on this set of simulations the reader is referred to fan et al 2020 2 5 tke budget we start by considering the tke budget to gain insight on the relative importance of each term responsible for vertical mixing the horizontal domain averaged tke equation can be written as 5 e t t t p shear p b u o y t pressure p stokes ɛ s g s where t t 1 2 u 2 w z v 2 w z w 2 w z is the turbulent transport term p shear u w u z v w v z is the shear production term p b u o y α g θ w β g s w is the buoyancy production term t pressure 1 ρ 0 p w z is the pressure transport term p stokes u w u s x z v w u s y z is the stokes production term e is the total tke ɛ is the kinetic energy dissipation rate and s g s is the subgrid scale contribution the angle bracket in the above equations represents horizontal domain average the superscript prime denotes a departure from the mean value the tke budget for the les experiments with and without the effect of lt at ows p are shown in fig 2 averaged over the ten inertial periods shown in fig 1 in the absence of lt the balance is between shear production buoyancy and dissipation but in the presence of lt stokes production becomes the dominant source of energy at the surface followed by shear production while transport terms that are negligible in simulations without lt now play a minor role the contribution from shear production when lt is present decreases because vertical gradients of velocity decrease faster than the increase in turbulent fluxes commonly referred to as the anti stokes effect haney 2015 pearson et al 2018 the turbulent transport and pressure terms are also significantly larger in the simulation with lt while the dissipation is slightly reduced suggesting that the excess of available energy at the near surface is transported downwards instead of being dissipated at the surface at the surface stokes production is the largest source of tke but buoyancy term is dominant in the bulk of the mixed layer which is easier to observe in a linear plot not shown buoyancy production also increases slightly suggesting stokes shear and buoyancy work together to increase vertical mixing using these model results and dimensional analysis we now consider various physical parameters that may contribute to the enhanced vertical mixing by lt 3 langmuir turbulence parameterization in this study we aim to parameterize the enhancement in vertical mixing brought by the inclusion of lt in turbulent models which already account for shear and convection hence our variable of interest is δ k k l t k where k l t is the eddy viscosity in the presence of lt and k is the eddy viscosity due to shear and convection only posing the problem in this manner allows this parameterization to be added to any already existing turbulent closure model that neglects the effect of lt additionally under certain conditions the difference in eddy viscosity is allowed to be negative for cases in which the presence of the stokes drift reduces the turbulent intensity we model the eddy viscosity without the effect of lt exactly as in large et al 1994 6 k σ h w m σ g σ where h is the bld w m is a turbulent velocity scale g is a nondimensional shape function and σ z h is a nondimensional vertical coordinate that varies from 0 at the surface to 1 at the base of the boundary layer where z is the distance from the surface eq 6 is a common way to calculate eddy viscosities and diffusivities in one equation in some models the non local flux is computed differently for example in large et al 1994 it is zero for momentum but non zero for scalars temperature salinity in our study we focus only on the local down gradient component k first term eq 7 and treat eddy viscosity diffusivity in the same way so it is not necessary to discuss eddy viscosities and diffusivities separately this also keeps the prandtl number unaltered and equal to w m w s in accordance to troen and mahrt 1986 this is discussed in appendix b from large et al 1994 for details of this parameterization the reader is referred to large et al 1994 note that we implemented the kpp scheme in ncom as it was originally presented and did not tune it for our application since the model was also originally tuned to ows p observations it provides a good benchmark for comparison but this also implies that the effect of lt is implicitly accounted for to some degree for simplicity we apply the parameterization to both the eddy viscosity and diffusivity in the same fashion 3 1 definitions first we provide a formal definition for three important physical parameters used in the parameterization and model validation eddy viscosity mld and bld the eddy viscosity diffusivity is used in ocean models to parameterize the vertical turbulent momentum heat fluxes as 7 w λ k λ z λ γ λ where w λ refers to the turbulent flux of a quantity λ which may be specified for momentum u w v w or scalars such as temperature w θ z λ is the mean vertical gradient and γ λ represents any flux not proportional to the local gradient li et al 2019 for the purposes of this study the eddy viscosity k refers specifically to the turbulent momentum flux and we diagnose it in les as the scalar eddy viscosity 8 k u w 2 v w 2 u z 2 v z 2 additionally we omit the non local flux γ λ in eq 7 following large et al 1994 the oceanic bld is defined from a physical standpoint as the limit to which the largest boundary layer eddies can penetrate in the vertical direction which depends on the surface forcing oceanic buoyancy b z and the mean velocity v z u profiles in kpp models the bld is defined as the smallest distance z at which the bulk richardson number r i b equals a critical value r i c 9 r i b b r b d z v r v z 2 v t 2 z where b r and v r are the near surface reference buoyancy and velocity respectively computed by averaging each respective profile over the surface layer h s l ε h and the term v t 2 is a velocity scale which accounts for the unresolved velocity shear note that fluxes should be about 20 of their surface value at the surface layer depth and approach linearly as z becomes small which has been taken to be about 10 of the boundary layer depth a value originally taken from atmospheric boundary layer values tennekes 1973 large et al 1994 we find that this is roughly a good estimate in our simulations and therefore we choose to set ε 0 1 when computing the near surface reference buoyancy and velocity in 8 however when computing the surface layer averaged langmuir number defined later the averaging is taken to be 20 of the mixed layer in both cases we choose these definitions to be consistent with the original work large et al 1994 for all of our analyses we use a critical richardson number r i c 0 3 in simulations without the effect of the stokes drift the velocity scale v t 2 is parameterized using eq 23 from large et al 1994 10 v t c v β t 1 2 r i c κ 2 c s ε 1 2 d n w s where c v 1 6 is the ratio of stratification frequency n at the interior and the entrainment depth β t is the ratio of entrainment flux to surface buoyancy flux w s is the turbulent velocity scale for scalars and κ 0 4 is von karman s constant in simulations that include the stokes drift it is parameterized using eq 26 from li and fox kemper 2017 11 v t c v n w s d r i c 0 15 w 3 0 17 u 3 1 0 49 l a s l 2 w s 3 1 2 the surface layer averaged langmuir number l a s l harcourt and d asaro 2008 is defined as 12 l a s l u u s s l u r e f s where the u r e f s is a reference velocity equal to the stokes drift velocity at 0 765 h m and the surface layer averaged velocity is defined as 13 u s s l 5 h m h m 5 0 u s d z as we will discuss later parameterization of the unresolved stokes drift through the velocity scale v t 2 as suggested by li and fox kemper 2017 is essential to estimate the bld finally we define the mld h m as the depth at which the temperature changes by 0 2 0 c from its surface value in our simulations this corresponds roughly to a change of 0 03 kg m 3 from the surface which shows better agreement in global simulations compared to other criteria de boyer monteǵut et al 2004 for additional discussion on the difference between the mld bld and other length scales relevant to scaling turbulence in the osbl the reader is referred to sutherland et al 2014 and pearson et al 2018 as will be discussed later all kpp parameterizations results show significant sensitivity to the computation of the bld 3 2 scaling of lt physical variables a critical aspect of any model parameterization is to provide the proper scaling for the phenomena under study which requires the identification of the relevant physical variables affecting the flow the eddy viscosity k has units of m 2 s is composed of two fundamental units length and time using dimensional analysis we can express the enhancement of the eddy viscosity as 14 δ k f f 1 f 2 f n where f 1 f 2 f n are the most relevant physical variables affecting the enhancement in vertical mixing in the presence of lt according to monin obukhov similarity theory the important turbulence parameters affecting the surface layer are the distance from the boundary z and surface fluxes w λ the contribution from wind forced turbulence p shear is commonly scaled using the water side friction velocity u τ ρ 0 and buoyancy production p b u o y is usually scaled using the surface buoyancy flux b 0 or deardorff s convective velocity w b 0 h 1 3 the relevant physical parameters used to describe the contribution from the stokes drift p stokes is more complicated but some les studies suggest that the wave forced turbulence should be scaled with a langmuir velocity scale w l u 2 u s 1 3 and a mixed layer depth h m harcourt and d asaro 2008 grant and belcher 2009 this is in fact the most convenient way to scale the contribution from the stokes drift but it suffers from the same limitation as the turbulent langmuir number in that it shows no explicit sensitivity to the stokes drift depth scale such that wind swell waves with the same surface stokes drift associated with shorter longer penetration depths will scale identically to capture the effect of the stokes penetration depth we choose to scale the contribution from the stokes drift using the depth scale δ and the stokes shear at the surface s 0 the stratification is considered through the mld so we can express the dimensional eddy viscosity difference as 15 δ k f u b 0 s 0 δ h m 3 3 scaling of lt dimensionless numbers in order to find the appropriate dimensionless variables to be used in the parameterization we start by non dimensionalizing our variable of interest δ k since we chose the surface stokes shear as the most relevant scale affecting stokes production we normalize our eddy viscosity difference as 16 π δ k s 0 u 2 we now seek to scale the surface value of dimensionless eddy viscosity π using the relevant physical parameters in eq 15 in fig 3 we show the scaling of our dimensionless eddy viscosity 16 during the ten inertial periods shown in fig 1 with the turbulent langmuir number mcwilliams et al 1997 the surface layer langmuir number harcourt and d asaro 2008 the depth ratio h m δ and the dimensionless parameter u δ s 0 the turbulent langmuir number which provides a dimensionless ratio between shear and stokes production at the surface is in the range of 0 22 0 37 during the 6 5 day period plotted in fig 3 and the surface layer langmuir number which integrates the stokes drift over the surface layer is in the range of 0 35 0 75 neither of which yields a good scaling with π for short wind waves of penetration depths of δ 1 2 m as indicated by the smaller size of the scatter markers in fig 3 show a different scaling than for deeper δ 5 8 m waves a similar scaling is observed with u δ s 0 due to the fact that u s 1 δ s 0 so that this ratio is analogous to the turbulent langmuir number the depth ratio h m δ increases with π suggesting that the penetration depth is in fact a relevant physical parameter but it also fails to scale with π as the depth ratio increases over a certain threshold to get a better scaling for π with we obtain a new parameter by combining h m δ and u δ s 0 to form 17 u δ s 0 δ h m u s 0 h m l a m the scaling of this new modified langmuir number l a m with the surface value of the dimensionless eddy viscosity 16 is shown in fig 4 which shows great improvement over those in fig 3 however the scaling fails as the wind wave angle of misalignment increases suggesting that it is in fact a relevant parameter affecting vertical mixing in the ocean and must therefore be taken into account in our parameterization 3 4 effect of wind wave wind wave misalignment in this section we use our idealized les experiments described in section 2 4 to guide the parameterization of the wind wave angle of misalignment as a starting point since our idealized les experiments are performed under very similar conditions i e weakly convective monochromatic waves and a steady wind stress we use the suggested enhancement by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 to parameterize the effect of lt for the case of aligned wind waves θ w w 0 18 k l t σ h w m σ g σ 1 c w l a t 4 1 2 where c w accounts for the effect of convection and is computed using eq 13 from smyth et al 2002 to account for the effect of wind wave misalignment on the enhancement of eddy viscosity we introduce a function g θ w w to parameterize the difference in eddy viscosity as 19 δ k k l t k g θ w w then we compute the eddy viscosity difference k l t k from our les experiments as a function of the wind wave angle shown in fig 5 by the solid lines in agreement with previous studies e g van roekel et al 2018 vertical mixing enhancement is maximum for aligned wind waves θ w w 0 and decreases with increasing angle of misalignment results from our idealized les experiments also suggest that at high wind wave angles θ w w 4 5 turbulence levels resemble simulations without lt i e δ k 0 and further increasing the misalignment θ w w 6 0 results in lower turbulence levels δ k 0 fan et al 2020 this observation supports the idea that the wind wave misalignment angle is an important factor affecting the scaling of dimensionless eddy viscosity with our dimensionless parameter l a m eq 17 which fails to scale after the wind wave misalignment angle is greater than around 45 degrees fig 4 the parameterization of the difference in eddy viscosity using large et al 1994 for k and by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 for k l t i e k l t k dashed blue line in fig 5 shows good agreement with our les simulation for the case of aligned wind waves solid blue line now we can derive the form of g θ w w hereafter called the wind wave modulation function by analyzing the eddy viscosity difference computed from les and assuming that the reduction in vertical mixing is symmetrical along the direction of the wind meaning that there is no difference in vertical mixing if the stokes drift is misaligned to the right left of the wind direction therefore the wind wave angle of misalignment has a range θ w w 0 18 0 and g θ w w should be symmetric about θ w w 0 additionally since the eddy viscosity difference decreases faster at lower wind wind wave angles i e the difference from θ w w 0 30 is greater than θ w w 90 120 we assume g θ w w decays rapidly with these constraints we choose a generalized form for the wind wave modulation function 20 g θ w w c 1 e θ w w cos c 2 θ w w c 3 where c 1 c 2 c 3 are constants used to match the parameterization with the les eddy viscosity difference which we set using the following constraints enhancement of the difference is maximum at 0 degrees so g 0 1 enhancement of the difference is 0 around 45 degrees so g 45 0 maximum reduction is around 90 degrees so g 90 min g 0 the wind wave modulation function is allowed to be negative at high wind wave angles to account for the negative viscosity difference observed in les fig 5 the wind wave modulation function shown in fig 6 takes the final form 21 g θ w w e cos 3 π 8 θ w w cos θ w w 2 3 π 8 the parameterization as a function of the misalignment angle eq 15 where k is computed using eq 6 k l t is computed using eq 18 and g θ w w is computed using eq 21 is shown in fig 5 by the dashed lines showing good agreement with the diagnosed eddy viscosity values from our idealized les 3 5 effect of surface heat flux in the ocean surface heat fluxes have significant influence over the temperature distributions and the extent of the boundary layer global simulations show that convective turbulence dominates a significant portion 17 of the low latitudes year round and about two thirds of the world s oceans act under combined langmuir and convective turbulence belcher et al 2012 li et al 2019 in our simulations buoyancy production p b u o y is enhanced in the presence of lt and became comparable with the other two production terms fig 2 furthermore in our simulations at ows p the shape of the k profiles changes significantly in the presence of lt and agreement with our parameterized eddy viscosity profiles over a wide range of surface heat fluxes highly convective to stable was improved by modifying the non dimensional shape function g σ the assumptions made in the original formulation of the non local kpp scheme are still valid when lt is present namely zero eddy viscosity at top bottom of the bl zero gradient at the bottom and linear gradient at the top the minimum degree of the polynomial needs to be 3 to accommodate for the 4 necessary constraints note that in the previous section we provided a scaling for the non dimensional eddy viscosity difference at the surface which is not zero we use the modified langmuir number eq 16 to provide a scaling of the overall magnitude difference of the eddy viscosity with and without lt throughout the entire bl analogous to the suggested model in mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 which makes the eddy viscosity everywhere in the bl proportional to the turbulent langmuir number defined at the surface in practice the assumption of g 0 0 does not affect the surface scaling in ocean models since vertical mixing variables in ncom as well as other models such as the regional ocean modeling system are defined at the grid faces and the eddy viscosity at the surface is used as the vertical boundary condition set by the wind stress setting g 0 0 thus offers the theoretical argument that boundary layer eddies should not cross the ocean atmosphere interface and the practical reason that the first grid point at the face is not used to compute interior fluxes although the minimum degree of the polynomial must be 3 to accommodate the 4 constraints there is no reason not to increase the degree of the polynomial by expressing the shape function g σ as a binomial expansion of degree n we can generalize and use some of its properties 22 g σ σ 1 σ n 23 g σ 1 σ 1 n σ 1 σ eqs 21 and 22 express the non dimensional shape function and its derivative respectively as a function of the non dimensional coordinate σ and the expansion coefficient n which equals 2 for simulations without lt fig 7 shows the non dimensional shape function g σ eq 21 as a function of the expansion coefficient n by increasing the degree of the binomial expansion we can control the magnitude and shape of the k profiles as a matter of fact the maximum of g is only a function of the degree of the expansion and is found at max g 1 n 1 therefore we assume the expansion coefficient n varies linearly with a yet undetermined dimensionless buoyancy flux parameter π 2 f b 0 24 n c 4 π 2 c 5 where c 4 c 5 are the empirical constants used to tune our parameterization to the observed les profiles in the kpp the eddy viscosity profile has a convex shape with magnitude u 2 f and a depth scale u f mcwilliams and huckle 2006 since the non dimensional shape function sets the depth at which the eddy viscosity is maximum fig 7 and the wavy ekman layer is modified in the presence of lt mcwilliams et al 1997 2012 we let our dimensionless parameter π 2 be a function of the coriolis frequency f we chose the coriolis frequency to form π 2 because in the ocean the mld is clearly a function of latitude and most importantly because it is linearly independent from all other physical parameters considered and hence required by the buckingham pi theorem to complete the parameterization since the stable stratification at the base of the mixed layer also affects the depth scale of penetration we let our dimensionless parameter π 2 be a function of the mld h m therefore we normalize the surface buoyancy flux as 25 π 2 b 0 f 3 h m therefore in our model the enhancement of the eddy viscosity in the presence of lt is a function of the wind stress u surface buoyancy flux b 0 surface stokes shear s 0 coriolis frequency f stratification h m boundary layer depth h and wind wave angle of misalignment θ w w the modified shape function is given by combining eq 21 23 and 24 26 g σ π 2 σ 1 σ c 4 π 2 c 5 3 6 lt model in this section we introduce our model for the enhancement of eddy viscosity in the presence of lt we use previous suggestions by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 and smyth et al 2002 but instead of parameterizing the eddy viscosity as in eq 18 we parameterize the eddy viscosity difference using 27 δ k h w x σ ε π 1 g σ π 2 g θ w w where h is the bld computed using eqs 9 and 11 g σ π 2 is our modified shape function eq 26 g θ w w is our wind wave modulation function eq 21 and ε π 1 is the enhancement of the magnitude due to the stokes drift given by 28 ε π 1 c w π 1 2 1 2 note that the kpp scheme from large et al 1994 implicitly includes the effect of lt by tuning their model constants to ocean observations but it may misrepresent the entrainment under varying wave conditions and result in biases in boundary layer depth li and fox kemper 2017 and therefore the difference eq 27 reflects the correction to the original kpp scheme on the lt effect instead of the pure lt effect the enhancements due to lt nondimensional parameters constants used in our parameterization are summarized in table 1 note that the enhancement eq 27 has a similar form to the suggested enhancement by smyth et al 2002 where the dominant wave direction is assumed to be aligned with the local wind direction but scales with l a m u s 0 h m instead of l a t u u s and further drop the plus one since in the absence of stokes drift there should be no enhancement i e ε π 1 0 as π 1 the enhancement due to lt eq 28 is based on the formulation first suggested by mcwilliams and sullivan 2001 where the dominant wave direction is aligned with the local wind direction but scales with l a m u s 0 h m instead of l a t u u s similar to the surface layer averaged langmuir number harcourt and d asaro 2008 we find that l a m scales well with different penetration depths and has similar performance to the traditional turbulent langmuir number under the idealized assumptions of aligned wind waves and monochromatic waves the wind wave misalignment is modeled explicitly using eq 21 g θ w w where the wind varies from 0 to 180 degrees and we assume symmetry along the aligned wind wave direction fig 6 this modification is based on a set of les simulations under stationary wind stress and weakly convective heat flux that show the eddy viscosity difference between simulations with and without lt is fig 5 1 maximum for aligned wind waves no enhancement at θ w w 4 5 and minimum at θ w w 9 0 which lead to the constants used in our simulations table 1 finally the modified shape function adjusts the local eddy viscosities including the depth at which vertical mixing is maximum based on the nondimensional parameter b 0 f 3 h m in our simulations at ows p this parameter is a strong function of the surface buoyancy flux b 0 which has significant influence on the shape of the eddy viscosities computed from les and we adjust the constants in ncom to match the les profiles these enhancements and nondimensional parameters are discussed further in the following section for clarity the complete parameterization that includes the effect of wind waves and convection is given by 29 k σ h w m σ g σ δ k where the first term on the right is the parameterization of large et al 1994 and δ k is described in eq 27 4 results the k profile parameterization as described in large et al 1994 was implemented in ncom for the first time and therefore we start by validating these results with observations and les experiments at ows p in section 4 1 the ncom experiment set up is described and we briefly summarize the implementation of the smc models in sections 4 2 and 4 3 we discuss the results from the simulations without and with lt respectively focusing on the eddy viscosity profiles in section 4 4 we compare all ncom results with les and observed temperature section 5 summarizes the overall performance of the schemes and further offer an intermodal comparison with other kpp models 4 1 ncom experiments a set of 1 dimensional ncom simulations is performed at ows p under the same surface forcing conditions as in the les experiments fig 1 the vertical grid uses the same number of grid points n 128 as the les with similar stretching towards the surface and double periodic boundary conditions are used in the horizontal direction following the horizontal homogeneity approximation made in this study as reported in other studies van roekel et al 2018 li et al 2019 we find significant sensitivity in our ncom experiments with different vertical grid resolutions we performed simulations with 50 100 128 and 150 grid points spanning the top 200 m of the ocean and show only those for 128 grid points because the difference to those with 150 grid points shows negligible difference but allows a more direct comparison with les simulations using the same vertical resolution the mean velocity is initialized from rest and temperature salinity fields are interpolated from observations to the ncom grid the same procedure is followed to interpolate the stokes drift velocity following the les experiments we assume horizontal homogeneity and use double periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal directions comparison of temperature profiles between observations and les shown in figs 11 and 13 suggests that this is a good approximation for most of the 20 day period at ows p with sst deviating from les result only in the last 4 days following the nomenclature used for the les experiments simulations with the effect of lt will be indicated by the lt label for example ncom simulations using the kantha clayson scheme will be labeled kc and kc lt for simulations without and with the effect of lt respectively the model of li and fox kemper 2017 is labeled kpp lf to differentiate from out kpp lt model 4 2 simulations under shear and convection only the first set of simulations compares the vertical mixing schemes of mellor yamada 2 5 mellor and yamada 1982 kantha and clayson 1994 harcourt 2013 2015 and kpp large et al 1994 where the stokes drift is identically zero i e no lt the implementation of these schemes is based on the original work by the authors including the constants used to tune the contribution from shear buoyancy production dissipation diffusion and transport of turbulent energy these are also based on simulations at ows p for at least one year not shown to make sure that mixed layer deepening and restratification are accurate over long periods in ncom both kpp and smc models use the eddy viscosity to estimate the vertical turbulent fluxes and thus provide a quantitative measure of the approximate mixing strength between different schemes the inertially averaged eddy viscosities from the experiments without lt are shown in fig 8 where the solid black lines are from les and the colored dashed lines are from ncom simulations the 10 inertial periods are taken over a 6 5 day period shown by the dashed black lines in fig 1 characterized by strong winds and convection e g period t2 short periods of moderately misaligned wind wave angles periods t4 t6 and t7 and periods of moderate winds and weakly convective neutral surface heating periods t8 t10 for most periods the kpp scheme shows more resemblance to the diagnosed eddy viscosity from les compared to the other smc schemes which on average have a higher magnitude located lower in the ml results from temperature distributions is further discussed in section 4 4 4 3 ncom with lt a second set of ncom simulations was performed to compare the performance of the kantha and clayson 2004 and harcourt 2015 schemes with our proposed parameterization described in section 4 labeled kpp lt as well as the parameterization from li and fox kemper 2017 hereafter referred to as kpp lf the setup of the ncom simulations is identical to simulations with only shear and convection with the only difference being the addition of the stokes drift first we start by comparing the diagnosed eddy viscosity from les lt with the ncom simulations shown by color contours on a logarithmic scale in fig 9 during the period from november 16 to 17 characterized by strong shear convection and stokes drift les lt shows mixing rates of about 1 m 2 s and rapid ml deepening in agreement with kpp lt and kpp lf models the eddy viscosity from the kc lt model seems to underestimate the mixing strength during this period of high turbulent production which is improved in the hc lt model suggesting that the corrections to the algebraic reynold stress model by harcourt 2015 significantly improve the smc scheme during the last day of the simulations where surface conditions are close to neutral to weakly stable the contours of eddy viscosity from hc lt show good agreement but overall both kpp lt and kpp lf do a reasonable job at estimating the bld the rapid deepening of the ml in les lt indicated by the white lines in fig 9 is more gradual in the smc models compared the kpp models but all of them are underestimated compared to les this is discussed further in the next section it is hard to elucidate the differences between the kpp lt and kpp lf schemes from logarithmic color contours which are more useful to compare the order of magnitude rather than precise values therefore we compare the inertially averaged profiles during the period from november 16 to 23 in fig 10 in agreement with fig 9 the overall magnitude of the kpp models is larger compared to smc schemes and in better agreement with les the shape of the kpp lt model is in better agreement with les lt as can be expected since we tuned our model to these results and is of course absent from kpp lf during periods of wind wave misalignment 2 0 periods t4 and t7 both the shape and magnitude of the profiles show good agreement under the conditions at ows p that is a well defined mixed layer and in the absence of horizontal currents 1d simulations the improvement in kpp lf and kpp lt is mainly through the modification of entrainment via the turbulent velocity scale eq 10 and should be considered when parameterizing other unresolved phenomena 4 4 temperature further validation of our model is shown by comparing sst from ncom with les and observations presented in fig 11 which in the absence of horizontal gradients and under the same surface conditions closely resembles the behavior and magnitude of the mld not shown for simulations under only shear and convective turbulence top panel the sst from my2 5 and kc are identical as are the result from hc and kpp models with the latter showing slightly lower temperatures and therefore slightly greater entrainment during the period of rapid ml deepening sst from les is about 0 1 degrees higher than observed which can be attributed to lt when observing that les lt simulations show near perfect agreement during this 2 day period however during the last 2 days of the simulation sst from les lt diverges from observations this is most likely due to the lack of rainfall data in the simulations when heavy rainfall events were noted during these days in the bottom panel of fig 11 we see that sst for our kpp lt model is in better agreement with observations and is improved from kpp lf by roughly 0 1 degrees but mixing is still underestimated compared to les and observations this discrepancy might be explained by the lack on non local transport in our model since divergence from les and observations happens during the period of strongest convection around november 17 where strong counter gradient fluxes present in les can play an important role in deepening the ml large et al 2019b fig 12 shows color contours of the diagnosed eddy viscosity from les with lt superimposed with the bld computed in three different ways 1 using the parameterization of large et al 1994 2 using lagrangian velocities in the bulk richardson number v u 2 u s 2 and 3 using the surface layer averaged langmuir number parameterization from li and fox kemper 2017 during the period of strong convection winds around november 17 the parameterization from large et al 1994 becomes shallower due to the decrease of the vertical velocity gradients while using the lagrangian velocities mean stokes improves the estimate of the bld during convective periods it is still too shallow when the surface becomes stabilizing as seen around december 1st in fig 12 therefore we find in our simulations that the parameterization of li and fox kemper 2017 for the bld to be more accurate than other suggested estimates this also suggests that in the absence of horizontal advection it is the eddy viscosity at the pycnocline that largely influences sst and mld while the eddy viscosity within the mixed layer is less important finally we compare the temperature distribution in the vertical direction from our ncom lt simulations with les lt and observations in fig 13 for the 6 5 day period shown in fig 1 the solid black line in the left panel shows the observed temperature on november 16 at 7utc when the ml is approximately 60 m deep and the purple dots indicate the observations on november 22 at 19utc during this 6 5 day period the sst decreases by 1 degree from 8 6 to 7 6 c and the ml deepens by almost 20 m the les lt experiment dashed purple line shows great agreement with observations both above and below the mixed layer with the largest error at 150 m depth and an error of less than 0 1 c at the surface due to the large temperature gradient at the pycnocline the error in temperature at 80 m depth is large for all ncom simulations 1 degree but this error is significantly reduced in the kpp lt model as well as the error with observed mld which is about 5 m deeper in our kpp lt model compared to kpp lf and smc models the largest differences between the les and kpp lt model are found below the mixed layer where we have not modified the original formulation from large et al 1994 and therefore does not account for other important effects in the ocean interior such as the presence of internal waves which may potentially alter the mixed layer significantly garrett and kunze 2007 below the bld the main source of vertical mixing in the kpp scheme for our simulations are shear instabilities modeled using the gradient richardson number eqs 27 and 28 in large et al 1994 5 summary and conclusions a new k profile parameterization kpp lt for the enhancement of the eddy viscosity in the presence of langmuir turbulence has been developed and implemented in the navy coastal ocean model this model was developed and tuned using a set of les at ocean weather station papa spanning a 20 day period from november 14th to december 4th 2011 les and ncom simulations are forced at the surface with wind stress and heat fluxes derived from observed atmospheric measurements and the stokes drift is computed from observed 2d wave spectra to allow the stokes drift to evolve independently from the wind forcing fig 1 in

enhanced vertical transport stokes production p stokes and buoyancy production p b u o y resulting in a deeper mixed layer depth and in the absence of lateral horizontal gradients lower sst with better agreement with observations a set of idealized les experiments under different wind waveangles of misalignment θ w w was used to parameterize the effect of the misalignment between the wind stress and stokes drift these simulations show that the vertical mixing is maximum for the case of aligned wind wave angles i e θ w w 0 but further increasing this angle leads to no enhancement θ w w

l a m which shows better scaling with our non dimensional eddy viscosity π eq 13 our ncom experiments show improvement of the eddy viscosity in kpp simulations compared to smc models both with and without the effect of lt figs 8 and 10 an important goal of this paper was to highlight the advantages and limitations of current smc and kpp models which still show significant differences under the same forcing conditions in ocean simulations by far the largest shortcoming of the kpp model as presented in this study and conceptualized by large et al 1994 is the assumption of an immobile surface which makes it complicated to represent the ocean s surface dynamics which is formally addressed in large et al 2019a b smc models have addressed the need for additional turbulence due to stokes drift by injecting additional tke at the surface using the dot product of wind stress and stokes drift as a scaling parameter kantha et al 2010 that considers wind wave misalignment finally in this study we do not address the issue of nonlocal transport that has been shown to be important in highly convective flows or the role of vertical grid resolution in the accuracy of smc and kpp models in view of these limitations it seems necessary that new parameterizations are proposed that prioritize these issues to start with since they have proved to be highly elusive declaration of competing interest

23856,in this study we present a new parameterization for the enhancement of vertical mixing brought by the inclusion of the stokes drift for the turbulent mixing schemes in ocean circulation models the new scheme kpp lt uses the k profile parameterization large et al 1994 as a template and attempts to include the effect of the penetration decay scale of the stokes drift δ and the misalignment between the wind stress and stokes drift θ w w the effect of the wind wave angle of misalignment is guided by a set of idealized large eddy simulations les and the langmuir turbulence lt parameterization is developed based on les of the ocean surface boundary layer at ocean weather station papa for a period of 20 days under observed atmospheric and oceanic conditions the kpp lt model is implemented in the navy coastal ocean model ncom and compared to in situ oceanographic measurements les and other second moment closure smc schemes available in ncom namely the model of kantha and clayson 2004 and harcourt 2013 2015 comparisons with temperature observations suggest better performance of the kpp lt model over smc models within the boundary layer which are supported by comparisons of inertially averaged eddy viscosity profiles estimated from les keywords langmuir turbulence kpp ncom ocean surface boundary layer vertical mixing 1 introduction ocean models based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations use turbulence parameterizations to model the effect of unresolved motions on the mean flow turbulence models aimed at simulating the dynamics of the upper ocean determine the extent and relative influence that surface fluxes heat and freshwater and temperature distributions have on turbulent motions and how these redistribute momentum and heat in the past few decades langmuir turbulence lt has been recognized as an important source of turbulent energy in the upper ocean significantly affecting the mean velocity and scalar flux profiles within the mixed layer mcwilliams et al 1997 2012 although lt is now regarded as a contributing and often dominant factor driving turbulent processes that transport heat and momentum in the upper layers of oceans and lakes global simulations using different lt closure schemes show significant discrepancies in the resulting temperature distributions li et al 2019 several different parameterizations have been proposed based on second moment closure smc models e g kantha and clayson 2004 harcourt 2013 2015 and models based on the k profile parameterization kpp mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 smyth et al 2002 van roekel et al 2018 li and fox kemper 2017 to simulate the effects of lt this study aims to assess the performance of different turbulent parameterization models that seek to simulate the effects of lt using the navy coastal ocean model ncom under realistic forcing conditions and propose a parameterization for the enhancement i e the additional turbulent mixing of the turbulent eddy viscosity in the presence of lt based on large eddy simulations les forced by observed wind and waves the proposed model presented here hereafter kpp lt is based on the kpp model large et al 1994 as well as subsequent model improvements that account for lt e g smyth et al 2002 li and fox kemper 2017 and further attempts to take into account the effects of wind wave angle of misalignment van roekel et al 2012 and stokes drift decay scale kukulka and harcourt 2017 we find that the effect of misaligned stokes drift and wind direction has significant impact on the diagnosed eddy viscosity profiles in idealized les under weakly convective conditions this is obscured in realistic les configurations where strong convection is often dominant over lt but important differences in turbulent intensities are still observed between aligned and misaligned wind waves in realistic les experiments fan et al 2020 to assess the overall performance of the models results are validated with observed sea surface temperature sst and mixed layer depth mld which provide a bulk measure of the total mixing strength however we also emphasize the shape and magnitude of inertially averaged eddy viscosity profiles to elucidate local mixing effects especially in contrast to smc models although we recognize that non local transport effects are important we focus on local transport since the models considered here formulate fluxes as downgradient large et al 2019a b a drawback of some turbulence closure models attempting to simulate the effects of lt in the ocean is the use of idealized les experiments in the development of the model parameterization and tuning of model constants these approximations are useful because they significantly reduce the complexity of ocean dynamics that facilitates the development of turbulence parameterizations and are necessary in understanding the dynamics of turbulent components individually however in practice ocean models using turbulence parameterizations developed under idealized conditions are expected to simulate ocean dynamics under realistic forcing conditions accurately with the implication that the ocean model solution is only weakly affected by these approximations for example the model developed by kantha and clayson 1994 2004 tunes its constants to constant forcing simulations in contrast kpp models are more empirical in nature using ocean observations to tune model constants for example the kpp of large et al 1994 uses ocean weather station papa ows p data in the original formulation by tuning model constants to match observations the kpp scheme also has the downside of obscuring physically relevant effects such as lt which results in ocean models including unknown effects implicitly additionally turbulence models may be biased towards the conditions under which they were developed for example the lt parameterization by reichl et al 2016 that aims to simulate the dynamics of the ocean under hurricane conditions in which rapid ml deepening is expected yields good results under those conditions but significantly overestimates the mixed layer deepening in global simulations li et al 2019 therefore turbulence models may benefit from being developed and tuned under the conditions that they are expected to simulate due to the large computational cost associated with high resolution les simulations we choose to follow similar studies large et al 2019a to test and tune our parameterization under a wide range typical oceanic forcing conditions using surface fluxes computed from in situ observations more recently numerical les experiments have addressed some of the complexities of ocean conditions namely characterizing waves from an observed spectrum non constant wind forcing and misaligned wind waves failing to account for directional wave spreading and multidirectional wave effects can lead to overestimating the mean stokes drift magnitude by 20 40 in addition to a directional veer with depth webb and fox kemper 2015 characterizing broadband waves with a langmuir number based on a stokes drift profile is a significant complication from a modeling standpoint but appears to provide sufficient information about the wave forcing to be an effective independent variable large et al 2019a numerical studies under tropical cyclone conditions show the importance of explicitly including sea state dependent impact of lt especially wind wave misalignment reichl et al 2016 and further suggest the use of lagrangian instead of eulerian currents to characterize the combined wind wave effects van roekel et al 2012 intercomparison of the most recent kpp modifications van roekel et al 2018 li et al 2019 clearly show that there is no clear way to characterize wave effects under all possible situations and significant uncertainty remains regarding the nonlocal flux parameterization due to these uncertainties in our study we choose to focus on the local flux parameterization and follow the suggestions from recent literature van roekel et al 2018 li et al 2019 large et al 2019a to test and tune our parameterization under a wide range typical oceanic forcing conditions using surface fluxes computed from in situ observations this study presents the results of les experiments at ocean weather station papa hereafter ows p during a 20 day period with a range of oceanic and atmospheric conditions representative of the combined langmuir and convective turbulence dominant in the global ocean li et al 2019 fig 12 the model is initialized by measured temperature and salinity with surface fluxes computed from observed wind and wave measurements experiments with and without the effect of lt are performed to elucidate the enhancement of turbulence in the presence of the wave generated stokes drift these simulations are used to develop a model for the enhancement of the eddy viscosity brought by the presence of lt that is instead of parameterizing the eddy viscosity k we aim to parameterize the difference in eddy viscosity δ k between simulations with and without wave forcing the parameterization is based on the non local kpp scheme large et al 1994 now commonly used in ocean models where we reconsider the original assumptions and approximations made by the authors and how they stand up to the numerical les experiments under realistic forcing conditions in addition to the enhancement of turbulent energy and modifications to the turbulent velocity scale w x as suggested previously mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 smyth et al 2002 mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 first attempted to account for lt in kpp by introducing an enhancement factor to the turbulent velocity scale based on the turbulent langmuir number l a t mcwilliams et al 1997 smyth et al 2002 improved their scheme by adding a stratification effect to restrain magnify the turbulence enhancement under weak strong stratification conditions to account for the effect of misaligned wind and waves van roekel et al 2012 proposed a projected langmuir number reflecting the effect of wind wave misalignment angle while these studies improved the representation of boundary layer turbulence in our ocean circulation models they all suggest enhanced turbulence with lt under all conditions in this study reduced turbulence was observed at large wind wave misalignment thus we attempt to better represent the effects of the wind wave angle of misalignment that not only enhance mixing at smaller angles but can also reduce mixing at large angles ncom was used by the naval oceanographic office navoceano for operational global simulations and is still currently used at the naval research laboratory nrl and by the fleet numerical meteorology and oceanography center fnmoc for regional domains through this study the original kpp scheme large et al 1994 is implemented in ncom for the first time and the implementation will be validated without the effects of lt or any additional modifications large et al 1994 against observations the performance of the original kpp scheme will also be compared with the mellor yamada level 2 5 1982 and the kantha and clayson 1994 models the new kpp lt scheme presented here is then compared with other lt parameterizations namely the smc models by kantha and clayson 2004 harcourt 2015 and the more recent kpp model of li and fox kemper 2017 performance is evaluated by comparing the eddy viscosity from ncom with les estimates and further validated with observed sst and mld this paper is organized as follows section 2 outlines

our interpretations on the model results limitations and future work 2 method a critical component in the study and development of turbulent parameterizations for the oceanic surface boundary layer osbl is the use of les that explicitly calculates the grid scale reynold stresses and model sub grid stresses sgs moeng 1984 les that solve the phase averaged craik leibovich equations have been shown to quantitatively simulate important characteristics of lt observed in the ocean namely decreased downwind mean shear z u e g price and sundermeyer 1999 an increase of near surface crosswind wave normalized turbulent kinetic energy tke v r m s u 2 e g gargett et al 2004 and mixed layer vertical tke w r m s u 2 e g d asaro 2001 thus providing a good benchmark for parameterizations used in large scale circulation models zikanov et al 2003 idealized les studies have been used to characterize lt under a wide range of oceanic conditions including steady moderate winds with weakly convective surface forcing skyllingstad and denbo 1995 mcwilliams et al 1997 li et al 2005 tropical cyclones sullivan et al 2012 reichl et al 2016 and very strong swells mcwilliams et al 2014 in this study we emphasize the importance of using observed oceanic and meteorological condition in les simulations for the purpose of parameter development for turbulence closure models 2 1 large eddy simulations the les model used here solves the filtered craik leibovich craik and leibovich 1976 momentum and continuity equations 1 d u d t f z ˆ u u s π g z ˆ ρ ρ 0 u s ω s g s 2 d ρ d t u s ρ s g s 3 u 0 where g is the gravitational acceleration d d t t u the eulerian velocity vector is denoted by u u v w the resolved vorticity is ω ω x ω y ω z u the stokes drift velocity is u s u s v s 0 ρ is the water density with ρ 0 being its reference density f is the coriolis parameter π p ρ 0 1 2 u u s 2 u 2 is a generalized pressure and z ˆ denotes the vertical coordinate the prognostic equation for the subgrid scale sgs model in the les takes the same form as the turbulent kinetic equation except the fluxes are parameterized instead of being resolved the details on the sgs model can be found in sullivan et al 2007 and the appendix 2 2 model idealizations in the context of turbulent parameterizations for the osbl three approximations are commonly used in les experiments seeking to understand the effects of lt steady state surface forcing monochromatic waves and aligned wind wave directions experiments using steady state surface forcing of heat and momentum fluxes seek equilibrium solutions to understand the individual contributions from shear convection and lt to the total tke budget and their effects on the equilibrium velocity and temperature distributions although quasi steady states have been observed in the ocean their persistence over long term periods is questionable consequently les experiments assuming a steady state surface forcing are mostly useful from a theoretical standpoint but have limited applicability to the real ocean in the study of kantha and clayson kantha and clayson 2004 the authors replicate the idealized conditions in the les experiments by mcwilliams et al 1997 in order to tune the model parameter e 6 which sets the relative contribution of the craik leibovich vortex force term in the prognostic equation for q 2 l and consequently the turbulent eddy viscosity k m s m q l where s m is a stability function for momentum q is the turbulent velocity scale and l is the turbulent length scale mellor and yamada 1982 harcourt 2015 when setting e 6 1 both tke and dissipation levels agree well with les results by mcwilliams but the turbulent eddy viscosity is underestimated kantha and clayson 2004 choose to set e 6 7 2 see kantha et al 2010 in order to match the turbulent eddy viscosity to les estimated values presumably overestimating tke and dissipation levels while tuning the model constants for the mellor yamada level 2 5 model mellor and yamada 1982 the basis of all general length scale models umlauf and burchard 2003 such as the model by kantha and clayson 2004 the authors warn that a bias to any one set of data will result in that set being well predicted while being less skillful for other sets invoking steady surface forcing is therefore useful in the development of turbulent parameterizations to provide a theoretical framework from the equilibrium solutions and low order statistics but ultimately ocean models should be tuned under realistic surface conditions to avoid possible biases towards the unrealistic stationary state although the stationary i e time independent solution is certainly important and physically relevant ocean models are significantly affected by the transient conditions ubiquitous in the real ocean another idealization commonly made in les experiments to study lt is the monochromatic wave approximation that facilitates the estimation of the stokes drift even in this idealized form a surface gravity wave field as a steady monochromatic deep water wave equation 2 4 in mcwilliams et al 1997 the stokes drift u s is a function of two variables the surface stokes drift u s and its wavelength l 2 π k k is the wave number with the implication that the stokes drift profile can only be uniquely defined by using a minimum of two parameters consequently the turbulent langmuir number l a t u u s where u is the water side friction velocity is apt to characterize the effects of lt under this idealization i e monochromatic waves but shows no explicit sensitivity to the stokes drift decay scale or the angle between stokes drift and wind stress in contrast the hoenikker number defined as h o 4 b 0 u s δ u 2 li et al 2005 where b 0 is the surface buoyancy flux and δ 2 k 1 is the stokes drift decay scale or e folding scale also referred to as penetration depth does take into account the wavelength through δ to measure the relative effects of convective and langmuir turbulence the monochromatic wave approximation has been made mostly on grounds of simplicity and the assumption that turbulence dynamics in the osbl are only weakly dependent on the dimensionless depth ratio k h li et al 2005 where k is the wavenumber of a monochromatic wave with stokes drift decay length δ and h is the boundary layer depth bld however more recent studies mcwilliams et al 2014 kukulka and harcourt 2017 show important differences in turbulent statistics and buoyancy entrainment rates between short equilibrium wind waves and longer swell waves les experiments of lt in pure wind seas harcourt and d asaro 2008 show that using a scale equivalent monochromatic wave does not accurately reproduce the results using a full surface wave spectrum with the same penetration depth in their study harcourt and d asaro suggest a surface layer averaged langmuir number l a s l to consider the different penetration depths of the stokes drift estimated from both monochromatic and broadband spectra further numerical experiments show that under nonequilibrium swell conditions the osbl does not restratify despite low wind and strong solar radiation kukulka et al 2013 and wind wave equilibrium can significantly affect the vertical distribution of passive buoyant tracers through near surface enhanced tke due to wave breaking and lt kukulka and brunner 2015 therefore turbulence models developed and tuned under the assumption of a monochromatic wave field cannot be expected to perform well in the real ocean and the non dimensional numbers used to characterize lt under these idealized conditions have significant limitations in characterizing lt under realistic forcing conditions perhaps the most commonly used approximation in lt parameterizations is the assumption that the wind stress and stokes drift act in the same direction in this approximation the waves are assumed to be in equilibrium with the local wind i e c p u 10 1 2 where c p is the phase speed of the waves at the peak of the wave spectrum and u 10 is the wind velocity at 10 m height the wave number is usually used to estimate the stokes drift when there is no observed or modeled data of the wave field however surface gravity waves often propagate long distances in form of swells where the wind is rarely in equilibrium with the waves hanely et al 2010 les experiments in swell show an amplification of the lagrangian mean current an enhancement of the turbulent variance and buoyancy entrainment rate from the pycnocline compared to an equilibrium wind sea mcwilliams et al 2014 the relative importance of wind and wave directions is obscured by the difficultness in measuring turbulent shear and stokes drift simultaneously but the study of kantha et al 2010 suggests a scaling proportional to the dot product of stokes drift and wind stress at the surface les experiments simulating the effect of misaligned stokes drift and wind direction show that the axial direction and rotation of the langmuir cell pairs changes significantly with the wind wave angle as well the vertical variance and scaling of the turbulent langmuir number van roekel et al 2012 these findings are supported by les experiments of tropical cyclones which show that misaligned winds and waves result in vertical momentum fluxes that counter the gradient of the stokes drift so that the potency of lt depends on the turbulent langmuir number the wind stokes drift alignment and the relative penetration scale k h of the stokes drift sullivan et al 2012 attempts to include the effect of wind wave misalignment in lt parameterizations suggest the use of the lagrangian velocity u l u s u and shear to direct part of the momentum flux down the stokes shear mcwilliams et al 2012 reichl et al 2016 2 3 les at ows p the first set of les experiments consists of two simulations at ows p one with the effect of lt and the other without the effect of lt unless otherwise specified simulations with the effect of lt will be labeled lt for example the difference in eddy viscosity between simulations with lt and without lt are computed as δ k k l t k where the eddy viscosity from simulations without lt are subtracted from simulations with the effect of lt ows p is located 850 miles off the british columbia canadian coast at 14 5 e and 5 0 n simulations span a period of 20 days starting on november 14 2011 at 1 utc and ending on december 4 2011 at 1 utc the horizontal domain is set to be 300 m in both directions which is 4 5 times of the mixed layer depth that varied between 60 m to 80 m during our simulation period and thus is wide enough to permit multiple coherent largest scale structures to develop independent of the periodic side wall boundary conditions imposed the vertical extent of the domain is 200 m which is more than twice of maximum mixed layer depth and thus can permit a smooth transition between the turbulent and stably stratified layers below a vertical grid with 128 grid points stretched towards the surface starting at 0 2 meter depth is used to better resolve the surface fluxes and the rapid vertical decay of the stokes drift profiles the model starts from rest u 0 with temperature and salinity profiles initialized from measurements at 17 levels from 1 meter to 300 meters depth which are linearly interpolated to the vertical grid both temperature and salinity profiles at initialization are vertically uniform in the upper 60 meters with a sharp thermocline halocline at the base of the mixed layer hourly wind stress τ was calculated from observed 10 m winds using the vectorized coare 3 5 algorithm modified from fairall et al 2003 and net heat flux q was computed using the sensible and latent heat fluxes from the coare 3 0 bulk algorithm as well as observations of the net shortwave and longwave radiation concurrent detailed two dimensional wave spectra e σ θ were collected near ocean station papa by the applied physics laboratory at the university of washington using a 0 9 m datawell directional waverider thomson et al 2013 where σ and θ are the frequency and direction of the spectra the hourly stokes drift profile time series were computed following kenyon 1969 4 u s z 2 ω k e ω θ e 2 k z d σ d θ where k is the wave number vector of the spectra surface fluxes and stokes drift are shown in fig 1 along with the wind wave angle of misalignment θ w w and stokes e folding depth δ note that during this 20 day period wind stress ranges between 0 and 1 2 pa 0 25 ms 1 and heat flux ranges from 450 wm 2 strongly convective to 175 wm 2 stable providing a wide range of surface forcing conditions for testing our model the dashed lines in fig 1 indicate the 10 inertial periods t 1 t 10 from november 16 at 07 12 utc to november 22 at 19 25 utc used to guide our parameterization which is then tested for the entire 20 day period 2 4 les with varying wind wave wind wave angles the second set of les experiments consists on a suite of idealized experiments with wind wave misalignment angles ranging from 0 to 135 degrees used to guide the lt parameterization under different angles of misalignment stratified ocean initial conditions are prescribed for the idealized experiments with a constant density layer in top 20 m below that layer stable stratification of d θ d z 0 01 k m is prescribed with a constant thermal expansion coefficient α 2 10 4 k 1 constant forcing is applied for all experiments following mcwilliams et al 1997 with wind stress τ 0 037 nm 2 corresponding to a wind speed of about 5 m s 1 a weak heat flux into the ocean of q 5 wm 2 and a stokes drift profile from a sinusoidal wave with an amplitude of 0 8 m and length of 60 m corresponding to stokes drift with surface value of u s 0 068 m s 1 this implies a l a t equal to 0 3 the x ˆ direction in the model is defined as the along wind direction the boundary layer environment is uniformly rotating for all experiments with f 8 5867 10 5 s 1 corresponding to 36 17 n latitude all model runs are spun up from rest to a statistical equilibrium state after one inertial period 20 3 h for more details on this set of simulations the reader is referred to fan et al 2020 2 5 tke budget we start by considering the tke budget to gain insight on the relative importance of each term responsible for vertical mixing the horizontal domain averaged tke equation can be written as 5 e t t t p shear p b u o y t pressure p stokes ɛ s g s where t t 1 2 u 2 w z v 2 w z w 2 w z is the turbulent transport term p shear u w u z v w v z is the shear production term p b u o y α g θ w β g s w is the buoyancy production term t pressure 1 ρ 0 p w z is the pressure transport term p stokes u w u s x z v w u s y z is the stokes production term e is the total tke ɛ is the kinetic energy dissipation rate and s g s is the subgrid scale contribution the angle bracket in the above equations represents horizontal domain average the superscript prime denotes a departure from the mean value the tke budget for the les experiments with and without the effect of lt at ows p are shown in fig 2 averaged over the ten inertial periods shown in fig 1 in the absence of lt the balance is between shear production buoyancy and dissipation but in the presence of lt stokes production becomes the dominant source of energy at the surface followed by shear production while transport terms that are negligible in simulations without lt now play a minor role the contribution from shear production when lt is present decreases because vertical gradients of velocity decrease faster than the increase in turbulent fluxes commonly referred to as the anti stokes effect haney 2015 pearson et al 2018 the turbulent transport and pressure terms are also significantly larger in the simulation with lt while the dissipation is slightly reduced suggesting that the excess of available energy at the near surface is transported downwards instead of being dissipated at the surface at the surface stokes production is the largest source of tke but buoyancy term is dominant in the bulk of the mixed layer which is easier to observe in a linear plot not shown buoyancy production also increases slightly suggesting stokes shear and buoyancy work together to increase vertical mixing using these model results and dimensional analysis we now consider various physical parameters that may contribute to the enhanced vertical mixing by lt 3 langmuir turbulence parameterization in this study we aim to parameterize the enhancement in vertical mixing brought by the inclusion of lt in turbulent models which already account for shear and convection hence our variable of interest is δ k k l t k where k l t is the eddy viscosity in the presence of lt and k is the eddy viscosity due to shear and convection only posing the problem in this manner allows this parameterization to be added to any already existing turbulent closure model that neglects the effect of lt additionally under certain conditions the difference in eddy viscosity is allowed to be negative for cases in which the presence of the stokes drift reduces the turbulent intensity we model the eddy viscosity without the effect of lt exactly as in large et al 1994 6 k σ h w m σ g σ where h is the bld w m is a turbulent velocity scale g is a nondimensional shape function and σ z h is a nondimensional vertical coordinate that varies from 0 at the surface to 1 at the base of the boundary layer where z is the distance from the surface eq 6 is a common way to calculate eddy viscosities and diffusivities in one equation in some models the non local flux is computed differently for example in large et al 1994 it is zero for momentum but non zero for scalars temperature salinity in our study we focus only on the local down gradient component k first term eq 7 and treat eddy viscosity diffusivity in the same way so it is not necessary to discuss eddy viscosities and diffusivities separately this also keeps the prandtl number unaltered and equal to w m w s in accordance to troen and mahrt 1986 this is discussed in appendix b from large et al 1994 for details of this parameterization the reader is referred to large et al 1994 note that we implemented the kpp scheme in ncom as it was originally presented and did not tune it for our application since the model was also originally tuned to ows p observations it provides a good benchmark for comparison but this also implies that the effect of lt is implicitly accounted for to some degree for simplicity we apply the parameterization to both the eddy viscosity and diffusivity in the same fashion 3 1 definitions first we provide a formal definition for three important physical parameters used in the parameterization and model validation eddy viscosity mld and bld the eddy viscosity diffusivity is used in ocean models to parameterize the vertical turbulent momentum heat fluxes as 7 w λ k λ z λ γ λ where w λ refers to the turbulent flux of a quantity λ which may be specified for momentum u w v w or scalars such as temperature w θ z λ is the mean vertical gradient and γ λ represents any flux not proportional to the local gradient li et al 2019 for the purposes of this study the eddy viscosity k refers specifically to the turbulent momentum flux and we diagnose it in les as the scalar eddy viscosity 8 k u w 2 v w 2 u z 2 v z 2 additionally we omit the non local flux γ λ in eq 7 following large et al 1994 the oceanic bld is defined from a physical standpoint as the limit to which the largest boundary layer eddies can penetrate in the vertical direction which depends on the surface forcing oceanic buoyancy b z and the mean velocity v z u profiles in kpp models the bld is defined as the smallest distance z at which the bulk richardson number r i b equals a critical value r i c 9 r i b b r b d z v r v z 2 v t 2 z where b r and v r are the near surface reference buoyancy and velocity respectively computed by averaging each respective profile over the surface layer h s l ε h and the term v t 2 is a velocity scale which accounts for the unresolved velocity shear note that fluxes should be about 20 of their surface value at the surface layer depth and approach linearly as z becomes small which has been taken to be about 10 of the boundary layer depth a value originally taken from atmospheric boundary layer values tennekes 1973 large et al 1994 we find that this is roughly a good estimate in our simulations and therefore we choose to set ε 0 1 when computing the near surface reference buoyancy and velocity in 8 however when computing the surface layer averaged langmuir number defined later the averaging is taken to be 20 of the mixed layer in both cases we choose these definitions to be consistent with the original work large et al 1994 for all of our analyses we use a critical richardson number r i c 0 3 in simulations without the effect of the stokes drift the velocity scale v t 2 is parameterized using eq 23 from large et al 1994 10 v t c v β t 1 2 r i c κ 2 c s ε 1 2 d n w s where c v 1 6 is the ratio of stratification frequency n at the interior and the entrainment depth β t is the ratio of entrainment flux to surface buoyancy flux w s is the turbulent velocity scale for scalars and κ 0 4 is von karman s constant in simulations that include the stokes drift it is parameterized using eq 26 from li and fox kemper 2017 11 v t c v n w s d r i c 0 15 w 3 0 17 u 3 1 0 49 l a s l 2 w s 3 1 2 the surface layer averaged langmuir number l a s l harcourt and d asaro 2008 is defined as 12 l a s l u u s s l u r e f s where the u r e f s is a reference velocity equal to the stokes drift velocity at 0 765 h m and the surface layer averaged velocity is defined as 13 u s s l 5 h m h m 5 0 u s d z as we will discuss later parameterization of the unresolved stokes drift through the velocity scale v t 2 as suggested by li and fox kemper 2017 is essential to estimate the bld finally we define the mld h m as the depth at which the temperature changes by 0 2 0 c from its surface value in our simulations this corresponds roughly to a change of 0 03 kg m 3 from the surface which shows better agreement in global simulations compared to other criteria de boyer monteǵut et al 2004 for additional discussion on the difference between the mld bld and other length scales relevant to scaling turbulence in the osbl the reader is referred to sutherland et al 2014 and pearson et al 2018 as will be discussed later all kpp parameterizations results show significant sensitivity to the computation of the bld 3 2 scaling of lt physical variables a critical aspect of any model parameterization is to provide the proper scaling for the phenomena under study which requires the identification of the relevant physical variables affecting the flow the eddy viscosity k has units of m 2 s is composed of two fundamental units length and time using dimensional analysis we can express the enhancement of the eddy viscosity as 14 δ k f f 1 f 2 f n where f 1 f 2 f n are the most relevant physical variables affecting the enhancement in vertical mixing in the presence of lt according to monin obukhov similarity theory the important turbulence parameters affecting the surface layer are the distance from the boundary z and surface fluxes w λ the contribution from wind forced turbulence p shear is commonly scaled using the water side friction velocity u τ ρ 0 and buoyancy production p b u o y is usually scaled using the surface buoyancy flux b 0 or deardorff s convective velocity w b 0 h 1 3 the relevant physical parameters used to describe the contribution from the stokes drift p stokes is more complicated but some les studies suggest that the wave forced turbulence should be scaled with a langmuir velocity scale w l u 2 u s 1 3 and a mixed layer depth h m harcourt and d asaro 2008 grant and belcher 2009 this is in fact the most convenient way to scale the contribution from the stokes drift but it suffers from the same limitation as the turbulent langmuir number in that it shows no explicit sensitivity to the stokes drift depth scale such that wind swell waves with the same surface stokes drift associated with shorter longer penetration depths will scale identically to capture the effect of the stokes penetration depth we choose to scale the contribution from the stokes drift using the depth scale δ and the stokes shear at the surface s 0 the stratification is considered through the mld so we can express the dimensional eddy viscosity difference as 15 δ k f u b 0 s 0 δ h m 3 3 scaling of lt dimensionless numbers in order to find the appropriate dimensionless variables to be used in the parameterization we start by non dimensionalizing our variable of interest δ k since we chose the surface stokes shear as the most relevant scale affecting stokes production we normalize our eddy viscosity difference as 16 π δ k s 0 u 2 we now seek to scale the surface value of dimensionless eddy viscosity π using the relevant physical parameters in eq 15 in fig 3 we show the scaling of our dimensionless eddy viscosity 16 during the ten inertial periods shown in fig 1 with the turbulent langmuir number mcwilliams et al 1997 the surface layer langmuir number harcourt and d asaro 2008 the depth ratio h m δ and the dimensionless parameter u δ s 0 the turbulent langmuir number which provides a dimensionless ratio between shear and stokes production at the surface is in the range of 0 22 0 37 during the 6 5 day period plotted in fig 3 and the surface layer langmuir number which integrates the stokes drift over the surface layer is in the range of 0 35 0 75 neither of which yields a good scaling with π for short wind waves of penetration depths of δ 1 2 m as indicated by the smaller size of the scatter markers in fig 3 show a different scaling than for deeper δ 5 8 m waves a similar scaling is observed with u δ s 0 due to the fact that u s 1 δ s 0 so that this ratio is analogous to the turbulent langmuir number the depth ratio h m δ increases with π suggesting that the penetration depth is in fact a relevant physical parameter but it also fails to scale with π as the depth ratio increases over a certain threshold to get a better scaling for π with we obtain a new parameter by combining h m δ and u δ s 0 to form 17 u δ s 0 δ h m u s 0 h m l a m the scaling of this new modified langmuir number l a m with the surface value of the dimensionless eddy viscosity 16 is shown in fig 4 which shows great improvement over those in fig 3 however the scaling fails as the wind wave angle of misalignment increases suggesting that it is in fact a relevant parameter affecting vertical mixing in the ocean and must therefore be taken into account in our parameterization 3 4 effect of wind wave wind wave misalignment in this section we use our idealized les experiments described in section 2 4 to guide the parameterization of the wind wave angle of misalignment as a starting point since our idealized les experiments are performed under very similar conditions i e weakly convective monochromatic waves and a steady wind stress we use the suggested enhancement by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 to parameterize the effect of lt for the case of aligned wind waves θ w w 0 18 k l t σ h w m σ g σ 1 c w l a t 4 1 2 where c w accounts for the effect of convection and is computed using eq 13 from smyth et al 2002 to account for the effect of wind wave misalignment on the enhancement of eddy viscosity we introduce a function g θ w w to parameterize the difference in eddy viscosity as 19 δ k k l t k g θ w w then we compute the eddy viscosity difference k l t k from our les experiments as a function of the wind wave angle shown in fig 5 by the solid lines in agreement with previous studies e g van roekel et al 2018 vertical mixing enhancement is maximum for aligned wind waves θ w w 0 and decreases with increasing angle of misalignment results from our idealized les experiments also suggest that at high wind wave angles θ w w 4 5 turbulence levels resemble simulations without lt i e δ k 0 and further increasing the misalignment θ w w 6 0 results in lower turbulence levels δ k 0 fan et al 2020 this observation supports the idea that the wind wave misalignment angle is an important factor affecting the scaling of dimensionless eddy viscosity with our dimensionless parameter l a m eq 17 which fails to scale after the wind wave misalignment angle is greater than around 45 degrees fig 4 the parameterization of the difference in eddy viscosity using large et al 1994 for k and by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 for k l t i e k l t k dashed blue line in fig 5 shows good agreement with our les simulation for the case of aligned wind waves solid blue line now we can derive the form of g θ w w hereafter called the wind wave modulation function by analyzing the eddy viscosity difference computed from les and assuming that the reduction in vertical mixing is symmetrical along the direction of the wind meaning that there is no difference in vertical mixing if the stokes drift is misaligned to the right left of the wind direction therefore the wind wave angle of misalignment has a range θ w w 0 18 0 and g θ w w should be symmetric about θ w w 0 additionally since the eddy viscosity difference decreases faster at lower wind wind wave angles i e the difference from θ w w 0 30 is greater than θ w w 90 120 we assume g θ w w decays rapidly with these constraints we choose a generalized form for the wind wave modulation function 20 g θ w w c 1 e θ w w cos c 2 θ w w c 3 where c 1 c 2 c 3 are constants used to match the parameterization with the les eddy viscosity difference which we set using the following constraints enhancement of the difference is maximum at 0 degrees so g 0 1 enhancement of the difference is 0 around 45 degrees so g 45 0 maximum reduction is around 90 degrees so g 90 min g 0 the wind wave modulation function is allowed to be negative at high wind wave angles to account for the negative viscosity difference observed in les fig 5 the wind wave modulation function shown in fig 6 takes the final form 21 g θ w w e cos 3 π 8 θ w w cos θ w w 2 3 π 8 the parameterization as a function of the misalignment angle eq 15 where k is computed using eq 6 k l t is computed using eq 18 and g θ w w is computed using eq 21 is shown in fig 5 by the dashed lines showing good agreement with the diagnosed eddy viscosity values from our idealized les 3 5 effect of surface heat flux in the ocean surface heat fluxes have significant influence over the temperature distributions and the extent of the boundary layer global simulations show that convective turbulence dominates a significant portion 17 of the low latitudes year round and about two thirds of the world s oceans act under combined langmuir and convective turbulence belcher et al 2012 li et al 2019 in our simulations buoyancy production p b u o y is enhanced in the presence of lt and became comparable with the other two production terms fig 2 furthermore in our simulations at ows p the shape of the k profiles changes significantly in the presence of lt and agreement with our parameterized eddy viscosity profiles over a wide range of surface heat fluxes highly convective to stable was improved by modifying the non dimensional shape function g σ the assumptions made in the original formulation of the non local kpp scheme are still valid when lt is present namely zero eddy viscosity at top bottom of the bl zero gradient at the bottom and linear gradient at the top the minimum degree of the polynomial needs to be 3 to accommodate for the 4 necessary constraints note that in the previous section we provided a scaling for the non dimensional eddy viscosity difference at the surface which is not zero we use the modified langmuir number eq 16 to provide a scaling of the overall magnitude difference of the eddy viscosity with and without lt throughout the entire bl analogous to the suggested model in mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 which makes the eddy viscosity everywhere in the bl proportional to the turbulent langmuir number defined at the surface in practice the assumption of g 0 0 does not affect the surface scaling in ocean models since vertical mixing variables in ncom as well as other models such as the regional ocean modeling system are defined at the grid faces and the eddy viscosity at the surface is used as the vertical boundary condition set by the wind stress setting g 0 0 thus offers the theoretical argument that boundary layer eddies should not cross the ocean atmosphere interface and the practical reason that the first grid point at the face is not used to compute interior fluxes although the minimum degree of the polynomial must be 3 to accommodate the 4 constraints there is no reason not to increase the degree of the polynomial by expressing the shape function g σ as a binomial expansion of degree n we can generalize and use some of its properties 22 g σ σ 1 σ n 23 g σ 1 σ 1 n σ 1 σ eqs 21 and 22 express the non dimensional shape function and its derivative respectively as a function of the non dimensional coordinate σ and the expansion coefficient n which equals 2 for simulations without lt fig 7 shows the non dimensional shape function g σ eq 21 as a function of the expansion coefficient n by increasing the degree of the binomial expansion we can control the magnitude and shape of the k profiles as a matter of fact the maximum of g is only a function of the degree of the expansion and is found at max g 1 n 1 therefore we assume the expansion coefficient n varies linearly with a yet undetermined dimensionless buoyancy flux parameter π 2 f b 0 24 n c 4 π 2 c 5 where c 4 c 5 are the empirical constants used to tune our parameterization to the observed les profiles in the kpp the eddy viscosity profile has a convex shape with magnitude u 2 f and a depth scale u f mcwilliams and huckle 2006 since the non dimensional shape function sets the depth at which the eddy viscosity is maximum fig 7 and the wavy ekman layer is modified in the presence of lt mcwilliams et al 1997 2012 we let our dimensionless parameter π 2 be a function of the coriolis frequency f we chose the coriolis frequency to form π 2 because in the ocean the mld is clearly a function of latitude and most importantly because it is linearly independent from all other physical parameters considered and hence required by the buckingham pi theorem to complete the parameterization since the stable stratification at the base of the mixed layer also affects the depth scale of penetration we let our dimensionless parameter π 2 be a function of the mld h m therefore we normalize the surface buoyancy flux as 25 π 2 b 0 f 3 h m therefore in our model the enhancement of the eddy viscosity in the presence of lt is a function of the wind stress u surface buoyancy flux b 0 surface stokes shear s 0 coriolis frequency f stratification h m boundary layer depth h and wind wave angle of misalignment θ w w the modified shape function is given by combining eq 21 23 and 24 26 g σ π 2 σ 1 σ c 4 π 2 c 5 3 6 lt model in this section we introduce our model for the enhancement of eddy viscosity in the presence of lt we use previous suggestions by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 and smyth et al 2002 but instead of parameterizing the eddy viscosity as in eq 18 we parameterize the eddy viscosity difference using 27 δ k h w x σ ε π 1 g σ π 2 g θ w w where h is the bld computed using eqs 9 and 11 g σ π 2 is our modified shape function eq 26 g θ w w is our wind wave modulation function eq 21 and ε π 1 is the enhancement of the magnitude due to the stokes drift given by 28 ε π 1 c w π 1 2 1 2 note that the kpp scheme from large et al 1994 implicitly includes the effect of lt by tuning their model constants to ocean observations but it may misrepresent the entrainment under varying wave conditions and result in biases in boundary layer depth li and fox kemper 2017 and therefore the difference eq 27 reflects the correction to the original kpp scheme on the lt effect instead of the pure lt effect the enhancements due to lt nondimensional parameters constants used in our parameterization are summarized in table 1 note that the enhancement eq 27 has a similar form to the suggested enhancement by smyth et al 2002 where the dominant wave direction is assumed to be aligned with the local wind direction but scales with l a m u s 0 h m instead of l a t u u s and further drop the plus one since in the absence of stokes drift there should be no enhancement i e ε π 1 0 as π 1 the enhancement due to lt eq 28 is based on the formulation first suggested by mcwilliams and sullivan 2001 where the dominant wave direction is aligned with the local wind direction but scales with l a m u s 0 h m instead of l a t u u s similar to the surface layer averaged langmuir number harcourt and d asaro 2008 we find that l a m scales well with different penetration depths and has similar performance to the traditional turbulent langmuir number under the idealized assumptions of aligned wind waves and monochromatic waves the wind wave misalignment is modeled explicitly using eq 21 g θ w w where the wind varies from 0 to 180 degrees and we assume symmetry along the aligned wind wave direction fig 6 this modification is based on a set of les simulations under stationary wind stress and weakly convective heat flux that show the eddy viscosity difference between simulations with and without lt is fig 5 1 maximum for aligned wind waves no enhancement at θ w w 4 5 and minimum at θ w w 9 0 which lead to the constants used in our simulations table 1 finally the modified shape function adjusts the local eddy viscosities including the depth at which vertical mixing is maximum based on the nondimensional parameter b 0 f 3 h m in our simulations at ows p this parameter is a strong function of the surface buoyancy flux b 0 which has significant influence on the shape of the eddy viscosities computed from les and we adjust the constants in ncom to match the les profiles these enhancements and nondimensional parameters are discussed further in the following section for clarity the complete parameterization that includes the effect of wind waves and convection is given by 29 k σ h w m σ g σ δ k where the first term on the right is the parameterization of large et al 1994 and δ k is described in eq 27 4 results the k profile parameterization as described in large et al 1994 was implemented in ncom for the first time and therefore we start by validating these results with observations and les experiments at ows p in section 4 1 the ncom experiment set up is described and we briefly summarize the implementation of the smc models in sections 4 2 and 4 3 we discuss the results from the simulations without and with lt respectively focusing on the eddy viscosity profiles in section 4 4 we compare all ncom results with les and observed temperature section 5 summarizes the overall performance of the schemes and further offer an intermodal comparison with other kpp models 4 1 ncom experiments a set of 1 dimensional ncom simulations is performed at ows p under the same surface forcing conditions as in the les experiments fig 1 the vertical grid uses the same number of grid points n 128 as the les with similar stretching towards the surface and double periodic boundary conditions are used in the horizontal direction following the horizontal homogeneity approximation made in this study as reported in other studies van roekel et al 2018 li et al 2019 we find significant sensitivity in our ncom experiments with different vertical grid resolutions we performed simulations with 50 100 128 and 150 grid points spanning the top 200 m of the ocean and show only those for 128 grid points because the difference to those with 150 grid points shows negligible difference but allows a more direct comparison with les simulations using the same vertical resolution the mean velocity is initialized from rest and temperature salinity fields are interpolated from observations to the ncom grid the same procedure is followed to interpolate the stokes drift velocity following the les experiments we assume horizontal homogeneity and use double periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal directions comparison of temperature profiles between observations and les shown in figs 11 and 13 suggests that this is a good approximation for most of the 20 day period at ows p with sst deviating from les result only in the last 4 days following the nomenclature used for the les experiments simulations with the effect of lt will be indicated by the lt label for example ncom simulations using the kantha clayson scheme will be labeled kc and kc lt for simulations without and with the effect of lt respectively the model of li and fox kemper 2017 is labeled kpp lf to differentiate from out kpp lt model 4 2 simulations under shear and convection only the first set of simulations compares the vertical mixing schemes of mellor yamada 2 5 mellor and yamada 1982 kantha and clayson 1994 harcourt 2013 2015 and kpp large et al 1994 where the stokes drift is identically zero i e no lt the implementation of these schemes is based on the original work by the authors including the constants used to tune the contribution from shear buoyancy production dissipation diffusion and transport of turbulent energy these are also based on simulations at ows p for at least one year not shown to make sure that mixed layer deepening and restratification are accurate over long periods in ncom both kpp and smc models use the eddy viscosity to estimate the vertical turbulent fluxes and thus provide a quantitative measure of the approximate mixing strength between different schemes the inertially averaged eddy viscosities from the experiments without lt are shown in fig 8 where the solid black lines are from les and the colored dashed lines are from ncom simulations the 10 inertial periods are taken over a 6 5 day period shown by the dashed black lines in fig 1 characterized by strong winds and convection e g period t2 short periods of moderately misaligned wind wave angles periods t4 t6 and t7 and periods of moderate winds and weakly convective neutral surface heating periods t8 t10 for most periods the kpp scheme shows more resemblance to the diagnosed eddy viscosity from les compared to the other smc schemes which on average have a higher magnitude located lower in the ml results from temperature distributions is further discussed in section 4 4 4 3 ncom with lt a second set of ncom simulations was performed to compare the performance of the kantha and clayson 2004 and harcourt 2015 schemes with our proposed parameterization described in section 4 labeled kpp lt as well as the parameterization from li and fox kemper 2017 hereafter referred to as kpp lf the setup of the ncom simulations is identical to simulations with only shear and convection with the only difference being the addition of the stokes drift first we start by comparing the diagnosed eddy viscosity from les lt with the ncom simulations shown by color contours on a logarithmic scale in fig 9 during the period from november 16 to 17 characterized by strong shear convection and stokes drift les lt shows mixing rates of about 1 m 2 s and rapid ml deepening in agreement with kpp lt and kpp lf models the eddy viscosity from the kc lt model seems to underestimate the mixing strength during this period of high turbulent production which is improved in the hc lt model suggesting that the corrections to the algebraic reynold stress model by harcourt 2015 significantly improve the smc scheme during the last day of the simulations where surface conditions are close to neutral to weakly stable the contours of eddy viscosity from hc lt show good agreement but overall both kpp lt and kpp lf do a reasonable job at estimating the bld the rapid deepening of the ml in les lt indicated by the white lines in fig 9 is more gradual in the smc models compared the kpp models but all of them are underestimated compared to les this is discussed further in the next section it is hard to elucidate the differences between the kpp lt and kpp lf schemes from logarithmic color contours which are more useful to compare the order of magnitude rather than precise values therefore we compare the inertially averaged profiles during the period from november 16 to 23 in fig 10 in agreement with fig 9 the overall magnitude of the kpp models is larger compared to smc schemes and in better agreement with les the shape of the kpp lt model is in better agreement with les lt as can be expected since we tuned our model to these results and is of course absent from kpp lf during periods of wind wave misalignment 2 0 periods t4 and t7 both the shape and magnitude of the profiles show good agreement under the conditions at ows p that is a well defined mixed layer and in the absence of horizontal currents 1d simulations the improvement in kpp lf and kpp lt is mainly through the modification of entrainment via the turbulent velocity scale eq 10 and should be considered when parameterizing other unresolved phenomena 4 4 temperature further validation of our model is shown by comparing sst from ncom with les and observations presented in fig 11 which in the absence of horizontal gradients and under the same surface conditions closely resembles the behavior and magnitude of the mld not shown for simulations under only shear and convective turbulence top panel the sst from my2 5 and kc are identical as are the result from hc and kpp models with the latter showing slightly lower temperatures and therefore slightly greater entrainment during the period of rapid ml deepening sst from les is about 0 1 degrees higher than observed which can be attributed to lt when observing that les lt simulations show near perfect agreement during this 2 day period however during the last 2 days of the simulation sst from les lt diverges from observations this is most likely due to the lack of rainfall data in the simulations when heavy rainfall events were noted during these days in the bottom panel of fig 11 we see that sst for our kpp lt model is in better agreement with observations and is improved from kpp lf by roughly 0 1 degrees but mixing is still underestimated compared to les and observations this discrepancy might be explained by the lack on non local transport in our model since divergence from les and observations happens during the period of strongest convection around november 17 where strong counter gradient fluxes present in les can play an important role in deepening the ml large et al 2019b fig 12 shows color contours of the diagnosed eddy viscosity from les with lt superimposed with the bld computed in three different ways 1 using the parameterization of large et al 1994 2 using lagrangian velocities in the bulk richardson number v u 2 u s 2 and 3 using the surface layer averaged langmuir number parameterization from li and fox kemper 2017 during the period of strong convection winds around november 17 the parameterization from large et al 1994 becomes shallower due to the decrease of the vertical velocity gradients while using the lagrangian velocities mean stokes improves the estimate of the bld during convective periods it is still too shallow when the surface becomes stabilizing as seen around december 1st in fig 12 therefore we find in our simulations that the parameterization of li and fox kemper 2017 for the bld to be more accurate than other suggested estimates this also suggests that in the absence of horizontal advection it is the eddy viscosity at the pycnocline that largely influences sst and mld while the eddy viscosity within the mixed layer is less important finally we compare the temperature distribution in the vertical direction from our ncom lt simulations with les lt and observations in fig 13 for the 6 5 day period shown in fig 1 the solid black line in the left panel shows the observed temperature on november 16 at 7utc when the ml is approximately 60 m deep and the purple dots indicate the observations on november 22 at 19utc during this 6 5 day period the sst decreases by 1 degree from 8 6 to 7 6 c and the ml deepens by almost 20 m the les lt experiment dashed purple line shows great agreement with observations both above and below the mixed layer with the largest error at 150 m depth and an error of less than 0 1 c at the surface due to the large temperature gradient at the pycnocline the error in temperature at 80 m depth is large for all ncom simulations 1 degree but this error is significantly reduced in the kpp lt model as well as the error with observed mld which is about 5 m deeper in our kpp lt model compared to kpp lf and smc models the largest differences between the les and kpp lt model are found below the mixed layer where we have not modified the original formulation from large et al 1994 and therefore does not account for other important effects in the ocean interior such as the presence of internal waves which may potentially alter the mixed layer significantly garrett and kunze 2007 below the bld the main source of vertical mixing in the kpp scheme for our simulations are shear instabilities modeled using the gradient richardson number eqs 27 and 28 in large et al 1994 5 summary and conclusions a new k profile parameterization kpp lt for the enhancement of the eddy viscosity in the presence of langmuir turbulence has been developed and implemented in the navy coastal ocean model this model was developed and tuned using a set of les at ocean weather station papa spanning a 20 day period from november 14th to december 4th 2011 les and ncom simulations are forced at the surface with wind stress and heat fluxes derived from observed atmospheric measurements and the stokes drift is computed from observed 2d wave spectra to allow the stokes drift to evolve independently from the wind forcing fig 1 in agreement with previous studies les at ows p show enhanced vertical mixing figs 9 and 10 and tke fig 2 in the presence of lt significant reduction of shear production by the mean currents p shear with enhanced vertical transport stokes production p stokes and buoyancy production p b u o y resulting in a deeper mixed layer depth and in the absence of lateral horizontal gradients lower sst with better agreement with observations a set of idealized les experiments under different wind waveangles of misalignment θ w w was used to parameterize the effect of the misalignment between the wind stress and stokes drift these simulations show that the vertical mixing is maximum for the case of aligned wind wave angles i e θ w w 0 but further increasing this angle leads to no enhancement θ w w 45 6 0 over simulations without lt and even reduction in the turbulent energy figs 2 and 7 for very high wind wave angles θ w w 60 the kpp lt scheme eq 22 is based on the non local kpp scheme large et al 1994 with 4 important modifications 1 increased entrainment of buoyancy flux parameterized via the bulk richardson number li and fox kemper 2017 2 the enhancement of vertical mixing by lt ε π 1 based on suggestions by mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 and smyth et al 2002 3 the effect of the surface buoyancy flux through modifications to the non dimensional shape function g σ π 2 and 4 the wind wave angle of misalignment through the wind wave modulation function g θ w w in our model the enhancement due to the inclusion of the stokes drift is parameterized using a modified langmuir number π 1 l a m which shows better scaling with our non dimensional eddy viscosity π eq 13 our ncom experiments show improvement of the eddy viscosity in kpp simulations compared to smc models both with and without the effect of lt figs 8 and 10 an important goal of this paper was to highlight the advantages and limitations of current smc and kpp models which still show significant differences under the same forcing conditions in ocean simulations by far the largest shortcoming of the kpp model as presented in this study and conceptualized by large et al 1994 is the assumption of an immobile surface which makes it complicated to represent the ocean s surface dynamics which is formally addressed in large et al 2019a b smc models have addressed the need for additional turbulence due to stokes drift by injecting additional tke at the surface using the dot product of wind stress and stokes drift as a scaling parameter kantha et al 2010 that considers wind wave misalignment finally in this study we do not address the issue of nonlocal transport that has been shown to be important in highly convective flows or the role of vertical grid resolution in the accuracy of smc and kpp models in view of these limitations it seems necessary that new parameterizations are proposed that prioritize these issues to start with since they have proved to be highly elusive declaration of competing interest

23857,meridional transport variability induced by westward propagating eddies impinging on the western boundary is investigated both analytically and numerically a simple theory is first developed in the framework of the reduced gravity model which relates eddy induced meridional transport to eddy thickness anomalies propagated into the western boundary by long rossby waves and this is followed by a suite of numerical model experiments it is found that eddies impinging on the western boundary excite boundary waves that propagate equatorward along the western boundary which leads to coherent meridional overturning circulation moc anomalies equatorward of the incident eddy field the magnitude and duration of eddy induced moc anomalies are variable and irregular ranging from less than 1 sv to over 5 sv and from less than 10 days to over 100 days importantly these eddy induced moc anomalies lead to considerable meridional heat transport variability across the latitudes with implications for seasonal and interannual climate variability and prediction keywords ocean eddy meridional overturning circulation western boundary ocean modelling 1 introduction the meridional overturning circulation moc of the global ocean dominates the exchange of water as well as climatically important properties it carries between ocean basins and across latitudes within the basins for example in the subtropical north atlantic the moc transports approximately 1 pw 1 pw 1 0 15 w of heat northward with important consequences for european climate and arctic sea ice variability e g vellinga and wood 2002 mahajan et al 2011 as revealed by recent rapid array observations e g cunningham et al 2007 mccarthy et al 2012 the strength of the moc varies on all time scales on decadal and longer time scales the moc variability is found to be closely related to low frequency changes of basin wide wind stress field and high latitude surface buoyancy flux e g eden and willebrand 2001 cessi and louazel 2001 johnson and marshall 2002 zhai et al 2014 on the shorter seasonal and interannual time scales the moc variability is often attributed to higher frequency wind driven ekman transport fluctuations e g jayne and marotzke 2001 biastoch et al 2008 this understanding of moc variability which is based primarily on linear theory and coarse resolution ocean model simulations is linear and deterministic in nature that is any changes of the moc can be traced back to changes in external forcing on the other hand the ocean is populated with nonlinear mesoscale eddies which dominate the ocean s kinetic energy spectra e g ferrari and wunsch 2009 chelton et al 2011 ni et al 2020 apart from in the antarctic circumpolar current and separated western boundary currents these nonlinear eddies are observed to propagate ubiquitously westward chelton et al 2011 ni et al 2020 upon arriving at the western boundary the majority of the energy associated with the eddies is dissipated within the narrow western boundary region due to processes such as loss of balance zhai et al 2010 yang et al 2021 while the eddy energy is shown to be dissipated at the western boundary the fate of volume anomalies carried westward by the eddies is much less clear it is possible that pressure anomalies are built up by eddies impinging on the western boundary which subsequently drive anomalous alongshore boundary current transport there have been extensive studies of the dynamics of a large isolated eddy interacting with a side boundary e g smith and o brien 1983 smith 1986 shi and nof 1994 sutyrin et al 2003 frolov et al 2004 wei and wang 2009 for example shi and nof 1994 showed that when an eddy encounters a sidewall it migrates in the alongshore direction under the influence of the beta force image effect and rocket effect and they found that the image effect usually dominates with the addition of a continental shelf and slope the eddy boundary interaction becomes more complicated it results in the spinup of secondary cyclones anticyclones and the excitation of topography waves e g sutyrin et al 2003 frolov et al 2004 wei and wang 2009 however the focus of these studies has been primarily on the evolution and trajectory of an incident eddy upon its arrival at a side boundary to our knowledge there have been few studies investigating the eddy induced meridional transport and moc variability thomas and zhai 2013 isolated the contribution of eddies to moc variability in an eddy permitting model of the north atlantic by forcing it with climatological and steady surface forcing they found that the eddy induced moc variability is ubiquitous and significant at all latitudes with a magnitude comparable to the seasonally forced moc particularly in the subtropics furthermore the eddy induced moc variability is found to manifest not only at high frequencies e g days to weeks but also at seasonal and longer time scales marshall et al 2013 proposed that the stokes drift or bolus transport associated with westward propagating rossby waves and eddies is returned eastward through eulerian mean currents which they termed rossby rip currents more recently domingues et al 2019 investigated the impact of eddy like westward propagating signals on the florida current variability using controlled realistic numerical experiments and they found both a direct response involving eddy wall interaction and an indirect response involving eddy perturbation of gulf stream meandering although the realistic modelling studies of thomas and zhai 2013 and domingues et al 2019 have highlighted the potential significance of eddy induced moc variability a theoretical understanding and analysis is still lacking in this study we investigate meridional transport variability induced by westward propagating eddies impinging on the western boundary using a combination of linear theory and idealised model simulations the paper is organised as follows in section 2 a simple theory is developed in the framework of a reduced gravity model which relates eddy induced meridional transport to eddy thickness anomalies propagated into the western boundary by long rossby waves in section 3 results from a suite of numerical model experiments are presented ranging from a simple gaussian eddy interacting with vertical western sidewall to satellite derived ocean eddy field interacting with realistic western boundary geometry finally the key findings from this study are summarised and discussed in section 4 2 eddy induced western boundary transport following the earlier theoretical work of godfrey 1975 and minobe et al 2017 here we consider the volume budget of a narrow western boundary layer in the northern hemisphere enclosed by the dotted lines in fig 1 and derive eddy induced meridional transport in the framework of a reduced gravity model we start with the linear continuity equation 1 h t h u x v y 0 where u and v are the zonal and meridional velocities and h is the upper layer thickness anomaly from its initial value h integrating 1 from the western boundary at x x w to just outside the western boundary layer at x x b while noting the no normal flow boundary condition at the western boundary i e u 0 at x x w we get 2 x w x b h t d x u b h t y 0 where u b y t is the zonal velocity anomaly at x x b associated with the incident eddy field and t y t x w x b v h d x is the meridional alongshore boundary current transport outside of the western boundary layer the geostrophic balance applies i e 3 f u b g h b y where f y is the coriolis parameter g is the reduced gravity and h b y t is the upper layer thickness anomaly at x x b now substituting 3 into 2 and integrating between latitudes at the northern y n and southern y s limits of the incident eddy field fig 1 we obtain the volume budget for the narrow western boundary layer 4 a h t d a y s y n c y h b d y t n t s 0 here a is the horizontal area of the western boundary layer t n and t s are meridional western boundary current transports at y n and y s respectively and c y β g h f 2 is the long rossby wave speed where β d f d y is the meridional gradient of the coriolis parameter in deriving 4 integration by parts is used and h b is assumed to vanish at y y n and y y s physically 4 states that the volume change in the western boundary layer is caused by eddy thickness anomalies propagating into the western boundary layer from the ocean interior at long rossby wave speeds as well as the difference between meridional alongshore boundary transports at the two bounding latitudes of the eddy field anomalies arriving at the western boundary excite boundary trapped waves that propagate equatorward and thereby set up t s in the absence of forcing further to the north of the eddy field t n 0 for large eddies approaching a narrow western boundary layer where the zonal scale of the eddies is much greater than the western boundary width the time lag caused by eddy thickness anomalies crossing the narrow western boundary layer can be neglected furthermore for time scales of interest to this study i e longer than the boundary wave adjustment time the time derivative term in 4 is small minobe et al 2017 in this case 4 simplifies to 5 t s t y s y n c y h b d y y s y n β g h f 2 h b d y eq 5 shows that the eddy induced western boundary transport at latitudes immediately equatorward of the incident eddy field depends on eddy thickness anomalies propagated into the western boundary by long rossby waves integrated over the latitude range of the whole eddy field furthermore the amplitude of this eddy induced boundary transport remains constant equatorward of y y s because of the absence of westward propagation of eddy thickness anomalies equatorward of the eddy field the dependence of t s on long rossby wave speeds shown in 5 further indicates that for eddies with the same h b those at lower latitudes are capable of generating greater transport variability at the western boundary note that the alongshore eddy migration owing to the sidewall image effect can potentially delay the leakage of eddy thickness anomalies via boundary wave propagation and thereby introduce additional lag between the time eddy thickness anomalies crossing x x b and the time they crossing y y s on the other hand the presence of a realistic continental shelf often does not allow the eddies to come close enough to the western boundary to permit a significant interaction with their images e g sutyrin et al 2003 frolov et al 2004 for example experiments of sutyrin et al 2003 demonstrated that the centre of an eddy needs to be within a distance of less than its radius to the western wall for the image effect to come into play with eq 5 one can further infer sea level anomalies induced by the incident eddies at the western boundary the alongshore flow in the western boundary layer is approximately in geostrophic balance i e 6 f v g h x zonally integrating 6 across the western boundary layer at y y s while noting that h b 0 at y y s we obtain another equation for t s 7 t s g h f s h w where h w is the upper layer thickness anomaly at x x w and y y s combining 5 and 7 a solution for layer thickness anomaly at the western boundary immediately equatorward of the incident eddy field is obtained 8 h w t f s y s y n β f 2 h b y t d y in the reduced gravity model the sea level and upper ocean thickness anomalies are related via g η g h as such the sea level anomaly at the western boundary η w t depends on eddy sea level anomalies just outside of the western boundary layer η b y t in a similar way i e 9 η w t f s y s y n β f 2 η b y t d y a similar relationship between sea level at the western boundary and sea level at the western end of the ocean interior was also derived by godfrey 1975 and zhai et al 2014 for a meridional western boundary and by minobe et al 2017 for a curved western boundary both with vertical sidewalls for a more general solution of η w t that accounts for contribution of western boundary sea level anomalies further to the north of y n readers are referred to minobe et al 2017 eq 7 shows that due to the f s factor the amplitudes of layer thickness and sea level anomalies at the western boundary decay towards the equator equatorward of the incident eddy field this can be understood as follows constant alongshore transport equatorward of the eddy field see eq 5 requires smaller cross shore pressure difference at lower latitudes as dictated by geostrophy marshall and johnson 2013 note that the presence of a continental shelf and slope can attenuate the influence of the interior sea level on sea level at the coast especially if the continental shelf and slope are wide and bottom friction is small wise et al 2018 however the focus of these previous studies is primarily on boundary sea level anomalies generated by large scale wind and thermohaline forcing in the open ocean and there have been few theoretical studies on meridional transport variability at the western boundary induced by an incident mesoscale eddy field 2 1 a single gaussian eddy we first consider the case of an idealised gaussian shaped eddy immediately outside of a narrow western boundary layer in the northern hemisphere with the centre of the eddy initially located at x b r y 0 where r is the e folding radius of the eddy the eddy is then assumed to propagate westward at the long rossby wave speed of c 0 as a result the eddy centre moves westward according to x x b r c 0 t and the layer thickness anomaly associated with the eddy is given by 10 h x y t a e x x b r c 0 t 2 y y 0 2 r 2 where a is the eddy amplitude we obtain the evolution of layer thickness anomaly at x x b by letting x x b in 10 11 h b y t a e c 0 t r 2 r 2 e y y 0 2 r 2 substituting 11 into 5 we then obtain meridional transport at the western boundary induced by this gaussian eddy i e 12 t s t a π r c 0 e c 0 t r 2 r 2 assuming that the gaussian eddy is anticyclonic with an amplitude of a 200 m a radius of r 100 km and a westward propagating speed of c 0 2 cm s 1 the amplitude of t s increases and then decreases with time with a peak value of about 0 7 sv negative means southward 1 sv 1 0 6 m 3 s 1 at t r c 0 2 2 random eddies when there is a chain of gaussian shaped eddies that are initially lined up meridionally and immediately outside of the western boundary layer in the latitude band between y s and y n the eddy induced western boundary transport at y y s and also equatorward of y s is given by 13 t s t π i 1 n a i r i c i e c i t r i 2 r i 2 where n is the total number of eddies between y s and y n and a i r i and c i are the amplitude radius and propagating speed of the i th eddy respectively eq 13 shows that the eddy induced transport variability at the western boundary equatorward of incident eddies depends on eddy anomalies arriving at the western boundary integrated over the whole eddy field with larger stronger eddies and those at lower latitudes making a greater contribution in situations where eddies of the same polarity arrive simultaneously at the western boundary they are able to generate particularly large meridional transport anomalies note that 13 assumes that eddies propagate westward at long rossby wave speeds and neglects random eddy movement owing to eddy eddy interaction 3 numerical model experiments we now conduct a suite of numerical experiments using the mit general circulation model mitgcm marshall et al 1997 ranging from a simple gaussian eddy interacting with vertical western sidewall to satellite derived ocean eddy field interacting with realistic western boundary geometry to examine eddy induced meridional transport variability 3 1 idealised eddy field the model simulations are first initialised with either a single gaussian eddy or a sea of random eddies the model domain is a rectangular basin that is 16 6 degrees in zonal extent 35 degrees for the case of random eddies 80 degrees in meridional extent 90 degrees for random eddies and 4 km deep with vertical sidewalls and a flat bottom the horizontal grid spacing is chosen to be 1 12 1 12 to permit a vigorous mesoscale eddy field there are 70 geopotential levels whose thicknesses increase with depth ranging from 5 m at the surface to 165 m close to the bottom we employ a linear equation of state that depends only on temperature and a quadratic bottom friction with a drag coefficient of 2 1 0 3 sponges are applied at the northernmost and southernmost 10 degrees of the model domain to damp waves excited by eddy western boundary interaction approaching these boundaries for the single eddy experiments we initialise the model with a surface intensified gaussian shaped mesoscale eddy that is in thermal wind balance θ x y z θ s g x y if z δ θ s g x y exp 5 2 z δ d δ if z δ where z is the vertical coordinate positive upward θ x y z is the potential temperature anomaly associated with the eddy θ s 2 5 c is the maximum eddy temperature anomaly at the surface g x y exp 5 2 x x 0 2 y y 0 2 r 2 is the horizontal gaussian function δ 300 m is the depth of the upper layer r 100 km is the eddy radius and d 1500 m is the eddy depth range the eddy thermal structure used in this study is similar to that in vic et al 2015 but with some minor modifications to ensure a smooth transition at z δ the background vertical stratification is derived from the climatological temperature field of the u s navy s generalised digital environmental model gdem assuming that the horizontal eddy velocities vanish at the bottom we integrate the equation of hydrostatic balance over the water column to deduce the eddy pressure field and from that we obtain the horizontal eddy velocities at each depth via geostrophic balance fig 2a d shows the initial eddy temperature and velocity fields used in the single anticyclonic eddy ae experiment and single cyclonic eddy ce experiment both the ae and ce experiments run for 200 days following zhai et al 2010 and yang et al 2021 we then conduct another two model experiments random and random2 hereafter with each initialised with a sea of random eddies fig 2e in these two experiments the initial eddy sea surface height ssh field is constructed via a superposition of zonal and meridional fourier modes brannigan et al 2015 ni et al 2020 η η 0 k l 1 8 sin 2 π k x ϕ 1 k l sin 2 π l y ϕ 2 k l where η 0 25 cm is the maximum eddy ssh amplitude k and l are the zonal and meridional wavenumbers respectively and ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are random phases for the initial eddy temperature field we make use of the vertical eddy temperature profile obtained from composite analysis of satellite altimetry and argo float data in the northwest atlantic region zhang et al 2013 since this composite vertical temperature profile is normalised by the eddy ssh anomaly we combine it with the initial eddy ssh field to generate the initial 3d eddy temperature finally the initial eddy horizontal velocity is derived from a combination of eddy ssh and temperature anomalies via geostrophic balance see also yang et al 2021 similar to the single eddy experiments due to the wider model domain random and random2 are run for a longer period of time that is 500 days 3 2 satellite derived eddy field as a step towards more realistic simulations we conduct an additional ensemble of twelve experiments in a regional atlantic model atlantic hereafter that are initialised with realistic bathymetry and satellite derived ssh anomalies the regional atlantic model domain spans the area between 260 w and 18 9 e and between 20 s and 60 n there are 50 geopotential levels whose thicknesses increase with depth ranging from 10 m at the surface to 456 m close to the bottom instead of vertical sidewalls and flat bottom realistic topography from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco is used in the atlantic ensemble experiments the other model parameters remain the same as in random the daily gridded global ssh anomaly data produced and distributed by the copernicus marine environment monitoring service are interpolated from its 0 25 0 25 grid onto the 1 12 1 12 atlantic model grid before they are combined in the same way as in random with the normalised vertical eddy temperature profile from the argo composite analysis to generate the initial 3d eddy temperature and horizontal velocity fields we conduct an ensemble of twelve experiments by initialising the regional atlantic model with satellite derived ssh anomalies on twelve different days that is the first days of januaries and julys in year 2002 2005 and the first days of aprils and octobers in year 2002 2003 since the aim of this study is to examine meridional transport variability induced by eddies impinging on the western boundary we exclude in the model initial conditions ssh anomalies that are within 1 5 degrees to the east of the 2000 m isobath fig 3a each ensemble member is integrated forward for 20 days with the truncated ssh field and with model temperature strongly restored towards the initial 3d eddy temperature field in this way the initially truncated ssh field to the east of the 2000 m isobath is allowed to evolve into closed ssh contours fig 3b and the eddy velocity field further adjusts to the eddy temperature and ssh fields to reduce mismatch after this initial 20 day adjustment each ensemble experiment is run for 300 days 4 results 4 1 single eddy experiments the ae and ce in the single eddy experiments propagate westward at speeds close to the phase speeds of long rossby waves with the ae drifting slightly equatorward and the ce drifting slightly poleward fig 4a as often found in satellite observations e g chelton et al 2007 ni et al 2020 upon encountering the vertical sidewall at the western boundary the ae and ce generally migrate equatorward and poleward respectively owing to the image effect of the sidewall e g shi and nof 1994 the amplitudes of both eddies defined as maximum minimum ssh for ae ce decay with time due to frictional energy dissipation in the western boundary eddy graveyard fig 4b zhai et al 2010 yang et al 2021 fig 5 shows the model ssh fields on day 80 in the single eddy experiments shortly after the arrival of the eddy centres at the western boundary the eddy sidewall interaction excites short rossby waves and generates smaller satellite eddies which leads to a complex ssh pattern at the eddy incident latitudes to the south of the eddy incident latitudes a simpler picture emerges the positive negative ssh anomaly associated with the ae ce is seen to leak equatorward along the western boundary eastward along the equator and then poleward along the eastern boundary followed by the slow radiation of rossby waves into the ocean interior in a manner similar to the ocean response to large scale wind and thermohaline forcing e g johnson and marshall 2002 zhai et al 2014 this boundary wave adjustment process is likely the reason behind the coherent moc structure induced by eddies at latitudes south of the gulf stream found in the realistic atlantic model of thomas and zhai 2013 given the meridional coherence of eddy induced moc south of the eddy incident latitudes we plot the time series of the moc streamfunction at the 20 n latitude in the single eddy experiments fig 6 the moc streamfunction is the integral of zonally integrated meridional transport from the surface to a given depth and is defined as v y z t x w x e z 0 v x y z t d z d x where x x e is the model eastern boundary and z is the depth as the ae arrives at the western boundary it generates positive ssh and upper ocean pressure anomalies at the western boundary setting up zonal pressure difference across the western boundary region and also across the model domain which via geostrophy drives southward upper ocean meridional transport and negative moc anomalies these pressure and moc anomalies propagate equatorward along the western boundary and arrive at 20 n on about day 40 fig 6 the negative moc anomaly then intensifies and reaches its maximum strength of 0 5 sv on day 70 before it weakens and switches sign at depths below 1000 m on day 80 over the rest of the simulation period the moc anomaly at 20 n remains negative in the upper 500 800 m while below that it displays overturning cells of alternating signs and short durations these short duration deep cells are most likely associated with the smaller eddies generated during the ae western wall interaction e g sutyrin et al 2003 frolov et al 2004 wei and wang 2009 a process that is not accounted for in our simple theory we therefore focus on comparison between the theory and moc anomalies in the upper ocean of the model black lines in fig 6 for meridional transport at 20 n 5 can be re written after substituting g η b g h b as 14 t 20n t 20n 50n β g h f 2 η b d y in 14 the integral is limited to 50 n since northward of 50 n is the model sponge layer we then estimate moc anomalies at 20 n using 14 with h 600 m inferred from the initial eddy structure and η b ssh anomalies 80 km to the east of the western sidewall from model output time series of moc predicted by our simple theory compares reasonably well with that simulated by the model albeit the modelled moc lags the theoretically predicted moc by about 15 days fig 7a we attribute this time lag to the time it takes for the eddy to cross the narrow western boundary region as well as the sidewall image effect both of which are neglected in the theory see section 2 4 2 random in experiments initialised with a sea of random eddies the eddies propagate westward while at the same time interact with each other and cascade energy towards larger scales upon encountering the western sidewall the eddies again generate pressure anomalies that propagate equatorward along the western boundary in the form of coastal trapped kelvin waves resulting in meridionally coherent moc anomalies to the south of the incident eddy latitude band 30 50 n fig 8 shows the time series of moc streamfunctions at 20 n as well as meridional heat transport across this latitude in random and random2 the meridional heat transport is defined as h y t x w x e h b 0 ρ 0 c p v x y z t θ x y z t d z d x where ρ 0 1027 5 kg m 3 is the reference density c p 4200 j kg 1 c 1 is the specific heat of sea water θ is the potential temperature and h b is the depth of ocean bottom the eddy induced moc anomalies are found to be deep reaching with peak values close to 1 5 sv furthermore these moc anomalies are not short lived but last for tens of days and sometime over one hundred days for example the negative moc anomaly event on days 170 300 in random the eddy induced meridional heat transport varies on the same time scales as the moc anomalies with each positive negative moc anomaly event corresponding to a northward southward heat transport anomaly the large negative moc anomaly event on days 170 300 in random results in an extended period of southward heat transport with the peak magnitude approaching 0 1 pw in random2 a large positive eddy induced moc anomaly event is found to last for over 200 days which yields an average northward heat transport anomaly of 0 05 pw over the 200 day period of this event comparisons between theoretically predicted and model simulated mocs in random and random2 both show reasonable agreement for example the theory is able to capture the decline of the moc in the first 200 days or so as well as its subsequent recovery in random fig 7b 4 3 atlantic in the atlantic experiments where realistic bathymetry and satellite derived eddy ssh fields are used pressure anomalies are generated as eddies impinge on the western continental slope and they propagate equatorward in other forms of coastal trapped waves such as topographic rossby waves e g hughes et al 2019 rather than kelvin waves as in random experiment which has a flat bottom and vertical sidewalls associated with these pressure anomalies are equatorward propagating moc anomalies figs 9 11 there appear to be no systematic differences between experiments initialised in january and july in the four study years or between these experiments and those initialised in april and october in year 2002 and 2003 i e no evidence suggesting a seasonal cycle of eddy induced mocs in the atlantic experiments in all twelve ensemble experiments the moc anomalies originate at the latitudes of the incident eddy band 30 50 n and spread equatorward at speeds of approximately 2 to 3 m s 1 the duration and magnitude of these moc anomaly events are variable and irregular ranging from less than 10 days to over 3 months and from less than 1 sv to close to 5 sv fig 12 shows hovmöller diagrams of moc streamfunctions at 27 n from four atlantic experiments initialised in januaries and julys of year 2002 and 2003 close to the latitude of the rapid array results from experiments initialised in aprils and octobers of year 2002 and 2003 and those initialised in januaries and julys of year 2004 and 2005 are very similar not shown the eddy induced moc anomalies are again deep reaching and significant with some anomalies reaching a magnitude of over 5 sv and lasting for longer than 100 days in comparison the atlantic moc estimated from the rapid array has an average strength of 16 9 sv and standard deviation of 4 4 sv from april 2004 to october 2015 e g cunningham et al 2007 mccarthy et al 2012 these eddy induced moc anomalies lead to considerable meridional heat transport variability across 27 n with values of h frequently exceeding 0 1 pw fig 13 for example there is a significant positive moc anomaly event on days 100 200 in the experiment initialised with satellite ssh field on january 1st 2003 fig 12b which leads to northward heat transport of h 0 1 pw during almost the whole 100 day period of this event red curve in fig 13a recall that meridional heat transport in the north atlantic achieved by the time mean moc driven by large scale wind stress and buoyancy forcing is approximately 1 pw these results therefore highlight the importance of moc variability induced by westward propagating eddies impinging on the western boundary 5 conclusions ocean eddies are observed to propagate ubiquitously westward apart from in the antarctic circumpolar current and separated western boundary currents while the eddy energy is dissipated in the western boundary graveyard zhai et al 2010 yang et al 2021 what happens to volume anomalies carried westward by the eddies remains unclear in this study we have investigated meridional transport variability induced by westward propagating eddies impinging on the western boundary a simple quantitative theory has been developed in the framework of the reduced gravity model the theory predicts that the eddy induced meridional transport at latitudes equatorward of an incident eddy field depends on eddy thickness anomalies propagated into the western boundary by long rossy waves integrated over the latitude range of the whole eddy field therefore when eddies of the same polarity simultaneously arrive at the western boundary they are able to generate particularly large meridional transport anomalies there are however limitations associated with our simple reduced gravity model approach for example there is no mean flow advection and the model assumes vertical sidewalls in deriving the theory we have also assumed that the western boundary layer is narrow such that the time delay caused by eddy thickness anomalies crossing the narrow western boundary layer can be neglected one way to account for this time delay is to include a time lag in 5 i e 15 t s t y s y n β g h f 2 h b y t x b x w c y d y where x b x w c y is the time it takes for long rossby waves to cross the western boundary region for the single eddy experiments c 4 5 cm s 1 and x b x w 80 km which gives a time lag of 20 days comparable to the lag between the model simulated and theoretically predicted moc anomalies shown in fig 7a we then carry out a suite of numerical experiments using the mitgcm to examine eddy induced meridional transport variability ranging from a simple gaussian eddy interacting with vertical western sidewall to satellite derived ocean eddy field interacting with realistic western boundary geometry results from these experiments show that eddies impinging on the western boundary excite boundary trapped waves that propagate equatorward along the western boundary and this leads to meridionally coherent moc anomalies at latitudes equatorward of the incident eddy field there are reasonable agreements between moc anomalies predicted by the theory and those simulated by the model the eddy induced moc anomalies are found to be deep reaching and significant with some anomalies reaching a magnitude of over 5 sv and lasting longer than 100 days particularly in the atlantic experiments where realistic bathymetry and satellite derived eddy ssh fields are used our results suggest that part of the moc variability seen in the rapid array observations is eddy driven and as such is stochastic in nature furthermore these eddy induced moc anomalies lead to considerable meridional heat transport variability during large moc anomaly events the associated meridional heat transport anomalies often exceed 0 1 pw during the whole period of the events sometimes over 100 days such large and sustained meridional heat transport anomalies are expected to cause changes in ocean heat content and sea surface temperature with implications for seasonal and interannual climate variability and prediction e g goddard et al 2001 bryden et al 2014

to over 5 sv and from less than 10 days to over 100 days importantly these eddy induced moc anomalies lead to considerable meridional heat transport variability across the latitudes with implications for seasonal and interannual climate variability and prediction keywords ocean eddy meridional overturning circulation western boundary ocean modelling 1 introduction the meridional overturning circulation moc of the global ocean dominates the exchange of water as well as climatically important properties it carries between ocean basins and across latitudes within the basins for example in the subtropical north atlantic the moc transports approximately 1 pw 1 pw 1 0 15 w of heat northward with important consequences for european climate and arctic sea ice variability e g vellinga and wood 2002 mahajan et al 2011 as revealed by recent rapid array observations e g cunningham et al 2007 mccarthy et al 2012 the strength of the moc varies on all time scales on decadal and longer time scales the moc variability is found to be closely related to low frequency changes of basin wide wind stress field and high latitude surface buoyancy flux e g eden and willebrand 2001 cessi and louazel 2001 johnson and marshall 2002 zhai et al 2014 on the shorter seasonal and interannual time scales the moc variability is often attributed to higher frequency wind driven ekman transport fluctuations e g jayne and marotzke 2001 biastoch et al 2008 this understanding of moc variability which is based primarily on linear theory and coarse resolution ocean model simulations is linear and deterministic in nature that is any changes of the moc can be traced back to changes in external forcing on the other hand the ocean is populated with nonlinear mesoscale eddies which dominate the ocean s kinetic energy spectra e g ferrari and wunsch 2009 chelton et al 2011 ni et al 2020 apart from in the antarctic circumpolar current and separated western boundary currents these nonlinear eddies are observed to propagate ubiquitously westward chelton et al 2011 ni et al 2020 upon arriving at the western boundary the majority of the energy associated with the eddies is dissipated within the narrow western boundary region due to processes such as loss of balance zhai et al 2010 yang et al 2021 while the eddy energy is shown to be dissipated at the western boundary the fate of volume anomalies carried westward by the eddies is much less clear it is possible that pressure anomalies are built up by eddies impinging on the western boundary which subsequently drive anomalous alongshore boundary current transport there have been extensive studies of the dynamics of a large isolated eddy interacting with a side boundary e g smith and o brien 1983 smith 1986 shi and nof 1994 sutyrin et al 2003 frolov et al 2004 wei and wang 2009 for example shi and nof 1994 showed that when an eddy encounters a sidewall it migrates in the alongshore direction under the influence of the beta force image effect and rocket effect and they found that the image effect usually dominates with the addition of a continental shelf and slope the eddy boundary interaction becomes more complicated it results in the spinup of secondary cyclones anticyclones and the excitation of topography waves e g sutyrin et al 2003 frolov et al 2004 wei and wang 2009 however the focus of these studies has been primarily on the evolution and trajectory of an incident eddy upon its arrival at a side boundary to our knowledge there have been few studies investigating the eddy induced meridional transport and moc variability thomas and zhai 2013 isolated the contribution of eddies to moc variability in an eddy permitting model of the north atlantic by forcing it with climatological and steady surface forcing they found that the eddy induced moc variability is ubiquitous and significant at all latitudes with a magnitude comparable to the seasonally forced moc particularly in the subtropics furthermore the eddy induced moc variability is found to manifest not only at high frequencies e g days to weeks but also at seasonal and longer time scales marshall et al 2013 proposed that the stokes drift or bolus transport associated with westward propagating rossby waves and eddies is returned eastward through eulerian mean currents which they termed rossby rip currents more recently domingues et al 2019 investigated the impact of eddy like westward propagating signals on the florida current variability using controlled realistic numerical experiments and they found both a direct response involving eddy wall interaction and an indirect response involving eddy perturbation of gulf stream meandering although the realistic modelling studies of thomas and zhai 2013 and domingues et al 2019 have highlighted the potential significance of eddy induced moc variability a theoretical understanding and analysis is still lacking in this study we investigate meridional transport variability induced by westward propagating eddies impinging on the western boundary using a combination of linear theory and idealised model simulations the paper is organised as follows in section 2 a simple theory is developed in the framework of a reduced gravity model which relates eddy induced meridional transport to eddy thickness anomalies propagated into the western boundary by long rossby waves in section 3 results from a suite of numerical model experiments are presented ranging from a simple gaussian eddy interacting with vertical western sidewall to satellite derived ocean eddy field interacting with realistic western boundary geometry finally the key findings from this study are summarised and discussed in section 4 2 eddy induced western boundary transport following the earlier theoretical work of godfrey 1975 and minobe et al 2017 here we consider the volume budget of a narrow western boundary layer in the northern hemisphere enclosed by the dotted lines in fig 1 and derive eddy induced meridional transport in the framework of a reduced gravity model we start with the linear continuity equation 1 h t h u x v y 0 where u and v are the zonal and meridional velocities and h is the upper layer thickness anomaly from its initial value h integrating 1 from the western boundary at x x w to just outside the western boundary layer at x x b while noting the no normal flow boundary condition at the western boundary i e u 0 at x x w we get 2 x w x b h t d x u b h t y 0 where u b y t is the zonal velocity anomaly at x x b associated with the incident eddy field and t y t x w x b v h d x is the meridional alongshore boundary current transport outside of the western boundary layer the geostrophic balance applies i e 3 f u b g h b y where f y is the coriolis parameter g is the reduced gravity and h b y t is the upper layer thickness anomaly at x x b now substituting 3 into 2 and integrating between latitudes at the northern y n and southern y s limits of the incident eddy field fig 1 we obtain the volume budget for the narrow western boundary layer 4 a h t d a y s y n c y h b d y t n t s 0 here a is the horizontal area of the western boundary layer t n and t s are meridional western boundary current transports at y n and y s respectively and c y β g h f 2 is the long rossby wave speed where β d f d y is the meridional gradient of the coriolis parameter in deriving 4 integration by parts is used and h b is assumed to vanish at y y n and y y s physically 4 states that the volume change in the western boundary layer is caused by eddy thickness anomalies propagating into the western boundary layer from the ocean interior at long rossby wave speeds as well as the difference between meridional alongshore boundary transports at the two bounding latitudes of the eddy field anomalies arriving at the western boundary excite boundary trapped waves that propagate equatorward and thereby set up t s in the absence of forcing further to the north of the eddy field t n 0 for large eddies approaching a narrow western boundary layer where the zonal scale of the eddies is much greater than the western boundary width the time lag caused by eddy thickness anomalies crossing the narrow western boundary layer can be neglected furthermore for time scales of interest to this study i e longer than the boundary wave adjustment time the time derivative term in 4 is small minobe et al 2017 in this case 4 simplifies to 5 t s t y s y n c y h b d y y s y n β g h f 2 h b d y eq 5 shows that the eddy induced western boundary transport at latitudes immediately equatorward of the incident eddy field depends on eddy thickness anomalies propagated into the western boundary by long rossby waves integrated over the latitude range of the whole eddy field furthermore the amplitude of this eddy induced boundary transport remains constant equatorward of y y s because of the absence of westward propagation of eddy thickness anomalies equatorward of the eddy field the dependence of t s on long rossby wave speeds shown in 5 further indicates that for eddies with the same h b those at lower latitudes are capable of generating greater transport variability at the western boundary note that the alongshore eddy migration owing to the sidewall image effect can potentially delay the leakage of eddy thickness anomalies via boundary wave propagation and thereby introduce additional lag between the time eddy thickness anomalies crossing x x b and the time they crossing y y s on the other hand the presence of a realistic continental shelf often does not allow the eddies to come close enough to the western boundary to permit a significant interaction with their images e g sutyrin et al 2003 frolov et al 2004 for example experiments of sutyrin et al 2003 demonstrated that the centre of an eddy needs to be within a distance of less than its radius to the western wall for the image effect to come into play with eq 5 one can further infer sea level anomalies induced by the incident eddies at the western boundary the alongshore flow in the western boundary layer is approximately in geostrophic balance i e 6 f v g h x zonally integrating 6 across the western boundary layer at y y s while noting that h b 0 at y y s we obtain another equation for t s 7 t s g h f s h w where h w is the upper layer thickness anomaly at x x w and y y s combining 5 and 7 a solution for layer thickness anomaly at the western boundary immediately equatorward of the incident eddy field is obtained 8 h w t f s y s y n β f 2 h b y t d y in the reduced gravity model the sea level and upper ocean thickness anomalies are related via g η g h as such the sea level anomaly at the western boundary η w t depends on eddy sea level anomalies just outside of the western boundary layer η b y t in a similar way i e 9 η w t f s y s y n β f 2 η b y t d y a similar relationship between sea level at the western boundary and sea level at the western end of the ocean interior was also derived by godfrey 1975 and zhai et al 2014 for a meridional western boundary and by minobe et al 2017 for a curved western boundary both with vertical sidewalls for a more general solution of η w t that accounts for contribution of western boundary sea level anomalies further to the north of y n readers are referred to minobe et al 2017 eq 7 shows that due to the f s factor the amplitudes of layer thickness and sea level anomalies at the western boundary decay towards the equator equatorward of the incident eddy field this can be understood as follows constant alongshore transport equatorward of the eddy field see eq 5 requires smaller cross shore pressure difference at lower latitudes as dictated by geostrophy marshall and johnson 2013 note that the presence of a continental shelf and slope can attenuate the influence of the interior sea level on sea level at the coast especially if the continental shelf and slope are wide and bottom friction is small wise et al 2018 however the focus of these previous studies is primarily on boundary sea level anomalies generated by large scale wind and thermohaline forcing in the open ocean and there have been few theoretical studies on meridional transport variability at the western boundary induced by an incident mesoscale eddy field 2 1 a single gaussian eddy we first consider the case of an idealised gaussian shaped eddy immediately outside of a narrow western boundary layer in the northern hemisphere with the centre of the eddy initially located at x b r y 0 where r is the e folding radius of the eddy the eddy is then assumed to propagate westward at the long rossby wave speed of c 0 as a result the eddy centre moves westward according to x x b r c 0 t and the layer thickness anomaly associated with the eddy is given by 10 h x y t a e x x b r c 0 t 2 y y 0 2 r 2 where a is the eddy amplitude we obtain the evolution of layer thickness anomaly at x x b by letting x x b in 10 11 h b y t a e c 0 t r 2 r 2 e y y 0 2 r 2 substituting 11 into 5 we then obtain meridional transport at the western boundary induced by this gaussian eddy i e 12 t s t a π r c 0 e c 0 t r 2 r 2 assuming that the gaussian eddy is anticyclonic with an amplitude of a 200 m a radius of r 100 km and a westward propagating speed of c 0 2 cm s 1 the amplitude of t s increases and then decreases with time with a peak value of about 0 7 sv negative means southward 1 sv 1 0 6 m 3 s 1 at t r c 0 2 2 random eddies when there is a chain of gaussian shaped eddies that are initially lined up meridionally and immediately outside of the western boundary layer in the latitude band between y s and y n the eddy induced western boundary transport at y y s and also equatorward of y s is given by 13 t s t π i 1 n a i r i c i e c i t r i 2 r i 2 where n is the total number of eddies between y s and y n and a i r i and c i are the amplitude radius and propagating speed of the i th eddy respectively eq 13 shows that the eddy induced transport variability at the western boundary equatorward of incident eddies depends on eddy anomalies arriving at the western boundary integrated over the whole eddy field with larger stronger eddies and those at lower latitudes making a greater contribution in situations where eddies of the same polarity arrive simultaneously at the western boundary they are able to generate particularly large meridional transport anomalies note that 13 assumes that eddies propagate westward at long rossby wave speeds and neglects random eddy movement owing to eddy eddy interaction 3 numerical model experiments we now conduct a suite of numerical experiments using the mit general circulation model mitgcm marshall et al 1997 ranging from a simple gaussian eddy interacting with vertical western sidewall to satellite derived ocean eddy field interacting with realistic western boundary geometry to examine eddy induced meridional transport variability 3 1 idealised eddy field the model simulations are first initialised with either a single gaussian eddy or a sea of random eddies the model domain is a rectangular basin that is 16 6 degrees in zonal extent 35 degrees for the case of random eddies 80 degrees in meridional extent 90 degrees for random eddies and 4 km deep with vertical sidewalls and a flat bottom the horizontal grid spacing is chosen to be 1 12 1 12 to permit a vigorous mesoscale eddy field there are 70 geopotential levels whose thicknesses increase with depth ranging from 5 m at the surface to 165 m close to the bottom we employ a linear equation of state that depends only on temperature and a quadratic bottom friction with a drag coefficient of 2 1 0 3 sponges are applied at the northernmost and southernmost 10 degrees of the model domain to damp waves excited by eddy western boundary interaction approaching these boundaries for the single eddy experiments we initialise the model with a surface intensified gaussian shaped mesoscale eddy that is in thermal wind balance θ x y z θ s g x y if z δ θ s g x y exp 5 2 z δ d δ if z δ where z is the vertical coordinate positive upward θ x y z is the potential temperature anomaly associated with the eddy θ s 2 5 c is the maximum eddy temperature anomaly at the surface g x y exp 5 2 x x 0 2 y y 0 2 r 2 is the horizontal gaussian function δ 300 m is the depth of the upper layer r 100 km is the eddy radius and d 1500 m is the eddy depth range the eddy thermal structure used in this study is similar to that in vic et al 2015 but with some minor modifications to ensure a smooth transition at z δ the background vertical stratification is derived from the climatological temperature field of the u s navy s generalised digital environmental model gdem assuming that the horizontal eddy velocities vanish at the bottom we integrate the equation of hydrostatic balance over the water column to deduce the eddy pressure field and from that we obtain the horizontal eddy velocities at each depth via geostrophic balance fig 2a d shows the initial eddy temperature and velocity fields used in the single anticyclonic eddy ae experiment and single cyclonic eddy ce experiment both the ae and ce experiments run for 200 days following zhai et al 2010 and yang et al 2021 we then conduct another two model experiments random and random2 hereafter with each initialised with a sea of random eddies fig 2e in these two experiments the initial eddy sea surface height ssh field is constructed via a superposition of zonal and meridional fourier modes brannigan et al 2015 ni et al 2020 η η 0 k l 1 8 sin 2 π k x ϕ 1 k l sin 2 π l y ϕ 2 k l where η 0 25 cm is the maximum eddy ssh amplitude k and l are the zonal and meridional wavenumbers respectively and ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are random phases for the initial eddy temperature field we make use of the vertical eddy temperature profile obtained from composite analysis of satellite altimetry and argo float data in the northwest atlantic region zhang et al 2013 since this composite vertical temperature profile is normalised by the eddy ssh anomaly we combine it with the initial eddy ssh field to generate the initial 3d eddy temperature finally the initial eddy horizontal velocity is derived from a combination of eddy ssh and temperature anomalies via geostrophic balance see also yang et al 2021 similar to the single eddy experiments due to the wider model domain random and random2 are run for a longer period of time that is 500 days 3 2 satellite derived eddy field as a step towards more realistic simulations we conduct an additional ensemble of twelve experiments in a regional atlantic model atlantic hereafter that are initialised with realistic bathymetry and satellite derived ssh anomalies the regional atlantic model domain spans the area between 260 w and 18 9 e and between 20 s and 60 n there are 50 geopotential levels whose thicknesses increase with depth ranging from 10 m at the surface to 456 m close to the bottom instead of vertical sidewalls and flat bottom realistic topography from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco is used in the atlantic ensemble experiments the other model parameters remain the same as in random the daily gridded global ssh anomaly data produced and distributed by the copernicus marine environment monitoring service are interpolated from its 0 25 0 25 grid onto the 1 12 1 12 atlantic model grid before they are combined in the same way as in random with the normalised vertical eddy temperature profile from the argo composite analysis to generate the initial 3d eddy temperature and horizontal velocity fields we conduct an ensemble of twelve experiments by initialising the regional atlantic model with satellite derived ssh anomalies on twelve different days that is the first days of januaries and julys in year 2002 2005 and the first days of aprils and octobers in year 2002 2003 since the aim of this study is to examine meridional transport variability induced by eddies impinging on the western boundary we exclude in the model initial conditions ssh anomalies that are within 1 5 degrees to the east of the 2000 m isobath fig 3a each ensemble member is integrated forward for 20 days with the truncated ssh field and with model temperature strongly restored towards the initial 3d eddy temperature field in this way the initially truncated ssh field to the east of the 2000 m isobath is allowed to evolve into closed ssh contours fig 3b and the eddy velocity field further adjusts to the eddy temperature and ssh fields to reduce mismatch after this initial 20 day adjustment each ensemble experiment is run for 300 days 4 results 4 1 single eddy experiments the ae and ce in the single eddy experiments propagate westward at speeds close to the phase speeds of long rossby waves with the ae drifting slightly equatorward and the ce drifting slightly poleward fig 4a as often found in satellite observations e g chelton et al 2007 ni et al 2020 upon encountering the vertical sidewall at the western boundary the ae and ce generally migrate equatorward and poleward respectively owing to the image effect of the sidewall e g shi and nof 1994 the amplitudes of both eddies defined as maximum minimum ssh for ae ce decay with time due to frictional energy dissipation in the western boundary eddy graveyard fig 4b zhai et al 2010 yang et al 2021 fig 5 shows the model ssh fields on day 80 in the single eddy experiments shortly after the arrival of the eddy centres at the western boundary the eddy sidewall interaction excites short rossby waves and generates smaller satellite eddies which leads to a complex ssh pattern at the eddy incident latitudes to the south of the eddy incident latitudes a simpler picture emerges the positive negative ssh anomaly associated with the ae ce is seen to leak equatorward along the western boundary eastward along the equator and then poleward along the eastern boundary followed by the slow radiation of rossby waves into the ocean interior in a manner similar to the ocean response to large scale wind and thermohaline forcing e g johnson and marshall 2002 zhai et al 2014 this boundary wave adjustment process is likely the reason behind the coherent moc structure induced by eddies at latitudes south of the gulf stream found in the realistic atlantic model of thomas and zhai 2013 given the meridional coherence of eddy induced moc south of the eddy incident latitudes we plot the time series of the moc streamfunction at the 20 n latitude in the single eddy experiments fig 6 the moc streamfunction is the integral of zonally integrated meridional transport from the surface to a given depth and is defined as v y z t x w x e z 0 v x y z t d z d x where x x e is the model eastern boundary and z is the depth as the ae arrives at the western boundary it generates positive ssh and upper ocean pressure anomalies at the western boundary setting up zonal pressure difference across the western boundary region and also across the model domain which via geostrophy drives southward upper ocean meridional transport and negative moc anomalies these pressure and moc anomalies propagate equatorward along the western boundary and arrive at 20 n on about day 40 fig 6 the negative moc anomaly then intensifies and reaches its maximum strength of 0 5 sv on day 70 before it weakens and switches sign at depths below 1000 m on day 80 over the rest of the simulation period the moc anomaly at 20 n remains negative in the upper 500 800 m while below that it displays overturning cells of alternating signs and short durations these short duration deep cells are most likely associated with the smaller eddies generated during the ae western wall interaction e g sutyrin et al 2003 frolov et al 2004 wei and wang 2009 a process that is not accounted for in our simple theory we therefore focus on comparison between the theory and moc anomalies in the upper ocean of the model black lines in fig 6 for meridional transport at 20 n 5 can be re written after substituting g η b g h b as 14 t 20n t 20n 50n β g h f 2 η b d y in 14 the integral is limited to 50 n since northward of 50 n is the model sponge layer we then estimate moc anomalies at 20 n using 14 with h 600 m inferred from the initial eddy structure and η b ssh anomalies 80 km to the east of the western sidewall from model output time series of moc predicted by our simple theory compares reasonably well with that simulated by the model albeit the modelled moc lags the theoretically predicted moc by about 15 days fig 7a we attribute this time lag to the time it takes for the eddy to cross the narrow western boundary region as well as the sidewall image effect both of which are neglected in the theory see section 2 4 2 random in experiments initialised with a sea of random eddies the eddies propagate westward while at the same time interact with each other and cascade energy towards larger scales upon encountering the western sidewall the eddies again generate pressure anomalies that propagate equatorward along the western boundary in the form of coastal trapped kelvin waves resulting in meridionally coherent moc anomalies to the south of the incident eddy latitude band 30 50 n fig 8 shows the time series of moc streamfunctions at 20 n as well as meridional heat transport across this latitude in random and random2 the meridional heat transport is defined as h y t x w x e h b 0 ρ 0 c p v x y z t θ x y z t d z d x where ρ 0 1027 5 kg m 3 is the reference density c p 4200 j kg 1 c 1 is the specific heat of sea water θ is the potential temperature and h b is the depth of ocean bottom the eddy induced moc anomalies are found to be deep reaching with peak values close to 1 5 sv furthermore these moc anomalies are not short lived but last for tens of days and sometime over one hundred days for example the negative moc anomaly event on days 170 300 in random the eddy induced meridional heat transport varies on the same time scales as the moc anomalies with each positive negative moc anomaly event corresponding to a northward southward heat transport anomaly the large negative moc anomaly event on days 170 300 in random results in an extended period of southward heat transport with the peak magnitude approaching 0 1 pw in random2 a large positive eddy induced moc anomaly event is found to last for over 200 days which yields an average northward heat transport anomaly of 0 05 pw over the 200 day period of this event comparisons between theoretically predicted and model simulated mocs in random and random2 both show reasonable agreement for example the theory is able to capture the decline of the moc in the first 200 days or so as well as its subsequent recovery in random fig 7b 4 3 atlantic in the atlantic experiments where realistic bathymetry and satellite derived eddy ssh fields are used pressure anomalies are generated as eddies impinge on the western continental slope and they propagate equatorward in other forms of coastal trapped waves such as topographic rossby waves e g hughes et al 2019 rather than kelvin waves as in random experiment which has a flat bottom and vertical sidewalls associated with these pressure anomalies are equatorward propagating moc anomalies figs 9 11 there appear to be no systematic differences between experiments initialised in january and july in the four study years or between these experiments and those initialised in april and october in year 2002 and 2003 i e no evidence suggesting a seasonal cycle of eddy induced mocs in the atlantic experiments in all twelve ensemble experiments the moc anomalies originate at the latitudes of the incident eddy band 30 50 n and spread equatorward at speeds of approximately 2 to 3 m s 1 the duration and magnitude of these moc anomaly events are variable and irregular ranging from less than 10 days to over 3 months and from less than 1 sv to close to 5 sv fig 12 shows hovmöller diagrams of moc streamfunctions at 27 n from four atlantic experiments initialised in januaries and julys of year 2002 and 2003 close to the latitude of the rapid array results from experiments initialised in aprils and octobers of year 2002 and 2003 and those initialised in januaries and julys of year 2004 and 2005 are very similar not shown the eddy induced moc anomalies are again deep reaching and significant with some anomalies reaching a magnitude of over 5 sv and lasting for longer than 100 days in comparison the atlantic moc estimated from the rapid array has an average strength of 16 9 sv and standard deviation of 4 4 sv from april 2004 to october 2015 e g cunningham et al 2007 mccarthy et al 2012 these eddy induced moc anomalies lead to considerable meridional heat transport variability across 27 n with values of h frequently exceeding 0 1 pw fig 13 for example there is a significant positive moc anomaly event on days 100 200 in the experiment initialised with satellite ssh field on january 1st 2003 fig 12b which leads to northward heat transport of h 0 1 pw during almost the whole 100 day period of this event red curve in fig 13a recall that meridional heat transport in the north atlantic achieved by the time mean moc driven by large scale wind stress and buoyancy forcing is approximately 1 pw these results therefore highlight the importance of moc variability induced by westward propagating eddies impinging on the western boundary 5 conclusions ocean eddies are observed to propagate ubiquitously westward apart from in the antarctic circumpolar current and separated western boundary currents while the eddy energy is dissipated in the western boundary graveyard zhai et al 2010 yang et al 2021 what happens to volume anomalies carried westward by the eddies remains unclear in this study we have investigated meridional transport variability induced by westward propagating eddies impinging on the western boundary a simple quantitative theory has been developed in the framework of the reduced gravity model the theory predicts that the eddy induced meridional transport at latitudes equatorward of an incident eddy field depends on eddy thickness anomalies propagated into the western boundary by long rossy waves integrated over the latitude range of the whole eddy field therefore when eddies of the same polarity simultaneously arrive at the western boundary they are able to generate particularly large meridional transport anomalies there are however limitations associated with our simple reduced gravity model approach for example there is no mean flow advection and the model assumes vertical sidewalls in deriving the theory we have also assumed that the western boundary layer is narrow such that the time delay caused by eddy thickness anomalies crossing the narrow western boundary layer can be neglected one way to account for this time delay is to include a time lag in 5 i e 15 t s t y s y n β g h f 2 h b y t x b x w c y d y where x b x w c y is the time it takes for long rossby waves to cross the western boundary region for the single eddy experiments c 4 5 cm s 1 and x b x w 80 km which gives a time lag of 20 days comparable to the lag between the model simulated and theoretically predicted moc anomalies shown in fig 7a we then carry out a suite of numerical experiments using the mitgcm to examine eddy induced meridional transport variability ranging from a simple gaussian eddy interacting with vertical western sidewall to satellite derived ocean eddy field interacting with realistic western boundary geometry results from these experiments show that eddies impinging on the western boundary excite boundary trapped waves that propagate equatorward along the western boundary and this leads to meridionally coherent moc anomalies at latitudes equatorward of the incident eddy field there are reasonable agreements between moc anomalies predicted by the theory and those simulated by the model the eddy induced moc anomalies are found to be deep reaching and significant with some anomalies reaching a magnitude of over 5 sv and lasting longer than 100 days particularly in the atlantic experiments where realistic bathymetry and satellite derived eddy ssh fields are used our results suggest that part of the moc variability seen in the rapid array observations is eddy driven and as such is stochastic in nature furthermore these eddy induced moc anomalies lead to considerable meridional heat transport variability during large moc anomaly events the associated meridional heat transport anomalies often exceed 0 1 pw during the whole period of the events sometimes over 100 days such large and sustained meridional heat transport anomalies are expected to cause changes in ocean heat content and sea surface temperature with implications for seasonal and interannual climate variability and prediction e g goddard et al 2001 bryden et al 2014

23858,estimating ocean processes in regions with sparse observations and where dynamics are dominated by strong barotropic and baroclinic tides poses a significant modelling challenge in this study a four dimensional variational 4d var data assimilation method incorporating remotely sensed sea surface temperature sst data observations only was used to improve estimates of the internal tide dynamics in the ocean between australia and indonesia in this region local internal tide generation propagation and interference of the internal tides is highly variable and dependent on the 3d density field and mesoscale dynamics the results of this study show that assimilation of remotely sensed sst data not only reduced the surface temperature root mean squared error rmse from 0 8 c to 0 3 c and removed a 0 4 c cold bias compared to a non assimilative model but also improved estimates of through water column variables with the latter evaluated against argo profiling floats and two independent mooring sites overall the depth averaged temperature rmse was reduced by as much as 38 and ocean currents by 20 at the two mooring sites the improvements were most significant in the top 100 m where the internal tide signature was significantly corrected despite no depth varying variables being assimilated the study also showed that assimilating 2 km resolution sst observations resulted in more realistic sst wavenumber power spectral density estimates than those without assimilating data in particular the scheme reduced the energy at mesoscale length scales and improved the spectral slope towards the smaller submesoscale dynamics it is concluded that 4d var assimilation using only sst improves estimates of upper 100 m ocean dynamics in tropical regions where there is sensitivity to the air sea fluxes keywords 4d var data assimilation internal tides roms model australian north west shelf 1 introduction variational state estimation methods are well established and

and for higher resolution coastal applications on the order of days janeković et al 2013 2020 iermano et al 2015 souza et al 2015 kerry et al 2016 sperrevik et al 2017 levin et al 2020 2021 most data assimilation applications typically target the mesoscale flow e g moore et al 2011a powell et al 2008 broquet et al 2011 matthews et al 2012 and to do that efficiently they filter the finer scale dynamics from the observations before assimilation in contrast a key problem with data assimilation at finer scales is that there is typically insufficient data to constrain the fine scale processes o 1 km such as submesoscale eddies and internal gravity waves sandery and sakov 2017 demonstrated that the performance of a data assimilating ocean model degrades with smaller horizontal model grid spacing souopgui et al 2020 showed that the appropriate choice of length scale in the background error covariance matrix described is important for assimilating data at scales finer than the mesoscale using a 3d var scheme in this study we aim to demonstrate that fine scale processes in particular internal waves can be better represented with appropriate choices of input data assimilation scheme and model data error covariance matrices in a traditional 4d var scheme the 4d var data assimilation da technique aims to minimize residuals between observations and model background state over the assimilation time window by computing optimal perturbations of the control parameters δx the minimization is usually based on the variational iterative approach courtier et al 1994 courtier 1997 using the pre conditioned conjugate gradient method it reduces the cost function j considering i adjustments for the initial conditions boundary conditions and surface forcing all weighted with the normalized model background error covariance matrix d and ii all residuals between observational data and the model estimates at observation locations gδx d weighted with the observational error covariance matrix r and within the assimilation window 1 j j m j o 1 2 δ x t d 1 δx 1 2 gδx d t r 1 gδx d generally two approaches are used to minimize j a the primal approach which minimizes j in the space spanned by the model control vector and b the dual approach which minimizes j in the space defined by the number of used observations usually using the primal approach is less attractive as it has a much larger size and memory footprint than the dual approach the observational error covariance matrix r can be populated relatively simply using the observational data and their associated processing and instrument errors along with the computed variance when mapping multiple observations onto a single model grid cell and model time step representativeness errors within the approach it is usually assumed that instrument errors and errors of representativeness are mutually uncorrelated in space and time resulting in a diagonal r this assumption is not completely valid for example in the case of using time frequent and spatially gridded satellite products for more details refer to neveu et al 2016 the definition of the 4d var background error covariance matrix d requires careful attention especially if tidal dynamics are included e g matthews et al 2012 janeković et al 2013 powell et al 2012 if d is loosely constrained the model can significantly deviate from the background state i e towards an unphysical state while if it is too tightly constrained it will be heavily penalized for any deviation from the background state reducing assimilation capability and leaving large residuals this study explores the benefits of using correlation modelling to determine d with the generalized diffusion equation and isotropic decorrelation scales weaver and courtier 2001 in an environment with strong tidal forcing the australian northwest shelf the principal objective of this study was to enable better estimation of currents on the australian north west shelf nws the nws and timor sea is a 250 km wide marginal sea that is bounded by a region of the eastern indian ocean known as the indo australian basin fig 1 shelf oceanography is dominated by strong tidal forcing holloway 1983 large amplitude internal waves holloway 2001 rayson et al 2011 gong et al 2019 and seasonally variable ekman and geostrophic currents godfrey and mansbridge 2000 wijeratne et al 2018 internal waves on the shelf are directly forced at the shelf break by barotropic baroclinic topographic conversion e g holloway 2001 rayson et al 2011 or result from remotely generated internal tides propagating from distant topography like the exmouth plateau gong et al 2019 or indonesian islands katsumata and wijffels 2006 zaron 2019 gong et al 2021 the long range propagation of these remotely generated waves and hence their arrival time and location are all influenced by the ocean state e g the horizontal and vertical density stratification and mean circulation e g rayson et al 2011 the mean circulation in the indo australian basin is dominated by the westward flowing indonesian throughflow which from around june to december breaks down into mesoscale eddies when the monsoonal winds shift direction meyers et al 1995 feng and wijffels 2002 wijeratne et al 2018 these variations in larger scale circulation influence the ocean interior stratification and are sensitive to air sea fluxes and it is therefore necessary to accurately reproduce the large scale dynamics to correctly predict internal wave driven flow on the shelf in order to improve the prediction of internal wave driven currents in what is a data sparse region of the ocean by global standards it is necessary to create a best estimate of the ocean state which has been achieved in this study using only remotely sensed sst observations in a dynamically consistent way this best state estimate can then serve as the starting point for other high resolution modelling activities such as nested models to explore non linear internal wave dynamics this paper first describes the sst data used in the da system as well as the in situ observations of the ocean interior that were used for independent validation the roms model setup is then described with particular attention paid to describing how the background error covariance matrix d was constructed an analysis of the model performance relative to independent in situ observations is then provided before discussing the impacts of assimilated sst on the simulated range of dynamic scales in the ocean and the internal tide phasing 2 data sst derived from the three infrared channels of the japan meteorological agency himawari 8 geostationary satellite kurihara et al 2016 was assimilated in this study in this l3 product the clouds are masked using a probabilistic method see kurihara et al 2016 for full details and the reported rms of this sst dataset against in situ moored and drifting buoy data is 0 58 c after downloading this sst data from the jaxa server https www eorc jaxa jp ptree index html additional processing steps were performed to remove the day time solar heating effects that are not well represented within the model s s vertical coordinate system with variable surface layer thickness the night time averaged sst was calculated using only the hourly data between 2000 and 0600 local time 8 h ahead of utc where it was larger than the observation instrument error the standard deviation of the eight night time scenes was used as the observational error term while only data where the quality control flag was best quality level 5 was used the time period adopted for the 4d var simulation was selected to overlap with the kimberley internal soliton sediment and mixing experiment kissme conducted on the kimberley shelf browse basin region during april and may 2017 see rayson et al 2021 zulberti et al 2020 while this is the primary region of interest the model domain encompassed the entire australian north west shelf timor and arafura seas as well as the indo australian basin in addition to the kissme data all known publicly available data was sourced for the wider region and time period to provide independent validation of the 4d var da results through water column water temperature and velocity data from two moorings is available for the time period being studied these two moorings were installed in dynamically different locations along the mid to outer shelf region of the northern australian continental margin fig 1 the kissme sp250 mooring was located in the browse basin region in 250 m deep water while the integrated marine observing system imos timor sea mooring itftis was located on the edge of the timor trench in 460 m deep water fig 1 the sp250 mooring measured velocity with an upward looking rdi 75 khz adcp sampling at 60 s with 4 m vertical bins the lower bin was 12 m above the seabed and only data below 30 m of the free surface was retained seabird electronics sbe 56 thermistors were also installed at roughly 10 m intervals along the mooring and sampled at 2 hz in contrast the itftis mooring provided water temperature measurements at 60 s intervals from instruments spaced at roughly 20 m vertical intervals with data below 25 m of the free surface only in addition to the two moorings data from the argo ctd profiling network was used to broadly assess the performance of the model at reproducing the vertical temperature stratification in the deeper indo australian basin in total 157 profiles were found in the model domain for the period february to may 2017 fig 1 the quality controlled temperature data was interpolated onto 75 standard layers in the upper 2000 m such that statistics could be derived from a composite of all profiles argo data was sourced from the australian ocean data network aodn 3 model setup and methodology the numerical model used in this study was the regional ocean modeling system roms a three dimensional free surface hydrostatic terrain following s vertical coordinate system model solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 2009 the roms 4d var da method available in the svn rev 1028 inside the roms model branch was used our setup was similar to recent studies using 4d var levin et al 2020 2021 and was formulated on the dual form restricted b preconditioned lanczos algorithm rpcg gürol et al 2014 correcting for initial and boundary conditions including the surface wind stress and heat flux this method has benefits over other approaches such as 3d var or optimal interpolation it assimilates data at the exact observation time and location with time dependent errors for each gridded observation as opposed to averaging to a single time as in 3d var or optimal interpolation it uses model evolving error covariance implicitly to constrain the system in a more physical way than stationary statistics and it is possible to interrogate the spatial and temporal structures of the optimal corrections computed in the whole model space and apply them to the state vectors the 4d var methodology relies on small perturbations around the background ocean state and linear variational calculus using adjoint and tangent linear models which constrain the assimilation window to where linear assumptions are still valid for details see moore et al 2011a b in our case we ran multiple tangent linear models to propagate perturbations together with the corresponding non linear model in order to test tangent linear model time window validity to that end the assimilation period 1 february 2017 to 1 june 2017 was split into 30 individual four day cycles the ocean model numerical grid was carefully considered and set with 1010 480 horizontal grid cells of variable spatial resolution between 2 and 5 km and zero orthogonal error the model grid was optimally setup for pawsey cray xc 40 architecture utilizing exactly 10 nodes each having 24 cores 240 tiles 24 10 layout in the vertical 30 s model layers with increased resolution at the ocean surface were used as well as at the thermocline depth around 150 m depth the model domain covers all important regions including the known generation sites for internal tides gong et al 2021 to estimate the model grid depths the best available bathymetry data was adopted in regions close to australia a combination of the geoscience australia 250 m gridded product and 1 m resolution multi beam swath measurements was used while further offshore the gebco 30 arc second global dataset was input to reduce horizontal pressure gradient errors hpge inside the numerical model solution an iterative approach comprising linear programming smoothing dutour sikiric et al 2009 in each iteration was adopted this was achieved by integrating the ocean model without any forcing or boundary conditions instead only using a depth variable horizontally uniform and stable analytical fit to the mean density profile ideally in the quiescent setup there should not be any horizontal density gradients and induced ocean currents however due to the inherent slope in s vertical coordinate layers hpge did develop with non negligible bottom currents 0 1 m s around the sea mounts and shelf breaks where the s layers were significantly tilted using information from the hpge bottom currents a weighted mask was created for the next iteration of the linear programming pointwise smoothing and by applying this approach the original bathymetry was modified in 2 iterations only at the grid cells where it was needed current speed larger or equal to 5 cm s while retaining most of the important steep topographic features for internal tide generation fig 1 in our study the near surface model grid cell width varied from 0 25 m in shallow waters up to 7 5 m in the deepest regions despite using 30 vertical layers in total with an increased number in the surface zone and around the thermocline we gave particular attention to the construction of the background error covariance matrix d in eq 1 such that the assimilation scheme would adjust to sub tidal frequency variability but not tidal frequency dynamics this was necessary because for example tidally dominated thermocline heaving inside the domain can have significant excursions of o 10 m that would poorly constrain the error background covariance matrix to compute d a free running non linear model was run for 6 months 1 january to 1 july 2017 with all 2d and 3d model state and control variables saved at hourly intervals a low pass filter third order butterworth with 34 hour cut off period of all tidally influenced variables was then applied to remove the tidal frequency variability this filtering also removed the diurnal heating induced variability from the surface heat flux variables to compute the standard deviations of the filtered variables needed for d there are typically two approaches a using long order of years simulations or b shorter order of days weeks simulations the first method a is usually used to provide robust estimates of multiyear simulations for re analysis here smoothed variables such as multiyear mean daily values are employed the second method b is used for operational short term and high resolution analysis such as what we are trying to achieve here estimating the standard deviations of the filtered variables over shorter time scales allows the standard deviations and consequently d to be influenced by the recent model dynamics achieving adjustment for fast changing high resolution model dynamics that are specified on a daily basis in our case the standard deviation for each 4 day assimilation window was computed with an additional padding of 2 days one day before and one day after the assimilation cycle window a diffusion operator approach was used to insert initial state boundary condition and atmospheric forcing standard deviation values into the d matrix computation weaver and courtier 2001 within that process we used decorrelation scales of a 100 km for the atmospheric control vector variables and b 50 km in the horizontal and 10 m in the vertical for variables in the ocean overall the filtering and standard deviation computations required o 10 gb of memory 6 months of hourly values for 6 variables and whole grid with a python pangeo dask xarray parallel cluster environment set up on the pawsey supercomputer finally the observation error matrix r was assumed diagonal and was constructed by taking the maximum value of either the individual sensor error or the observation representativeness error usually the latter was larger super observations were formed by combining observations that fit within each model grid and 1 h intervals the average of the values are the super observations and the standard deviation is the representativeness error this analysis was undertaken with the python package seapy daily averaged fields for the free surface ocean currents temperature and salinity were interpolated from the operational analysis and forecast system of mercator ocean international with 1 12 degree grid spacing onto our roms model open boundaries the barotropic tidal signal was synthesized and added at the open boundaries at each model time step using 15 tidal harmonics m 2 s 2 n 2 k 2 k 1 o 1 p 1 q 1 m m m f m 4 mn4 ms4 2n2 s 1 originating from the tpxo 9 1 egbert and erofeeva 2002 database the initial ocean state 1 january 2017 was interpolated from the operational analysis and forecast system of mercator ocean international with 1 12 degree grid spacing while the atmospheric forcing was supplied by the european centre for medium range forecast ecmwf ifs operational model output at 10 km spatial and one hour temporal resolution for the non linear model run bulk flux parametrizations were used for air sea heat and momentum fluxes fairall et al 1996 while at the open boundaries the implicit chapman scheme chapman 1985 was used for the free surface and the flather scheme flather 1976 for 2d momentum transport a combination of radiation and nudging was used for the tracers and the 3d momentum the 4d var assimilation experiment started one month after the non linear model started i e 1 february 2017 and was initialized with the dynamically balanced ocean state from the non linear model run that had already spun up the internal and barotropic tides spatially and temporally variable open boundary conditions were used for the 4d var while ocean mixing was saved during each assimilation window of the background non linear model run and later used within the adjoint and tangent linear models during each data assimilation cycle the background non linear model trajectory was first computed starting from the initial state of the previous assimilation cycle and as such the background simulation from here on referred to as the prior solution was not using any observations during the specific assimilation cycle however information of previous assimilation cycles was embedded inside the prior initial state all available sst observations were assimilated within each 4 day window and produced an optimal model solution from here on referred to as the posterior solution in addition a fully observation independent non linear model run was also undertaken referred to as the control run model estimates were saved at the same observation locations across all three simulations such that 4d var results prior and posterior could be compared to the control run in summary across the 120 day long da experiment period a total of 30 assimilation cycles were performed each of 4 day duration and using 30 million himawari 8 model gridded night scene sst observations 4 results 4 1 model evaluation the first stage of the da evaluation involves confirming that the j cost function converged since the da acts to minimize the residuals between the observations and model background state via a cost function eq 1 for each 4 day assimilation cycle a total of 7 inner and 2 outer minimization loops were used which was sufficient to converge and find optimal perturbations of model trajectory by minimizing the cost function fig 2 and still fit within the supercomputer 24 hour queue time limit cost function was based on the non linear model only at the start of outer loops while on the tangent linear model at the inner loops during the entire 30 cycle experiment i the first iteration was the most effective reducing the total starting cost by 21 ii at the end of the first outer loop i e after 7 iterations the cost was reduced by half and iii the 2nd outer loop 8 14 iterations reduced the cost function by another 8 although during the last iteration of the 2nd outer loop 14th iteration the reduction was only 1 7 the total cost varied between each assimilation window and was a function of both the ocean dynamic variability and the number of assimilated observations 4 2 estimated and observed sst overall the da scheme resulted in i a 1 c difference between posterior and control 120 day time mean sst fig 3 top row ii a reduction in the westward surface currents south of the indonesian archipelago fig 3 middle row and iii corrections in the northern surface currents fig 3 bottom row additional details are provided in the following discussion the mean sst was larger for the posterior than for the control model by approximately 1 c the most pronounced differences were found in the areas close to the coastline southern indonesian archipelago and along the nws shelf as well as the south west region of the model where a cold ocean front meandered in the control run a negative cold sst bias varied both temporally and spatially during the experiment and was significantly reduced by the 4d var da system fig 4 which was particularly evident during may reaching over 0 5 c for the domain mean although large this is close to the observation error limit and it is worth reiterating that the 4d var da minimizes the l2 norm of the cost function j and that this improvement in bias is an important result of the scheme the main difference in the mean surface current was in the westward flow south of the indonesian archipelago the control run had a 0 2 m s faster westward flow in this region fig 3 middle row other differences due to eddy front position mismatch resulting in both eastward and northward velocity differences fig 3 middle and bottom rows spatially the largest bias in the control run fig 5 c occurred on the nws during the first part of the experiment see fig 10 and in the region surrounding the indonesian archipelago during the last period see fig 11 while the prior solution was significantly better than the control solution fig 5 b as it was initialized from the previous posterior ocean state at the start of the new assimilation cycle the posterior model practically eliminated the spatial trends in sst bias fig 5 a and overall had a very small bias with values significantly smaller than the satellite sst instrument error 0 58 c the rmse for sst for the control run was 0 5 0 8 c depending on the assimilation cycle fig 6 while for the prior it reduced to 0 4 0 5 c and it was further reduced to 0 2 0 3 c for the posterior and as such the posterior rmse was roughly 2 5 times smaller than the control value spatially the largest temporally averaged values for rmse were found in the most temporally variable regions where the control model performed poorly fig 7 c here the prior solution performed significantly better fig 7b than the control run whilst the posterior fig 7a further removed the spatial variability in rmse as well as the magnitude an exception being within the narrow channels of the indonesian archipelago regions which exhibit strong mixing and through flow variability i e indonesian s small islands lombok strait 4 3 model differences in the surface heat flux and wind stress data assimilation of the satellite observations reduced the rmse for sst in the posterior simulation by mostly modifying the surface net heat flux fig 8 and the eastward wind stress fig 9 in both cases the differences were within the bounds of expected conditions for example the monthly averaged surface net heat flux differences between posterior and control runs were up 50 w m2 in february the difference had a predominantly positive sign denoting that the net heat flux into the ocean was on average greater in the posterior run fig 8a b and c in april south of 15 s over much of the region the net heat flux was out of the ocean and the magnitude was too large in the control north of this the net heat flux was into the ocean and was larger than in the control run the largely increased net heat flux in the posterior model corrected the negative temperature bias in the control model figs 4 and 5 similar net heat flux differences are reported in studies of the warm central pacific region around hawaii matthews et al 2012 a region with similar latitude to the present study area differences in the surface eastward wind stress were small but occurred dominantly during february in the northern part of the domain dominant eastward or westerly winds in particular around the indonesian archipelago fig 9 c where the eastward wind stress component was reduced by up to 5 0 005 pa in the posterior later during april the wind regime changed to the westward direction easterly winds and the differences were an order of magnitude smaller than in february fig 9c and f have different range the change in the northward wind stress component not shown was generally smaller than for the eastward component and only evident along the south western region of the model domain the benefits of the 4d var da system in constraining the model to a more physically realistic state are exemplified in two regional examples taken from the first and second halves of the analysis period where snap shots in time are used to demonstrate the details of the 4d var da model in the first example early march 2017 the control solution demonstrated a cold bias along the coastal and central australian nws central and southern regions of the domain while the posterior solution showed increased net heat flux from the atmosphere due to the da heat flux correction resulting in a warmer ocean that was closer to the observations fig 10 the innovation vector d fig 10e bottom left which is defined as the difference between the observed value and the background model estimate drives the assimilation there was however a small residual fig 10f bottom right that was not possible to adjust and this is important to note as 4d var combines observations with model dynamics in a consistent way and did not over fit values due to our properly constrained observation r and model error background covariance matrix d for a second example fig 11 a snap shot is taken from the last month of the simulation 23rd may 2017 where a cold bias was present in the control solution around the indonesian archipelago this cold bias was the consequence of strong easterly winds in the global atmospheric model which subsequently generated strong upwelling along java s southern coastline to decrease the residuals between the sst observations and the prior simulation the wind forcing and net heat flux were adjusted by 4d var da and resulted in a modified ocean state including ocean currents fig 12 which remained in dynamic balance with the observed horizontal density structure captured by the high resolution sst observations the posterior mean westward surface currents were smaller along java s southern coast fig 12 than in the control simulation while the complex variation in eastward surface currents in the interior of the domain reflects modification to the position and strength of the ocean currents as well as more transient dynamics such as eddies fig 12 4 4 evaluation of water column ocean properties improvements in modelling through water column ocean properties with only sst assimilation were evaluated by comparing the model output with data from the argo profiling network as well as the two vertical moorings located on the continental shelf in the browse basin 250 m and the timor sea 460 m fig 1 comparisons with the mooring data focused on april 2017 when there was sufficient data coverage from both moorings and the da model had sufficient spinup time all available 157 argo profiles for the period february to may 2017 were used to give basin wide coverage with both bias and rmse used as metrics for comparing all quantities again note that none of this argo or mooring data is used in the da so they represent a truly independent assessment of the model solution the temperature profiles from the 157 argo profiles showed more than a 50 reduction in bias in the upper 100 m for the posterior compared with the control run fig 13 the bias of the posterior was in the range of 0 5 to 0 c in the upper 100 m while it was up to 1 c in the control run the posterior run demonstrated a warmer bias roughly 0 25 c between 150 m and 300 m below the sea surface while the bias in both model runs reduced to zero below 400 m similar to the bias the posterior displayed a smaller rmse in the upper 100 m the peak rmse was 1 5 c at 80 m depth whereas the control run peaked at 2 4 c at the same depth the lowest rmse was roughly 0 5 c near the sea surface where the instantaneous profiles from the argo buoys are less likely to be distorted by isothermal heaving due to internal waves and eddies both the posterior and control runs had a similar rmse below 300 m overall the 4d var da exhibited greatest improvement in the upper 100 m salinity bias also decreased from 0 4 psu to 0 15 psu in the posterior run over the upper 100 m not shown this freshening was likely due to decreases in the latent heat flux not shown and hence the evaporation rate since we did not include freshwater fluxes in the model control vector improvements in temperature bias and rmse were evident at the timor sea itftis mooring when using the mean temperature during april 2017 fig 14 the posterior model bias was near zero in the upper 50 m and 1 c between 50 and 100 m in comparison the control run showed a 1 c cold bias in the upper 100 m similarly the rmse was about 50 lower in the posterior compared to the control run over the upper 100 m below 100 m depth the temperature bias increased up to 1 c in both runs while rmse peaked at 1 8 c the thermocline in both runs was deeper and broader than the observations and this is likely the reason for poorer performance below 100 m the observed monthly averaged velocity at the itftis mooring for april 2017 was less than 0 05 ms 1 in both directions fig 15 4d var da reduced the bias in the mean flow by around 50 in the upper 100 m for both the eastward and northward velocity components while the control run had an eastward velocity bias of 0 2 ms 1 the posterior was close to the observed values 0 1 ms 1 bias while the rmse peaked at about 25 cm s at roughly 200 m in both runs the posterior rmse for both velocity components was again lower than the control run by about 30 in the upper 100 m there was less improvement evident in through water column temperature at the 250 m browse basin shelf mooring the temperature bias at 40 m below the surface in the posterior run was closer to zero 0 4 versus 0 7 c in the control run however the bias below 50 m was worse fig 16b the temperature rmse was up to a factor of two larger in the posterior run and exceeded 2 c at 150 200 m below the surface fig 16c both the posterior and control runs failed to capture the mean thermocline structure at this shelf site observations reveal a thermocline extending from 50 to 175 m deep and weaker temperature gradient between 175 m and the seafloor fig 16a both posterior and control runs did not reproduce this weaker gradient region near the bed resulting in a wider thermocline extending to 250 m deep the posterior run did however capture the surface to seabed temperature difference 16 c better because of adjusting the surface temperatures using the net heat flux corrections demonstrated in the following section these adjustments to vertical stratification influence internal wave propagation and thus the water velocity at the site the eastward and northward velocity rmse at the browse mooring was up to 30 lower in the posterior run for april 2017 particularly in the upper 100 m fig 17c and f the observations did not indicate any mean flow exceeding 0 1 ms 1 this result was captured in the bias of the posterior run the velocity bias was less than 0 05 ms 1 for both components whereas it was 0 15 ms 1 in the northward component of the control run fig 17e corrections made to the surface net heat and momentum fluxes are likely the reason for the improvement in the posterior run 5 discussion this section examines the sensitivity of data assimilation on higher order derived ocean quantities that are also of interest and discusses potential driving mechanisms for these results the higher order quantities include i the mixed layer and thermocline depth ii internal tide induced baroclinic velocity ellipses and phasing and iii the horizontal wavenumber spectra of sst 5 1 mixed layer depth overall the time and spatially averaged mixed layer depth mld defined as the depth where the temperature deviates by 0 4 c from the temperature at 10 m depth was 80 m in the posterior run 4 m deeper than the control run not shown in february the mld was largely shallower over the domain with a maximum decrease of over 20 m along the coast of java in the north of the domain fig 18a the 5 10 m decrease in mld over much of the domain is likely due to the increased net heat flux into the ocean and reduced eastward wind stress in february fig 8a and b adjacent to java the significant wind speed reduction was the likely cause as the net heat flux actually decreased in this region in april in the north of the domain the mld predominantly increased in the posterior compared with the control the increase largely aligned with regions with increased westward wind stresses alteration of the mld impacts the propagation of internal tides and baroclinic instabilities and thereby is a critical model parameter 5 2 internal tide phasing the vertical density distribution plays a crucial role in the generation and propagation of the internal tides on the nws even slight variations in density can lead to large changes in velocity as the internal tide phase shifts and leads to changes in the interaction of internal tides propagating in different directions as shown by powell et al 2012 in a study of internal tide dominated dynamics in a region around hawaii by extending standard 4d var to 4d var adjoint sensitivity technique density variations were the dominant factor in defining and altering baroclinic energy paths these interactions can result in either constructive or destructive interference depending on the relative phase difference meaning that accurate reproduction of current at a point in space is critically dependent upon the stratification throughout the model domain the rmse and bias of the currents at the browse basin sp250 station and timor sea itftis station moorings were both reduced in the posterior model relative to the control model figs 15 and 17 respectively both mooring sites are internal tide dominated regions gong et al 2019 and the influence of the data assimilation on the regional internal tide dynamics is discussed further below in the model validation statistics the internal tide contribution to model data mismatch is evident in the rmse for example it is observed that the greatest temperature rmse occurs around 150 m to 200 m below the surface where the internal tide induced temperature perturbations are also the greatest see fig 14 despite having a small bias the velocity depth averaged rmse for the posterior run at the browse basin mooring fig 15 was still 0 16 ms 1 and 0 19 ms 1 for the eastward and northward components respectively this represents roughly a 30 improvement on the control run which not only over predicted the mean flow of both components but also over predicted the semi diurnal fluctuation amplitude it is shown that both the amplitude and phase of the semi diurnal velocity perturbations were improved in the posterior run particularly in the northward velocity component to understand the influence of the da scheme on the modelled internal tide the spatial fields of the internal tide namely the baroclinic tidal ellipse parameters were compared from the roms model solutions the semi major component of the surface baroclinic tidal currents was calculated by least squares fitting a semi diurnal frequency sinusoid to a 3 day segment 3 6 april 2017 of the model data real and imaginary amplitudes of eastward and northward baroclinic velocity were then converted using the ellipse parameters the semi diurnal major ellipse axis was 0 35 ms 1 in the browse basin region in the vicinity of the mooring although decreased to near zero within one internal wave length fig 19a the large spatial variations in surface currents were due to standing waves causing the velocity to either constructively or destructively interfere rayson et al 2021 gong et al 2019 a comparison of the baroclinic major ellipse magnitude from the posterior and control solutions revealed a spatial shift in the standing wave nodes and anti nodes as a consequence there was a 40 lower velocity amplitude in the posterior case at the browse mooring site although higher amplitudes were present elsewhere along the transect fig 19b a short 3 day time trace of both baroclinic velocity components visually demonstrates the improved performance of the posterior run particularly for the total speed where the control run velocities were up to 0 3 ms 1 100 larger than the observations fig 19c although more similar in magnitude the posterior run still did not do a great job at reproducing the baroclinic speed and direction of the observations and greater spatial coverage of observations within a radius of 50 km one internal wavelength would be necessary to conclude that the posterior run improved the regional internal tide dynamics this analysis highlights the difficulties in predicting velocity in regions where internal waves interact causing velocity to vary over spatial scales of less than 50 km 5 3 evaluation of energy containing length scales to evaluate the ocean model response to surface forcing modified by 4d var da the zonal wavenumber spectrum of the sst was calculated from both the posterior and control model runs this analysis enables us to compare the scale dependent variance for length scales spanning 25 300 km roughly spanning the smallest resolvable model length scale to a few 4 rossby radii of deformation dynamically this region of wavenumber space coincides with the small mesoscale and large submesoscale regimes i e eddies with length scales smaller than the rossby radius of deformation and where the absolute vertical vorticity exceeds the coriolis frequency sst variability at these scales is governed by a combination of either two dimensional turbulence see e g vallis 2006 or a response to the wavenumber content of the atmospheric heat and momentum forcing e g frankignoul and hasselmann 1977 alexander et al 2000 global observations of sst wavenumber spectra from infrared satellite imagery and along track vessel data reveal spectral slopes of k 1 k 3 that are vary regionally deschamps et al 1981 schloesser et al 2016 the meridionally averaged zonal wavenumber spectra of sst ssh and net surface heat flux was computed over a 6 6 degree box by averaging spectra determined along each latitude band and then averaging over a 4 day model cycle fig 20 a key result from this analysis was that the control run contained more variance at length scales greater than 300 km wavelength 0 02 cycle per kilometre cpkm and less at scales approaching 25 km it thus had a steeper spectral slope k 2 6 and k 2 0 for the control and posterior runs respectively the psd magnitude and slope of the posterior run was in better agreement with the observed sst for individual snapshots not shown analysis of other 4 day model cycles resulted in different slopes although the posterior model spectral slope was generally flatter than the control experiment and in better agreement with the himawari 8 data not shown a qualitatively similar result to sst where the posterior run had a flatter spectral slope was found in both the net heat flux and ssh meaning that variance was being injected into the finer length scales of these non assimilated quantities fig 20b and c respectively note that ssh is an integrated response to the upper ocean vertical temperature profile through the steric effect we suspect that the flatter spectral slope in all quantities was a forced response to the assimilation scheme modifying the heat flux scale dependent variability wind stress spectra was not affected by the assimilation not shown we cannot however completely rule out the role of internal variability because a sensible latent and outgoing longwave heat flux are all functions of sst and b modifications to the surface mixed layer depth vis fig 18 can influence baroclinic instability in the upper ocean see e g d addezio et al 2020 it was promising to find that the da scheme placed constraints on the scale dependent variability and that appropriate construction of the background error covariance matrix influenced this response correctly modelling the spectra of ocean variables from 100 km down to 1 km wavelength the submesoscales is an ongoing challenge souopgui et al 2020 assimilated synthetic sea surface height instead of sst using a 3d var assimilation scheme that had no tidal forcing and found that the assimilation scheme injected variance at around the 100 km wavelength in the sub surface temperature spectra in the model described in our paper sub surface temperature was dominated by internal gravity waves not eddies due to the inclusion of tidal forcing there was less variance at wave lengths around 100 km in the posterior sst and it is noted that the sst satellite observations are contaminated by noise at higher wavenumbers results from the present study suggest that the free running control model was too energetic in the mesoscale wavenumber region as indicated by the increased sst variance in wavenumbers greater than 300 km and that the da scheme appropriately constrained this aspect of the dynamics as shown in the posterior solution 6 summary and conclusions the primary goal of this study was to facilitate improvements in the estimation of upper ocean temperature and velocity in a remote and relatively under sampled region of the eastern indian ocean indo australian basin which is characterized by strong barotropic and baroclinic tides and mesoscale eddies to achieve that a state of the art roms ocean model was applied with the 4d var da method only remote sensed sst himawari 8 data was assimilated these observations are minimally affected by tidal dynamics the results demonstrate that the assimilation of only sst data improved not only the representation of surface temperatures but also other ocean variables like the baroclinic velocity down to at least 100 m depth it is found that the da corrections to the surface net heat and momentum fluxes associated with increased net heat flux from the atmosphere and changes to the eastward wind stress play a primary role in significantly improving the upper 100 m temperature profile almost completely removing sst bias and dramatically reducing rmse compared with the free non assimilating control model solution an important step in the 4d var da approach is to properly constrain the background error covariance in space and time this was achieved by running a non assimilating model first to filter tidally affected variables and compute residuals during the whole period then the standard deviations of residual values were calculated within each individual data assimilation cycle and used to populate model background covariance proper constraint of the background error covariance matrix d allowed the system to make suitable perturbations to the model initial state boundary conditions and forcing that remain physically plausible e g heat flux corrections o 10 w m2 horizontal wavenumber spectra of sst provided further evidence that these atmospheric net heat flux corrections were physically plausible overall the scheme reduced the variance at the mesoscale length scales 80 km and improved the spectral slope towards the smaller submesoscales the assimilation approach presented here using only surface observations is likely best suited to tropical and sub tropical regions where the ocean is sensitive to variations in the atmospheric heating and cooling assimilating other types of observations without filtering the barotropic and wide spectrum baroclinic dynamics would require a slightly different approach calling for more pre processing or using a different technique a promising approach may be the multi step assimilation technique where the minimization problem is split into two parts the first part focuses on large and mesoscale features while the second step focuses on the fine submesoscale information from the small scale innovation vector within the 3d var li et al 2015 souopgui et al 2020 or 4d var carrier et al 2019 framework these techniques will be explored in further work to improve estimates of temperature and velocity below 100 m depth using whole of water column observations credit authorship contribution statement i janeković

23858,estimating ocean processes in regions with sparse observations and where dynamics are dominated by strong barotropic and baroclinic tides poses a significant modelling challenge in this study a four dimensional variational 4d var data assimilation method incorporating remotely sensed sea surface temperature sst data observations only was used to improve estimates of the internal tide dynamics in the ocean between australia and indonesia in this region local internal tide generation propagation and interference of the internal tides is highly variable and dependent on the 3d density field and mesoscale dynamics the results of this study show that assimilation of remotely sensed sst data not only reduced the surface temperature root mean squared error rmse from 0 8 c to 0 3 c and removed a 0 4 c cold bias compared to a non assimilative model but also improved estimates of through water column variables with the latter evaluated against argo profiling floats and two independent mooring sites overall the depth averaged temperature rmse was reduced by as much as 38 and ocean currents by 20 at the two mooring sites the improvements were most significant in the top 100 m where the internal tide signature was significantly corrected despite no depth varying variables being assimilated the study also showed that assimilating 2 km resolution sst observations resulted in more realistic sst wavenumber power spectral density estimates than those without assimilating data in particular the scheme reduced the energy at mesoscale length scales and improved the spectral slope towards the smaller submesoscale dynamics it is concluded that 4d var assimilation using only sst improves estimates of upper 100 m ocean dynamics in tropical regions where there is sensitivity to the air sea fluxes keywords 4d var data assimilation internal tides roms model australian north west shelf 1 introduction variational state estimation methods are well established and gaining in popularity for advanced ocean modelling of both reanalysis of past ocean states and for forecasting they are employed at global spatial scales of o 10 km and decadal time scales köhl et al 2007 stammer et al 2003 regional scales of o 1 km and seasonal time scales moore et al 2011a powell et al 2008 broquet et al 2011 matthews et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 neveu et al 2016 levin et al 2019 and for higher resolution coastal applications on the order of days janeković et al 2013 2020 iermano et al 2015 souza et al 2015 kerry et al 2016 sperrevik et al 2017 levin et al 2020 2021 most data assimilation applications typically target the mesoscale flow e g moore et al 2011a powell et al 2008 broquet et al 2011 matthews et al 2012 and to do that efficiently they filter the finer scale dynamics from the observations before assimilation in contrast a key problem with data assimilation at finer scales is that there is typically insufficient data to constrain the fine scale processes o 1 km such as submesoscale eddies and internal gravity waves sandery and sakov 2017 demonstrated that the performance of a data assimilating ocean model degrades with smaller horizontal model grid spacing souopgui et al 2020 showed that the appropriate choice of length scale in the background error covariance matrix described is important for assimilating data at scales finer than the mesoscale using a 3d var scheme in this study we aim to demonstrate that fine scale processes in particular internal waves can be better represented with appropriate choices of input data assimilation scheme and model data error covariance matrices in a traditional 4d var scheme the 4d var data assimilation da technique aims to minimize residuals between observations and model background state over the assimilation time window by computing optimal perturbations of the control parameters δx the minimization is usually based on the variational iterative approach courtier et al 1994 courtier 1997 using the pre conditioned conjugate gradient method it reduces the cost function j considering i adjustments for the initial conditions boundary conditions and surface forcing all weighted with the normalized model background error covariance matrix d and ii all residuals between observational data and the model estimates at observation locations gδx d weighted with the observational error covariance matrix r and within the assimilation window 1 j j m j o 1 2 δ x t d 1 δx 1 2 gδx d t r 1 gδx d generally two approaches are used to minimize j a the primal approach which minimizes j in the space spanned by the model control vector and b the dual approach which minimizes j in the space defined by the number of used observations usually using the primal approach is less attractive as it has a much larger size and memory footprint than the dual approach the observational error covariance matrix r can be populated relatively simply using the observational data and their associated processing and instrument errors along with the computed variance when mapping multiple observations onto a single model grid cell and model time step representativeness errors within the approach it is usually assumed that instrument errors and errors of representativeness are mutually uncorrelated in space and time resulting in a diagonal r this assumption is not completely valid for example in the case of using time frequent and spatially gridded satellite products for more details refer to neveu et al 2016 the definition of the 4d var background error covariance matrix d requires careful attention especially if tidal dynamics are included e g matthews et al 2012 janeković et al 2013 powell et al 2012 if d is loosely constrained the model can significantly deviate from the background state i e towards an unphysical state while if it is too tightly constrained it will be heavily penalized for any deviation from the background state reducing assimilation capability and leaving large residuals this study explores the benefits of using correlation modelling to determine d with the generalized diffusion equation and isotropic decorrelation scales weaver and courtier 2001 in an environment with strong tidal forcing the australian northwest shelf the principal objective of this study was to enable better estimation of currents on the australian north west shelf nws the nws and timor sea is a 250 km wide marginal sea that is bounded by a region of the eastern indian ocean known as the indo australian basin fig 1 shelf oceanography is dominated by strong tidal forcing holloway 1983 large amplitude internal waves holloway 2001 rayson et al 2011 gong et al 2019 and seasonally variable ekman and geostrophic currents godfrey and mansbridge 2000 wijeratne et al 2018 internal waves on the shelf are directly forced at the shelf break by barotropic baroclinic topographic conversion e g holloway 2001 rayson et al 2011 or result from remotely generated internal tides propagating from distant topography like the exmouth plateau gong et al 2019 or indonesian islands katsumata and wijffels 2006 zaron 2019 gong et al 2021 the long range propagation of these remotely generated waves and hence their arrival time and location are all influenced by the ocean state e g the horizontal and vertical density stratification and mean circulation e g rayson et al 2011 the mean circulation in the indo australian basin is dominated by the westward flowing indonesian throughflow which from around june to december breaks down into mesoscale eddies when the monsoonal winds shift direction meyers et al 1995 feng and wijffels 2002 wijeratne et al 2018 these variations in larger scale circulation influence the ocean interior stratification and are sensitive to air sea fluxes and it is therefore necessary to accurately reproduce the large scale dynamics to correctly predict internal wave driven flow on the shelf in order to improve the prediction of internal wave driven currents in what is a data sparse region of the ocean by global standards it is necessary to create a best estimate of the ocean state which has been achieved in this study using only remotely sensed sst observations in a dynamically consistent way this best state estimate can then serve as the starting point for other high resolution modelling activities such as nested models to explore non linear internal wave dynamics this paper first describes the sst data used in the da system as well as the in situ observations of the ocean interior that were used for independent validation the roms model setup is then described with particular attention paid to describing how the background error covariance matrix d was constructed an analysis of the model performance relative to independent in situ observations is then provided before discussing the impacts of assimilated sst on the simulated range of dynamic scales in the ocean and the internal tide phasing 2 data sst derived from the three infrared channels of the japan meteorological agency himawari 8 geostationary satellite kurihara et al 2016 was assimilated in this study in this l3 product the clouds are masked using a probabilistic method see kurihara et al 2016 for full details and the reported rms of this sst dataset against in situ moored and drifting buoy data is 0 58 c after downloading this sst data from the jaxa server https www eorc jaxa jp ptree index html additional processing steps were performed to remove the day time solar heating effects that are not well represented within the model s s vertical coordinate system with variable surface layer thickness the night time averaged sst was calculated using only the hourly data between 2000 and 0600 local time 8 h ahead of utc where it was larger than the observation instrument error the standard deviation of the eight night time scenes was used as the observational error term while only data where the quality control flag was best quality level 5 was used the time period adopted for the 4d var simulation was selected to overlap with the kimberley internal soliton sediment and mixing experiment kissme conducted on the kimberley shelf browse basin region during april and may 2017 see rayson et al 2021 zulberti et al 2020 while this is the primary region of interest the model domain encompassed the entire australian north west shelf timor and arafura seas as well as the indo australian basin in addition to the kissme data all known publicly available data was sourced for the wider region and time period to provide independent validation of the 4d var da results through water column water temperature and velocity data from two moorings is available for the time period being studied these two moorings were installed in dynamically different locations along the mid to outer shelf region of the northern australian continental margin fig 1 the kissme sp250 mooring was located in the browse basin region in 250 m deep water while the integrated marine observing system imos timor sea mooring itftis was located on the edge of the timor trench in 460 m deep water fig 1 the sp250 mooring measured velocity with an upward looking rdi 75 khz adcp sampling at 60 s with 4 m vertical bins the lower bin was 12 m above the seabed and only data below 30 m of the free surface was retained seabird electronics sbe 56 thermistors were also installed at roughly 10 m intervals along the mooring and sampled at 2 hz in contrast the itftis mooring provided water temperature measurements at 60 s intervals from instruments spaced at roughly 20 m vertical intervals with data below 25 m of the free surface only in addition to the two moorings data from the argo ctd profiling network was used to broadly assess the performance of the model at reproducing the vertical temperature stratification in the deeper indo australian basin in total 157 profiles were found in the model domain for the period february to may 2017 fig 1 the quality controlled temperature data was interpolated onto 75 standard layers in the upper 2000 m such that statistics could be derived from a composite of all profiles argo data was sourced from the australian ocean data network aodn 3 model setup and methodology the numerical model used in this study was the regional ocean modeling system roms a three dimensional free surface hydrostatic terrain following s vertical coordinate system model solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 2009 the roms 4d var da method available in the svn rev 1028 inside the roms model branch was used our setup was similar to recent studies using 4d var levin et al 2020 2021 and was formulated on the dual form restricted b preconditioned lanczos algorithm rpcg gürol et al 2014 correcting for initial and boundary conditions including the surface wind stress and heat flux this method has benefits over other approaches such as 3d var or optimal interpolation it assimilates data at the exact observation time and location with time dependent errors for each gridded observation as opposed to averaging to a single time as in 3d var or optimal interpolation it uses model evolving error covariance implicitly to constrain the system in a more physical way than stationary statistics and it is possible to interrogate the spatial and temporal structures of the optimal corrections computed in the whole model space and apply them to the state vectors the 4d var methodology relies on small perturbations around the background ocean state and linear variational calculus using adjoint and tangent linear models which constrain the assimilation window to where linear assumptions are still valid for details see moore et al 2011a b in our case we ran multiple tangent linear models to propagate perturbations together with the corresponding non linear model in order to test tangent linear model time window validity to that end the assimilation period 1 february 2017 to 1 june 2017 was split into 30 individual four day cycles the ocean model numerical grid was carefully considered and set with 1010 480 horizontal grid cells of variable spatial resolution between 2 and 5 km and zero orthogonal error the model grid was optimally setup for pawsey cray xc 40 architecture utilizing exactly 10 nodes each having 24 cores 240 tiles 24 10 layout in the vertical 30 s model layers with increased resolution at the ocean surface were used as well as at the thermocline depth around 150 m depth the model domain covers all important regions including the known generation sites for internal tides gong et al 2021 to estimate the model grid depths the best available bathymetry data was adopted in regions close to australia a combination of the geoscience australia 250 m gridded product and 1 m resolution multi beam swath measurements was used while further offshore the gebco 30 arc second global dataset was input to reduce horizontal pressure gradient errors hpge inside the numerical model solution an iterative approach comprising linear programming smoothing dutour sikiric et al 2009 in each iteration was adopted this was achieved by integrating the ocean model without any forcing or boundary conditions instead only using a depth variable horizontally uniform and stable analytical fit to the mean density profile ideally in the quiescent setup there should not be any horizontal density gradients and induced ocean currents however due to the inherent slope in s vertical coordinate layers hpge did develop with non negligible bottom currents 0 1 m s around the sea mounts and shelf breaks where the s layers were significantly tilted using information from the hpge bottom currents a weighted mask was created for the next iteration of the linear programming pointwise smoothing and by applying this approach the original bathymetry was modified in 2 iterations only at the grid cells where it was needed current speed larger or equal to 5 cm s while retaining most of the important steep topographic features for internal tide generation fig 1 in our study the near surface model grid cell width varied from 0 25 m in shallow waters up to 7 5 m in the deepest regions despite using 30 vertical layers in total with an increased number in the surface zone and around the thermocline we gave particular attention to the construction of the background error covariance matrix d in eq 1 such that the assimilation scheme would adjust to sub tidal frequency variability but not tidal frequency dynamics this was necessary because for example tidally dominated thermocline heaving inside the domain can have significant excursions of o 10 m that would poorly constrain the error background covariance matrix to compute d a free running non linear model was run for 6 months 1 january to 1 july 2017 with all 2d and 3d model state and control variables saved at hourly intervals a low pass filter third order butterworth with 34 hour cut off period of all tidally influenced variables was then applied to remove the tidal frequency variability this filtering also removed the diurnal heating induced variability from the surface heat flux variables to compute the standard deviations of the filtered variables needed for d there are typically two approaches a using long order of years simulations or b shorter order of days weeks simulations the first method a is usually used to provide robust estimates of multiyear simulations for re analysis here smoothed variables such as multiyear mean daily values are employed the second method b is used for operational short term and high resolution analysis such as what we are trying to achieve here estimating the standard deviations of the filtered variables over shorter time scales allows the standard deviations and consequently d to be influenced by the recent model dynamics achieving adjustment for fast changing high resolution model dynamics that are specified on a daily basis in our case the standard deviation for each 4 day assimilation window was computed with an additional padding of 2 days one day before and one day after the assimilation cycle window a diffusion operator approach was used to insert initial state boundary condition and atmospheric forcing standard deviation values into the d matrix computation weaver and courtier 2001 within that process we used decorrelation scales of a 100 km for the atmospheric control vector variables and b 50 km in the horizontal and 10 m in the vertical for variables in the ocean overall the filtering and standard deviation computations required o 10 gb of memory 6 months of hourly values for 6 variables and whole grid with a python pangeo dask xarray parallel cluster environment set up on the pawsey supercomputer finally the observation error matrix r was assumed diagonal and was constructed by taking the maximum value of either the individual sensor error or the observation representativeness error usually the latter was larger super observations were formed by combining observations that fit within each model grid and 1 h intervals the average of the values are the super observations and the standard deviation is the representativeness error this analysis was undertaken with the python package seapy daily averaged fields for the free surface ocean currents temperature and salinity were interpolated from the operational analysis and forecast system of mercator ocean international with 1 12 degree grid spacing

mercator ocean international with 1 12 degree grid spacing while the atmospheric forcing was supplied by the european centre for medium range forecast ecmwf ifs operational model output at 10 km spatial and one hour temporal resolution for the non linear model run bulk flux parametrizations were used for air sea heat and momentum fluxes fairall et al 1996 while at the open boundaries the implicit chapman scheme chapman 1985 was used for the free surface and the flather scheme flather 1976 for 2d momentum transport a combination of radiation and nudging was used for the tracers and the 3d momentum the 4d var assimilation experiment started one month after the non linear model started i e 1 february 2017 and was initialized with the dynamically balanced ocean state from the non linear model run that had already spun up the internal and barotropic tides spatially and temporally variable open boundary conditions were used for the 4d var while ocean mixing was saved during each assimilation window of the background non linear model run and later used within the adjoint and tangent linear models during each data assimilation cycle the background non linear model trajectory was first computed starting from the initial state of the previous assimilation cycle and as such the background simulation from here on referred to as the prior solution was not using any observations during the specific assimilation cycle however information of previous assimilation cycles was embedded inside the prior initial state all available sst observations were assimilated within each 4 day window and produced an optimal model solution from here on referred to as the posterior solution in addition a fully observation independent non linear model run was also undertaken referred to as the control run model estimates were saved at the same observation locations across all three simulations such that 4d var results prior and posterior could be compared to the control run in summary across the 120 day long da experiment period a total of 30 assimilation cycles were performed each of 4 day duration and using 30 million himawari 8 model gridded night scene sst observations 4 results 4 1 model evaluation the first stage of the da evaluation involves confirming that the j cost function converged since the da acts to minimize the residuals between the observations and model background state via a cost function eq 1 for each 4 day assimilation cycle a total of 7 inner and 2 outer minimization loops were used which was sufficient to converge and find optimal perturbations of model trajectory by minimizing the cost function fig 2 and still fit within the supercomputer 24 hour queue time limit cost function was based on the non linear model only at the start of outer loops while on the tangent linear model at the inner loops during the entire 30 cycle experiment i the first iteration was the most effective reducing the total starting cost by 21 ii at the end of the first outer loop i e after 7 iterations the cost was reduced by half and iii the 2nd outer loop 8 14 iterations reduced the cost function by another 8 although during the last iteration of the 2nd outer loop 14th iteration the reduction was only 1 7 the total cost varied between each assimilation window and was a function of both the ocean dynamic variability and the number of assimilated observations 4 2 estimated and observed sst overall the da scheme resulted in i a 1 c difference between posterior and control 120 day time mean sst fig 3 top row ii a reduction in the westward surface currents south of the indonesian archipelago fig 3 middle row and iii corrections in the northern surface currents fig 3 bottom row additional details are provided in the following discussion the mean sst was larger for the posterior than for the control model by approximately 1 c the most pronounced differences were found in the areas close to the coastline southern indonesian archipelago and along the nws shelf as well as the south west region of the model where a cold ocean front meandered in the control run a negative cold sst bias varied both temporally and spatially during the experiment and was significantly reduced by the 4d var da system fig 4 which was particularly evident during may reaching over 0 5 c for the domain mean although large this is close to the observation error limit and it is worth reiterating that the 4d var da minimizes the l2 norm of the cost function j and that this improvement in bias is an important result of the scheme the main difference in the mean surface current was in the westward flow south of the indonesian archipelago the control run had a 0 2 m s faster westward flow in this region fig 3 middle row other differences due to eddy front position mismatch resulting in both eastward and northward velocity differences fig 3 middle and bottom rows spatially the largest bias in the control run fig 5 c occurred on the nws during the first part of the experiment see fig 10 and in the region surrounding the indonesian archipelago during the last period see fig 11 while the prior solution was significantly better than the control solution fig 5 b as it was initialized from the previous posterior ocean state at the start of the new assimilation cycle the posterior model practically eliminated the spatial trends in sst bias fig 5 a and overall had a very small bias with values significantly smaller than the satellite sst instrument error 0 58 c the rmse for sst for the control run was 0 5 0 8 c depending on the assimilation cycle fig 6 while for the prior it reduced to 0 4 0 5 c and it was further reduced to 0 2 0 3 c for the posterior and as such the posterior rmse was roughly 2 5 times smaller than the control value spatially the largest temporally averaged values for rmse were found in the most temporally variable regions where the control model performed poorly fig 7 c here the prior solution performed significantly better fig 7b than the control run whilst the posterior fig 7a further removed the spatial variability in rmse as well as the magnitude an exception being within the narrow channels of the indonesian archipelago regions which exhibit strong mixing and through flow variability i e indonesian s small islands lombok strait 4 3 model differences in the surface heat flux and wind stress data assimilation of the satellite observations reduced the rmse for sst in the posterior simulation by mostly modifying the surface net heat flux fig 8 and the eastward wind stress fig 9 in both cases the differences were within the bounds of expected conditions for example the monthly averaged surface net heat flux differences between posterior and control runs were up 50 w m2 in february the difference had a predominantly positive sign denoting that the net heat flux into the ocean was on average greater in the posterior run fig 8a b and c in april south of 15 s over much of the region the net heat flux was out of the ocean and the magnitude was too large in the control north of this the net heat flux was into the ocean and was larger than in the control run the largely increased net heat flux in the posterior model corrected the negative temperature bias in the control model figs 4 and 5 similar net heat flux differences are reported in studies of the warm central pacific region around hawaii matthews et al 2012 a region with similar latitude to the present study area differences in the surface eastward wind stress were small but occurred dominantly during february in the northern part of the domain dominant eastward or westerly winds in particular around the indonesian archipelago fig 9 c where the eastward wind stress component was reduced by up to 5 0 005 pa in the posterior later during april the wind regime changed to the westward direction easterly winds and the differences were an order of magnitude smaller than in february fig 9c and f have different range the change in the northward wind stress component not shown was generally smaller than for the eastward component and only evident along the south western region of the model domain the benefits of the 4d var da system in constraining the model to a more physically realistic state are exemplified in two regional examples taken from the first and second halves of the analysis period where snap shots in time are used to demonstrate the details of the 4d var da model in the first example early march 2017 the control solution demonstrated a cold bias along the coastal and central australian nws central and southern regions of the domain while the posterior solution showed increased net heat flux from the atmosphere due to the da heat flux correction resulting in a warmer ocean that was closer to the observations fig 10 the innovation vector d fig 10e bottom left which is defined as the difference between the observed value and the background model estimate drives the assimilation there was however a small residual fig 10f bottom right that was not possible to adjust and this is important to note as 4d var combines observations with model dynamics in a consistent way and did not over fit values due to our properly constrained observation r and model error background covariance matrix d for a second example fig 11 a snap shot is taken from the last month of the simulation 23rd may 2017 where a cold bias was present in the control solution around the indonesian archipelago this cold bias was the consequence of strong easterly winds in the global atmospheric model which subsequently generated strong upwelling along java s southern coastline to decrease the residuals between the sst observations and the prior simulation the wind forcing and net heat flux were adjusted by 4d var da and resulted in a modified ocean state including ocean currents fig 12 which remained in dynamic balance with the observed horizontal density structure captured by the high resolution sst observations the posterior mean westward surface currents were smaller along java s southern coast fig 12 than in the control simulation while the complex variation in eastward surface currents in the interior of the domain reflects modification to the position and strength of the ocean currents as well as more transient dynamics such as eddies fig 12 4 4 evaluation of water column ocean properties improvements in modelling through water column ocean properties with only sst assimilation were evaluated by comparing the model output with data from the argo profiling network as well as the two vertical moorings located on the continental shelf in the browse basin 250 m and the timor sea 460 m fig 1 comparisons with the mooring data focused on april 2017 when there was sufficient data coverage from both moorings and the da model had sufficient spinup time all available 157 argo profiles for the period february to may 2017 were used to give basin wide coverage with both bias and rmse used as metrics for comparing all quantities again note that none of this argo or mooring data is used in the da so they represent a truly independent assessment of the model solution the temperature profiles from the 157 argo profiles showed more than a 50 reduction in bias in the upper 100 m for the posterior compared with the control run fig 13 the bias of the posterior was in the range of 0 5 to 0 c in the upper 100 m while it was up to 1 c in the control run the posterior run demonstrated a warmer bias roughly 0 25 c between 150 m and 300 m below the sea surface while the bias in both model runs reduced to zero below 400 m similar to the bias the posterior displayed a smaller rmse in the upper 100 m the peak rmse was 1 5 c at 80 m depth whereas the control run peaked at 2 4 c at the same depth the lowest rmse was roughly 0 5 c near the sea surface where the instantaneous profiles from the argo buoys are less likely to be distorted by isothermal heaving due to internal waves and eddies both the posterior and control runs had a similar rmse below 300 m overall the 4d var da exhibited greatest improvement in the upper 100 m salinity bias also decreased from 0 4 psu to 0 15 psu in the posterior run over the upper 100 m not shown this freshening was likely due to decreases in the latent heat flux not shown and hence the evaporation rate since we did not include freshwater fluxes in the model control vector improvements in temperature bias and rmse were evident at the timor sea itftis mooring when using the mean temperature during april 2017 fig 14 the posterior model bias was near zero in the upper 50 m and 1 c between 50 and 100 m in comparison the control run showed a 1 c cold bias in the upper 100 m similarly the rmse was about 50 lower in the posterior compared to the control run over the upper 100 m below 100 m depth the temperature bias increased up to 1 c in both runs while rmse peaked at 1 8 c the thermocline in both runs was deeper and broader than the observations and this is likely the reason for poorer performance below 100 m the observed monthly averaged velocity at the itftis mooring for april 2017 was less than 0 05 ms 1 in both directions fig 15 4d var da reduced the bias in the mean flow by around 50 in the upper 100 m for both the eastward and northward velocity components while the control run had an eastward velocity bias of 0 2 ms 1 the posterior was close to the observed values 0 1 ms 1 bias while the rmse peaked at about 25 cm s at roughly 200 m in both runs the posterior rmse for both velocity components was again lower than the control run by about 30 in the upper 100 m there was less improvement evident in through water column temperature at the 250 m browse basin shelf mooring the temperature bias at 40 m below the surface in the posterior run was closer to zero 0 4 versus 0 7 c in the control run however the bias below 50 m was worse fig 16b the temperature rmse was up to a factor of two larger in the posterior run and exceeded 2 c at 150 200 m below the surface fig 16c both the posterior and control runs failed to capture the mean thermocline structure at this shelf site observations reveal a thermocline extending from 50 to 175 m deep and weaker temperature gradient between 175 m and the seafloor fig 16a both posterior and control runs did not reproduce this weaker gradient region near the bed resulting in a wider thermocline extending to 250 m deep the posterior run did however capture the surface to seabed temperature difference 16 c better because of adjusting the surface temperatures using the net heat flux corrections demonstrated in the following section these adjustments to vertical stratification influence internal wave propagation and thus the water velocity at the site the eastward and northward velocity rmse at the browse mooring was up to 30 lower in the posterior run for april 2017 particularly in the upper 100 m fig 17c and f the observations did not indicate any mean flow exceeding 0 1 ms 1 this result was captured in the bias of the posterior run the velocity bias was less than 0 05 ms 1 for both components whereas it was 0 15 ms 1 in the northward component of the control run fig 17e corrections made to the surface net heat and momentum fluxes are likely the reason for the improvement in the posterior run 5 discussion this section examines the sensitivity of data assimilation on higher order derived ocean quantities that are also of interest and discusses potential driving mechanisms for these results the higher order quantities include i the mixed layer and thermocline depth ii internal tide induced baroclinic velocity ellipses and phasing and iii the horizontal wavenumber spectra of sst 5 1 mixed layer depth overall the time and spatially averaged mixed layer depth mld defined as the depth where the temperature deviates by 0 4 c from the temperature at 10 m depth was 80 m in the posterior run 4 m deeper than the control run not shown in february the mld was largely shallower over the domain with a maximum decrease of over 20 m along the coast of java in the north of the domain fig 18a the 5 10 m decrease in mld over much of the domain is likely due to the increased net heat flux into the ocean and reduced eastward wind stress in february fig 8a and b adjacent to java the significant wind speed reduction was the likely cause as the net heat flux actually decreased in this region in april in the north of the domain the mld predominantly increased in the posterior compared with the control the increase largely aligned with regions with increased westward wind stresses alteration of the mld impacts the propagation of internal tides and baroclinic instabilities and thereby is a critical model parameter 5 2 internal tide phasing the vertical density distribution plays a crucial role in the generation and propagation of the internal tides on the nws even slight variations in density can lead to large changes in velocity as the internal tide phase shifts and leads to changes in the interaction of internal tides propagating in different directions as shown by powell et al 2012 in a study of internal tide dominated dynamics in a region around hawaii by extending standard 4d var to 4d var adjoint sensitivity technique density variations were the dominant factor in defining and altering baroclinic energy paths these interactions can result in either constructive or destructive interference depending on the relative phase difference meaning that accurate reproduction of current at a point in space is critically dependent upon the stratification throughout the model domain the rmse and bias of the currents at the browse basin sp250 station and timor sea itftis station moorings were both reduced in the posterior model relative to the control model figs 15 and 17 respectively both mooring sites are internal tide dominated regions gong et al 2019 and the influence of the data assimilation on the regional internal tide dynamics is discussed further below in the model validation statistics the internal tide contribution to model data mismatch is evident in the rmse for example it is observed that the greatest temperature rmse occurs around 150 m to 200 m below the surface where the internal tide induced temperature perturbations are also the greatest see fig 14 despite having a small bias the velocity depth averaged rmse for the posterior run at the browse basin mooring fig 15 was still 0 16 ms 1 and 0 19 ms 1 for the eastward and northward components respectively this represents roughly a 30 improvement on the control run which not only over predicted the mean flow of both components but also over predicted the semi diurnal fluctuation amplitude it is shown that both the amplitude and phase of the semi diurnal velocity perturbations were improved in the posterior run particularly in the northward velocity component to understand the influence of the da scheme on the modelled internal tide the spatial fields of the internal tide namely the baroclinic tidal ellipse parameters were compared from the roms model solutions the semi major component of the surface baroclinic tidal currents was calculated by least squares fitting a semi diurnal frequency sinusoid to a 3 day segment 3 6 april 2017 of the model data real and imaginary amplitudes of eastward and northward baroclinic velocity were then converted using the ellipse parameters the semi diurnal major ellipse axis was 0 35 ms 1 in the browse basin region in the vicinity of the mooring although decreased to near zero within one internal wave length fig 19a the large spatial variations in surface currents were due to standing waves causing the velocity to either constructively or destructively interfere rayson et al 2021 gong et al 2019 a comparison of the baroclinic major ellipse magnitude from the posterior and control solutions revealed a spatial shift in the standing wave nodes and anti nodes as a consequence there was a 40 lower velocity amplitude in the posterior case at the browse mooring site although higher amplitudes were present elsewhere along the transect fig 19b a short 3 day time trace of both baroclinic velocity components visually demonstrates the improved performance of the posterior run particularly for the total speed where the control run velocities were up to 0 3 ms 1 100 larger than the observations fig 19c although more similar in magnitude the posterior run still did not do a great job at reproducing the baroclinic speed and direction of the observations and greater spatial coverage of observations within a radius of 50 km one internal wavelength would be necessary to conclude that the posterior run improved the regional internal tide dynamics this analysis highlights the difficulties in predicting velocity in regions where internal waves interact causing velocity to vary over spatial scales of less than 50 km 5 3 evaluation of energy containing length scales to evaluate the ocean model response to surface forcing modified by 4d var da the zonal wavenumber spectrum of the sst was calculated from both the posterior and control model runs this analysis enables us to compare the scale dependent variance for length scales spanning 25 300 km roughly spanning the smallest resolvable model length scale to a few 4 rossby radii of deformation dynamically this region of wavenumber space coincides with the small mesoscale and large submesoscale regimes i e eddies with length scales smaller than the rossby radius of deformation and where the absolute vertical vorticity exceeds the coriolis frequency sst variability at these scales is governed by a combination of either two dimensional turbulence see e g vallis 2006 or a response to the wavenumber content of the atmospheric heat and momentum forcing e g frankignoul and hasselmann 1977 alexander et al 2000 global observations of sst wavenumber spectra from infrared satellite imagery and along track vessel data reveal spectral slopes of k 1 k 3 that are vary regionally deschamps et al 1981 schloesser et al 2016 the meridionally averaged zonal wavenumber spectra of sst ssh and net surface heat flux was computed over a 6 6 degree box by averaging spectra determined along each latitude band and then averaging over a 4 day model cycle fig 20 a key result from this analysis was that the control run contained more variance at length scales greater than 300 km wavelength 0 02 cycle per kilometre cpkm and less at scales approaching 25 km it thus had a steeper spectral slope k 2 6 and k 2 0 for the control and posterior runs respectively the psd magnitude and slope of the posterior run was in better agreement with the observed sst for individual snapshots not shown analysis of other 4 day model cycles resulted in different slopes although the posterior model spectral slope was generally flatter than the control experiment and in better agreement with the himawari 8 data not shown a qualitatively similar result to sst where the posterior run had a flatter spectral slope was found in both the net heat flux and ssh meaning that variance was being injected into the finer length scales of these non assimilated quantities fig 20b and c respectively note that ssh is an integrated response to the upper ocean vertical temperature profile through the steric effect we suspect that the flatter spectral slope in all quantities was a forced response to the assimilation scheme modifying the heat flux scale dependent variability wind stress spectra was not affected by the assimilation not shown we cannot however completely rule out the role of internal variability because a sensible latent and outgoing longwave heat flux are all functions of sst and b modifications to the surface mixed layer depth vis fig 18 can influence baroclinic instability in the upper ocean see e g d addezio et al 2020 it was promising to find that the da scheme placed constraints on the scale dependent variability and that appropriate construction of the background error covariance matrix influenced this response correctly modelling the spectra of ocean variables from 100 km down to 1 km wavelength the submesoscales is an ongoing challenge souopgui et al 2020 assimilated synthetic sea surface height instead of sst using a 3d var assimilation scheme that had no tidal forcing and found that the assimilation scheme injected variance at around the 100 km wavelength in the sub surface temperature spectra in the model described in our paper sub surface temperature was dominated by internal gravity waves not eddies due to the inclusion of tidal forcing there was less variance at wave lengths around 100 km in the posterior sst and it is noted that the sst satellite observations are contaminated by noise at higher wavenumbers results from the present study suggest that the free running control model was too energetic in the mesoscale wavenumber region as indicated by the increased sst variance in wavenumbers greater than 300 km and that the da scheme appropriately constrained this aspect of the dynamics as shown in the posterior solution 6 summary and conclusions the primary goal of this study was to facilitate improvements in the estimation of upper ocean temperature and velocity in a remote and relatively under sampled region of the eastern indian ocean indo australian basin which is characterized by strong barotropic and baroclinic tides and mesoscale eddies to achieve that a state of the art roms ocean model was applied with the 4d var da method only remote sensed sst himawari 8 data was assimilated these observations are minimally affected by tidal dynamics the results demonstrate that the assimilation of only sst data improved not only the representation of surface temperatures but also other ocean variables like the baroclinic velocity down to at least 100 m depth it is found that the da corrections to the surface net heat and momentum fluxes associated with increased net heat flux from the atmosphere and changes to the eastward wind stress play a primary role in significantly improving the upper 100 m temperature profile almost completely removing sst bias and dramatically reducing rmse compared with the free non assimilating control model solution an important step in the 4d var da approach is to properly constrain the background error covariance in space and time this was achieved by running a non assimilating model first to filter tidally affected variables and compute residuals during the whole period then the standard deviations of residual values were calculated within each individual data assimilation cycle and used to populate model background covariance proper constraint of the background error covariance matrix d allowed the system to make suitable perturbations to the model initial state boundary conditions and forcing that remain physically plausible e g heat flux corrections o 10 w m2 horizontal wavenumber spectra of sst provided further evidence that these atmospheric net heat flux corrections were physically plausible overall the scheme reduced the variance at the mesoscale length scales 80 km and improved the spectral slope towards the smaller submesoscales the assimilation approach presented here using only surface observations is likely best suited to tropical and sub tropical regions where the ocean is sensitive to variations in the atmospheric heating and cooling assimilating other types of observations without filtering the barotropic and wide spectrum baroclinic dynamics would require a slightly different approach calling for more pre processing or using a different technique a promising approach may be the multi step assimilation technique where the minimization problem is split into two parts the first part focuses on large and mesoscale features while the second step focuses on the fine submesoscale information from the small scale innovation vector within the 3d var li et al 2015 souopgui et al 2020 or 4d var carrier et al 2019 framework these techniques will be explored in further work to improve estimates of temperature and velocity below 100 m depth using whole of water column observations credit authorship contribution statement i janeković

https gws access jasmin ac uk public jmmp collab amm7 the en 4 2 1 dataset is available at https www metoffice gov uk hadobs en4 1 introduction it can be time consuming to choose a suitable vertical coordinate system for an ocean model yet it has been argued that the vertical coordinates are the single most important configuration option because they steer the representation of modelled processes griffies 2004 a significant factor is the effect on the model s representation of processes at regions of steeply sloping bathymetry such as at the continental slope which can be important in terms of transports and dissipation e g zhai et al 2010 marsh et al 2017 dukhovskoy et al 2006 desbruyères et al 2020 the vertical coordinates are particularly important for shelf sea models where there is a need to accurately represent shallow water dynamics as well as include the adjacent deeper off shelf regions in such situations the vertical coordinates play an important role in how on and off shelf processes are represented and therefore in some sense how the shelf seas are forced via cross shelf exchange huthnance 1995 brink 2016 the three main coordinate options are i vertical coordinates defined by depth giving horizontally uniform z levels ii terrain following sigma coordinates following the bottom topography iii coordinates that follow isopycnals each has their strengths and weaknesses and it can be possible to hybridise the coordinates in order to obtain reasonable compromises hybridisation as well as the need to specify parameters that control properties such as the vertical spacing of the computational surfaces stretching quickly turns the choice of vertical coordinates into a non trivial exercise the purpose of this paper is to create a useful case study of how certain classes of vertical coordinates perform in a realistic shelf model we will compare the performance of different vertical coordinate options in a nemo nucleus for european modelling of the ocean https www nemo ocean eu shelf seas model of the northwest european shelf using a hierarchy of experiments idealised realistic tide only in z level coordinates the discretisation of depth is horizontally uniform which means that the bottom topography is represented by steps that can result in overstating local depth gradients furthermore the number of computational levels effectively decreases over shallower bathymetry the step like representation of the bottom topography and restricted vertical resolution have been found to negatively affect the representation of down slope density driven currents in the bottom boundary layer in both idealised ezer and mellor 2004 bruciaferri et al 2018 and realistic shapiro et al 2013 models the cascading of dense shelf water down the continental slope is an example of a density driven flow that contributes to shelf ocean exchange luneva et al 2020 although the larger scale significance of intermittent cascading is hard to quantify ivanov et al 2004 the representation of bottom topography at ocean boundaries is also important for the simulation of ocean boundary dynamics such as boundary currents ezer 2016 and boundary waves dukhovskoy et al 2006 wise et al 2020a which can influence coastal sea level wise et al 2018 2020b fukumori et al 2015 calafat et al 2012 and communicate changes in ocean circulation around ocean basins johnson and marshall 2002 roussenov et al 2008 the artificially extreme depth gradients found in z level models can be reduced though not removed by introducing partial steps in the bottom cells pacanowski and gnanadesikan 1998 it is possible to define an arbitrary vertical coordinate s s x y z t where x y z are the spatial coordinates and t is the temporal coordinate with the restriction that s is a monotonic function of height above the sea surface z the primitive equations can then be transformed into the x y s t coordinate system s coordinates such that a dependent variable can be described as a function of the new coordinates i e a a x y z x y s t t a particular and common application of this transformation is to allow the spatial variation to fit with the changes in the bottom topography this gives terrain following coordinates that are commonly referred to as sigma σ coordinates i e s σ z h x y where h is the ocean bottom depth terrain following coordinates naturally improve on the noted deficiencies in z level models by representing topographic features more faithfully and they can do so with a coarser overall vertical resolution since computational levels naturally compress where the bathymetry is shallower a well studied problem that arises in numerical models with σ coordinates however is that the hydrostatic pressure gradient is transformed to become the sum of two terms that may be large of comparable magnitude and of opposite sign in finite difference form this can introduce a truncation error haney 1991 beckmann and haidvogel 1993 mellor et al 1994 1998 reducing the hydrostatic pressure gradient hpg error is an active area of research and model development and a range of approaches have been investigated to achieve this including increasing eddy viscosities preconditioning by removing the background stratification interpolation of the density field back onto z levels and various different hpg algorithms and higher order approximations see berntsen and oey 2010 and references therein for further discussion this issue makes clear that in addition to the vertical coordinates affecting the representation of physical processes the accuracy of a numerical model depends on how well the model s numerical schemes cater to the different vertical coordinates haney 1991 originally noted that a sufficient condition for maintaining hydrostatic consistency in a finite difference scheme is 1 σ δ v σ δ h h 1 where h is the bottom depth δ h is the horizontal change in h of adjacent cells σ z h z is height measured from the undisturbed sea surface negative in the direction of the ocean bottom and δ v σ is the vertical grid spacing however since mellor et al 1994 showed that eq 1 and the discretisation error are not strictly aligned the concept of hydrostatic consistency has been considered less helpful a more useful approach was adopted by beckmann and haidvogel 1993 who studied the local error due to the hpg error by defining a slope parameter that is the ratio of the slope of the computational surface and the mean local bottom depth h defining the slope parameter r by 2 r δ h 2 h gives 0 r 1 with the error tending to zero as r 0 to limit the truncation error a restriction on the maximum allowable slope parameter r m a x can be imposed such that r r m a x following dukhovskoy et al 2009 we refer to such coordinate systems as vanishing quasi sigma vqs coordinates since the computational levels are no longer strictly terrain following as described in o dea et al 2012 this can be achieved by creating a smoothed version of the bathymetry with the restriction that r r m a x by deepening relative to the real bathymetry the terrain following coordinate system is then generated based on this new smoothed bathymetry surface envelope and the grid cells that are deeper than the true bathymetry are masked for example see the zonal cross section of the vertical coordinates in fig 1a a disadvantage of this approach is that vertical resolution can be reduced on the continental shelf and slope in addition a saw tooth representation of the bottom can be created when there is a jump in the number of active levels between adjacent points e g see inset panel in fig 1b this in cropping of sigma layers into the topography potentially provides a physical barrier to any downslope flow bruciaferri et al 2018 2020 allowed for the definition of a spatially varying r m a x by introducing multiple arbitrarily defined surfaces envelopes which vertically divide the ocean domain into sets of levels each potentially possessing an individual 2d varying r m a x parameter envelopes can also be optimised according to other criteria these coordinate systems have been referred to as multi envelope s coordinates mes and an aspect that will be explored in this paper is their flexibility to allow a stricter smaller r m a x to be applied on the continental slope and a less strict larger r m a x on the shelf in both z and σ like coordinates the computational levels are in general misaligned with density surfaces isopycnals this misalignment introduces spurious diapycnal mixing via the numerical diffusion that accompanies advection of the tracer fields over steep topography this misalignment can be more extreme in terrain following coordinates griffies et al 2000 furthermore a spurious circulation can be generated in terrain following coordinates as this mixing can reinforce horizontal density gradients in z level models the same gradients tend to be weakened these issues are removed in isopycnic models where the vertical coordinate surfaces follow isopycnals although this in itself creates complications in representing water masses that are well mixed griffies 2004 at the time of writing isopycnic coordinates are not an option in nemo for our experiments we use nemo version 4 0 2 and the 7 km horizontal resolution 51 level atlantic margin model amm7 which is a shelf model spanning the northwest european shelf a version of this configuration is used as part of the uk met office s operational forecasting capabilities for the northwest european shelf o dea et al 2017 and is developed by both the national oceanography centre and the met office through the joint marine modelling programme the met office s operational model uses vqs vertical coordinates with a constant r m a x parameter that as of version co6 coastal ocean version 6 is relatively large i e weak restriction on the slope of computational surfaces we will compare the performance of the model

iii different stretching functions iv s z hybridisation and v z level with partial steps our focus is on the coordinates effect on overall model accuracy and this implicitly includes the overall effect of the coordinates on the model s numerical approximations in addition to the effect of the coordinates on representing physical processes as part of the joint marine modelling programme this case study will help inform future development of the vertical coordinate system used in the operational 1 5 km atlantic margin model amm15 graham et al 2018 tonani et al 2019 in the following section we describe the vertical coordinates in detail and the core of the model we then discuss the experiments unforced multi year realistically forced tide only and results and follow with a summary and conclusion 2 model and vertical coordinates 2 1 vertical coordinate configurations nine configurations of a 51 level vertical coordinate system are used in our experiments a vertical zonal plot of each is given in figs 1 3 transect in fig 4 denotes location showing the vertical maximum of r eq 2 for each vertical column the configurations are described below and summarised in table 1 2 1 1 vanishing quasi sigma vqs coordinates configurations 1 3 sf r24 sf r10 sh r10 use vqs coordinates that are generated by creating a smoothed version of the bathymetry with a restriction on the slope parameter r such that r r m a x the coordinates are then generated based on this new smoothed bathymetry envelope and then the grid cells that are deeper than the true bathymetry are masked out this last step ensures that the bathymetry has not been smoothed configuration sf r24 fig 1a is the current amm7 co6 configuration and uses r m a x 0 24 an r m a x parameter of 0 24 is relatively large and allows computational surfaces to closely follow the terrain the vertical distribution of levels is defined by the siddorn and furner 2013 sf stretching equation configuration sf r10 fig 1b is the same as configuration sf r24 with the exception that r m a x 0 10 hence computational slopes are generally flatter on the slope and shelf however there is reduced vertical resolution as well as more saw toothing layers that in crop into the bottom topography configuration sh r10 fig 1c is the same as configuration sf r10 but with the vertical distribution of levels defined by the song and haidvogel 1994 sh stretching formulation the siddorn and furner 2013 stretched configuration sf r10 typically gives flatter surfaces while the song and haidvogel 1994 stretched configuration sh r10 exhibits a finer resolution at the bed on the mid slope where the levels are steepest note that parameters can be modified in the siddorn and furner 2013 formulation to increase resolution at the bed 2 1 2 multi envelope s coordinates configurations 4 5 mes r24 07 mes r10 07 use mes coordinates employing two envelopes note that the pink dashed lines in figs 2a b indicate the transition between envelopes in configuration mes r24 07 fig 2a the upper envelope has maximum depth of 250 m and is generated by smoothing the actual bathymetry 250 m with the martinho and batteen 2006 smoothing algorithm with r m a x 0 24 the deeper envelope is a smoothed version of the actual bathymetry with minimum depth of 250 m and using r m a x 0 07 in the case of the deeper envelope an r m a x 0 04 has also been applied to specific grid points where horizontal pressure gradient errors were larger than 0 1 m s in a tuning phase the upper part of the domain is discretised using 25 vqs levels stretched via the siddorn and furner 2013 formulation while the deeper part of the domain consist of 26 vqs levels distributed to ensure continuity of the jacobian of the vertical coordinate transformation see bruciaferri et al 2018 for details this configuration has the same r m a x as configuration sf r24 on the shelf but a lower r m a x on the slope configuration mes r10 07 fig 2b is the same as mes r24 07 except that the upper envelope is constrained by an r m a x 0 10 the same as sf r10 and sh r10 which enables us to isolate the effect of r m a x on the shelf and at the shelfbreak 2 1 3 s z hybrid and z level coordinates configurations 6 8 sz r10 s26 sz r24 s21 sz r10 s21 use hybrid s z coordinates and configuration 9 zp uses z levels with partial steps configuration sz r10 s26 fig 2c uses hybrid s z coordinates where the bottom 25 levels are z level with partial steps and the upper 26 levels approximately upper 490 m are vqs with an r m a x 0 10 the s z coordinates employ vertical stretching using a double tanh function based on madec and imbard 1996 in the z levels transitioning to pure sigma all layers of equal thickness in shallow waters configuration sz r24 s21 fig 3a also uses hybrid s z coordinates but here the bottom 30 levels are z level with partial steps and the upper 21 levels approximately upper 225 m are vqs with an r m a x 0 24 configuration sz r10 s21 fig 3b is the same as sz r24 s21 but using an r m a x 0 10 contrasting the performance of configurations sz r24 s21 and sz r10 s21 will again test the sensitivity to r m a x on the shelf and at the shelfbreak contrasting the performance of configurations sz r10 s26 and sz r10 s21 will test the sensitivity to the number of s levels just below the shelfbreak the comparison of the mes and s z hybrid configurations allows us to quantify the effect of gently sloping computational surfaces on the continental slope finally configuration zp fig 3c uses z levels with partial steps and the same double tanh stretching used in the z level portions of the s z hybrid configurations which concentrates resolution towards the surface 2 1 4 discussion and summary with these nine configurations summarised in table 1 we are able to investigate a number of permutations i the vqs coordinates with different r m a x allow us to examine the effect of restricting the tilt of computational surfaces at all depths ii the mes coordinates allow us to examine the effect of r m a x individually on the continental shelf and slope iii the s z coordinates allow us to examine the effect of z levels with partial steps below the shelfbreak iv the z level with partial steps allows us to contrast sigma and z levels on the shelf v the different stretching options allow us to compare the effect of vertical resolution fig 4 shows the vertical resolution of the nine configurations at points on the shelf at the shelfbreak and in the deep ocean the sf r24 sf r10 and sh r10 configurations have notably higher resolution on the shelf than the other configurations however comparing them against one another makes clear the effect that different stretching formulations and r m a x have on vertical resolution the siddorn and furner 2013 stretching sf r24 sf r10 has in general a more uniform cell thickness throughout the water column with smaller thicknesses in the upper and lower levels a more uniform surface layer may give more consistent air sea fluxes however the song and haidvogel 1994 stretching sh r10 has thinner cells around 2500 m depth compared to the siddorn and furner 2013 formulation which we see from fig 1c appears to give increased resolution just above the mid region of the continental slope on the shelf the mes s z and zp configurations have lower resolution this is more pronounced in the lower half of the water column for the s z and zp configurations this is also the case at the shelf break from figs 1 3 it is clear that the trade off for increased resolution is greater potential for hpg errors with the sf r24 and zp configurations at opposite extremes this is particularly notable from the mid continental slope region upwards onto the shelfbreak the mes and s z configurations can be thought of as compromises of varying degrees between these two extremes indeed this is the general basis for the presented ordering of the configurations bottom boundary processes which can have vertical scales smaller than in the interior ocean have been demonstrated to be particularly sensitive to vertical resolution in experiments investigating the effect of resolution on gravity currents down a slope it has been shown that increased resolution in the ekman layer improves representation of dense water cascades laanaia et al 2010 wobus et al 2011 laanaia et al 2010 showed that when applying a no slip bottom condition realistic gravity current dynamics could be captured with 3 computational surfaces in the bottom 40 m whereas a single surface resulted in a reduced descent rate finer resolution in the bottom 40 m 200 m range improved performance but to a lesser degree berntsen et al 2018 showed that the application of a quadratic drag law friction parameterisation and law of the wall scaled drag coefficient gave good representation of ekman drainage and spiral with 4 to 5 grid cells in the bottom ekman layer while our focus is necessarily on overall model performance clearly bottom boundary processes are an important consideration for processes such as ekman transport off shelf and the associated downwelling circulation huthnance et al 2009 that can connect shelf ocean carbon exchange holt et al 2009 panel c in fig 4 shows that the sf r24 configuration has a resolution at the bottom of less than 10 m at 300 m bathymetry with finer resolution at 200 m bathymetry fig 1 panel a shows that increased resolution in the ekman layer is maintained on the upper slope from there the resolution will typically reduce in the bottom as the number of overall levels becomes a limitation the mes configurations also have about 3 layers in the bottom 40 m at 300 m depth more at shallower depth the other configurations typically either have 2 or 1 layers while even the sf r24 configuration has reduced bottom resolution a great depth our ensemble does include a range of resolution characteristics including in the bottom boundary region 2 2 model description the amm7 regional configuration of nemo encompasses the north west european shelf and at the time of writing the met office s operational version uses nemo version 3 6 as part of the transition to version 4 madec and nemo system team a review of the vertical coordinates has taken place and we therefore use nemo version 4 0 2 before moving on to describe the specific configurations used for the individual experiments we will first outline the core model set up which is based on o dea et al 2017 the curvilinear horizontal grid extends from 20 w 40 n to 13 e 65 n and has a meridional resolution of 7 4 km and a zonal resolution that varies from 9 4 km along the southern boundary to 5 2 km along the northern boundary with a 7 4 km mean the bottom topography uses bathymetry derived from the north west european shelf operational oceanographic system noos which is a modified gebco 1 arcmin dataset the bathymetry fig 4a extends to a maximum depth of order 5000 m to the south west the model employs a non linear split explicit free surface with variable volume layers and a 10 s barotropic and a 300 s baroclinic time step for momentum lateral viscosity is applied with a bilaplacian operator along computational levels with a coefficient of 1010 m4 s note that for an idealised two layer reduced gravity system the internal rossby radius on the nw european shelf would be in the region of 2 5 km holt and proctor 2008 and as such would not be resolved the vertical diffusion is via the generic length scale scheme with neumann conditions at the boundaries and a quadratic friction parameterisation is applied with law of the wall scaled drag coefficient the coriolis and momentum advection terms are computed using the vector invariant formulation with the enstrophy and energy conserving een scheme finally the nemo specific prj option is used for the hydrostatic pressure gradient scheme this uses a cubic spline to reconstruct the density with a subsequent analytical integration to calculate the pressure and pressure jacobian method to obtain the horizontal gradient it should be emphasised that this is a nemo specific option and as such conclusions drawn in this paper are limited to that scope since it is not clear how the specifics of the numerical scheme transfer to other models for tracers lateral diffusion is applied with a geopotential laplacian operator with a coefficient of 50 m2 s vertical diffusion is via the generic length scale scheme advection is applied with an fct scheme that is 4th order in the horizontal and 2nd order in the vertical the eos80 equation of state is used supporting code and configuration files used in the experiments can be found in the software repository wise et al 2021 3 experiments and results 3 1 unforced hydrostatic pressure gradient experiment as a first step we compare the different vertical coordinate configurations in an unforced experiment where the model is run from a state of no motion without boundary forcing closed lateral boundaries and with a horizontally uniform density field with no diffusion on the tracer fields there should be no evolution the smagorinsky scheme is used for lateral viscosity this classic experiment has been used to investigate spurious mixing and currents produced as a result of the truncation error in the hydrostatic pressure gradient calculation discussed in the introduction e g beckmann and haidvogel 1993 mellor et al 1998 siddorn and furner 2013 for the initial temperature and salinity we first tried four different climatologies that were representative of the on shelf and off shelf stratification for both summer and winter see fig 5 using each of these four different scenarios in an unforced model run using the sf r24 configuration we found that the summertime off shelf temperature and salinity profiles produced the largest spurious velocities in order to capture the largest errors we have used these summertime off shelf temperature and salinity profiles in the experiments in this section fig 6 shows the domain maximum velocity generated with the different vertical coordinates it shows significant spurious maximum velocities for the vqs coordinates that use a single value of the r m a x parameter configs sf r24 sf r10 sh r10 the maximum absolute error is close to 1 m s for the sf r24 configuration which constrains the slope of the computational levels the least the sf r10 configuration shows that tightening this restriction reduces the maximum absolute error to 40 cm s comparing the sf r10 and sh r10 configurations shows that the error with the siddorn and furner 2013 stretching is approximately 15 larger 5 cm s than the error with the song and haidvogel 1994 stretching this suggests that the increased vertical resolution over the mid region of the continental slope produced by the song and haidvogel 1994 stretching might help limit the error the mes hybrid s z and z level with partial stepping configurations perform significantly better the mes configurations both have maximum errors at the end of the experiment of 0 07 cm s with the change in r m a x in the upper 250 m making little difference the differences between the vqs sf r24 sf r10 sh r10 and multi envelope mes r24 07 mes r10 07 configurations suggests that constraining the tilt of the computational levels on the continental slope improves performance at least in the idealised case this is further supported by the hybrid s z configurations sz r10 s26 sz r24 s21 sz r10 s21 the spurious velocities for the configurations employing partial step z levels are a further order of magnitude smaller except for the sz r24 s21 configuration the hybrid case where the terrain following upper 21 computational levels are allowed to slope to a greater extent where the maximum velocities are comparable to the mes configurations the fact that the sz r24 s21 configuration produces errors an order of magnitude larger than the sz r10 s21 configuration suggests that at least some of the errors are produced on shelf or at the shelf break although clearly it is the sloping of the levels on the continental slope that are having the largest impact vertical resolution on the shelf does not appear to affect the error to leading order this can be seen more clearly in figs 7 and 8 which show maps of the depth averaged horizontal kinetic energy at days 10 and 30 respectively the white line denotes the 200 m isobath firstly both figures show that there is relatively large spurious kinetic energy in the vqs configurations while the errors are present both on and off shelf it is evident that the erroneous energy is largest on the continental slope secondly the figures show that the kinetic energy spreads spatially in time hence while the growth in the maximum velocities stops or slows the velocity errors also disperse such that the domain wide kinetic energy continues to increase as shown in fig 9a the kinetic energy can apparently disperse and grow because the errors in the hydrostatic pressure gradient calculation perturb the tracer fields which then drive velocities that do not decay at least on the time scale considered here we note for example that running the sf r24 configuration without tracer advection produces a smaller maximum velocity error that is less noisy fig 9b shows the magnitude of the temperature trend due to advection volume averaged over the domain it shows that the temperature field is evolving fig 9c shows that there is an associated geostrophic flow that is larger in the configurations that produce larger temperature transport typically this process has been labelled as a sigma error of the second kind sesk defined by a vorticity error mellor et al 1998 berntsen 2002 concluded that large viscosities unavailable to realistic ocean models are required to prevent these errors from growing they describe a situation where the error in vorticity produces continuous vertical exchange of water masses light water downward producing large real pressure gradient errors that may be more important than the initial erroneous pressure gradient error in driving a geostrophic flow berntsen 2002 also notes however that for any given model setup it is difficult to rule out other errors or limitations present in the model for example the advection or pressure gradient schemes used that may have a contributing effect in any case the relationship between the velocity and hydrostatic pressure gradient can be considered via the depth integrated momentum equations where 3 u h 0 u d z h 0 v d z is the depth integrated velocity for hydrostatic pressure p z 0 ρ g d z where ρ is density and g the gravity constant the relationship is 4 f k u 1 ρ 0 h 0 p d z 1 ρ 0 h 0 p d z 1 ρ 0 p b h 5 1 ρ 0 z p h 0 h 0 z p z d z 1 ρ 0 p b h 6 1 ρ 0 h 0 z p z d z h 1 ρ 0 p b 7 φ h 1 ρ 0 p b where 8 φ g ρ 0 h 0 z ρ d z is the potential energy p b the bottom hydrostatic pressure z h and k is the vertical unit vector the horizontal derivative operator h the bottom depth z the negative depth and ρ 0 the reference density hence the spurious potential energy can be transformed into kinetic energy and dispersed throughout the domain in summary the magnitude of the error increases as computational surfaces are allowed to slope relative to the geopotential surfaces these errors can be large particularly on the continental slope and are associated with large advective transports perturbing the density field as a consequence the configurations using z levels on the continental slope sz r10 s26 sz r24 s21 sz r10 s21 zp perform the best with the mes configurations mes r24 07 mes r10 07 performing better than the vqs configurations sf r24 sf r10 sh r10 constraining the tilting of the surfaces on the shelf can also reduce the errors but to a lesser degree since the bottom topography on the shelf is usually less steep the sensitivity of the simulations to the tilt of the computational surfaces suggests that there is an opportunity for the implementation of different hpg schemes to reduce this sensitivity e g shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2003 berntsen and oey 2010 berntsen 2011 berntsen et al 2015 sensitivity testing to the configuration of momentum diffusion used did show however that the relative performance of the experiments with the different vertical coordinates was robust to different mixing setups while the unforced experiments in this section highlight an important issue with the sloping of computational levels and suggest the mechanism by which it manifests the results should be taken alongside more realistically forced experiments one limitation of the unforced experiments is that they assume that density contours are horizontal which in reality is not the case this should be advantageous to the z level coordinates a second weakness of the unforced experiments is that due to the nonlinear evolution of the tracer fields which clearly have an important effect on the spurious velocities via the nonlinear equation of state it is difficult to assess what changes realistic forcing of tracers and momentum will have it is therefore problematic to assume that the spurious velocities can simply be superimposed over a real climatology of the velocity field in section 3 2 we use a realistically forced model to diagnose differences between the vertical coordinates via differences in the modelled temperature and salinity fields to observations and contextualise with the results from these unforced experiments 3 2 forced in this section we investigate whether the anomalies produced in the idealised setups are evident in a model with more realistic tracer fields and boundary forcing in the following experiments the model for each vertical coordinate setup is initialised and forced at the boundaries with reanalysis data and run from 2005 up to and including 2015 3 2 1 forcing and initialisation the model is initialised at the beginning of 2005 and is run with forcing applied at the lateral boundaries the atmospheric interface and with river run off along the land interface tidal forcing is also applied the era5 dataset hersbach et al 2018 is used to provide hourly atmospheric surface forcing fluxes for the humidity precipitation long and short wave radiation snowfall air temperature wind velocities and pressure using the core 3 5 bulk formulation monthly diffuse attenuation coefficient data for downwelling irradiance at 490 nm are supplied with constant chlorophyll concentration the daily river discharge timeseries are produced from an updated version of the river dataset used in lenhart et al 2010 combined with climatology of daily discharge data from the global river discharge data base vörösmarty et al 2000 and from data prepared by the centre for ecology and hydrology as used by young and holt 2007 the river runoff forcing frequency is daily and it is distributed throughout the water column for the tides 15 constituents are calculated from a tidal model of the northeast atlantic flather 1981 and applied at open lateral boundaries as the depth mean velocity and sea surface height for the lateral boundaries the flather radiation scheme is applied to the barotropic velocities and a zero gradient condition is applied to the normal baroclinic velocities the global seasonal forecast system glosea version 5 dataset maclachlan et al 2015 is used for the ocean lateral boundary conditions with the flow relaxation scheme applied to the tracers 3 2 2 analysis approach to assess the performance of the different vertical coordinates we compare the monthly model output against the en4 en 4 2 1 d l 19 jan 21 observational dataset good et al 2013 of quality controlled subsurface ocean profiles for temperature and salinity over the 10 year period 2006 2015 note our aim here is to compare the different set ups rather than fine tune the model the tracer fields are a good comparison benchmark because the en4 dataset provides a large observational dataset with a spread both in depth and horizontally across the entire domain see fig 10 for profile locations the en4 dataset includes depth profiles of salinity and temperature observations each profile p is located at a specific longitude and latitude and has k p observations at different depths such that k p 1 2 k p denotes an individual observation where subscript p 1 2 n denotes the profile of which there are n the en4 dataset groups profiles by their year and month to produce the model observation difference anomalies we first perform a nearest neighbour interpolation of the relevant monthly averaged model fields to each observation profile we then interpolate the model vertically to the observation depths and finally take the difference the set of salinity and temperature difference anomalies for all the profiles p are therefore defined by 9 s s p k p m o d s p k p o b s 10 t t p k p m o d t p k p o b s in order to highlight possible depth sampling biases we also define sets of depth averaged difference anomalies 11 s p r o f i l e 1 k p k p s p k p m o d s p k p o b s 12 t p r o f i l e 1 k p k p t p k p m o d t p k p o b s it should be acknowledged that there will be spatial and temporal uncertainties in any such analysis however by comparing the model tracer fields against over ten million observations covering a range of depths around the domain we obtain difference anomaly distributions that present a broad picture of how the vertical coordinates affect long term performance given the temporal and spatial non uniformity of instantaneous observations this is a pragmatic choice for assessing long term relative performance and a similar approach has been adopted in graham et al 2018 o dea et al 2017 3 2 3 results and discussion fig 11 shows the distributions of the difference anomalies for the entire domain over the entire 10 year period as boxplots the red line denotes the median the central box extends from the 25th to 75th percentiles and the lines extend from the 5th to the 95th percentiles there is an overall fresh and cool bias that is consistent across the experiments with all vertical coordinates that can typically be attributed to the forcing datasets used as well as physics options chosen for example see o dea et al 2017 for discussion of amm7 biases from a comparative point of view however there is a clear divergence between the configurations into broadly two categories the vqs configurations with a single r m a x parameter value have larger biases than the others and exhibit greater variability about the median this is an initial indication that the errors resulting from the hydrostatic pressure gradient errors seen in the unforced experiments section 3 1 might be important in the realistic models as well note also that the distributions have a skew and long tails which is a possible indication of the uncertainties in the individual difference anomalies since large errors can undesirably influence the mean and standard deviation of the sample we will also use the median in our diagnostics fig 12 shows the salinity and temperature difference anomalies aggregated over the entire domain for the entire 10 years giving an overall measure of relative performance panels 12 a and 12 b plot the mean absolute error and median absolute error against the standard deviation for the salinity defined by eq 9 both metrics show that sf r24 produces the largest difference and that sf r10 and sh r10 both give improvements the song and haidvogel 1994 stretching also appears to perform favourably against the siddorn and furner 2013 stretching these results are consistent with the unforced experiment results the zp s z and mes configurations all result in a further reduction in errors with the mes r10 07 configuration also reducing variability about the mean error the similarity between the mes r10 07 and mes r24 07 configuration and between the sz r10 21 and sz r24 21 configurations suggests that it is primarily on the continental slope where the sloping of computational levels becomes an issue panels 12c and 12d show the same metrics for the case where the difference anomalies have first been averaged for each profile as defined in eqs 11 and 12 respectively here we see a similar result in terms of absolute errors but there is a notable increase in variability in the configurations using z levels the difference between the mes and s z zp configurations in the mean and median metrics shows that the s z zp models have very slightly smaller typical absolute errors but larger variability such that they perform slightly worse as measured by the mean absolute error panels 12 e 12 h show the same results for temperature the picture presented is very similar to that of salinity with the least constrained sf r24 configuration showing the most variability and largest errors and the s z and mes showing the best performance with the sf r10 and sh r10 somewhere in between the same metrics applied to the profile averages panels 12g 12h give a very consistent picture the domain aggregated results from the reanalysis forced experiments qualitatively follow those of the unforced experiments this suggests that the hydrostatic pressure gradient error at steeply sloping bottom topography primarily off shelf on the continental slope when considered over the entire domain might dominate the potential benefits of the improved representation of near bottom processes such as dense water overflows this point in particular is highlighted by the strong performance of the zp configuration compared to the sf r24 sf r10 and sh r10 configurations indeed the difference anomalies for the zp configuration are similar to the more sophisticated s z and mes configurations that vary the constraint on computational slope to get the best of both z like and terrain following coordinates the greatest departure from the unforced experiment results is the performance of the mes configurations relative to the zp and s z configurations in the unforced experiments the spurious kinetic energy for the mes configuration is orders of magnitude larger than for the zp and s z configurations yet in the forced experiments the configurations have comparable absolute errors there are at least two interpretations of this difference firstly that the mes configuration is more closely aligned with realistic tracer contours resulting in smaller errors and secondly that the hydrostatic pressure gradient errors are small enough compared with the evolution driven by the boundary forcing that they become less important relative to the benefits of terrain following coordinates in terms of capturing near bottom processes in either case it demonstrates that tuning of terrain following coordinates using multiple envelopes can produce vastly improved results despite the marginal effect of constraining the computational slopes on the shelf i e above the continental slope it can be seen that the errors originating on the continental slope coincide with errors on the shelf this can be shown by looking at the difference anomalies on the outer shelf region denoted os in fig 13 as a function of depth fig 14 shows the set of difference anomalies defined by 9 and 10 horizontally averaged for the seasonal climatologies december february djf and june august jja for the outer shelf region denoted os in fig 13 for both salinity and temperature and both seasons there is a clear clustering of the bias anomalies for the mes s z and zp configurations which are also relatively consistent with depth the sf r24 anomaly by contrast has a large fresh and cool bias at the bed which decreases towards the surface tending towards the main cluster this is a strong indication that the errors seen in the unforced experiments remain important not only on the continental slope but also at the shelf break influencing processes in the lower half of the water column on the outershelf the same can be seen to a lesser extent in the biases of both the sf r10 and sh r10 configurations a similar picture emerges in the north sea and norwegian trench regions not shown regions ns and nt in fig 13 in the english channel southern north sea region denoted ec in fig 13 where there is no direct connection to the shelfbreak the horizontally averaged difference anomalies for the seasonal climatologies djf and jja present a different picture fig 15 in this shallow region the vqs coordinate systems perform best notably for salinity the main difference may be due to the higher vertical resolution of the sf r24 sf r10 and sh r10 configurations on the shelf this might be an important detail for an improved representation of the seasonal pycnocline in shallow regions for example the above aggregated results can be put into context by looking at how the different configurations represent water mass properties across the shelf slope and deep ocean the shetland faroe channel is a challenging test case because there are a number of water masses present that originate at a range of depths fig 16 based on figs 1 3 and 1 4 in hughes et al 2006 is a schematic representation of the water mass circulation and vertical structure in the shetland faroe channel based on long term observations the temperature and salinity ranges defining the water masses are given in table 2 and represent typical properties of the different water masses hansen and østerhus 2000 hughes et al 2006 there are five water masses defined starting from the deepest the norwegian sea deep water nsdw is the coolest the norwegian sea arctic intermediate water nsaiw is slightly warmer and slightly fresher the modified east icelandic water meiw is the freshest the modified north atlantic water mnaw is cooler and fresher than the north atlantic water naw which is the warmest and saltiest and is part of the upper slope current in the channel using the average of the monthly mean temperature and salinity model data over the 10 years 2006 2015 fig 17 shows the five water masses across the transect shown in fig 16a for the 9 model configurations the temperature and salinity ranges are defined in table 2 to represent the water masses in the model the ranges are in some cases slightly extended compared to those used in the schematic to be more continuous in particular the temperature range to define the mnaw must extend to be significantly cooler to include the waters just above the meiw while this is partly due to model bias generally too fresh and cool this is also because there will be a degree of mixing between the water masses which can have very different properties that may not be reflected in a schematic representation the black unassigned areas denote mixed regions that are outside the defined ranges of the five water masses overall the zp sz and mes models do a good job at capturing the structure of the different water masses a comparison with the vqs coordinates which struggle to capture the opposite extremes of the naw and nsdw shows that the vertical coordinates are making a significant difference this is consistent with the more extreme fresh and cool biases seen with the vqs configurations in the lower half of the water column in the outer shelf region in fig 14 to demonstrate the relationship between the on shelf tracer errors and the pressure gradient errors due to the vertical coordinates on the continental slope more explicitly we consider the rate of change of the salinity and temperature fields due to advection at the shelfbreak this is important because in section 3 1 it was shown that the error induced by the steeply sloping vertical coordinates manifests via the nonlinear coupling between the hydrostatic pressure gradient and the transfer of heat and salt characterised by increased advection of the tracers i e fig 9 we consider the advection of the tracers at the shelfbreak which is defined as the 200 m contour between the points 48n 7 5 w and 61n 0 5e this contour is adjacent to the outer shelf region as denoted in fig 13 advection at the shelfbreak is quantified in three steps i take the magnitude of tracer advection at the shelfbreak ii depth average this iii take the median in formal terms the salinity and temperature advection in the i j k directions are s u and t u where is the derivative operator in the i j k directions and u is the velocity vector u v w we use the 10 yr time averages 2006 2015 of the tracer advection denoted by s u and t u taking the magnitude and depth averaging gives 13 s a d v 1 h h 0 s u 2 d z 14 t a d v 1 h h 0 t u 2 d z where h is the bottom depth along the contour to represent the typical values of s a d v and t a d v we take the median denoted by fig 18 shows this typical advective transport of the tracers at the shelf break s a d v and t a d v plotted against the median absolute error in the tracer fields in the outer shelf region region denoted os in fig 13 the black dashed line is the linear best fit the four panels show an approximately linear relationship between the median absolute error and the magnitude of advective transport at the shelfbreak it was shown in the unforced experiments in section 3 1 that a larger slope parameter r m a x on the continental slope was associated with a larger magnitude domain averaged temperature advection fig 18 shows that this is also partially the case in the realistic runs the magnitude of the advective transport at the shelfbreak for the s z and zp configurations is very similar to the mes configurations which have an r m a x of either 0 04 or 0 07 on the continental slope this suggests that the hpg error in the mes configurations is not a leading order effect in the realistically forced experiment however we see that an r m a x on the continental slope that is larger than 0 07 is associated with an increase in advective transport in the realistically forced experiments hence for 0 07 r m a x 0 24 on the continental slope the results suggest that the errors in the tracer fields on the outer shelf are connected to larger advective transports at the shelfbreak which in the unforced experiments were associated with the hpg error due to the larger r m a x on the continental slope this relationship breaks down for r m a x 0 07 on the continental slope suggesting that this is close to a critical value where the hpg error becomes small enough so as not to be of leading order in a realistically forced model we note that in preliminary testing we used untuned mes configurations with r m a x 0 07 everywhere in the lower envelope and that the error in the tracer fields was larger than when using the tuned mes configurations with r m a x 0 07 or r m a x 0 04 in the lower envelope the errors were however still smaller than those produced by the r m a x 0 10 configurations which further supports the interpretation above to summarise the realistically forced runs broadly support the theme of the results of the unforced hydrostatic pressure gradient experiments the erroneous velocity dominates the benefits of the terrain following coordinates but importantly only in cases where the slope of the computational levels are allowed to deviate from the horizontal too much over the continental slope i e where the slope parameter is larger than 0 07 on the continental slope in fact in some locations it should be restricted even further i e fine tuning the most sensitive grids points with a smaller r m a x as was done with the mes configurations these errors seem to penetrate across the shelfbreak onto the shelf but the effect of restricting the slope parameter on the shelf itself appears far smaller the fact that the mes and s z have comparatively similar results while the sf r10 and sh r10 performed worse suggests that r 0 07 on the continental slope is in the proximity of a general critical value in terms of getting the best out of the vqs coordinates for our nemo shelf model configuration 3 3 tide only higher frequency dynamics are also important for shelf sea model applications such as storm surge and tidal modelling calculation of the surge residuals requires tidal simulation and the quality of the tidal simulation can be a good indication of model performance at these frequencies graham et al 2018 we therefore carry out a tide only experiment to investigate the effect of the vertical coordinates on the tides for this experiment the model is initialised from rest using a constant temperature and salinity of 10 c and 35 psu respectively the tidal forcing 15 constituents is the same as in the forced runs in section 3 2 the simulations are run for two years and a comparison is performed between the harmonic analyses of the model sea surface height ssh output and tide gauges there are 480 tide gauges and they are distributed as in fig 19 here we are interested in the relative performance of the different tidal simulations fig 20 shows the square root of the mean of the squared error rmse against the mean error bias for the m2 and s2 amplitudes and phases where the error is defined as the model minus the tide gauge the results show that performance of the configurations can be separated into four groups that differ by their configurations setups on the shelf and around the shelfbreak the smallest rmse is achieved by those coordinates which allow greater tilting of the computational surfaces on the shelf r m a x 0 24 for approximately upper 250 m sf r24 mes r24 07 sz r24 s21 the next smallest rmse is achieved by those configurations using the hybrid s z or mes coordinates with r m a x 0 10 on the shelf mes r10 07 sz r10 s26 sz r10 s21 the vqs configurations with r m a x 0 10 sf r10 sh r10 have a similar rmse for amplitude but larger rmse for m2 phase finally the zp configuration has the poorest performance in all respects in these experiments the spurious velocities investigated in the previous section do not factor because there is no stratification here the configurations with the most faithful representation of the real bathymetry on the shelf r m a x 0 24 perform the best the three configurations with r m a x 0 24 on the shelf have different vertical resolutions on the shelf and different representations of the bottom topography on the continental slope yet they all have a similar rmse and bias in shallow regions the bottom topography is an important factor affecting wave propagation and this appears to be the most important determinant of tidal simulation accuracy tested by our experiments the difference between the s z and mes group using r m a x 0 10 on the shelf and the sf r10 sh r10 group all these configurations have r m a x 0 10 on the shelf is that the latter group of configurations have a notable saw tooth representation of the bottom topography on the shelf which appears to degrade tidal simulation note that the s z and mes configurations avoid the saw toothing because more of their computational surfaces vanish beneath the bottom topography on the continental slope where the r m a x 0 07 in this sense the setup below the shelfbreak remains important it is consistent with the analysis above that the zp configuration should perform worst because it has the least accurate representation of the bottom topography on the shelf as well as a step like representation the results here are important for tidal simulations using a homogeneous ocean however they diverge from the results of the unforced and realistically forced climatological experiments because there can be no hydrostatic pressure gradient error 4 summary and conclusions the vertical coordinates are one of the most important configuration options in an ocean model but they can require a significant investment of resources to optimise here we have compared 9 vertical coordinate configurations by carrying out a hierarchy of experiments using a shelf seas model with realistic bathymetry to create the 9 different vertical coordinate systems we have used 4 different approaches namely vanishing quasi sigma vqs multi envelope s coordinate mes z level with partial steps and hybrid s z level the overarching aim has been to investigate their effect on model accuracy and in the process identify key configuration options in particular we have investigated the importance of allowing the computational surfaces to follow the terrain on the continental slope and shelf and we have looked at the effect of step like and saw tooth representations of the bottom topography we have used the nemo ocean model and the atlantic margin model configuration at 7 km horizontal resolution amm7 for our shelf sea model and while our results are specific to this configuration it is reasonable to expect that they are informative more generally we found that the scale of the error in the classic unforced hydrostatic pressure gradient experiments e g haney 1991 beckmann and haidvogel 1993 mellor et al 1994 with realistic bathymetry gave a reasonable up to a point qualitative indication of relative performance between the nine vertical coordinates when used in a realistically forced climatological simulation and compared against observations of temperature and salinity this is important because as noted originally by haney 1991 while the hydrostatic pressure gradient truncation error in s coordinates can be investigated relatively cheaply it is more difficult to assess the effect of the error on a realistic model this is further complicated when trying to compare against coordinate systems that have different deficiencies e g the step like representation of bathymetry in z level coordinates the tilt of the computational surfaces relative to depth as measured by the slope parameter r eq 2 on the continental slope was found to be the dominant determinant of accuracy down to a critical value of r m a x 0 07 where r m a x is the maximum allowed value of r before computational surfaces vanish beneath the bathymetry allowing the surfaces to closely follow the terrain everywhere as in configuration sf r24 r m a x 0 24 resulted in the generation of spurious velocities of the order of 10s of cm s in the unforced runs and large transports of temperature and salinity in the realistic simulations this coincided with the poorest domain aggregated performance relative to the other configurations increasing the constraint on the tilt of computational surfaces on the continental slope improved the simulation of the domain wide tracer fields an r m a x of 0 10 improved results and an r m a x of 0 07 improved results further by then restricting specific sensitive grid points on the slope further to r m a x 0 04 identified as grid points where large velocities would otherwise form in the unforced experiments in section 3 1 we found very little difference between having partial step z levels on the slope and vqs coordinates via the mes coordinates indeed the mes coordinates produced less error variability and a slightly smaller mean absolute error although the median absolute error was slightly smaller for the s z hybrid coordinates we therefore conclude that an r m a x of approximately 0 04 0 07 on the continental slope is optimal for vqs coordinates in the unforced experiments we found that the magnitude of the spurious flow due to the hydrostatic pressure gradient error was associated with the magnitude of tracer advection in the realistically forced experiments we found that across all nine configurations there is an approximately linear relationship between error of the tracers in the outer shelf region and the typical magnitude of tracer advection at the shelfbreak in the unforced experiments increased tracer advection was associated with increased r m a x on the continental slope this appears to be true in the realistically forced experiments for r m a x 0 07 for r m a x 0 07 it appears that the hpg error becomes small enough so as not to be a leading order effect in the unforced and realistically forced experiments we found a decreased r m a x on the shelf from 0 24 to 0 10 made little difference with the r m a x 0 10 giving perhaps slightly better performance overall we also found that in the case of the s z hybrid coordinates s above z having the upper s levels in the top 490 m 26 levels or top 225 m 21 levels made only a small difference with the latter slightly preferable overall this suggests that the larger errors originate below 490 m although this may be domain specific the tide only experiments primarily highlighted that in homogeneous models of the tides accuracy is improved by vertical coordinates that most closely represent the shelf bathymetry for example the sf r24 mes r24 07 and sz r24 s10 configurations which all allow the coordinates to closely follow the terrain on the shelf performed the best the vqs coordinates in nemo can lead to a saw toothed in cropping of layers representation of bottom topography on the shelf which resulted in a poorer tidal simulation similarly the step like representation of the shelf bathymetry in the zp configuration negatively impacted the solution while the coordinate system used off shelf made little direct difference to the tidal simulation it should be noted that in the vqs system layers that vanish on the continental slope may then reemerge on the shelf resulting in saw toothing these unwanted features can be minimised by either relaxing the r m a x criteria and or defining multiple envelopes or using hybrid s z coordinates on the shelf and slope our experiments show that performance gains can be made by defining different vqs setups on the continental shelf and slope transitioning at approximately 250 m depth with an r m a x 0 07 applied on the continental slope via the multi envelope approach or by hybridising vqs coordinates above partial step z levels the multi envelope approach offers flexibility for greater tuning to a specific domain while the hybrid s z is perhaps simpler there appears to be insensitivity to the precise depth location of the transition between coordinates providing it is not deeper than the typical upper slope 400 m which means that this approach is well suited to many different types of model domain e g global and regional this case study has involved the use of a regional model at a fixed 7 km horizontal resolution and we expect that optimal parameter values will also depend on the model resolution and the geographic region being modelled such dependencies are possible avenues of future research furthermore there is value in more specific process oriented studies that investigate the effect of the vertical coordinates on cascading and overflows with a realistic shelf sea model e g dependence on near bed resolution as well as exchange at the shelfbreak such investigations will help to inform the refinement of the vertical coordinates in more targeted studies finally we note that hpg algorithms are an active area of research and model development the implementation of different 4th order algorithms for example the 4th order shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2003 method holds the potential to enable a relaxation of the r m a x criteria with possible benefits for the simulation of bottom boundary layers over steep topography credit authorship contribution statement anthony wise

23859,the vertical coordinates vc are one of the most important set of configuration options of an ocean model optimisation is however a non trivial exercise we compare nine configurations to investigate different vc options and contrast the vanishing quasi sigma vqs partial step z level s z hybrid and multi envelope mes approaches using nemo model simulations a hierarchy of experiments are conducted including unforced simulations multi year climatological simulations with comparisons against tracer profile observations and tide only simulations hydrostatic pressure gradient errors on the continental slope in the vqs coordinates are found to be consistent with reduced domain averaged accuracy in both unforced and realistic simulations reduced accuracy on the continental shelf is associated with larger advective tracer transports at the shelfbreak accuracy is improved by using separate definitions of the computational surfaces on the shelf and slope using the mes and s z hybridisation approaches mes configurations employing vqs on the continental slope with a computational slope steepness parameter r m a x of 0 04 0 07 perform comparably with s z hybrid configurations restrictions on the tilt of computational surfaces on the shelf and upper slope appear less important in contrast tide only experiments without stratification show that tidal simulation quality is linked with accurately representing the shelf bathymetry which favours terrain following systems the experiments support transitioning the vertical coordinates across the shelfbreak using either a mes or hybrid s z approach as a flexible route to improving accuracy in regional and global models keywords vertical coordinates case study realistic ocean model shelf seas nemo pressure gradient error

coordinate system for an ocean model yet it has been argued that the vertical coordinates are the single most important configuration option because they steer the representation of modelled processes griffies 2004 a significant factor is the effect on the model s representation of processes at regions of steeply sloping bathymetry such as at the continental slope which can be important in terms of transports and dissipation e g zhai et al 2010 marsh et al 2017 dukhovskoy et al 2006 desbruyères et al 2020 the vertical coordinates are particularly important for shelf sea models where there is a need to accurately represent shallow water dynamics as well as include the adjacent deeper off shelf regions in such situations the vertical coordinates play an important role in how on and off shelf processes are represented and therefore in some sense how the shelf seas are forced via cross shelf exchange huthnance 1995 brink 2016 the three main coordinate options are i vertical coordinates defined by depth giving horizontally uniform z levels ii terrain following sigma coordinates following the bottom topography iii coordinates that follow isopycnals each has their strengths and weaknesses and it can be possible to hybridise the coordinates in order to obtain reasonable compromises hybridisation as well as the need to specify parameters that control properties such as the vertical spacing of the computational surfaces stretching quickly turns the choice of vertical coordinates into a non trivial exercise the purpose of this paper is to create a useful case study of how certain classes of vertical coordinates perform in a realistic shelf model we will compare the performance of different vertical coordinate options in a nemo nucleus for european modelling of the ocean https www nemo ocean eu shelf seas model of the northwest european shelf using a hierarchy of experiments idealised realistic tide only in z level coordinates the discretisation of depth is horizontally uniform which means that the bottom topography is represented by steps that can result in overstating local depth gradients furthermore the number of computational levels effectively decreases over shallower bathymetry the step like representation of the bottom topography and restricted vertical resolution have been found to negatively affect the representation of down slope density driven currents in the bottom boundary layer in both idealised ezer and mellor 2004 bruciaferri et al 2018 and realistic shapiro et al 2013 models the cascading of dense shelf water down the continental slope is an example of a density driven flow that contributes to shelf ocean exchange luneva et al 2020 although the larger scale significance of intermittent cascading is hard to quantify ivanov et al 2004 the representation of bottom topography at ocean boundaries is also important for the simulation of ocean boundary dynamics such as boundary currents ezer 2016 and boundary waves dukhovskoy et al 2006 wise et al 2020a which can influence coastal sea level wise et al 2018 2020b fukumori et al 2015 calafat et al 2012 and communicate changes in ocean circulation around ocean basins johnson and marshall 2002 roussenov et al 2008 the artificially extreme depth gradients found in z level models can be reduced though not removed by introducing partial steps in the bottom cells pacanowski and gnanadesikan 1998 it is possible to define an arbitrary vertical coordinate s s x y z t where x y z are the spatial coordinates and t is the temporal coordinate with the restriction that s is a monotonic function of height above the sea surface z the primitive equations can then be transformed into the x y s t coordinate system s coordinates such that a dependent variable can be described as a function of the new coordinates i e a a x y z x y s t t a particular and common application of this transformation is to allow the spatial variation to fit with the changes in the bottom topography this gives terrain following coordinates that are commonly referred to as sigma σ coordinates i e s σ z h x y where h is the ocean bottom depth terrain following coordinates naturally improve on the noted deficiencies in z level models by representing topographic features more faithfully and they can do so with a coarser overall vertical resolution since computational levels naturally compress where the bathymetry is shallower a well studied problem that arises in numerical models with σ coordinates however is that the hydrostatic pressure gradient is transformed to become the sum of two terms that may be large of comparable magnitude and of opposite sign in finite difference form this can introduce a truncation error haney 1991 beckmann and haidvogel 1993 mellor et al 1994 1998 reducing the hydrostatic pressure gradient hpg error is an active area of research and model development and a range of approaches have been investigated to achieve this including increasing eddy viscosities preconditioning by removing the background stratification interpolation of the density field back onto z levels and various different hpg algorithms and higher order approximations see berntsen and oey 2010 and references therein for further discussion this issue makes clear that in addition to the vertical coordinates affecting the representation of physical processes the accuracy of a numerical model depends on how well the model s numerical schemes cater to the different vertical coordinates haney 1991 originally noted that a sufficient condition for maintaining hydrostatic consistency in a finite difference scheme is 1 σ δ v σ δ h h 1 where h is the bottom depth δ h is the horizontal change in h of adjacent cells σ z h z is height measured from the undisturbed sea surface negative in the direction of the ocean bottom and δ v σ is the vertical grid spacing however since mellor et al 1994 showed that eq 1 and the discretisation error are not strictly aligned the concept of hydrostatic consistency has been considered less helpful a more useful approach was adopted by beckmann and haidvogel 1993 who studied the local error due to the hpg error by defining a slope parameter that is the ratio of the slope of the computational surface and the mean local bottom depth h defining the slope parameter r by 2 r δ h 2 h gives 0 r 1 with the error tending to zero as r 0 to limit the truncation error a restriction on the maximum allowable slope parameter r m a x can be imposed such that r r m a x following dukhovskoy et al 2009 we refer to such coordinate systems as vanishing quasi sigma vqs coordinates since the computational levels are no longer strictly terrain following as described in o dea et al 2012 this can be achieved by creating a smoothed version of the bathymetry with the restriction that r r m a x by deepening relative to the real bathymetry the terrain following coordinate system is then generated based on this new smoothed bathymetry surface envelope and the grid cells that are deeper than the true bathymetry are masked for example see the zonal cross section of the vertical coordinates in fig 1a a disadvantage of this approach is that vertical resolution can be reduced on the continental shelf and slope in addition a saw tooth representation of the bottom can be created when there is a jump in the number of active levels between adjacent points e g see inset panel in fig 1b this in cropping of sigma layers into the topography potentially provides a physical barrier to any downslope flow bruciaferri et al 2018 2020 allowed for the definition of a spatially varying r m a x by introducing multiple arbitrarily defined surfaces envelopes which vertically divide the ocean domain into sets of levels each potentially possessing an individual 2d varying r m a x parameter envelopes can also be optimised according to other criteria these coordinate systems have been referred to as multi envelope s coordinates mes and an aspect that will be explored in this paper is their flexibility to allow a stricter smaller r m a x to be applied on the continental slope and a less strict larger r m a x on the shelf in both z and σ like coordinates the computational levels are in general misaligned with density surfaces isopycnals this misalignment introduces spurious diapycnal mixing via the numerical diffusion that accompanies advection of the tracer fields over steep topography this misalignment can be more extreme in terrain following coordinates griffies et al 2000 furthermore a spurious circulation can be generated in terrain following coordinates as this mixing can reinforce horizontal density gradients in z level models the same gradients tend to be weakened these issues are removed in isopycnic models where the vertical coordinate surfaces follow isopycnals although this in itself creates complications in representing water masses that are well mixed griffies 2004 at the time of writing isopycnic coordinates are not an option in nemo for our experiments we use nemo version 4 0 2 and the 7 km horizontal resolution 51 level atlantic margin model amm7 which is a shelf model spanning the northwest european shelf a version of this configuration is used as part of the uk met office s operational forecasting capabilities for the northwest european shelf o dea et al 2017 and is developed by both the national oceanography centre and the met office through the joint marine modelling programme the met office s operational model uses vqs vertical coordinates with a constant r m a x parameter that as of version co6 coastal ocean version 6 is relatively large i e weak restriction on the slope of computational surfaces we will compare the performance of the model using the current co6 vertical coordinates against 8 other vertical coordinates described in detail in the next section but encompassing i smaller r m a x ii variable r m a x via the mes coordinates iii different stretching functions iv s z hybridisation and v z level with partial steps our focus is on the coordinates effect on overall model accuracy and this implicitly includes the overall effect of the coordinates on the model s numerical approximations in addition to the effect of the coordinates on representing physical processes as part of the joint marine modelling programme this case study will help inform future development of the vertical coordinate system used in the operational 1 5 km atlantic margin model amm15 graham et al 2018 tonani et al 2019 in the following section we describe the vertical coordinates in detail and the core of the model we then discuss the experiments unforced multi year realistically forced tide only and results and follow with a summary and conclusion 2 model and vertical coordinates 2 1 vertical coordinate configurations nine configurations of a 51 level vertical coordinate system are used in our experiments a vertical zonal plot of each is given in figs 1 3 transect in fig 4 denotes location showing the vertical maximum of r eq 2 for each vertical column the configurations are described below and summarised in table 1 2 1 1 vanishing quasi sigma vqs coordinates configurations 1 3 sf r24 sf r10 sh r10 use vqs coordinates that are generated by creating a smoothed version of the bathymetry with a restriction on the slope parameter r such that r r m a x the coordinates are then generated based on this new smoothed bathymetry envelope and then the grid cells that are deeper than the true bathymetry are masked out this last step ensures that the bathymetry has not been smoothed configuration sf r24 fig 1a is the current amm7 co6 configuration and uses r m a x 0 24 an r m a x parameter of 0 24 is relatively large and allows computational surfaces to closely follow the terrain the vertical distribution of levels is defined by the siddorn and furner 2013 sf stretching equation configuration sf r10 fig 1b is the same as configuration sf r24 with the exception that r m a x 0 10 hence computational slopes are generally flatter on the slope and shelf however there is reduced vertical resolution as well as more saw toothing layers that in crop into the bottom topography configuration sh r10 fig 1c is the same as configuration sf r10 but with the vertical distribution of levels defined by the song and haidvogel 1994 sh stretching formulation the siddorn and furner 2013 stretched configuration sf r10 typically gives flatter surfaces while the song and haidvogel 1994 stretched configuration sh r10 exhibits a finer resolution at the bed on the mid slope where the levels are steepest note that parameters can be modified in the siddorn and furner 2013 formulation to increase resolution at the bed 2 1 2 multi envelope s coordinates configurations 4 5 mes r24 07 mes r10 07 use mes coordinates employing two envelopes note that the pink dashed lines in figs 2a b indicate the transition between envelopes in configuration mes r24 07 fig 2a the upper envelope has maximum depth of 250 m and is generated by smoothing the actual bathymetry 250 m with the martinho and batteen 2006 smoothing algorithm with r m a x 0 24 the deeper envelope is a smoothed version of the actual bathymetry with minimum depth of 250 m and using r m a x 0 07 in the case of the deeper envelope an r m a x 0 04 has also been applied to specific grid points where horizontal pressure gradient errors were larger than 0 1 m s in a tuning phase the upper part of the domain is discretised using 25 vqs levels stretched via the siddorn and furner 2013 formulation while the deeper part of the domain consist of 26 vqs levels distributed to ensure continuity of the jacobian of the vertical coordinate transformation see bruciaferri et al 2018 for details this configuration has the same r m a x as configuration sf r24 on the shelf but a lower r m a x on the slope configuration mes r10 07 fig 2b is the same as mes r24 07 except that the upper envelope is constrained by an r m a x 0 10 the same as sf r10 and sh r10 which enables us to isolate the effect of r m a x on the shelf and at the shelfbreak 2 1 3 s z hybrid and z level coordinates configurations 6 8 sz r10 s26 sz r24 s21 sz r10 s21 use hybrid s z coordinates and configuration 9 zp uses z levels with partial steps configuration sz r10 s26 fig 2c uses hybrid s z coordinates where the bottom 25 levels are z level with partial steps and the upper 26 levels approximately upper 490 m are vqs with an r m a x 0 10 the s z coordinates employ vertical stretching using a double tanh function based on madec and imbard 1996 in the z levels transitioning to pure sigma all layers of equal thickness in shallow waters configuration sz r24 s21 fig 3a also uses hybrid s z coordinates but here the bottom 30 levels are z level with partial steps and the upper 21 levels approximately upper 225 m are vqs with an r m a x 0 24 configuration sz r10 s21 fig 3b is the same as sz r24 s21 but using an r m a x 0 10 contrasting the performance of configurations sz r24 s21 and sz r10 s21 will again test the sensitivity to r m a x on the shelf and at the shelfbreak contrasting the performance of configurations sz r10 s26 and sz r10 s21 will test the sensitivity to the number of s levels just below the shelfbreak the comparison of the mes and s z hybrid configurations allows us to quantify the effect of gently sloping computational surfaces on the continental slope finally configuration zp fig 3c uses z levels with partial steps and the same double tanh stretching used in the z level portions of the s z hybrid configurations which concentrates resolution towards the surface 2 1 4 discussion and summary with these nine configurations summarised in table 1 we are able to investigate a number of permutations i the vqs coordinates with different r m a x allow us to examine the effect of restricting the tilt of computational surfaces at all depths ii the mes coordinates allow us to examine the effect of r m a x individually on the continental shelf and slope iii the s z coordinates allow us to examine the effect of z levels with partial steps below the shelfbreak iv the z level with partial steps allows us to contrast sigma and z levels on the shelf v the different stretching options allow us to compare the effect of vertical resolution fig 4 shows the vertical resolution of the nine configurations at points on the shelf at the shelfbreak and in the deep ocean the sf r24 sf r10 and sh r10 configurations have notably higher resolution on the shelf than the other configurations however comparing them against one another makes clear the effect that different stretching formulations and r m a x have on vertical resolution the siddorn and furner 2013 stretching sf r24 sf r10 has in general a more uniform cell thickness throughout the water column with smaller thicknesses in the upper and lower levels a more uniform surface layer may give more consistent air sea fluxes however the song and haidvogel 1994 stretching sh r10 has thinner cells around 2500 m depth compared to the siddorn and furner 2013 formulation which we see from fig 1c appears to give increased resolution just above the mid region of the continental slope on the shelf the mes s z and zp configurations have lower resolution this is more pronounced in the lower half of the water column for the s z and zp configurations this is also the case at the shelf break from figs 1 3 it is clear that the trade off for increased resolution is greater potential for hpg errors with the sf r24 and zp configurations at opposite extremes this is particularly notable from the mid continental slope region upwards onto the shelfbreak the mes and s z configurations can be thought of as compromises of varying degrees between these two extremes indeed this is the general basis for the presented ordering of the configurations bottom boundary processes which can have vertical scales smaller than in the interior ocean have been demonstrated to be particularly sensitive to vertical resolution in experiments investigating the effect of resolution on gravity currents down a slope it has been shown that increased resolution in the ekman layer improves representation of dense water cascades laanaia et al 2010 wobus et al 2011 laanaia et al 2010 showed that when applying a no slip bottom condition realistic gravity current dynamics could be captured with 3 computational surfaces in the bottom 40 m whereas a single surface resulted in a reduced descent rate finer resolution in the bottom 40 m 200 m range improved performance but to a lesser degree berntsen et al 2018 showed that the application of a quadratic drag law friction parameterisation and law of the wall scaled drag coefficient gave good representation of ekman drainage and spiral with 4 to 5 grid cells in the bottom ekman layer while our focus is necessarily on overall model performance clearly bottom boundary processes are an important consideration for processes such as ekman transport off shelf and the associated downwelling circulation huthnance et al 2009 that can connect shelf ocean carbon exchange holt et al 2009 panel c in fig 4 shows that the sf r24 configuration has a resolution at the bottom of less than 10 m at 300 m bathymetry with finer resolution at 200 m bathymetry fig 1 panel a shows that increased resolution in the ekman layer is maintained on the upper slope from there the resolution will typically reduce in the bottom as the number of overall levels becomes a limitation the mes configurations also have about 3 layers in the bottom 40 m at 300 m depth more at shallower depth the other configurations typically either have 2 or 1 layers while even the sf r24 configuration has reduced bottom resolution a great depth our ensemble does include a range of resolution characteristics including in the bottom boundary region 2 2 model description the amm7 regional configuration of nemo encompasses the north west european shelf and at the time of writing the met office s operational version uses nemo version 3 6 as part of the transition to version 4 madec and nemo system team a review of the vertical coordinates has taken place and we therefore use nemo version 4 0 2 before moving on to describe the specific configurations used for the individual experiments we will first outline the core model set up which is based on o dea et al 2017 the curvilinear horizontal grid extends from 20 w 40 n to 13 e 65 n and has a meridional resolution of 7 4 km and a zonal resolution that varies from 9 4 km along the southern boundary to 5 2 km along the northern boundary with a 7 4 km mean the bottom topography uses bathymetry derived from the north west european shelf operational oceanographic system noos which is a modified gebco 1 arcmin dataset the bathymetry fig 4a extends to a maximum depth of order 5000 m to the south west the model employs a non linear split explicit free surface with variable volume layers and a 10 s barotropic and a 300 s baroclinic time step for momentum lateral viscosity is applied with a bilaplacian operator along computational levels with a coefficient of 1010 m4 s note that for an idealised two layer reduced gravity system the internal rossby radius on the nw european shelf would be in the region of 2 5 km holt and proctor 2008 and as such would not be resolved the vertical diffusion is via the generic length scale scheme with neumann conditions at the boundaries and a quadratic friction parameterisation is applied with law of the wall scaled drag coefficient the coriolis and momentum advection terms are computed using the vector invariant formulation with the enstrophy and energy conserving een scheme finally the nemo specific prj option is used for the hydrostatic pressure gradient scheme this uses a cubic spline to reconstruct the density with a subsequent analytical integration to calculate the pressure and pressure jacobian method to obtain the horizontal gradient it should be emphasised that this is a nemo specific option and as such conclusions drawn in this paper are limited to that scope since it is not clear how the specifics of the numerical scheme transfer to other models for tracers lateral diffusion is applied with a geopotential laplacian operator with a coefficient of 50 m2 s vertical diffusion is via the generic length scale scheme advection is applied with an fct scheme that is 4th order in the horizontal and 2nd order in the vertical the eos80 equation of state is used supporting code and configuration files used in the experiments can be found in the software repository wise et al 2021 3 experiments and results 3 1 unforced hydrostatic pressure gradient experiment as a first step we compare the different vertical coordinate configurations in an unforced experiment where the model is run from a state of no motion without boundary forcing closed lateral boundaries and with a horizontally uniform density field with no diffusion on the tracer fields there should be no evolution the smagorinsky scheme is used for lateral viscosity this classic experiment has been used to investigate spurious mixing and currents produced as a result of the truncation error in the hydrostatic pressure gradient calculation discussed in the introduction e g beckmann and haidvogel 1993 mellor et al 1998 siddorn and furner 2013 for the initial temperature and salinity we first tried four different climatologies that were representative of the on shelf and off shelf stratification for both summer and winter see fig 5 using each of these four different scenarios in an unforced model run using the sf r24 configuration we found that the summertime off shelf temperature and salinity profiles produced the largest spurious velocities in order to capture the largest errors we have used these summertime off shelf temperature and salinity profiles in the experiments in this section fig 6 shows the domain maximum velocity generated with the different vertical coordinates it shows significant spurious maximum velocities for the vqs coordinates that use a single value of the r m a x parameter configs sf r24 sf r10 sh r10 the maximum absolute error is close to 1 m s for the sf r24 configuration which constrains the slope of the computational levels the least the sf r10 configuration shows that tightening this restriction reduces the maximum absolute error to 40 cm s comparing the sf r10 and sh r10 configurations shows that the error with the siddorn and furner 2013 stretching is approximately 15 larger 5 cm s than the error with the song and haidvogel 1994 stretching this suggests that the increased vertical resolution over the mid region of the continental slope produced by the song and haidvogel 1994 stretching might help limit the error the mes hybrid s z and z level with partial stepping configurations perform significantly better the mes configurations both have maximum errors at the end of the experiment of 0 07 cm s with the change in r m a x in the upper 250 m making little difference the differences between the vqs sf r24 sf r10 sh r10 and multi envelope mes r24 07 mes r10 07 configurations suggests that constraining the tilt of the computational levels on the continental slope improves performance at least in the idealised case this is further supported by the hybrid s z configurations sz r10 s26 sz r24 s21 sz r10 s21 the spurious velocities for the configurations employing partial step z levels are a further order of magnitude smaller except for the sz r24 s21 configuration the hybrid case where the terrain following upper 21 computational levels are allowed to slope to a greater extent where the maximum velocities are comparable to the mes configurations the fact that the sz r24 s21 configuration produces errors an order of magnitude larger than the sz r10 s21 configuration suggests that at least some of the errors are produced on shelf or at the shelf break although clearly it is the sloping of the levels on the continental slope that are having the largest impact vertical resolution on the shelf does not appear to affect the error to leading order this can be seen more clearly in figs 7 and 8 which show maps of the depth averaged horizontal kinetic energy at days 10 and 30 respectively the white line denotes the 200 m isobath firstly both figures show that there is relatively large spurious kinetic energy in the vqs configurations while the errors are present both on and off shelf it is evident that the erroneous energy is largest on the continental slope secondly the figures show that the kinetic energy spreads spatially in time hence while the growth in the maximum velocities stops or slows the velocity errors also disperse such that the domain wide kinetic energy continues to increase as shown in fig 9a the kinetic energy can apparently disperse and grow because the errors in the hydrostatic pressure gradient calculation perturb the tracer fields which then drive velocities that do not decay at least on the time scale considered here we note for example that running the sf r24 configuration without tracer advection produces a smaller maximum velocity error that is less noisy fig 9b shows the magnitude of the temperature trend due to advection volume averaged over the domain it shows that the temperature field is evolving fig 9c shows that there is an associated geostrophic flow that is larger in the configurations that produce larger temperature transport typically this process has been labelled as a sigma error of the second kind sesk defined by a vorticity error mellor et al 1998 berntsen 2002 concluded that large viscosities unavailable to realistic ocean models are required to prevent these errors from growing they describe a situation where the error in vorticity produces continuous vertical exchange of water masses light water downward producing large real pressure gradient errors that may be more important than the initial erroneous pressure gradient error in driving a geostrophic flow berntsen 2002 also notes however that for any given model setup it is difficult to rule out other errors or limitations present in the model for example the advection or pressure gradient schemes used that may have a contributing effect in any case the relationship between the velocity and hydrostatic pressure gradient can be considered via the depth integrated momentum equations where 3 u h 0 u d z h 0 v d z is the depth integrated velocity for hydrostatic pressure p z 0 ρ g d z where ρ is density and g the gravity constant the relationship is 4 f k u 1 ρ 0 h 0 p d

pressure z h and k is the vertical unit vector the horizontal derivative operator h the bottom depth z the negative depth and ρ 0 the reference density hence the spurious potential energy can be transformed into kinetic energy and dispersed throughout the domain in summary the magnitude of the error increases as computational surfaces are allowed to slope relative to the geopotential surfaces these errors can be large particularly on the continental slope and are associated with large advective transports perturbing the density field as a consequence the configurations using z levels on the continental slope sz r10 s26 sz r24 s21 sz r10 s21 zp perform the best with the mes configurations mes r24 07 mes r10 07 performing better than the vqs configurations sf r24 sf r10 sh r10 constraining the tilting of the surfaces on the shelf can also reduce the errors but to a lesser degree since the bottom topography on the shelf is usually less steep the sensitivity of the simulations to the tilt of the computational surfaces suggests that there is an opportunity for the implementation of different hpg schemes to reduce this sensitivity e g shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2003 berntsen and oey 2010 berntsen 2011 berntsen et al 2015 sensitivity testing to the configuration of momentum diffusion used did show however that the relative performance of the experiments with the different vertical coordinates was robust to different mixing setups while the unforced experiments in this section highlight an important issue with the sloping of computational levels and suggest the mechanism by which it manifests the results should be taken alongside more realistically forced experiments one limitation of the unforced experiments is that they assume that density contours are horizontal which in reality is not the case this should be advantageous to the z level coordinates a second weakness of the unforced experiments is that due to the nonlinear evolution of the tracer fields which clearly have an important effect on the spurious velocities via the nonlinear equation of state it is difficult to assess what changes realistic forcing of tracers and momentum will have it is therefore problematic to assume that the spurious velocities can simply be superimposed over a real climatology of the velocity field in section 3 2 we use a realistically forced model to diagnose differences between the vertical coordinates via differences in the modelled temperature and salinity fields to observations and contextualise with the results from these unforced experiments 3 2 forced in this section we investigate whether the anomalies produced in the idealised setups are evident in a model with more realistic tracer fields and boundary forcing in the following experiments the model for each vertical coordinate setup is initialised and forced at the boundaries with reanalysis data and run from 2005 up to and including 2015 3 2 1 forcing and initialisation the model is initialised at the beginning of 2005 and is run with forcing applied at the lateral boundaries the atmospheric interface and with river run off along the land interface tidal forcing is also applied the era5 dataset hersbach et al 2018 is used to provide hourly atmospheric surface forcing fluxes for the humidity precipitation long and short wave radiation snowfall air temperature wind velocities and pressure using the core 3 5 bulk formulation monthly diffuse attenuation coefficient data for downwelling irradiance at 490 nm are supplied with constant chlorophyll concentration the daily river discharge timeseries are produced from an updated version of the river dataset used in lenhart et al 2010 combined with climatology of daily discharge data from the global river discharge data base vörösmarty et al 2000 and from data prepared by the centre for ecology and hydrology as used by young and holt 2007 the river runoff forcing frequency is daily and it is distributed throughout the water column for the tides 15 constituents are calculated from a tidal model of the northeast atlantic flather 1981 and applied at open lateral boundaries as the depth mean velocity and sea surface height for the lateral boundaries the flather radiation scheme is applied to the barotropic velocities and a zero gradient condition is applied to the normal baroclinic velocities the global seasonal forecast system glosea version 5 dataset maclachlan et al 2015 is used for the ocean lateral boundary conditions with the flow relaxation scheme applied to the tracers 3 2 2 analysis approach to assess the performance of the different vertical coordinates we compare the monthly model output against the en4 en 4 2 1 d l 19 jan 21 observational dataset good et al 2013 of quality controlled subsurface ocean profiles for temperature and salinity over the 10 year period 2006 2015 note our aim here is to compare the different set ups rather than fine tune the model the tracer fields are a good comparison benchmark because the en4 dataset provides a large observational dataset with a spread both in depth and horizontally across the entire domain see fig 10 for profile locations the en4 dataset includes depth profiles of salinity and temperature observations each profile p is located at a specific longitude and latitude and has k p observations at different depths such that k p 1 2 k p denotes an individual observation where subscript p 1 2 n denotes the profile of which there are n the en4 dataset groups profiles by their year and month to produce the model observation difference anomalies we first perform a nearest neighbour interpolation of the relevant monthly averaged model fields to each observation profile we then interpolate the model vertically to the observation depths and finally take the difference the set of salinity and temperature difference anomalies for all the profiles p are therefore defined by 9 s s p k p m o d s p k p o b s 10 t t p k p m o d t p k p o b s in order to highlight possible depth sampling biases we also define sets of depth averaged difference anomalies 11 s p r o f i l e 1 k p k p s p k p m o d s p k p o b s 12 t p r o f i l e 1 k p k p t p k p m o d t p k p o b s it should be acknowledged that there will be spatial and temporal uncertainties in any such analysis however by comparing the model tracer fields against over ten million observations covering a range of depths around the domain we obtain difference anomaly distributions that present a broad picture of how the vertical coordinates affect long term performance given the temporal and spatial non uniformity of instantaneous observations this is a pragmatic choice for assessing long term relative performance and a similar approach has been adopted in graham et al 2018 o dea et al 2017 3 2 3 results and discussion fig 11 shows the distributions of the difference anomalies for the entire domain over the entire 10 year period as boxplots the red line denotes the median the central box extends from the 25th to 75th percentiles and the lines extend from the 5th to the 95th percentiles there is an overall fresh and cool bias that is consistent across the experiments with all vertical coordinates that can typically be attributed to the forcing datasets used as well as physics options chosen for example see o dea et al 2017 for discussion of amm7 biases from a comparative point of view however there is a clear divergence between the configurations into broadly two categories the vqs configurations with a single r m a x parameter value have larger biases than the others and exhibit greater variability about the median this is an initial indication that the errors resulting from the hydrostatic pressure gradient errors seen in the unforced experiments section 3 1 might be important in the realistic models as well note also that the distributions have a skew and long tails which is a possible indication of the uncertainties in the individual difference anomalies since large errors can undesirably influence the mean and standard deviation of the sample we will also use the median in our diagnostics fig 12 shows the salinity and temperature difference anomalies aggregated over the entire domain for the entire 10 years giving an overall measure of relative performance panels 12 a and 12 b plot the mean absolute error and median absolute error against the standard deviation for the salinity defined by eq 9 both metrics show that sf r24 produces the largest difference and that sf r10 and sh r10 both give improvements the song and haidvogel 1994 stretching also appears to perform favourably against the siddorn and furner 2013 stretching these results are consistent with the unforced experiment results the zp s z and mes configurations all result in a further reduction in errors with the mes r10 07 configuration also reducing variability about the mean error the similarity between the mes r10 07 and mes r24 07 configuration and between the sz r10 21 and sz r24 21 configurations suggests that it is primarily on the continental slope where the sloping of computational levels becomes an issue panels 12c and 12d show the same metrics for the case where the difference anomalies have first been averaged for each profile as defined in eqs 11 and 12 respectively here we see a similar result in terms of absolute errors but there is a notable increase in variability in the configurations using z levels the difference between the mes and s z zp configurations in the mean and median metrics shows that the s z zp models have very slightly smaller typical absolute errors but larger variability such that they perform slightly worse as measured by the mean absolute error panels 12 e 12 h show the same results for temperature the picture presented is very similar to that of salinity with the least constrained sf r24 configuration showing the most variability and largest errors and the s z and mes showing the best performance with the sf r10 and sh r10 somewhere in between the same metrics applied to the profile averages panels 12g 12h give a very consistent picture the domain aggregated results from the reanalysis forced experiments qualitatively follow those of the unforced experiments this suggests that the hydrostatic pressure gradient error at steeply sloping bottom topography primarily off shelf on the continental slope when considered over the entire domain might dominate the potential benefits of the improved representation of near bottom processes such as dense water overflows this point in particular is highlighted by the strong performance of the zp configuration compared to the sf r24 sf r10 and sh r10 configurations indeed the difference anomalies for the zp configuration are similar to the more sophisticated s z and mes configurations that vary the constraint on computational slope to get the best of both z like and terrain following coordinates the greatest departure from the unforced experiment results is the performance of the mes configurations relative to the zp and s z configurations in the unforced experiments the spurious kinetic energy for the mes configuration is orders of magnitude larger than for the zp and s z configurations yet in the forced experiments the configurations have comparable absolute errors there are at least two interpretations of this difference firstly that the mes configuration is more closely aligned with realistic tracer contours resulting in smaller errors and secondly that the hydrostatic pressure gradient errors are small enough compared with the evolution driven by the boundary forcing that they become less important relative to the benefits of terrain following coordinates in terms of capturing near bottom processes in either case it demonstrates that tuning of terrain following coordinates using multiple envelopes can produce vastly improved results despite the marginal effect of constraining the computational slopes on the shelf i e above the continental slope it can be seen that the errors originating on the continental slope coincide with errors on the shelf this can be shown by looking at the difference anomalies on the outer shelf region denoted os in fig 13 as a function of depth fig 14 shows the set of difference anomalies defined by 9 and 10 horizontally averaged for the seasonal climatologies december february djf and june august jja for the outer shelf region denoted os in fig 13 for both salinity and temperature and both seasons there is a clear clustering of the bias anomalies for the mes s z and zp configurations which are also relatively consistent with depth the sf r24 anomaly by contrast has a large fresh and cool bias at the bed which decreases towards the surface tending towards the main cluster this is a strong indication that the errors seen in the unforced experiments remain important not only on the continental slope but also at the shelf break influencing processes in the lower half of the water column on the outershelf the same can be seen to a lesser extent in the biases of both the sf r10 and sh r10 configurations a similar picture emerges in the north sea and norwegian trench regions not shown regions ns and nt in fig 13 in the english channel southern north sea region denoted ec in fig 13 where there is no direct connection to the shelfbreak the horizontally averaged difference anomalies for the seasonal climatologies djf and jja present a different picture fig 15 in this shallow region the vqs coordinate systems perform best notably for salinity the main difference may be due to the higher vertical resolution of the sf r24 sf r10 and sh r10 configurations on the shelf this might be an important detail for an improved representation of the seasonal pycnocline in shallow regions for example the above aggregated results can be put into context by looking at how the different configurations represent water mass properties across the shelf slope and deep ocean the shetland faroe channel is a challenging test case because there are a number of water masses present that originate at a range of depths fig 16 based on figs 1 3 and 1 4 in hughes et al 2006 is a schematic representation of the water mass circulation and vertical structure in the shetland faroe channel based on long term observations the temperature and salinity ranges defining the water masses are given in table 2 and represent typical properties of the different water masses hansen and østerhus 2000 hughes et al 2006 there are five water masses defined starting from the deepest the norwegian sea deep water nsdw is the coolest the norwegian sea arctic intermediate water nsaiw is slightly warmer and slightly fresher the modified east icelandic water meiw is the freshest the modified north atlantic water mnaw is cooler and fresher than the north atlantic water naw which is the warmest and saltiest and is part of the upper slope current in the channel using the average of the monthly mean temperature and salinity model data over the 10 years 2006 2015 fig 17 shows the five water masses across the transect shown in fig 16a for the 9 model configurations the temperature and salinity ranges are defined in table 2 to represent the water masses in the model the ranges are in some cases slightly extended compared to those used in the schematic to be more continuous in particular the temperature range to define the mnaw must extend to be significantly cooler to include the waters just above the meiw while this is partly due to model bias generally too fresh and cool this is also because there will be a degree of mixing between the water masses which can have very different properties that may not be reflected in a schematic representation the black unassigned areas denote mixed regions that are outside the defined ranges of the five water masses overall the zp sz and mes models do a good job at capturing the structure of the different water masses a comparison with the vqs coordinates which struggle to capture the opposite extremes of the naw and nsdw shows that the vertical coordinates are making a significant difference this is consistent with the more extreme fresh and cool biases seen with the vqs configurations in the lower half of the water column in the outer shelf region in fig 14 to demonstrate the relationship between the on shelf tracer errors and the pressure gradient errors due to the vertical coordinates on the continental slope more explicitly we consider the rate of change of the salinity and temperature fields due to advection at the shelfbreak this is important because in section 3 1 it was shown that the error induced by the steeply sloping vertical coordinates manifests via the nonlinear coupling between the hydrostatic pressure gradient and the transfer of heat and salt characterised by increased advection of the tracers i e fig 9 we consider the advection of the tracers at the shelfbreak which is defined as the 200 m contour between the points 48n 7 5 w and 61n 0 5e this contour is adjacent to the outer shelf region as denoted in fig 13 advection at the shelfbreak is quantified in three steps i take the magnitude of tracer advection at the shelfbreak ii depth average this iii take the median in formal terms the salinity and temperature advection in the i j k directions are s u and t u where is the derivative operator in the i j k directions and u is the velocity vector u v w we use the 10 yr time averages 2006 2015 of the tracer advection denoted by s u and t u taking the magnitude and depth averaging gives 13 s a d v 1 h h 0 s u 2 d z 14 t a d v 1 h h 0 t u 2 d z where h is the bottom depth along the contour to represent the typical values of s a d v and t a d v we take the median denoted by fig 18 shows this typical advective transport of the tracers at the shelf break s a d v and t a d v plotted against the median absolute error in the tracer fields in the outer shelf region region denoted os in fig 13 the black dashed line is the linear best fit the four panels show an approximately linear relationship between the median absolute error and the magnitude of advective transport at the shelfbreak it was shown in the unforced experiments in section 3 1 that a larger slope parameter r m a x on the continental slope was associated with a larger magnitude domain averaged temperature advection fig 18 shows that this is also partially the case in the realistic runs the magnitude of the advective transport at the shelfbreak for the s z and zp configurations is very similar to the mes configurations which have an r m a x of either 0 04 or 0 07 on the continental slope this suggests that the hpg error in the mes configurations is not a leading order effect in the realistically forced experiment however we see that an r m a x on the continental slope that is larger than 0 07 is associated with an increase in advective transport in the realistically forced experiments hence for 0 07 r m a x 0 24 on the continental slope the results suggest that the errors in the tracer fields on the outer shelf are connected to larger advective transports at the shelfbreak which in the unforced experiments were associated with the hpg error due to the larger r m a x on the continental slope this relationship breaks down for r m a x 0 07 on the continental slope suggesting that this is close to a critical value where the hpg error becomes small enough so as not to be of leading order in a realistically forced model we note that in preliminary testing we used untuned mes configurations with r m a x 0 07 everywhere in the lower envelope and that the error in the tracer fields was larger than when using the tuned mes configurations with r m a x 0 07 or r m a x 0 04 in the lower envelope the errors were however still smaller than those produced by the r m a x 0 10 configurations which further supports the interpretation above to summarise the realistically forced runs broadly support the theme of the results of the unforced hydrostatic pressure gradient experiments the erroneous velocity dominates the benefits of the terrain following coordinates but importantly only in cases where the slope of the computational levels are allowed to deviate from the horizontal too much over the continental slope i e where the slope parameter is larger than 0 07 on the continental slope in fact in some locations it should be restricted even further i e fine tuning the most sensitive grids points with a smaller r m a x as was done with the mes configurations these errors seem to penetrate across the shelfbreak onto the shelf but the effect of restricting the slope parameter on the shelf itself appears far smaller the fact that the mes and s z have comparatively similar results while the sf r10 and sh r10 performed worse suggests that r 0 07 on the continental slope is in the proximity of a general critical value in terms of getting the best out of the vqs coordinates for our nemo shelf model configuration 3 3 tide only higher frequency dynamics are also important for shelf sea model applications such as storm surge and tidal modelling calculation of the surge residuals requires tidal simulation and the quality of the tidal simulation can be a good indication of model performance at these frequencies graham et al 2018 we therefore carry out a tide only experiment to investigate the effect of the vertical coordinates on the tides for this experiment the model is initialised from rest using a constant temperature and salinity of 10 c and 35 psu respectively the tidal forcing 15 constituents is the same as in the forced runs in section 3 2 the simulations are run for two years and a comparison is performed between the harmonic analyses of the model sea surface height ssh output and tide gauges there are 480 tide gauges and they are distributed as in fig 19 here we are interested in the relative performance of the different tidal simulations fig 20 shows the square root of the mean of the squared error rmse against the mean error bias for the m2 and s2 amplitudes and phases where the error is defined as the model minus the tide gauge the results show that performance of the configurations can be separated into four groups that differ by their configurations setups on the shelf and around the shelfbreak the smallest rmse is achieved by those coordinates which allow greater tilting of the computational surfaces on the shelf r m a x 0 24 for approximately upper 250 m sf r24 mes r24 07 sz r24 s21 the next smallest rmse is achieved by those configurations using the hybrid s z or mes coordinates with r m a x 0 10 on the shelf mes r10 07 sz r10 s26 sz r10 s21 the vqs configurations with r m a x 0 10 sf r10 sh r10 have a similar rmse for amplitude but larger rmse for m2 phase finally the zp configuration has the poorest performance in all respects in these experiments the spurious velocities investigated in the previous section do not factor because there is no stratification here the configurations with the most faithful representation of the real bathymetry on the shelf r m a x 0 24 perform the best the three configurations with r m a x 0 24 on the shelf have different vertical resolutions on the shelf and different representations of the bottom topography on the continental slope yet they all have a similar rmse and bias in shallow regions the bottom topography is an important factor affecting wave propagation and this appears to be the most important determinant of tidal simulation accuracy tested by our experiments the difference between the s z and mes group using r m a x 0 10 on the shelf and the sf r10 sh r10 group all these configurations have r m a x 0 10 on the shelf is that the latter group of configurations have a notable saw tooth representation of the bottom topography on the shelf which appears to degrade tidal simulation note that the s z and mes configurations avoid the saw toothing because more of their computational surfaces vanish beneath the bottom topography on the continental slope where the r m a x 0 07 in this sense the setup below the shelfbreak remains important it is consistent with the analysis above that the zp configuration should perform worst because it has the least accurate representation of the bottom topography on the shelf as well as a step like representation the results here are important for tidal simulations using a homogeneous ocean however they diverge from the results of the unforced and realistically forced climatological experiments because there can be no hydrostatic pressure gradient error 4 summary and conclusions the vertical coordinates are one of the most important configuration options in an ocean model but they can require a significant investment of resources to optimise here we have compared 9 vertical coordinate configurations by carrying out a hierarchy of experiments using a shelf seas model with realistic bathymetry to create the 9 different vertical coordinate systems we have used 4 different approaches namely vanishing quasi sigma vqs multi envelope s coordinate mes z level with partial steps and hybrid s z level the overarching aim has been to investigate their effect on model accuracy and in the process identify key configuration options in particular we have investigated the importance of allowing the computational surfaces to follow the terrain on the continental slope and shelf and we have looked at the effect of step like and saw tooth representations of the bottom topography we have used the nemo ocean model and the atlantic margin model configuration at 7 km horizontal resolution amm7 for our shelf sea model and while our results are specific to this configuration it is reasonable to expect that they are informative more generally we found that the scale of the error in the classic unforced hydrostatic pressure gradient experiments e g haney 1991 beckmann and haidvogel 1993 mellor et al 1994 with realistic bathymetry gave a reasonable up to a point qualitative indication of relative performance between the nine vertical coordinates when used in a realistically forced climatological simulation and compared against observations of temperature and salinity this is important because as noted originally by haney 1991 while the hydrostatic pressure gradient truncation error in s coordinates can be investigated relatively cheaply it is more difficult to assess the effect of the error on a realistic model this is further complicated when trying to compare against coordinate systems that have different deficiencies e g the step like representation of bathymetry in z level coordinates the tilt of the computational surfaces relative to depth as measured by the slope parameter r eq 2 on the continental slope was found to be the dominant determinant of accuracy down to a critical value of r m a x 0 07 where r m a x is the maximum allowed value of r before computational surfaces vanish beneath the bathymetry allowing the surfaces to closely follow the terrain everywhere as in configuration sf r24 r m a x 0 24 resulted in the generation of spurious velocities of the order of 10s of cm s in the unforced runs and large transports of temperature and salinity in the realistic simulations this coincided with the poorest domain aggregated performance relative to the other configurations increasing the constraint on the tilt of computational surfaces on the continental slope improved the simulation of the domain wide tracer fields an r m a x of 0 10 improved results and an r m a x of 0 07 improved results further by then restricting specific sensitive grid points on the slope further to r m a x 0 04 identified as grid points where large velocities would otherwise form in the unforced experiments in section 3 1 we found very little difference between having partial step z levels on the slope and vqs coordinates via the mes coordinates indeed the mes coordinates produced less error variability and a slightly smaller mean absolute error although the median absolute error was slightly smaller for the s z hybrid coordinates we therefore conclude that an r m a x of approximately 0 04 0 07 on the continental slope is optimal for vqs coordinates in the unforced experiments we found that the magnitude of the spurious flow due to the hydrostatic pressure gradient error was associated with the magnitude of tracer advection in the realistically forced experiments we found that across all nine configurations there is an approximately linear relationship between error of the tracers in the outer shelf region and the typical magnitude of tracer advection at the shelfbreak in the unforced experiments increased tracer advection was associated with increased r m a x on the continental slope this appears to be true in the realistically forced experiments for r m a x 0 07 for r m a x 0 07 it appears that the hpg error becomes small enough so as not to be a leading order effect in the unforced and realistically forced experiments we found a decreased r m a x on the shelf from 0 24 to 0 10 made little difference with the r m a x 0 10 giving perhaps slightly better performance overall we also found that in the case of the s z hybrid coordinates s above z having the upper s levels in the top 490 m 26 levels or top 225 m 21 levels made only a small difference with the latter slightly preferable overall this suggests that the larger errors originate below 490 m although this may be domain specific the tide only experiments primarily highlighted that in homogeneous models of the tides accuracy is improved by vertical coordinates that most closely represent the shelf bathymetry for example the sf r24 mes r24 07 and sz r24 s10 configurations which all allow the coordinates to closely follow the terrain on the shelf performed the best the vqs coordinates in nemo can lead to a saw toothed in cropping of layers representation of bottom topography on the shelf which resulted in a poorer tidal simulation similarly the step like representation of the shelf bathymetry in the zp configuration negatively impacted the solution while the coordinate system used off shelf made little direct difference to the tidal simulation it should be noted that in the vqs system layers that vanish on the continental slope may then reemerge on the shelf resulting in saw toothing these unwanted features can be minimised by either relaxing the r m a x criteria and or defining multiple envelopes or using hybrid s z coordinates on the shelf and slope our experiments show that performance gains can be made by defining different vqs setups on the continental shelf and slope transitioning at approximately 250 m depth with an r m a x 0 07 applied on the continental slope via the multi envelope approach or by hybridising vqs coordinates above partial step z levels the multi envelope approach offers flexibility for greater tuning to a specific domain while the hybrid s z is perhaps simpler there appears to be insensitivity to the precise depth location of the transition between coordinates providing it is not deeper than the typical upper slope 400 m which means that this approach is well suited to many different types of model domain e g global and regional this case study has involved the use of a regional model at a fixed 7 km horizontal resolution and we expect that optimal parameter values will also depend on the model resolution and the geographic region being modelled such dependencies are possible avenues of future research furthermore there is value in more specific process oriented studies that investigate the effect of the vertical coordinates on cascading and overflows with a realistic shelf sea model e g dependence on near bed resolution as well as exchange at the shelfbreak such investigations will help to inform the refinement of the vertical coordinates in more targeted studies finally we note that hpg algorithms are an active area of research and model development the implementation of different 4th order algorithms for example the 4th order shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2003 method holds the potential to enable a relaxation of the r m a x criteria with possible benefits for the simulation of bottom boundary layers over steep topography credit authorship contribution statement anthony wise
