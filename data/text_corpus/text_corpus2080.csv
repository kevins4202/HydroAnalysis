10400,even though mango productivity in ethiopia is low due to moisture stress there is no report on how such constraint could alleviate using cocoon water saving technology cocoon is small water reservoir technology which uses for plant growth in dry season the objectives of this study were to introduce and evaluate effectiveness of water saving techniques on mango seedlings survival and growth in mihitsab azmati watershed northern ethiopia in this experiment five treatments of water saving techniques with mango seedlings were evaluated these were cocoon sprayed by tricel t1 cocoon painted by used engine oil t2 cocoon without tricel and oil t3 manually irrigated seedlings t4 and mango seedlings planted during rainy season t5 the survival and growth performance of mango seedlings were recorded at six months and one year after transplanting data on plant survival height number of leaves per plant shoot length stem diameter and crown width were subjected to analysis of variance and t test there were significant differences in the treatment effects on mango seedlings transplanted survival plant height number of leaves per plant shoot length stem diameter and crown width measured at six months and one year after transplanting the lowest survival rate 20 was found during both data collection time in t5 six months after transplanting the highest growth parameters were measured from t1 whereas the lowest was from t5 however one year after transplanting the highest growth parameters were measured from t3 plant heights increments between the two measurement periods for t3 t2 t1 t4 and t5 were 45 1 38 5 24 8 9 8 and 7 0 cm respectively indicating that t3 performed better than the other treatments the t test on mean differences between the same growth parameter measured at 12 and six months after transplanting also showed significant differences the cocoon water saving technology was superior in improving mango seedlings survival and growth in the study area this study generalized that cocoon seems promising sustainable and highly scalable with mango seedlings at large scale in the study area conditions however this technology should not be assumed to perform uniformly well in all environmental conditions and with all tree species before demonstrated on a pilot study keywords cocoon water saving technology growth parameter moisture stress mihitsab azmati watershed water saving technique 1 introduction mango mangifera indica l belongs to the plant family anacardiaceae in which it is one of the 73 species in the mangifera genus that are originated in south east asia morton 1987 kosterman and bompard 1993 stangeland 2011 ahmed and mohamed 2015 wei et al 2017 neguse et al 2019 mango is one of the most widely grown fruit crops in the tropical and subtropical regions including in arid and semiarid areas in the presence of appropriate water management practices in developing countries where food and nutritional insecurity are still reported as big challenges mango is considered as the king of the fruits because of its excellent flavor delicious taste and high nutritive values hill 1952 bally et al 2009 ullah et al 2010 vasugi et al 2012 rekhapriyadharshini 2015 neguse et al 2019 as a result mango is one of the most widely grown fruit crops cultivated next to banana in terms of economic importance in ethiopia moreover within the past one decade in ethiopia both area coverage and production of mango has been increased by 208 and 247 respectively under such expansion of mango trees water deficit has been reported as a crucial environmental stress on agricultural productivity and limits the economical development dessalegn et al 2014 fita 2014 wei et al 2017 neguse et al 2019 this indicates the need for water saving technologies in order to reduce the effect of water deficit on agricultural production such as mango farms in the context of this paper water saving technologies are described as tools that may help increase survival and growth of planted seedlings while reducing the need for manual watering while speeding the ecological restoration process kulkarni jaramillo 2015 jaramillo et al 2015a b tapia et al 2019 regardless of the mango crop potential to contribute towards income improvement and nutritional status in ethiopia the national average production yield is 7 ton ha 1 the productivity in the country is very low as compared to the crop potential production 20 30 ton ha 1 griesbach 2003 tiwari and baghel 2014 neguse et al 2019 the low productivity of mango crop in ethiopia is governed by various factors e g water deficit environmental variables management factors or a combination of such variables however there is no report that addresses environmental and management factors that constrained mango growth at the early stage specifically using water saving techniques such as cocoon in degraded areas with arid and semiarid environmental conditions in ethiopia even at global scale there are very few published reports that tested for the contribution of the cocoon water saving technology on survival and growth performance of mango trees seedlings planted on degraded soils and areas with critical water shortage e g kulkarni 2011 jaramillo 2015 tapia et al 2019 the cocoon is a small water reservoir in which water is stored for plant growth in the dry season and thereby eliminating the need for irrigation land life company llc 2015 2016 water deficit moisture stress is the most persistent environmental stress on fruit crops such as mango growth and productivity in which this limits its contribution to improve nutritional status and economic development of a given society population growth coupled with irrigation land use expansion including mango plantation increased pressure on water availability dramatically now and in the future hussen and yimer 2013 wei et al 2017 neguse et al 2019 comparini et al 2020 jaramillo et al 2015 in addition rainfall is characterized by high spatial and temporal variability coupled with severe soil degradation due to soil erosion and nutrient depletion resulted in declined agricultural productivity tamene 2005 tesfahunegn et al 2014 tesfahunegn 2015 tesfahunegn et al 2016 tesfahunegn 2019 ghassemisahebi et al 2020 tesfahunegn and gebru 2020 such conditions challenge the processes how to meet the increasing food demand by the community as the livelihoods of landless youth depend on degraded natural resource base on the steep slope topography this and the worsening climatic conditions aggravate water scarcity problem in arid and semiarid areas of ethiopia it is important to apply the right agricultural practices and agricultural water management systems in order to increase agricultural water productivity of fruit crops möller and assouline 2007 hussen and yimer 2013 wei et al 2017 neguse et al 2019 many watershed management practices soil and water conservation water harvesting and plantation have been implemented for a long time in tigray region northern ethiopia however some promising results on improving income food security water resources for irrigation and vegetation coverage have been reported in this region hussen and yimer 2013 tesfahunegn and gebru 2020 since 70 of the land feature of the tigray region in northern ethiopia is undulating topography and rainfall distribution of the region is mainly for two months july and august with higher runoff and soil loss potential the remaining long dry months are so difficult for the survival of tree seedlings plantation tamene 2005 tesfahunegn et al 2014 2016 tesfahunegn and gebru 2020 in such conditions even though millions of seedlings have been planted every year in the past many decades there are conditions almost all of the seedlings planted died that resulted in poor survival rate and poor growth performance in the northern ethiopia conditions hussen and yimer 2013 abdullah 2017 wei et al 2017 neguse et al 2019 however there is interesting water saving technology such as cocoon which has been successfully implemented globally in the projects across 15 countries in africa only in kenya and south africa results from such cocoon projects globally confirmed seedlings plantation survival rates of 80 95 and significant savings on labor costs and water use in comparison to the traditional land restoration practices reports from such projects have suggested that the cocoon water saving technology could provide a better opportunity for improving seedling survival rate and other plant growth parameters in the arid and semiarid climatic conditions even on areas affiliated with severely degraded land land life company llc 2015 abdullah 2017 cocoon is the only biodegradable water saving technology designed to increase survival and growth of planted seedlings reducing the need for manual and regular irrigation and enhances land restoration process such as improving vegetation cover and soil systems lampayan et al 2004 land life company llc 2015 2016 abdullah 2017 wei et al 2017 tapia et al 2019 the cocoon function by holding water in its storage that surrounds the young plant and feed water to the soil at a slow but constant rate through the capillary action via a short length of rope that connects the water in the cocoon to the soil land life company llc 2015 cocoon is designed to restore dry and deforested land where there is no affordable or maintainable substitute as this enables trees to be planted and grow sustainably the cocoon has a water reservoir storage capacity of 25 l which fills once at a planting stage and then serves the water for the plant for six months this technology is designed to prevent evaporation and weed growth around the base of the seedling land life company llc 2015 abdullah 2017 tapia et al 2019 water is transported from the cocoon reservoir to the tree using wicks in which this protects seedlings from effects of harsh weather conditions and browsing by small animals particularly during its first year land life company llc 2015 abdullah 2017 the increasing water shortage in the arid and semiarid degraded areas is the push factor to investigate the sustainable use of cocoon water saving technology while transplanted tree seedlings the existing reports from the middle east and north africa have indicated that use of cocoon enables for better and successful survival and growth of planted tree seedlings on degraded soils in the arid and semiarid areas than the traditional tree planting system planting with cocoon also helps restoring the top soil nutrients and soil structure as it is 100 biodegradable abdullah 2017 land life company llc 2015 2016 other important advantages of planting using cocoon water saving technology is that it is a low cost needs no follow up and no regular irrigation but enhances the survival rates of planted young seedlings between 75 95 abdullah 2017 land life company llc 2015 faruqi et al 2018 however the specific effectiveness of the cocoon water saving technology detrimental effect on the survival and growth of transplanted mango seedlings should be tested before widely disseminated at large scale in the arid and semiarid conditions of the northern ethiopia in tigray region northern ethiopia such as the rama area in each year different plantation activities have been conducted just after raising seedlings which demands intensive labor and other resources however after planted tree seedlings the growers have been challenged by the poor survival rate 0 20 due to moisture stress coupled with degraded soils such moisture stress could be associated with water scarcity to irrigate mango seedlings on steep land erratic nature and short rainfall season and poor soil water holding capacity mihitsab azmati watershed in rama area of northern ethiopia is among the areas where problems of critical water scarcity and degraded soils have been observed and so challenged for proper establishment of tree seedlings the objective of this study was to introduce the new knowledge and innovative idea of the cocoon water saving technology and evaluate its effectiveness on improving transplanted mango seedlings survival rate and growth performance at the early stage of mango trees as compared to the conventional practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area this study was conducted in mihitsab azmati watershed of the rama area northern ethiopia fig 1 the study was conducted from july 2018 to january 2020 the study watershed is located at 34 km from the north of the town of adwa in tigray region ethiopia and 8 km from the border with eritrea the selected watershed falls within the mereb sub basin in ethiopia the total area coverage of the watershed is about 16 083 ha in this study watershed there is a reservoir finalized its construction in 2019 with a capacity to store water bout 28 5 million m3 the area of the reservoir is about 108 ha the irrigation production started since 2015 before the construction had finalized the slope of the study watershed based on the fao slope classification is flat undulating moderately sloping and steep to very steep lands but it is dominated by steep slope land the altitude of the watershed ranges from 1400 to 3350 m above sea level but the experimental site mean elevation is 1480 m above sea level bureau of agriculture and rural development office board 2018 the total household heads resided in the study watershed were 9554 with average family sizes of five 5 about 99 of the farmers lived in the watershed are engaged under subsistence agriculture the farmers have been used small degraded farm land with an average size of 0 5 ha per household head the implication is that there is a need to use mountain agriculture with suitable technologies such as cocoon in order to increase arable land size ad the corresponding productivity the mihitsab azmathi watershed has dominated by both lowland and midland agro climatic conditions but the experimental site is part of the lowland with arid climatic condition it has mono modal type of rain fall july to september with mean annual rainfall of 551 mm yr 1 likewise the mean annual temperature is 19 c and the maximum and minimum temperature of 30 c and 11 c respectively board 2018 the wide diversity in climate topography and vegetation cover in the study watershed could be the cause for the marked variations in soil types even within relatively small distance of the land plots according to the farmers classification sandy soils are the dominant soil texture on undulating and steep slope lands such soil texture is highly susceptible to erosion and this gradually declined soil productivity according to the fao soil classification four major soil types are available in the study watershed these are cambisols solonchaks leptosols and xerosols the predominant type of soil mostly occurs in the undulating and rolling to hill topography part of the catchment is leptosols food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 1998 the land use types in the study watershed includes bush land bare land cultivated land forest land home stead grazing land and reservoir area dam the cultivated land is dominated over the other land use types but the experimental site used the marginal land above the reservoir after the construction of bench terraces field level observation indicated that the main crops grown are bicolor sorghum sorghum eleusinecoracane finger milt arachishypogaea ground nut and zea mays maize vegetables and edible fruits are suitably grown in the study watershed dodonaea viscosa tahsos euceleara cemosa kuliow ziziphus mauritiane gava acacia albida momona acacia bussei gumeroficussy comorous sagla euphorbia tirucalli kinchib jatropha curcas jatropha are some of the tree species widely found in the study watershed dodonaea viscosa tahsos is the most dominant tree in the lowland including the experimental site board 2018 personal observation 2 2 experimental material experimental design and procedures this experiment was done using grafted mango seedlings which were planted as a test plant on the bench terraces built in the mihitsab azmati watershed in rama area northern ethiopia such bench terraces were built on the marginal area in the upper part of the reservoir by the local community who were involved under the project climate smart integrated watershed management from dec 2017 to april 2018 the area under bench terraces is about 1 ha in this experiment the cocoon technology was used alone and with other practices while transplanted mango seedlings the cocoon has the capacity to hold 25 l of water and designed to fill once at a time to serve water for 6 months for the transplanted seedlings in the temperate environment condition this is the duration used as a standard check the company designed the cocoon to give water constantly for the plant till the rainy month started however in the condition of the experimental site tropical condition it was observed that refilling of the cocoon for the second time is crucial as the water in the cocoon could not stay for six months in this research cocoon was refilled with the same amount of water at three months after establishment the cocoon was put into the pit when the pit is free from stones and leveled before placing the cocoon and the mango plant seedling 10 l of water was added into the pit as described in land life company llc 2019 in this experiment a total of five treatments related to the water saving techniques with mango seedlings plantation were evaluated these were i cocoon exterior part sprayed by tricel t1 ii cocoon exterior part painted by used engine oil t2 iii cocoon without tricel and oil i e 100 biodegradable cocoon t3 iv without cocoon but mango seedlings manually irrigated t4 and v planted mango seedling without cocoon water saving technology mango seedling planted during the rainy season t5 the tricel and oil were used to protect the cocoon water saving technology from termite attack during the dry period tricel is a broad spectrum organophosphorus insecticide it controls a wide range of insects including termites for this experiment the recommended rate of tricel and used engine oil were used both trice and oil are categorized as repellents implying termites avoid contact with a treated area which is part of their behavioral response su et al 1982 ibrahim et al 2003 in this study 1 g powder tricel mixed with 1 l of water was sprayed on the external part of the cocoon three liters of used engine oil mixed with 0 5 l of diesel was painted on the exterior part of the cocoon water saving technology the diesel makes the oil to be less viscous the oil gives unpleasant test which repel or discourages termites from attacking the cocoon this is considered by the farmers as a traditional method that controls termite attacks the treatment manual irrigation t4 has practiced for many years by smallholder farmers having small land holding size in areas where water is available for irrigation mango seedlings under manual irrigation were watered at 10 mm depth at three days interval until the rainfall started at the end of june 2019 recently manual irrigation practice using water cup and or furrow irrigation has been practiced widely by many farmers on the basis of availability of irrigation equipments though watering using a water cup is labor intensive irrigation using water cup may not be scalable as it is difficult to use with many seedlings planted at large scale the treatment considered as with no cocoon water saving technology of the mango seedlings planted during the rainy season t5 were implemented during the rain fed season on 01 july 2018 this was earlier by six months than the other treatments which were planted on 01 jan 2019 t5 was considered as a check or control because many farmers were practiced for many decades to establish fruit trees and other tree seedlings in areas where it is difficult to use irrigation infrastructure such as mountainous landscape of the study sites any of the other practices with all the treatments were implemented uniformly including the construction of the bench terraces no chemical for pest and diseases control was used on the plant because there was no such problem on the mango plants the experimental design was laid down in randomized complete block design rcbd in four replications this was fixed to have adequate number of mango plants for the treatments treatments were applied randomly in each blocks the five treatments were implemented on one newly built bench terrace with a length of 60 m and this was considered as a block or replication fig 2 the mango seedlings planted in each replicate of block was placed on a one of four 60 m length consecutive bench terraces each treatment replicate plot was represented by two trees the spacing between plants in a block was 6 m and a distance of 4 m was maintained between seedlings planted in two consecutive bench terraces the experimental site was closed from livestock interferences the illustration of how the cocoon water saving technology works with tree seedlings plantations is shown in fig 3 the pit size used to insert the cocoon was 60 cm depth and 70 cm diameter the cocoon is closed with a biodegradable paper lid and completely covered and surrounded by locally sourced soils wicks inside the device transports water from the water filled cocoon to the seedling s roots such drip system encourages roots to grow deep and wide helping them tap into sub surface soil moisture the final step is to slide a cylindrical shelter over the cocoon s opening which protects the growing seedling from excessive sun exposure winds and small animals land life company llc 2015 jongejan 2017 union of agricultural committee uawc and fanack and land life company llc 2017 agronomical the selected mango seedlings were watered before transported from the nursery to the planting site prepared on the bench terraces watering was done to protect the seedlings from drying up during transportation during seedling transportation caution was taken not to pile up as this can cause damage to the seedlings the seedlings were transported upright in boxes as this reduces the chance of damaging the seedlings transported seedlings were planted with respect to all the treatments just immediately at the same date of the transportation 2 3 data collection and procedures data on survival rate and other growth performance indicators of the mango seedlings planted with respect to the treatments effects were collected two times i e at six months and one year after transplanted the first period of data collection was just at six months 30 june 2019 after transplanted the mango seedlings with respect to all the other treatments except t5 the first at six months and second periods at one year of data collection with regard to t5 were on 31 dec 2018 and 30 june 2019 respectively all data from t5 were collected just after one rainy season july and august 2018 the second period of data collection for the rest of the treatments was just at one year 01 january 2020 from the date of the mango seedlings transplanted in this experiment survival rate plant height numbers of leaves per plant shoot length stem diameter and crown width were the parameters collected during the two data collection periods described on the above details of each parameters collected are described as follows survival rate of mango seedlings planted with respect to the five treatments were recorded just at six months and one year from the date of the seedlings transplanted finally the survival rate in percentage was calculated with respect to each of the treatments tapia et al 2019 as 1 s u r v i v a l r a t e n u m b e r o f s u r v i v e d s e e d l i n g s n u m b e r o f p l a n t e d s e e d l i n g s 100 plant height cm of the mango seedlings planted was measured from the attachment on the ground level up to the tip of the growing point fig 4 a this was recorded from all the plants treated using the five treatments in each blocks all the mango plants in all the blocks were recorded using tape meter at six months and at one year after the date of transplanted the total numbers of leaves per plant were counted from all the mango plants treated by the five treatments in each blocks twice i e at six months and one year after transplanting similarly the diameter of the main stem cm was measured at 5 cm above the ground level the thickest part with the help of graduated caliper just from all of the treatments during the two data collection periods terminal shoot length cm was also recorded using tape meter at the tip of the plant leaves from all the mango seedlings transplanted fig 4b in each blocks just at six and one year after the date of transplanted in addition crown width cm was measured from all the seedlings of mango planted in each blocks with respect to the five treatments during the two data collection periods crown width was estimated by pacing the diameter of the canopy from two directions perpendicular to each other brack 1997 2 4 data analysis data were subjected to analysis of variance using statistix 10 software analytical software tallahassee fl means of treatment effects were considered significant at the probability level p 0 05 mean of the treatment effects was separated using the least significant difference lsd at p 0 05 survival rate and number of leaves per plant were log transformed to meet the assumptions of normality paired samples t test at p 0 05 was used for paired mean difference comparison between values of the same growth parameter response to the different treatments determined across the two data collection periods at six months and one year after transplanting this t test procedure was used to test the null hypothesis stated as there was no significant difference in mango plant growth increment measured at six months and one year just after transplanted due to the effects of the treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects on survival rate and growth performance at six months after transplanted in this study the survival rate and growth performance of mango plant seedlings transplanted with respect to the effects of the different treatments is shown in table 1 the survival rates of the mongo plants treated with the five treatments at six months after transplanting were significantly influenced by the treatments the significantly lowest survival rate 20 six months after seedlings transplanted was in the control treatment t5 all the other treatments had a 100 survival rate at six months after transplanting this indicates that the use of cocoon water saving technology with or without tricel or oil could improve survival rate better than the standard local farm practices in the study area conditions the 100 survival rate six months after transplanting in this study is higher than that reported for cocoon technologies in other studies elsewhere between 75 95 e g land life company llc 2015 abdullah 2017 faruqi et al 2018 the present finding of the water saving techniques could be a solution for the concern of the greatest mortality risk poor survival rate of seedlings planted upto the first year of the plant after transplantation which reported by menendez and jaramillo 2015 and tapia et al 2019 this is because there was 100 seedling survival rate upto one year after transplanting due to the cocoon water saving techniques tested in this study there were significant differences in mango plant heights between the control t5 and the rest of the treatments measured at six months after transplanting table 1 however there were non significant differences in plant heights measured at six months after transplanting among t1 t2 t3 and t4 during the six months after trnsplanted the highest plant height was measured from mango plants treated by the cocoon exterior part sprayed with tricel t1 40 2 cm followed by cocoon exterior part painted by used engine oil t2 39 8 cm the shortest mango plant height was measured from mango seedlings treated by the control t5 25 0 cm followed by t4 37 2 cm regardless of the non significant difference t1 resulted in a plant height higher by 3 cm 8 1 as compared to that of t4 measured at six months after transplanting such difference in mango plant heights after transplanted in this short period of time is quite important to imply the treatments contribution in the study area conditions it is also important to note that mango seedlings with equal height were selected during the transplanted time and the same planting depth was used to avoid errors related to plant height measurement among the treatments there were significant differences in the number of leaves per plant of the mango seedlings counted at six months after transplanting due to the treatments treated using the cocoon water saving technologies t1 to t3 manually irrigated t4 and planted with rain fed t5 however there were non significant differences in the number of leaves per plant of the transplanted mango plants counted at six months among the cocoon technologies table 1 the number of leaves per mango plant counted at six months after transplantation with respect to the treatment effects of the cocoon water saving technology without tricel and oil t3 were significantly lower than those plants treated by the cocoon sprayed with tricel t1 and cocoon exterior part painted by used engine oil t2 the reason could be attributed to the nature of tricel and oil painted cocoon which protects the cocoon from being biodegraded by termites and other biological attacks while serving water to the plant mango tree seedling leaves per plant were recorded during the planting time and excluded from the analysis in order to see only the treatment effect after transplanting on the number of leaves in a plant generally the highest number of leaves per mango plant was recorded from plants treated with t1 25 0 whereas the lowest number of leaves per plant was found from mango plants treated with t5 followed by t4 table 1 such result on the numbers of leaves indicate that mango plants with cocoon could access water stored in the cocoon constantly during the entire dry period whereas the manually irrigated plants may expose to water stress within the irrigation interval due to a higher evaporation transpiration and or deep percolation flow losses beyond the root zone tesfahunegn 2019 gebru and tesfahunegn 2020 such losses may affect the mango plant growth including the number of leaves even within the six months after transplanting with regard to t5 it has only two months to access moisture from the seasonal natural rainfall and after this the long dry months affects negatively the growth parameters of the mango plant abdullah 2017 faruqi et al 2018 comparini et al 2020 the significantly highest shoot length at six months was in t1 12 6 cm followed by t2 12 3 cm was measured just after transplanted the lowest in shoot length of the transplanted mango seedling measured at six months was due to t5 5 0 cm followed by t4 6 3 cm similarly the significantly highest stem diameter 1 94 cm of the mango plants measured at six months after transplanting was due to t1 the significantly lowest stem diameter of 1 10 cm due to t5 followed by t4 1 18 cm of the mango plants were measured at six months after transplanting there were non significant differences in the stem diameter of the mango plants measured at six months after transplanting with respect to the effects of t1 and t2 table 1 in which this could be attributed to the similarity of both cocoon treatments with anti termite chemicals crown width of the mango plants measured at six months after transplanting showed significantly differences among most of the treatments the highest crown width was found due to t1 25 6 cm whereas the lowest was due to t5 16 0 cm however there were non significant differences in crown widths measured at six months after transplanting between the effects of t1 and t2 and t3 and t4 table 1 indicating that such treatments have similarity in the effects on crown width 3 2 effects on survival rate and growth performance at one year after transplanted the mean value of survival rate plant height number of leaves per plant shoot length stem diameter and crown width measured at one year after mango plant seedlings transplanting is shown in table 2 the survival rates of the mango seedlings at one year after transplanting influenced significantly by the treatments effects the lowest survival rate was in t5 20 whereas a 100 survival rate from the other treatments were reported this indicates that there was positive treatments effect on the survival rate of mango plants transplanted due to the water saving techniques described as t1 t2 t3 and t4 on the other hand the present result indicates that in the absence of water saving technology in the long dry periods survival rate of seedlings transplanted treated using t5 were reported as very poor this implies that there is a high benefit to adopt the cocoon water saving technologies that improve survival rate using small amount of water application in the dry season in support of this field observation on the same landscape indicated that the mean survival rate of graveala tree species seedlings planted during the same rainy season without cocoon and with no supplementary irrigation application during the dry months was reported as 10 this indicates that soil moisture is a critical issue for improving the survival of seedlings planted and growth performance at the early growth stage in the study area conditions the plant heights of mango seedlings measured at one year after transplanting were significantly influenced by the treatment effects table 2 the highest plant height was measured from t3 83 3 cm followed by t2 78 3 cm on the other hand the shortest plant height of mango plant measured at one year after transplanting was due to t5 32 0 cm followed by t4 47 0 cm the changes in plant height increments between the two measurement periods for t3 t2 t1 t4 and t5 in descending order were 45 1 38 5 24 8 9 8 and 7 0 cm respectively tables 1 and 2 this indicates that the highest mango plant height increment was due to t3 followed by t2 this could be associated with the cocoon water saving technology that supplies constantly water for six months after the seedlings transplanted and also its contribution to improve topsoil as it is biodegraded even though the study area is well known for the problem of termite fortunately t3 which was without any termite protection performed its intended purpose of water supply and soil nutrients biodegraded to the transplanted mango seedlings the cocoon water saving technology used with tricel and oil can supply constantly water for six months after the seedlings transplanted however such sprayed and painted substances could reduce cocoon from being biodegraded on time and thereby it has insufficient contribution to add plant nutrients and improve soil structure this may be lower the plant height increment due to t1 and t2 as compared to t3 practically it was observed at field level that the cocoon water saving technologies used with tricel and oil were less biodegraded even after one year fig 4 the numbers of leaves per plant measured at one year after transplanting were significantly influenced by the treatments table 2 the highest mean numbers of leaves per mango plant were observed in t3 67 0 followed by t2 61 0 the lowest mean numbers of leaves per mango plant 17 0 at one year after transplanting was due to t5 within six months july 2019 to dec 2019 there was nearly more than three folds increment in the mean number of leaves per mango plant with response to t3 and slightly less than three folds due to t2 tables 1and 2 similarly there were significant differences in shoot length measured at one year after transplanting due to the treatments effects the highest shoot length 26 3 cm was measured from t3 whereas the lowest shoot length 6 5 cm was from the mango plants treated by t5 the shoot length measured from mango plants treated with t2 was slightly higher than that of t1 which could be associated with the differences in the level of their degradation and constant water supplying to the plant root in addition there were significant differences in the mean stem diameter of mango plants determined at one year after transplanting due to the effects of the treatments the highest stem diameter 4 83 cm of mango plant measured at one year after transplanting was due to t3 this was followed by the effect of t2 on stem diameter 4 17 cm the lowest stem diameter of mango plants 1 25 cm was measured due to t5 in the study area the increment in stem diameter after measurement taken at six months up to 12 months after transplanting july 2019 to dec 2019 due to the effect of t3 was 3 44 cm which is the fastest stem diameter growth as compared to the other treatments significant differences in crown widths of the mango plant measured at one year after transplanting were reported with respect to the treatment effects in a similar manner the highest crown width of the mango plants at one year after transplanting was measured from t3 45 3 cm followed by t2 40 3 cm on the contrary the lowest mean crown width value of the mango plant was measured from plants treated using t5 16 0 cm at one year after transplanting the result of t3 indicated that the best growth performance of the mango seedlings at one year after transplanting provided that if the site is free of termite otherwise termites can be destroyed the cocoon within less than 2 months 3 3 paired mean difference of growth parameters between two measurement periods in this study the paired mean differences between the same growth parameter of mango plant measured at one year and six months after transplanted showed significant differences table 3 for example the overall treatments effect on mean difference between plant height measured at one year and six months after transplanted is 29 6 cm this value is within the lower and upper confidence interval with acceptable standard error of mean 4 8 cm indicating that such result is representative for the target population at confidence level of 95 2 the same interpretation can be used for the remaining paired mean differences values of the parameters indicated in table 3 the implication of the significant difference of the paired mean differences of the growth parameter of mango transplanted seedlings between the two measurement periods is that the cocoon technology is not only important during the first six months of the dry season just after transplanted but also it has even better contribution to increase the growth of mango plants up to 12 months this could be related to the fact that the plant may use the biodegraded cocoon as source of nutrients and improving soil water holding capacity during the rainy season a well established seedling during the first six months after transplanted can develop a root system that has good capacity to use nutrients and soil water from the soil profile however further detail research should be conducted to know scientifically the reason for such significantly increment in the growth parameters after the six months of the mango seedling transplanted from the point of view of soil nutrient and water dynamics 3 4 synthesis of treatments effects on mango growth performance after transplanted this study demonstrated that the cocoon technology was effective in increasing the survival rate and growth performance of the transplanted mango seedlings six months after transplanting the cocoon technology with tricel t1 was superior and positively affecting the growth performance as compared to the other treatments however the increment in the growth of the mango seedlings one year after the transplanting was significantly higher in the cocoon without tricel and oil t3 than the other treatments also the three treatments of cocoon water saving technologies t1 t2 and t3 were all found to ensure the best survival rate the survival rate due to t4 was also as effective as the cocoon treatments but used much water and labor however t4 showed significantly lower values of the other growth performance indicators than the treatments with cocoon water saving technology in support of this result the existing reports have shown that the use of cocoon supports the current practices in nature restoration and sustainable agriculture as it has completely eliminated irrigation and enhanced the survival rates and vigor of young seedlings e g land life company llc 2015 2016 abdullah 2017 wei et al 2017 according to the report by union of agricultural committee uawc and fanack and land life company llc 2017 comparatively the cocoon uses on average a total of 25 l of water to achieve seedlings survival rates of 75 95 on olive and almond planted trees in the gaza strip this survival rate is lower than the present result on survival reported at six and 12 months after mango seedlings transplanting which was 100 with the cocoon water saving technologies this indicates that cocoon water saving technologies could support the seedlings to survive and grow in the dry months of a year cocoon stimulates plant roots to grow to a sufficient depth and use available water and nutrients from the soil profile on their own lampayan et al 2004 jaramillo et al 2015a b land life company llc 2019 the cocoon water saving technology was found effective and so preferred over the other treatments such as t4 due to the following observed points the first point is the use of cocoon reduces labor costs as water is added one time during the installation stage as compared to the manually irrigated at three days interval the cocoon eliminates the need for regular irrigation systems and so reducing significantly the labor costs related to water and its application on the seedlings transplanted on the contrary the experiences of farmers who involved on irrigation from small ponds and shallow wells in the tigray region and other regions of ethiopia showed that irrigation practice is expensive as demands intensive water and energy meaning it consumes high energy to extract and convey water as well as costs related to installation maintenance and removal of irrigation infrastructures secondly the amount of water being added to the cocoon technology is about 25 l in temperate zone and 50 l in tropical conditions refilled which is used for about six months in which this amount is by far lower than the manual irrigation thirdly water losses as a result of evaporation lateral and vertical flows beyond the root zone and water being used by weeds growing around the mango plants were very low with the cocoon as the structure of this technology prevents such losses fourthly once planting with cocoon water saving technology is finished it will not require maintenance or removal as cocoon will degrade within two years after installation land life company llc 2015 2016 land life company llc 2019 under such conditions the cocoon water saving technology enhances the survival rate and growth performance of the planted seedlings during the dry months otherwise the poor survival rate in the conventional approach means that efforts have to be undertaken for re planting that adds again a cost to a plantation program finally the collective effects of the above core points indicate that the cocoon water saving technology is sustainable and highly scalable for its application while planting with seedlings of suitable tree species such as mango seedling transplanted at large scale in the arid and semiarid degraded areas land life company llc 2015 2016 union of agricultural committee uawc and fanack and land life company llc 2017 similarly the cocoon water saving technology is effective in landscaping such as road sides and public parks as this reduces irrigation water consumption and labor costs for irrigation and irrigation system installations and maintenances wei et al 2017 on the basis of this study result in termite suspected sites it is suggested to use the cocoon water saving technology with tricel or used engine oil so that to protect from termite attacks over the lifetime of the cocoon however in such conditions it should be realized that the cocoon biodegradable status is going to be reduced so the expected contribution towards soil nutrient improvement may not be addressed in the presence of anti termite painting or spray on the exterior part of the cocoon hence plantations that are being planned to execute on degraded soils should be considered for the application of external organic fertilizer sources if we use cocoon with tricel or used engine oil as this reduces the cocoon biodegradability cabin 2007 jaramillo 2015 generally in agreement to the present findings of the cocoon water saving technology that influenced significantly on survival and growth performance of mango seedlings transplanted tapia et al 2019 have reported that the survival and growth of opuntia species plantings had improved by the water saving technology such as groasis waterboxx however the same authors have stated that the advantage of such technology is highly dependent upon the planting environmental conditions e g elevation vegetation zone precipitation and species types the implication is that it is better to emphasize on the species types and site specific conditions while selecting and applying the above water saving technology for successful plant restoration in the dry areas with degraded soils kulkarni 2011 jaramillo 2015 tapia et al 2019 in support of this the cocoon water saving technology could not contribute for the improvement of opuntia cacti growth and rather reduced the probability of the survival rate of the seedlings of opuntia plantings by 89 tapia et al 2019 one possible explanation is that opuntia cacti species have a short root depth which has not matched with the cocoon depth as compared to other species with deep roots tapia et al 2019 snyman 2005 under such condition this may reduce opuntia cacti roots access to the water stored in the cocoon land life company llc 2015 tapia et al 2019 on the other hand acacia macracantha with deeper roots had showed better success when planted with the cocoon water saving technology in the galápagos area kulkarni 2011 tapia et al 2019 such findings however do not undermine the contribution of cocoon for plant restoration purposes in water stressed degraded soils rather underlined the significant observation that water saving technologies should be considered on a case by case and tested with each species under various environmental conditions before planning expansive planting activities at large scale tapia et al 2019 4 conclusion this study revealed a 100 survival of the mango seedlings planted with cocoon water saving technologies t1 t2 and t3 whereas the seedlings planted without cocoon during the rainfall season t5 showed a survival rate of 20 at six and 12 months after transplanting the survival rate of mango seedling with manual irrigation t4 was also found to be 100 to select the best practice for improving seedling survival rate among the treatments understanding comparative advantage of cocoon and manual irrigation with respect to amount of water and labor is crucial for example the cocoon technology is water saving as uses small amount of water 25 l just applied at one time as compared to the manually irrigated at three days interval which requires much water and labor to achieve the same plant survival rate the growth performance indicators of mango plant height number of leaves per plant shoot length stem diameter and crown width measured at six and 12 months after transplanted were significantly influenced by the cocoon water saving technology the highest growth parameters were measured at six months after transplanting due to cocoon exterior part sprayed by tricel t1 whereas the lowest values were from t5 however the highest growth parameters measured at 12 months after transplanting were due to the effect of cocoon without tricel and oil i e 100 biodegradable cocoon t3 this could be attributed to the contribution of biodegraded cocoon towards soil nutrients and structure improvement in which the mango plants are being expected to use for growth the cocoon sprayed by tricel or painted using used engine oil increased the lifetime of the cocoon biodegradability even more than a year in such condition application of external sources of organic fertilizer is highly suggested as plantation on degraded soils suffers from lack of adequate soil nutrients for plant growth in areas whereby termite is not a problem the use of the cocoon without tricel and oil is highly recommended to improve the growth performance of mango seedlings plantation through improving water use efficiency and soil system while reducing losses of water and labor costs the use of the water saving cocoon technology reduces the amount of water applied and used by the mango trees after transplanted as compared to the traditional irrigation method in which this could save an additional advantage on the basis of this study the 100 biodegradable cocoon seems sustainable and highly scalable for its application with seedlings of mango tree species in termite free arid and semiarid degraded areas at large scale this technology is thus expected to be a solution for the problem related to poor survival rate and other growth parameters of planted tree species using the conventional approach in which this has been remained a critical problem for a longtime in the study area conditions finally this study underlines that water saving technology such as cocoon is a promising system as it has a profound influence on mango tree seedlings survival rate and plant growth performance in the degraded soils of the arid environment however this technology should not be assumed to function uniformly well in all environmental conditions and with all tree species before demonstrating on a pilot study pilot testing on extensive environmental conditions with degraded soils and different restoring species is essential before large scale planting efforts with cocoon water saving technology are planned and

10400,even though mango productivity in ethiopia is low due to moisture stress there is no report on how such constraint could alleviate using cocoon water saving technology cocoon is small water reservoir technology which uses for plant growth in dry season the objectives of this study were to introduce and evaluate effectiveness of water saving techniques on mango seedlings survival and growth in mihitsab azmati watershed northern ethiopia in this experiment five treatments of water saving techniques with mango seedlings were evaluated these were cocoon sprayed by tricel t1 cocoon painted by used engine oil t2 cocoon without tricel and oil t3 manually irrigated seedlings t4 and mango seedlings planted during rainy season t5 the survival and growth performance of mango seedlings were recorded at six months and one year after transplanting data on plant survival height number of leaves per plant shoot length stem diameter and crown width were subjected to analysis of variance and t test there were significant differences in the treatment effects on mango seedlings transplanted survival plant height number of leaves per plant shoot length stem diameter and crown width measured at six months and one year after transplanting the lowest survival rate 20 was found during both data collection time in t5 six months after transplanting the highest growth parameters were measured from t1 whereas the lowest was from t5 however one year after transplanting the highest growth parameters were measured from t3 plant heights increments between the two measurement periods for t3 t2 t1 t4 and t5 were 45 1 38 5 24 8 9 8 and 7 0 cm respectively indicating that t3 performed better than the other treatments the t test on mean differences between the same growth parameter measured at 12 and six months after transplanting also showed significant differences the cocoon water saving technology was superior in improving mango seedlings survival and growth in the study area

originated in south east asia morton 1987 kosterman and bompard 1993 stangeland 2011 ahmed and mohamed 2015 wei et al 2017 neguse et al 2019 mango is one of the most widely grown fruit crops in the tropical and subtropical regions including in arid and semiarid areas in the presence of appropriate water management practices in developing countries where food and nutritional insecurity are still reported as big challenges mango is considered as the king of the fruits because of its excellent flavor delicious taste and high nutritive values hill 1952 bally et al 2009 ullah et al 2010 vasugi et al 2012 rekhapriyadharshini 2015 neguse et al 2019 as a result mango is one of the most widely grown fruit crops cultivated next to banana in terms of economic importance in ethiopia moreover within the past one decade in ethiopia both area coverage and production of mango has been increased by 208 and 247 respectively under such expansion of mango trees water deficit has been reported as a crucial environmental stress on agricultural productivity and limits the economical development dessalegn et al 2014 fita 2014 wei et al 2017 neguse et al 2019 this indicates the need for water saving technologies in order to reduce the effect of water deficit on agricultural production such as mango farms in the context of this paper water saving technologies are described as tools that may help increase survival and growth of planted seedlings while reducing the need for manual watering while speeding the ecological restoration process kulkarni jaramillo 2015 jaramillo et al 2015a b tapia et

various factors e g water deficit environmental variables management factors or a combination of such variables however there is no report that addresses environmental and management factors that constrained mango growth at the early stage specifically using water saving techniques such as cocoon in degraded areas with arid and semiarid environmental conditions in ethiopia even at global scale

areas with critical water shortage e g kulkarni 2011 jaramillo 2015 tapia et al 2019 the cocoon is a small water reservoir in which water is stored for plant growth in the dry season and thereby eliminating the need for irrigation land life company llc 2015 2016 water deficit moisture stress is the most persistent environmental stress on fruit crops such as mango growth and productivity in which this limits its contribution to improve nutritional status and economic development of a given society population growth coupled with irrigation land use expansion including mango plantation

plantation have been implemented for a long time in tigray region northern ethiopia however some promising results on improving income food security water resources for irrigation and vegetation coverage have been reported in this region hussen and yimer 2013 tesfahunegn and gebru 2020 since 70 of the land feature of the tigray region in northern ethiopia is undulating topography and rainfall distribution of the region is mainly for two months july and august with higher runoff and soil loss potential the remaining long dry months are so difficult for the survival of tree seedlings plantation tamene 2005 tesfahunegn et al 2014 2016 tesfahunegn and gebru 2020 in such conditions even though millions of seedlings have been planted every year in the past many decades there are conditions almost all of the seedlings planted died that resulted in poor survival rate and poor growth performance in the northern ethiopia conditions hussen and yimer 2013 abdullah 2017 wei et al 2017 neguse et al 2019 however there is interesting water saving technology such as cocoon which has been successfully implemented globally in the projects across 15 countries in africa only in kenya and south africa results from such cocoon projects globally confirmed seedlings plantation survival rates of 80 95 and significant savings on labor costs and water use in comparison to the traditional land restoration practices reports from such projects have suggested that the cocoon water saving technology could provide a better opportunity for improving seedling survival rate and other plant growth parameters in the arid and semiarid climatic conditions even on areas affiliated with severely degraded land land life company llc 2015 abdullah 2017 cocoon is the only biodegradable water saving technology designed to increase survival and growth of planted seedlings reducing the need for manual and regular irrigation and enhances land restoration process such as improving vegetation

plant and feed water to the soil at a slow but constant rate through the capillary action via a short length of rope that connects the water in the cocoon to the soil land life company llc 2015 cocoon is designed to restore dry and deforested land where there is no affordable or maintainable substitute as this enables trees to be planted and grow sustainably the cocoon has a water reservoir storage capacity of 25 l which fills once at a planting stage and then serves the water for the plant for six months this technology is designed to prevent evaporation and weed growth around the base of the seedling land life company llc 2015 abdullah 2017 tapia et al 2019 water is transported from the cocoon reservoir to the tree using wicks in which this protects seedlings from effects of harsh weather conditions and browsing by small animals particularly during its first year land life company llc 2015 abdullah 2017 the increasing water shortage in the arid and semiarid degraded areas is the push factor to investigate the sustainable use of cocoon water saving technology while transplanted tree seedlings the existing reports from the middle east and north africa have indicated that use of cocoon enables for better and successful survival and growth of planted tree seedlings on degraded soils in the arid and semiarid areas than the traditional tree planting system planting with cocoon also helps restoring the top soil nutrients and soil structure as it is 100 biodegradable abdullah 2017 land life company llc 2015 2016 other important advantages of planting using cocoon water saving technology is that it is a low cost needs no follow up and no regular irrigation but enhances the survival rates of planted young seedlings between 75 95 abdullah 2017 land life company llc 2015 faruqi et al 2018 however the specific effectiveness of the cocoon water saving technology detrimental effect on the survival and growth of transplanted mango seedlings should be tested before widely disseminated at large scale in the arid and semiarid conditions of the northern ethiopia in tigray region northern ethiopia such as the rama area in each year different plantation activities have been conducted just after raising seedlings which demands intensive labor and other resources however after planted tree seedlings the growers have been challenged by the poor survival rate 0 20 due to moisture stress coupled with degraded soils such moisture stress could be associated with water scarcity to irrigate mango seedlings on steep land erratic nature and short rainfall season and poor soil water holding capacity mihitsab azmati watershed in rama area of northern ethiopia is among the areas where problems of critical water scarcity and degraded soils have been observed and so challenged for proper establishment of tree seedlings the objective of this study was to introduce the new knowledge and innovative idea of the cocoon water saving technology and evaluate its effectiveness on improving transplanted mango seedlings survival rate and growth performance at the early stage of mango trees as compared to the conventional practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area this study was conducted in mihitsab azmati watershed of the rama area northern ethiopia fig 1 the study was conducted from july 2018 to january 2020 the study watershed is located at 34 km from the north of the town of adwa in tigray region ethiopia and 8 km from the border with eritrea the selected watershed falls within the mereb sub basin in ethiopia the total area coverage of the watershed is about 16 083 ha in this study watershed there is a reservoir finalized its construction in 2019 with a capacity to store water bout 28 5 million m3 the area of the reservoir is about 108 ha the irrigation production started since 2015 before the construction had finalized the slope of the study watershed based on the fao slope classification is flat undulating moderately sloping and steep to very steep lands but it is dominated by steep slope land the altitude of the watershed ranges from 1400 to 3350 m above sea level but the experimental site mean elevation is 1480 m above sea level bureau of agriculture and rural development office board 2018 the total household heads resided in the study watershed were 9554 with average family sizes of five 5 about 99 of the farmers lived in the watershed are engaged under subsistence agriculture the farmers have been used small degraded farm land with an average size of 0 5 ha per household head the implication is that there is a need to use mountain agriculture with suitable technologies such as cocoon in order to increase arable land size ad the corresponding productivity the mihitsab azmathi watershed has dominated by both lowland and midland agro climatic conditions but the experimental site is part of the lowland with arid climatic condition it has mono modal type of rain fall july to september with mean annual rainfall of 551 mm yr 1 likewise the mean annual temperature is 19 c and the maximum and minimum temperature of 30 c and 11 c respectively board 2018 the wide diversity in climate topography and vegetation cover in the study watershed could be the cause for the marked variations in soil types even within relatively small distance of the land plots according to the farmers classification sandy soils are the dominant soil texture on undulating and steep slope lands such soil texture is highly susceptible to erosion and this gradually declined soil productivity according to the fao soil classification four major soil types are available in the study watershed these are cambisols solonchaks leptosols and xerosols the predominant type of soil mostly occurs in the undulating and rolling to hill topography part of the catchment is leptosols food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 1998 the land use types in the study watershed includes bush land bare land cultivated land forest land home stead grazing land and reservoir area dam the cultivated land is dominated over the other land use types but the experimental site used the marginal land above the reservoir after the construction of bench terraces field level observation indicated that the main crops grown are bicolor sorghum sorghum eleusinecoracane finger milt arachishypogaea ground nut and zea mays maize vegetables and edible fruits are suitably grown in the study watershed dodonaea viscosa tahsos euceleara cemosa kuliow ziziphus mauritiane gava acacia albida momona acacia bussei gumeroficussy comorous sagla euphorbia tirucalli kinchib jatropha curcas jatropha are some of the tree species widely found in the study watershed dodonaea viscosa tahsos is the most dominant tree in the lowland including the experimental site board 2018 personal observation 2 2 experimental material experimental design and procedures this experiment was done using grafted mango seedlings which were planted as a test plant on the bench terraces built in the mihitsab azmati watershed in rama area northern ethiopia such bench terraces were built on the marginal area in the upper part of the reservoir by the local community who were involved under the project climate smart integrated watershed management from dec 2017 to april 2018 the area under bench terraces is about 1 ha in this experiment the cocoon technology was used alone and with other practices while transplanted mango seedlings the cocoon has the capacity to hold 25 l of water and designed to fill once at a time to serve water for 6 months for the transplanted seedlings in the temperate environment condition this is the duration used as a standard check the company designed the cocoon to give water constantly for the plant till the rainy month started however in the condition of the experimental site tropical condition it was observed that refilling of the cocoon for the second time is crucial as the water in the cocoon could not stay for six months in this research cocoon was refilled with the same amount of water at three months after establishment the cocoon was put into the pit when the pit is free from stones and leveled before placing the cocoon and the mango plant seedling 10 l of water was added into the pit as described in land life company llc 2019 in this experiment a total of five treatments related to the water saving techniques with mango seedlings plantation were evaluated these were i cocoon exterior part sprayed by tricel t1 ii cocoon exterior part painted by used engine oil t2 iii cocoon without tricel and oil i e 100 biodegradable cocoon t3 iv without cocoon but mango seedlings manually irrigated t4 and v planted mango seedling without cocoon water saving technology mango seedling planted during the rainy season t5 the tricel and oil were used to protect the cocoon water saving technology from termite attack during the dry period tricel is a broad spectrum organophosphorus insecticide it controls a wide range of insects including termites for this experiment the recommended rate of tricel and used engine oil were used both trice and oil are categorized as repellents implying termites avoid contact with a treated area which is part of their behavioral response su et al 1982 ibrahim et al 2003 in this study 1 g powder tricel mixed with 1 l of water was sprayed on the external part of the cocoon three liters of used engine oil mixed with 0 5 l of diesel was painted on the exterior part of the cocoon water saving technology the diesel makes the oil to be less viscous the oil gives unpleasant test which repel or discourages termites from attacking the cocoon this is considered by the farmers as a traditional method that controls termite attacks the treatment manual irrigation t4 has practiced for many years by smallholder farmers having small land holding size in areas where water is available for irrigation mango seedlings under manual irrigation were watered at 10 mm depth at three days interval until the rainfall started at the end of june 2019 recently manual irrigation practice using water cup and or furrow irrigation has been practiced widely by many farmers on the basis of availability of irrigation equipments though watering using a water cup is labor intensive irrigation using water cup may not be scalable as it is difficult to use with many seedlings planted at large scale the treatment considered as with no cocoon water saving technology of the mango seedlings planted during the rainy season t5 were implemented during the rain fed season on 01 july 2018 this was earlier by six months than the other treatments which were planted on 01 jan 2019 t5 was considered as a check or control because many farmers were practiced for many decades to establish fruit trees and other tree seedlings in areas where it is difficult to use irrigation infrastructure such as mountainous landscape of the study sites any of the other practices with all the treatments were implemented uniformly including the construction of the bench terraces no chemical for pest and diseases control was used on the plant because there was no such problem on the mango plants the experimental design was laid down in randomized complete block design rcbd in four replications this was fixed to have adequate number of mango plants for the treatments treatments were applied randomly in each blocks the five treatments were implemented on one newly built bench terrace with a length of 60 m and this was considered as a block or replication fig 2 the mango seedlings planted in each replicate of block was placed on a one of four 60 m length consecutive bench terraces each treatment replicate plot was represented by two trees the spacing between plants in a block was 6 m and a distance of 4 m was maintained between seedlings planted in two consecutive bench terraces the experimental site was closed from livestock interferences the illustration of how the cocoon water saving technology works with tree seedlings plantations is shown in fig 3 the pit size used to insert the cocoon was 60 cm depth and 70 cm diameter the cocoon is closed with a biodegradable paper lid and completely covered and surrounded by locally sourced soils wicks inside the device transports water from the water filled cocoon to the seedling s roots such drip system encourages roots to grow deep and wide helping them tap into sub surface soil moisture the final step is to slide a cylindrical shelter over the cocoon s opening which protects the growing seedling from excessive sun exposure winds and small animals land life company llc 2015 jongejan 2017 union of agricultural committee uawc and fanack and land life company llc 2017 agronomical the selected mango seedlings were watered before transported from the nursery to the planting site prepared on the bench terraces watering was done to protect the seedlings from drying up during transportation during seedling transportation caution was taken not to pile up as this can cause damage to the seedlings the seedlings were transported upright in boxes as this reduces the chance of damaging the seedlings transported seedlings were planted with respect to all the treatments just immediately at the same date of the transportation 2 3 data collection and procedures data on survival rate and other growth performance indicators of the mango seedlings planted with respect to the treatments effects were collected two times i e at six months and one year after transplanted the first period of data collection was just at six months 30 june 2019 after transplanted the mango seedlings with respect to all the other treatments except t5 the first at six months and second periods at one year of data collection with regard to t5 were on 31 dec 2018 and 30 june 2019 respectively all data from t5 were collected just after one rainy season july and august 2018 the second period of data collection for the rest of the treatments was just at one year 01 january 2020 from the date of the mango seedlings transplanted in this experiment survival rate plant height numbers of leaves per plant shoot length stem diameter and crown width were the parameters collected during the two data collection periods described on the above details of each parameters collected are described as follows survival rate of mango seedlings planted with respect to the five treatments were recorded just at six months and one year from the date of the seedlings transplanted finally the survival rate in percentage was calculated with respect to each of the treatments tapia et al 2019 as 1 s u r v i v a l r a t e n u m b e r o f s u r

growing point fig 4 a this was recorded from all the plants treated using the five treatments in each blocks all the mango plants in all the blocks were recorded using tape meter at six months and at one year after the date of transplanted the total numbers of leaves per plant were counted from all the mango plants treated by the five treatments in each blocks twice i e at six months and one year after transplanting similarly the diameter of the main stem cm was measured at 5 cm above the ground level the thickest part with the help of graduated caliper just from all of the treatments during the two data collection periods terminal shoot length cm was also recorded using tape meter at the tip of the plant leaves from all the mango seedlings transplanted fig 4b in each blocks just at six and one year after the date of transplanted in addition crown width cm was measured from all the seedlings of mango planted in each blocks with respect to the five treatments during the two data collection periods crown width was estimated by pacing the diameter of the canopy from two directions perpendicular to each other brack 1997 2 4 data analysis data were subjected to analysis of variance using statistix 10 software analytical software tallahassee fl means of treatment effects were considered significant at the probability level p 0 05 mean of the treatment effects was separated using the least significant difference lsd at p 0 05 survival rate and number of leaves per plant were log transformed to meet the assumptions of normality paired samples t test at p 0 05 was used for paired mean difference comparison between values of the same growth parameter response to the different treatments determined across the two data collection periods at six months and one year after transplanting this t test procedure was used to test the null hypothesis stated as there was no significant difference in mango plant growth increment measured at six months and one year just after transplanted due to the effects of the treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects on survival rate and growth performance at six months after transplanted in this study the survival rate and growth performance of mango plant seedlings transplanted with respect to the effects of the different treatments is shown in table 1 the survival rates of the mongo plants treated with the five treatments at six months after transplanting were significantly influenced by the treatments the significantly lowest survival rate 20 six months after seedlings transplanted was in the control treatment t5 all the other treatments had a 100 survival rate at six months after transplanting this indicates that the use of cocoon water saving technology with or without tricel or oil could improve survival rate better than the standard local farm practices in the study area conditions the 100 survival rate six months after transplanting in this study is higher than that reported for cocoon technologies in other studies elsewhere between 75 95 e g land life company llc 2015 abdullah 2017 faruqi et al 2018 the present finding of the water saving techniques could be a solution for the concern of the greatest mortality risk poor survival rate of seedlings planted upto the first year of the plant after transplantation which reported by menendez and jaramillo 2015 and tapia et al 2019 this is because there was 100 seedling survival rate upto one year after transplanting due to the cocoon water saving techniques tested in this study there were significant differences in mango plant heights between the control t5 and the rest of the treatments measured at six months after transplanting table 1 however there were non significant differences in plant heights measured at six months after transplanting among t1 t2 t3 and t4 during the six months after trnsplanted the highest plant height was measured from mango plants treated by the cocoon exterior part sprayed with tricel t1 40 2 cm followed by cocoon exterior part painted by used engine oil t2 39 8 cm the shortest mango plant height was measured from mango seedlings treated by the control t5 25 0 cm followed by t4 37 2 cm regardless of the non significant difference t1 resulted in a plant height higher by 3 cm 8 1 as compared to that of t4 measured at six months after transplanting such difference in mango plant heights after transplanted in this short period of time is quite important to imply the treatments contribution in the study area conditions it is also important to note that mango seedlings with equal height were selected during the transplanted time and the same planting depth was used to avoid errors related to plant height measurement among the treatments there were significant differences in the number of leaves per plant of the mango seedlings counted at six months after transplanting due to the treatments treated using the cocoon water saving technologies t1 to t3 manually irrigated t4 and planted with rain fed t5 however there were non significant differences in the number of leaves per plant of the transplanted mango plants counted at six months among the cocoon technologies table 1 the number of leaves per mango plant counted at six months after transplantation with respect to the treatment effects of the cocoon water saving technology without tricel and oil t3 were significantly lower than those plants treated by the cocoon sprayed with tricel t1 and cocoon exterior part painted by used engine oil t2 the reason could be attributed to the nature of tricel and oil painted cocoon which protects the cocoon from being biodegraded by termites and other biological attacks while serving water to the plant mango tree seedling leaves per plant were recorded during the planting time and excluded from the analysis in order to see only the treatment effect after transplanting on the number of leaves in a plant generally the highest number of leaves per mango plant was recorded from plants treated with t1 25 0 whereas the lowest number of leaves per plant was found from mango plants treated with t5 followed by t4 table 1 such result on the numbers of leaves indicate that mango plants with cocoon could access water stored in the cocoon constantly during the entire dry period whereas the manually irrigated plants may expose to water stress within the irrigation interval due to a higher evaporation transpiration and or deep percolation flow losses beyond the root zone tesfahunegn 2019 gebru and tesfahunegn 2020 such losses may affect the mango plant growth including the number of leaves even within the six months after transplanting with regard to t5 it has only two months to access moisture from the seasonal natural rainfall and after this the long dry months affects negatively the growth parameters of the mango plant abdullah 2017 faruqi et al 2018 comparini et al 2020 the significantly highest shoot length at six months was in t1 12 6 cm followed by t2 12 3 cm was measured just after transplanted the lowest in shoot length of the transplanted mango seedling measured at six months was due to t5 5 0 cm followed by t4 6 3 cm similarly the significantly highest stem diameter 1 94 cm of the mango plants measured at six months after transplanting was due to t1 the significantly lowest stem diameter of 1 10 cm due to t5 followed by t4 1 18 cm of the mango plants were measured at six months after transplanting there were non significant differences in the stem diameter of the mango plants measured at six months after transplanting with respect to the effects of t1 and t2 table 1 in which this could be attributed to the similarity of both cocoon treatments with anti termite chemicals crown width of the mango plants measured at six months after transplanting showed significantly differences among most of the treatments the highest crown width was found due to t1 25 6 cm whereas the lowest was due to t5 16 0 cm however there were non significant differences in crown widths measured at six months after transplanting between the effects of t1 and t2 and t3 and t4 table 1 indicating that such treatments have similarity in the effects on crown width 3 2 effects on survival rate and growth performance at one year after transplanted the mean value of survival rate plant height number of leaves per plant shoot length stem diameter and crown width measured at one year after mango plant seedlings transplanting is shown in table 2 the survival rates of the mango seedlings at one year after transplanting influenced significantly by the treatments effects the lowest survival rate was in t5 20 whereas a 100 survival rate from the other treatments were reported this indicates that there was positive treatments effect on the survival rate of mango plants transplanted due to the water saving techniques described as t1 t2 t3 and t4 on the other hand the present result indicates that in the absence of water saving technology in the long dry periods survival rate of seedlings transplanted treated using t5 were reported as very poor this implies that there is a high benefit to adopt the cocoon water saving technologies that improve survival rate using small amount of water application in the dry season in support of this field observation on the same landscape indicated that the mean survival rate of graveala tree species seedlings planted during the same rainy season without cocoon and with no supplementary irrigation application during the dry months was reported as 10 this indicates that soil moisture is a critical issue for improving the survival of seedlings planted and growth performance at the early growth stage in the study area conditions the plant heights of mango seedlings measured at one year after transplanting were significantly influenced by the treatment effects table 2 the highest plant height was measured from t3 83 3 cm followed by t2 78 3 cm on the other hand the shortest plant height of mango plant measured at one year after transplanting was due to t5 32 0 cm followed by t4 47 0 cm the changes in plant height increments between the two measurement periods for t3 t2 t1 t4 and t5 in descending order were 45 1 38 5 24 8 9 8 and 7 0 cm respectively tables 1 and 2 this indicates that the highest mango plant height increment was due to t3 followed by t2 this could be associated with the cocoon water saving technology that supplies constantly water for six months after the seedlings transplanted and also its contribution to improve topsoil as it is biodegraded even though the study area is well known for the problem of termite fortunately t3 which was without any termite protection performed its intended purpose of water supply and soil nutrients biodegraded to the transplanted mango seedlings the cocoon water saving technology used with tricel and oil can supply constantly water for six months after the seedlings transplanted however such sprayed and painted substances could reduce cocoon from being biodegraded on time and thereby it has insufficient contribution to add plant nutrients and improve soil structure this may be lower the plant height increment due to t1 and t2 as compared to t3 practically it was observed at field level that the cocoon water saving technologies used with tricel and oil were less biodegraded even after one year fig 4 the numbers of leaves per plant measured at one year after transplanting were significantly influenced by the treatments table 2 the highest mean numbers of leaves per mango plant were observed in t3 67 0 followed by t2 61 0 the lowest mean numbers of leaves per mango plant 17 0 at one year after transplanting was due to t5 within six months july 2019 to dec 2019 there was nearly more than three folds increment in the mean number of leaves per mango plant with response to t3 and slightly less than three folds due to t2 tables 1and 2 similarly there were significant differences in shoot length measured at one year after transplanting due to the treatments effects the highest shoot length 26 3 cm was measured from t3 whereas the lowest shoot length 6 5 cm was from the mango plants treated by t5 the shoot length measured from mango plants treated with t2 was slightly higher than that of t1 which could be associated with the differences in the level of their degradation and constant water supplying to the plant root in addition there were significant differences in the mean stem diameter of mango plants determined at one year after transplanting due to the effects of the treatments the highest stem diameter 4 83 cm of mango plant measured at one year after transplanting was due to t3 this was followed by the effect of t2 on stem diameter 4 17 cm the lowest stem diameter of mango plants 1 25 cm was measured due to t5 in the study area the increment in stem diameter after measurement taken at six months up to 12 months after transplanting july 2019 to dec 2019 due to the effect of t3 was 3 44 cm which is the fastest stem diameter growth as compared to the other treatments significant differences in crown widths of the mango plant measured at one year after transplanting were reported with respect to the treatment effects in a similar manner the highest crown width of the mango plants at one year after transplanting was measured from t3 45 3 cm followed by t2 40 3 cm on the contrary the lowest mean crown width value of the mango plant was measured from plants treated using t5 16 0 cm at one year after transplanting the result of t3 indicated that the best growth performance of the mango seedlings at one year after transplanting provided that if the site is free of termite otherwise termites can be destroyed the cocoon within less than 2 months 3 3 paired mean difference of growth parameters between two measurement periods in this study the paired mean differences between the same growth parameter of mango plant measured at one year and six months after transplanted showed significant differences table 3 for example the overall treatments effect on mean difference between plant height measured at one year and six months after transplanted is 29 6 cm this value is within the lower and upper confidence interval with acceptable standard error of mean 4 8 cm indicating that such result is representative for the target population at confidence level of 95 2 the same interpretation can be used for the remaining paired mean differences values of the parameters indicated in table 3 the implication of the significant difference of the paired mean differences of the growth parameter of mango transplanted seedlings between the two measurement periods is that the cocoon technology is not only important during the first six months of the dry season just after transplanted but also it has even better contribution to increase the growth of mango plants up to 12 months this could be related to the fact that the plant may use the biodegraded cocoon as source of nutrients and improving soil water holding capacity during the rainy season a well established seedling during the first six months after transplanted can develop a root system that has good capacity to use nutrients and soil water from the soil profile however further detail research should be conducted to know scientifically the reason for such significantly increment in the growth parameters after the six months of the mango seedling transplanted from the point of view of soil nutrient and water dynamics 3 4 synthesis of treatments effects on mango growth performance after transplanted this study demonstrated that the cocoon technology was effective in increasing the survival rate and growth performance of the transplanted mango seedlings six months after transplanting the cocoon technology with tricel t1 was superior and positively affecting the growth performance as compared to the other treatments however the increment in the growth of the mango seedlings one year after the transplanting was significantly higher in the cocoon without tricel and oil t3 than the other treatments also the three treatments of cocoon water saving technologies t1 t2 and t3 were all found to ensure the best survival rate the survival rate due to t4 was also as effective as the cocoon treatments but used much water and labor however t4 showed significantly lower values of the other growth performance indicators than the treatments with cocoon water saving technology in support of this result the existing reports have shown that the use of cocoon supports the current practices in nature restoration and sustainable agriculture as it has completely eliminated irrigation and enhanced the survival rates and vigor of young seedlings e g land life company llc 2015 2016 abdullah 2017 wei et al 2017 according to the report by union of agricultural committee uawc and fanack and land life company llc 2017 comparatively the cocoon uses on average a total of 25 l of water to achieve seedlings survival rates of 75 95 on olive and almond planted trees in the gaza strip this survival rate is lower than the present result on survival reported at six and 12 months after mango seedlings transplanting which was 100 with the cocoon water saving technologies this indicates that cocoon water saving technologies could support the seedlings to survive and grow in the dry months of a year cocoon stimulates plant roots to grow to a sufficient depth and use available water and nutrients from the soil profile on their own lampayan et al 2004 jaramillo et al 2015a b land life company llc 2019 the cocoon water saving technology was found effective and so preferred over the other treatments such as t4 due to the following observed points the first point is the use of cocoon reduces labor costs as water is added one time during the installation stage as compared to the manually irrigated at three days interval the cocoon eliminates the need for regular irrigation systems and so reducing significantly the labor costs related to water and its application on the seedlings transplanted on the contrary the experiences of farmers who involved on irrigation from small ponds and shallow wells in the tigray region and other regions of ethiopia showed that irrigation practice is expensive as demands intensive water and energy meaning it consumes high energy to extract and convey water as well as costs related to installation maintenance and removal of irrigation infrastructures secondly the amount of water being added to the cocoon technology is about 25 l in temperate zone and 50 l in tropical conditions refilled which is used for about six months in which this amount is by far lower than the manual irrigation thirdly water losses as a result of evaporation lateral and vertical flows beyond the root zone and water being used by weeds growing around the mango plants were very low with the cocoon as the structure of this technology prevents such losses fourthly once planting with cocoon water saving technology is finished it will not require maintenance or removal as cocoon will degrade within two years after installation land life company llc 2015 2016 land life company llc 2019 under such conditions the cocoon water saving technology enhances the survival rate and growth performance of the planted seedlings during the dry months otherwise the poor survival rate in the conventional approach means that efforts have to be undertaken for re planting that adds again a cost to a plantation program finally the collective effects of the above core points indicate that the cocoon water saving technology is sustainable and highly scalable for its application while planting with seedlings of suitable tree species such as mango seedling transplanted at large scale in the arid and semiarid degraded areas land life company llc 2015 2016 union of agricultural committee uawc and fanack and land life company llc 2017 similarly the cocoon water saving technology is effective in landscaping such as road sides and public parks as this reduces irrigation water consumption and labor costs for irrigation and irrigation system installations and maintenances wei et al 2017 on the basis of this study result in termite suspected sites it is suggested to use the cocoon water saving technology with tricel or used engine oil so that to protect from termite attacks over the lifetime of the cocoon however in such conditions it should be realized that the cocoon biodegradable status is going to be reduced so the expected contribution towards soil nutrient improvement may not be addressed in the presence of anti termite painting or spray on the exterior part of the cocoon hence plantations that are being planned to execute on degraded soils should be considered for the application of external organic fertilizer sources if we use cocoon with tricel or used engine oil as this reduces the cocoon biodegradability cabin 2007 jaramillo 2015 generally in agreement to the present findings of the cocoon water saving technology that influenced significantly on survival and growth performance of mango seedlings transplanted tapia et al 2019 have reported that the survival and growth of opuntia species plantings had improved by the water saving technology such as groasis waterboxx however the same authors have stated that the advantage of such technology is highly dependent upon the planting environmental conditions e g elevation vegetation zone precipitation and species types the implication is that it is better to emphasize on the species types and site specific conditions while selecting and applying the above water saving technology for successful plant restoration in the dry areas with degraded soils kulkarni 2011 jaramillo 2015 tapia et al 2019 in support of this the cocoon water saving technology could not contribute for the improvement of opuntia cacti growth and rather reduced the probability of the survival rate of the seedlings of opuntia plantings by 89 tapia et al 2019 one possible explanation is that opuntia cacti species have a short root depth which has not matched with the cocoon depth as compared to other species with deep roots tapia et al 2019 snyman 2005 under such condition this may reduce opuntia cacti roots access to the water stored in the cocoon land life company llc 2015 tapia et al 2019 on the other hand acacia macracantha with deeper roots had showed better success when planted with the cocoon water saving technology in the galápagos area kulkarni 2011 tapia et al 2019 such findings however do not undermine the contribution of cocoon for plant restoration purposes in water stressed degraded soils rather underlined the significant observation that water saving technologies should be considered on a case by case and tested with each species under various environmental conditions before planning expansive planting activities at large scale tapia et al 2019 4 conclusion this study revealed a 100 survival of the mango seedlings planted with cocoon water saving technologies t1 t2 and t3 whereas the seedlings planted without cocoon during the rainfall season t5 showed a survival rate of 20 at six and 12 months after transplanting the survival rate of mango seedling with manual irrigation t4 was also found to be 100 to select the best practice for improving seedling survival rate among the treatments understanding comparative advantage of cocoon and manual irrigation with respect to amount of water and labor is crucial for example the cocoon technology is water saving as uses small amount of water 25 l just applied at one time as compared to the manually irrigated at three days interval which requires much water and labor to achieve the same plant survival rate the growth performance indicators of mango plant height number of leaves per plant shoot length stem diameter and crown width measured at six and 12 months after transplanted were significantly influenced by the cocoon water saving technology the highest growth parameters were measured at six months after transplanting due to cocoon exterior part sprayed by tricel t1 whereas the lowest values were from t5 however the highest growth parameters measured at 12 months after transplanting were due to the effect of cocoon without tricel and oil i e 100 biodegradable cocoon t3 this could be attributed to the contribution of biodegraded cocoon towards soil nutrients and structure improvement in which the mango plants are being expected to use for growth the cocoon sprayed by tricel or painted using used engine oil increased the lifetime of the cocoon biodegradability even more than a year in such condition application of external sources of organic fertilizer is highly suggested as plantation on degraded soils suffers from lack of adequate soil nutrients for plant growth in areas whereby termite is not a problem the use of the cocoon without tricel and oil is highly recommended to improve the growth performance of mango seedlings plantation through improving water use efficiency and soil system while reducing losses of water and labor costs the use of the water saving cocoon technology reduces the amount of water applied and used by the mango trees after transplanted as compared to the traditional irrigation method in which this could save an additional advantage on the basis of this study the 100 biodegradable cocoon seems sustainable and highly scalable for its application with seedlings of mango tree species in termite free arid and semiarid degraded areas at large scale this technology is thus expected to be a solution for the problem related to poor survival rate and other growth parameters of planted tree species using the conventional approach in which this has been remained a critical problem for a longtime in the study area conditions finally this study underlines that water saving technology such as cocoon is a promising system as it has a profound influence on mango tree seedlings survival rate and plant growth performance in the degraded soils of the arid environment however this technology should not be assumed to function uniformly well in all environmental conditions and with all tree species before demonstrating on a pilot study pilot testing on extensive environmental conditions with degraded soils and different restoring species is essential before large scale planting efforts with cocoon water saving technology are planned and initiated a cost benefit analysis of the cocoon water saving technologies over the conventional practices on mango tree seedlings plantation should also be investigated conflict of interest

10401,rice oryza sativa has one of highest applied water footprints of any crop due in many cases to high percolation and lateral seepage rates in flooded rice fields better understanding the magnitude and variability of these subsurface water flows and their contribution to the rice field water balance is critical for efforts to reduce the water footprint of rice production and to limit the transport of pollutants to surface water and groundwater percolation was directly measured in eight direct seeded california rice fields that ranged from 20 to 61 clay and a complete water balance was developed for three of these fields for these latter fields directly measured percolation rates were compared to percolation calculated with darcy s law and combined percolation and lateral seepage calculated as the residual of a water balance was compared to directly measured values across eight fields cumulative percolation over the growing season ranged from 0 04 to 6 95 cm season 1 the mean cumulative percolation for the three water balance fields was 2 1 cm based on direct measurements compared to 3 2 cm based on darcy s law calculations combined percolation and lateral seepage calculated as the residual term of a water balance for the three fields was 17 1 cm compared to 4 4 cm based on direct measurements corresponding to 13 2 and 3 4 of water inputs respectively inputs were 98 99 from irrigation based on these results water management strategies that remove floodwater e g alternate wetting and drying would have limited potential to reduce water inputs in california rice production 0 7 2 7 cm season 1 furthermore using the most conservative largest estimates for each component of the water balance we conclude that the average water requirement for california rice fields is approximately 108 cm season 1 keywords california lateral seepage percolation rice water balance 1 introduction rice oryza sativa is grown on 160 million hectares worldwide predominantly under flooded conditions chauhan et al 2017 rice fields are estimated to receive 23 43 of all irrigation water worldwide despite accounting for only 10 of global cropland due in part to high percolation and lateral seepage losses under flooded conditions bouman et al 2007 grisp global rice science partnership 2013 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 percolation is the vertical flow of water to below the rice root zone and lateral seepage is the subsurface movement of water through the levees that border the rice fields bouman et al 2007 while percolation and lateral seepage can be significant components of the rice field water balance these subsurface flows are highly variable percolation rates varying from 0 01 6 12 cm d 1 or 4 363 cm season 1 have been reported in the literature corresponding to 5 87 of the total water inputs to the rice field cesari de maria et al 2016 darzi naftchali et al 2018 hatiye et al 2018 li et al 2017 mcdonald et al 2006 this is due to the myriad of edaphic and hydrologic factors that influence percolation including soil texture soil structure bulk density field water height and the groundwater elevation bouman et al 2007 percolation is an important factor controlling the transport of nitrate li et al 2018 xinchun et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 heavy metals xu et al 2013 yada et al 2008 salts chen et al 2013 and pesticides sudo et al 2018 watanabe et al 2006 to groundwater and for reducing the applied water footprint of rice production bouman et al 2007 cesari de maria et al 2017 darzi naftchali et al 2018 mohammad et al 2018 singh et al 2001 this latter point is of particular interest for california as growers and irrigation districts face increasing pressure to reduce applied water several studies have been conducted on intermittent irrigation or alternate wetting and drying awd as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from california rice fields carrijo et al 2018 2019 lahue et al 2016 yet the subsurface water losses that would determine whether awd can reduce irrigation water requirements are less well studied liang et al 2014 made laboratory measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity and concluded that nitrate leaching from california rice fields is minimal due in part to the low saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soils linquist et al 2015 measured irrigation rainfall evapotranspiration et and tailwater drainage grower controlled surface runoff concluding that combined percolation and lateral seepage the residual term in the water balance corresponded to 15 of water inputs or 26 3 cm per season however percolation and lateral seepage were not directly measured in that study and while direct measurements of lateral seepage through rice field levees have been published recently lahue and linquist 2019 percolation has never been directly measured in california rice fields water balances have been used to estimate subsurface water losses in rice fields by many studies due to the relative ease of measuring or estimating irrigation rainfall crop et and changes in soil moisture storage however estimating percolation and lateral seepage with a water balance has a few notable disadvantages first quantifying percolation and lateral seepage separately is challenging bouman et al 2007 for this reason most water balance studies either assume lateral seepage is negligible cesari de maria et al 2017 khepar et al 2000 mo allim et al 2018 singh et al 2001 lump percolation and lateral seepage together linquist et al 2015 mcdonald et al 2006 saptomo et al 2015 sudo et al 2018 or fail to mention lateral seepage altogether e g ahmad et al 2002 li et al 2017 mohammad et al 2018 xu et al 2013 yada et al 2008 second for fields with low percolation and lateral seepage rates bethune et al 2001 chen et al 2013 linquist et al 2015 errors in the measurement of larger water balance terms like irrigation inputs and crop et may lead to large relative errors in calculated percolation and lateral seepage rates direct point measurements of percolation or lateral seepage have their own limitations as they are labor intensive and it can be difficult to achieve sufficient replication to account for in field spatial variability it is therefore advisable to measure percolation and lateral seepage with multiple approaches such as direct measurements lysimeters percolation rings etc and water balance calculations or computer modeling so that a more reliable range of rates for these subsurface water flows can be determined agrawal et al 2004 bethune et al 2001 hatiye et al 2018 mo allim et al 2018 wopereis et al 1994 the objectives of this study were to characterize the magnitude and variability of percolation in california rice fields using multiple methodologies and to place subsurface water flows in the context of the rice field water balance to inform water management strategies it was hypothesized that cumulative percolation and lateral seepage calculated with the water balance would be comparable to direct measurements and that these subsurface water flows would be a small part of the overall water balance 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites direct percolation measurements were made during the 2017 growing season using percolation rings in seven commercial rice fields spread throughout the sacramento valley and at the california cooperative rice research foundation s rice experiment station in biggs ca sites were chosen to be representative of california rice fields and to ensure adequate geographic representation fig 1 table 1 a complete water balance all components were independently measured or calculated was developed for one of these sites in 2016 and 2017 site 2 and two additional sites in 2017 sites 3 and 4 that were located in irrigation districts that measured irrigation inputs at the field level fig 1 the sacramento valley receives about 50 cm of rainfall annually with the vast majority of this rainfall coming during the winter fallow season cimis 2018 several soil orders are present in the rice growing region though vertisols are the most prevalent and the soils in this study are representative of the region table 1 soils are generally formed on alluvial material from california s coast range and sierra nevada mountains and several sites in this study have restrictive layers cemented with silica that are present approximately 1 0 m below the soil surface table 1 localized perched groundwater is commonly observed in the vicinity of rice fields though connectivity between the perched and regional groundwater may be poor dickey et al 2013 2 2 direct percolation measurements a methodology to measure percolation was adapted from the international rice research institute s water requirement meter irri 1987 and seepage meters used in stream hydrology limnology and oceanography lee 1977 three percolation rings were installed in each of the eight fields soil survey data and manual soil sampling at the extremities of each field didn t reveal any significant in field soil heterogeneity the rings were made from 30 cm diameter beveled pvc rings that were inserted to 20 25 cm below the soil surface 5 15 cm into the plow pan which left 20 25 cm of the ring above the soil surface unlike the water requirement meters which measure combined et and percolation the percolation rings were covered with vented lids to minimize evaporation while allowing equilibration of air pressure a hole was drilled into one side of the ring just above the soil surface and a rubber stopper was inserted that connected to an external flexible 0 15 mm thick polyethylene bag attached to the ring s side which allowed hydraulic head to equilibrate between the ring and the field weekly ring water height measurements involved completely emptying the water in the bag into the ring and measuring the distance between the top of the ring and the water surface using a digital caliper with 0 01 mm accuracy and 0 02 mm precision mitutoyo corporation kawasaki japan despite the accuracy and precision of the caliper unavoidable user error in measuring small water height differences means that percolation rates of 0 03 mm day 1 should be interpreted with caution the water temperature in the ring and the field water height were also recorded percolation was recorded as the difference in ring water height between the last measurement and the current measurement after correcting for volume changes due to thermal expansion polyethylene bags were checked for leaks after each measurement was made and if any leak was found the measurement from the preceding interval was discarded the methodology used required a minimum water height of 5 cm early in the season low water levels occurred at most sites due to water management for stand establishment and herbicide applications therefore percolation measurements began 4 8 weeks after planting depending on the site and continued until the final drain for harvest 2 3 water balance the complete rice field water balance can be represented by eq 1 where the change in soil

irrigation input data was obtained from the richvale irrigation district site 2 reclamation district 108 site 3 and reclamation district 1004 site 4 discontinuous irrigation input measurements were made with a sontek flowtracker xylem inc rye brook ny at sites 2 and 3 every time inlet flow gates were adjusted and every few days between adjustments with piecewise constant interpolation based on the previous observation continuous irrigation input measurements were made with a mcpropeller digital flowmeter mccrometer inc hemet ca at site 4 rainfall and reference et were obtained from the nearest weather station cimis 2018 and crop et was calculated using crop coefficients developed for california rice production montazar et al 2017 tailwater drainage during maintenance flow a constant low level of irrigation and tailwater drainage to maintain uniform water levels and manage salinity was calculated based on water height over a sharp crested weir bureau of reclamation 2001 recorded with a global water wl16 water level logger xylem inc rye brook ny in certain instances the sharp crested weir could not be used to calculate drainage due to the need of the growers to drain the field as quickly as possible in these cases water height measurements were taken throughout the field 56 80 locations immediately prior to the drain to calculate the volume of water removed although the sharp crested weir was used to calculate the volume of the final drain for harvest at site 2 due to the slower drain at this site it was later determined that the assumptions of the sharp crested weir weren t met in 2017 and field water height immediately prior to the drain had to be extrapolated from localized water height measurements at the percolation rings and the piezometer nest lateral seepage was calculated as a weighted average for each of the three fields for which a complete water balance was developed based on the length of each border levee and lateral seepage rate measurements from lahue and linquist 2019 that included all border levees of the three fields lateral seepage rates were extrapolated for the duration of flooding at each field the rice plant root zone was estimated to be 0 25 cm and this was used as the control volume to partition percolation and changes in soil moisture storage soil samples were taken from 0 cm and 25 cm below the soil surface in three locations per field just before the initial flood and just prior to harvest dried to constant weight at 105 c and the difference between the initial and final water content of the samples converted to volumetric water content with the soil bulk density was used to calculate the change in root zone soil moisture over the course of the growing season percolation was directly measured as described in the previous section though at site 2 in 2016 it was only measured at one unequalized ring rather than three equalized rings similarly lateral seepage measurements were

screened interval and powdered bentonite clay was packed into the hole around the pvc pipe until it mounded around the soil surface the water height or hydraulic head in the piezometers was monitored manually over the course of the growing season the piezometers screened over the 30 40 cm interval were used to calculate the hydraulic head gradient through the root zone δh δz by subtracting the water height in the piezometer from the field water height and dividing by the distance between the soil surface and the midpoint of the screened interval the other piezometers were used to monitor

season ranged from 0 004 to 0 60 mm d 1 corresponding to 0 04 to 69 5 mm season 1 based on 115 flooded days during the season fig 2 table s1 percolation rates below 0 031 mm d 1 should be interpreted with caution especially negative rates due to the inherent difficulty in measuring these very small water height changes little temporal variability in percolation rates was observed at most sites fig 2 error bars for the white circles with the exception of site 8 and across all sites there was no correlation between percolation rates and time p 0 261 similarly there was little in field variability in percolation rates fig 2 error bars for the black circles piezometers showed that at some sites unsaturated zones in the soil profile persisted for most or all of the season sites 1 and 8 as evidenced by the lack of water in all piezometers at a particular depth or water levels below the top of the screened interval at the other end of the spectrum all piezometers at some sites sites 4 and 5 had water levels above the screened interval within a week after flooding indicating saturation of the entire soil profile that persisted until the drain for harvest fig 3 sites with unsaturated zones that persisted for more of the season tended to have higher percolation rates but with only one piezometer nest at each site the influence of unsaturated zones and hydraulic head below the root zone on percolation rates could not be separated from other site specific factors seasonal average percolation rates for individual rings were correlated with the logarithm of the saturated hydraulic

of the water inputs to the field mean 13 2 whereas in the latter case it corresponds to 2 6 4 7 of the water inputs to the field mean 3 4 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of measurement approaches percolation and lateral seepage were relatively small components of the water balance in this study regardless of the manner in which they were measured or calculated table 2 point measurements rings and calculations darcy flux of percolation for the water balance sites generally agreed with each other means 2 1 cm and 3 2 cm respectively but combined cumulative percolation and lateral seepage based on point measurements mean 4 4 cm was smaller than combined percolation and lateral seepage calculated as the residual of the water balance mean 17 1 cm point measurements of percolation may significantly underestimate percolation compared to water balance calculations in cases where small areas with high percolation rates have an outsized influence on the water balance calculations e g racz et al 2012 while in field variability with respect to soils based on initial soil samples and percolation was low it is possible that small areas of high permeability existed and resulted in higher percolation rates for the whole field although point measurements may underestimate percolation the water balance approach likely overestimates percolation for several reasons 1 lateral seepage rates are more likely to have been underestimated by the point measurements in lahue and linquist 2019 given the greater observed variability in rates and the possibility for increased spatial heterogeneity due to the vertical stratification of soils and greater macrofaunal activity near the soil surface 2 some of the larger water balance terms may be underestimated particularly crop et as the crop coefficients developed for california rice production by montazar et al 2017 are lower during the majority of the growing season than those reported by other studies and linquist et al 2015 reported consistently higher crop et values 5 cm and crop coefficients in california rice fields and 3 leaks are common in commercial rice fields such as preferential flow pathways around field outlets and more rarely flooding over the levees run off due to excess irrigation leaks are distinct from lateral seepage through levees and are unpredictable and unmeasurable by their nature based on the above points we believe that cumulative percolation and lateral seepage were overestimated by the water balance approach and underestimated by direct measurements as such these two methodologies likely provide a reliable range for these flows 4 2 implications for rice field water management rice growers in california are frequently under pressure to reduce the amount of water applied to rice fields especially during periods of drought despite being a promising practice to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and rice grain arsenic awd is unlikely to significantly reduce irrigation water requirements for california rice production given the percolation and lateral seepage rates reported in this study combined percolation and lateral seepage would be reduced by only 0 7 2 7 cm season 1 based on point measurements and the water balance respectively assuming the total duration of awd drain events is 19 days as in carrijo et al 2018 and lahue et al 2016 recent research has found that tailwater drainage can be eliminated in some california rice fields without increasing floodwater salinity to detrimental levels marcos et al 2018 if fields are managed in this way the irrigation water requirement will be determined by crop et subsurface water losses percolation and lateral seepage and changes in soil moisture storage given that the contribution of rainfall during the growing season is generally minimal we suggest that the minimum water input requirement is approximately 108 cm based on conservative mean crop et estimates 85 cm from linquist et al 2015 the mean change in soil moisture observed in this study 6 cm and percolation and lateral seepage estimated in this study using the more conservative water balance approach 17 cm importantly despite our efforts to get representative percolation measurements for sacramento valley rice fields any particular field may have edaphic or hydrologic factors that significantly alter its water balance and irrigation water requirement one question that has arisen in california rice production is whether changing groundwater levels can alter the rice field water balance while this study cannot specifically address that question we note that although the highest percolation rate observed occurred in a field with a large unsaturated zone in the soil profile throughout the season site 8 and although there was a general trend for higher cumulative percolation at sites with unsaturated zones that persisted for longer into the season figs 1 3 cumulative percolation at site 8 over the growing season was still small 7 cm compared to typical water inputs to california rice fields 137 cm johnson and cody 2015 furthermore restrictive layers and confined groundwater groundwater restricted from upward movement by the restrictive layer were observed at several of the sites table 1 suggesting that interaction between the episaturated zone and the groundwater may be limited in some locations it is therefore likely that changes in groundwater levels will have modest effects on percolation rates for most fields however dropping groundwater levels may increase percolation rates for fields that have both an episaturated zone that is well connected to the groundwater and soils with a higher saturated hydraulic conductivity more research is needed to characterize infiltration rates and changes in soil profile moisture content immediately after flooding especially as it relates to the groundwater elevation prior to flooding 5 conclusions and areas for further research this study explored the magnitude and variability of percolation rates in california rice fields and quantified the contribution of subsurface water flows to the rice field water balance with different methodologies direct measurements point calculations and water balance calculations higher percolation and lateral seepage rates were calculated by the water balance approach than were directly measured suggesting that more research is needed to characterize spatial variability of subsurface water flows in rice fields and to determine the contribution of leaks to the rice field water balance large preferential flow pathways due to macrofaunal activity or poor contact between soil and field inlet or outlet structures nevertheless cumulative percolation and lateral seepage were small compared to total water inputs suggesting that efforts to reduce irrigation input requirements may be better focused on reducing tailwater drainage or crop et e g shorter duration cultivars the magnitude of these subsurface water flows also suggests that dropping groundwater levels are unlikely to significantly alter the contribution of percolation and lateral seepage to the water balance except in fields with relatively coarse textured soils and high saturated hydraulic conductivity however given that direct measurements of percolation and lateral seepage were not possible during the first few weeks of the growing season due to methodological constraints future studies should look at infiltration during the initial flooding of fields and the relationship between these infiltration rates and the depth to

10401,rice oryza sativa has one of highest applied water footprints of any crop due in many cases to high percolation and lateral seepage rates in flooded rice fields better understanding the magnitude and variability of these subsurface water flows and their contribution to the rice field water balance is critical for efforts to reduce the water footprint of rice production and to limit the transport of pollutants to surface water and groundwater percolation was directly measured in eight direct seeded california rice fields that ranged from 20 to 61 clay and a complete water balance was developed for three of these fields for these latter fields directly measured percolation rates were compared to percolation calculated with darcy s law and combined percolation and lateral seepage calculated as the residual of a water balance was compared to directly measured values across eight fields cumulative percolation over the growing season ranged from 0 04 to 6 95 cm season 1 the mean cumulative percolation for the three water balance fields was 2 1 cm based on direct measurements compared to 3 2 cm based on darcy s law calculations combined percolation and lateral seepage calculated as the residual term of a water balance for the three fields was 17 1 cm compared to 4 4 cm based on direct measurements corresponding to 13 2 and 3 4 of water inputs respectively inputs were 98 99 from irrigation based on these results water management strategies that remove floodwater e g alternate wetting and drying would have limited potential to reduce water inputs in california rice production 0 7 2 7 cm season 1 furthermore using the most conservative largest estimates for each component of the water balance we conclude that the average water requirement for california rice fields is approximately 108 cm season 1 keywords california lateral seepage percolation rice water balance 1 introduction rice oryza sativa is grown on 160 million hectares worldwide predominantly under flooded conditions chauhan et al 2017 rice fields are estimated to receive 23 43 of all irrigation water worldwide despite accounting for only 10 of global cropland due in part to high percolation and lateral seepage losses under flooded conditions bouman et al 2007 grisp global rice science partnership 2013 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 percolation is the vertical flow of water to below the rice root zone and lateral seepage is the subsurface movement of water through the levees that border the rice fields bouman et al 2007 while percolation and lateral seepage can be significant components of the rice field water balance these subsurface flows are highly variable percolation rates varying from 0 01 6 12 cm d 1 or 4 363 cm season 1 have been reported in the literature corresponding to 5 87 of the total water inputs to the rice field cesari de maria et al 2016 darzi naftchali et al 2018 hatiye et al 2018 li et al 2017 mcdonald et al 2006 this is due to the myriad of edaphic and hydrologic factors that influence percolation including soil texture soil structure bulk density field water height and the groundwater elevation bouman et al 2007 percolation is an important factor controlling the transport of nitrate li et al 2018 xinchun et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 heavy metals xu et al 2013 yada et al 2008 salts chen et al 2013 and pesticides sudo et al 2018 watanabe et al 2006 to groundwater and for reducing the applied water footprint of rice production bouman et al 2007 cesari de maria et al 2017 darzi naftchali et al 2018 mohammad et al 2018 singh et al 2001 this latter point is of particular interest for california as growers and irrigation districts face increasing pressure to reduce applied water several studies have been conducted on intermittent irrigation or alternate wetting and drying awd as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from california rice fields carrijo et al 2018 2019 lahue et al 2016 yet the subsurface water losses that would determine whether awd can reduce irrigation water requirements are less well studied liang et al 2014 made laboratory measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity and concluded that nitrate leaching from california rice fields is minimal due in part to the low saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soils linquist et al 2015 measured irrigation rainfall evapotranspiration et and tailwater drainage grower controlled surface runoff concluding that combined percolation and lateral seepage the residual term in the water balance corresponded to 15 of water inputs or 26 3 cm per season however percolation and lateral seepage were not directly measured in that study and while direct measurements of lateral seepage through rice field levees have been published recently lahue and linquist 2019 percolation has never been directly measured in california rice fields water balances have been used to estimate subsurface water losses in rice fields by many studies due to the relative ease of measuring or estimating irrigation rainfall crop et and changes in soil moisture storage however estimating percolation and lateral seepage with a water balance has a few notable disadvantages first quantifying percolation and lateral seepage separately is challenging bouman et al 2007 for this reason most water balance studies either assume lateral seepage is negligible cesari de maria et al 2017 khepar et al 2000 mo allim et al 2018 singh et al 2001 lump percolation and lateral seepage together linquist et al 2015 mcdonald et al 2006 saptomo et al 2015 sudo et al 2018 or fail to mention lateral seepage altogether e g ahmad et al 2002 li et al 2017 mohammad et al 2018 xu et al 2013 yada et al 2008 second for fields with low percolation and lateral seepage rates bethune et al 2001 chen et al 2013 linquist et al 2015 errors in the measurement of larger water balance terms like irrigation inputs and crop et may lead to large relative errors in calculated percolation and lateral seepage rates direct point measurements of percolation or lateral seepage have their own limitations as they are labor intensive and it can be difficult to achieve sufficient replication to account for in field spatial variability it is therefore advisable to measure percolation and lateral seepage with multiple approaches such as direct measurements lysimeters percolation rings etc and water balance calculations or computer modeling so that a more reliable range of rates for these subsurface water flows can be determined agrawal et al 2004 bethune et al 2001 hatiye et al 2018 mo allim et al 2018 wopereis et al 1994 the objectives of this study were to characterize the magnitude and variability of percolation in california rice fields using multiple methodologies and to place subsurface water flows in the context of the rice field water balance to inform water management strategies it was hypothesized that cumulative percolation and lateral seepage calculated with the water balance would be comparable to direct measurements and that these subsurface water flows would be a small part of the overall water balance 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites direct percolation measurements were made during the 2017 growing season using percolation rings in seven commercial rice fields spread throughout the sacramento valley and at the california cooperative rice research foundation s rice experiment station in biggs ca sites were chosen to be representative of california rice fields and to ensure adequate geographic representation fig 1 table 1 a complete water balance all components were independently measured or calculated was developed for one of these sites in 2016 and 2017 site 2 and two additional sites in 2017 sites 3 and 4 that were located in irrigation districts that measured irrigation inputs at the field level fig 1 the sacramento valley receives about 50 cm of rainfall annually with the vast majority of this rainfall coming during the winter fallow season cimis 2018 several soil orders are present in the rice growing region though vertisols are the most prevalent and the soils in this study are representative of the region table 1 soils are generally formed on alluvial material from california s coast range and sierra nevada mountains and several sites in this study have restrictive layers cemented with silica that are present approximately 1 0 m below the soil surface table 1 localized perched groundwater is commonly observed in the vicinity of rice fields though connectivity between the perched and regional groundwater may be poor dickey et al 2013 2 2 direct percolation measurements a methodology to measure percolation was adapted from the international rice research institute s water requirement meter irri 1987 and seepage meters used in stream hydrology limnology and oceanography lee 1977 three percolation rings were installed in each of the eight fields soil survey data and manual soil sampling at the extremities of each field didn t reveal any significant in field soil heterogeneity the rings were made from 30 cm diameter beveled pvc rings that were inserted to 20 25 cm below the soil surface 5 15 cm into the plow pan which left 20 25 cm of the ring above the soil surface unlike the water requirement meters which measure combined et and percolation the percolation rings were covered with vented lids to minimize evaporation while allowing equilibration of air pressure a hole was drilled into one side of the ring just above the soil surface and a rubber stopper was inserted that connected to an external flexible 0 15 mm thick polyethylene bag attached to the ring s side which allowed hydraulic head to equilibrate between the ring and the field weekly ring water height measurements involved completely emptying the water in the bag into the ring and measuring the distance between the top of the ring and the water surface using a digital caliper with 0 01 mm accuracy and 0 02 mm precision mitutoyo corporation kawasaki japan despite the accuracy and precision of the caliper unavoidable user error in measuring small water height differences means that percolation rates of 0 03 mm day 1 should be interpreted with caution the water temperature in the ring and the field water height were also recorded percolation was recorded as the difference in ring water height between the last measurement and the current measurement after correcting for volume changes due to thermal expansion polyethylene bags were checked for leaks after each measurement was made and if any leak was found the measurement from the preceding interval was discarded the methodology used required a minimum water height of 5 cm early in the season low water levels occurred at most sites due to water management for stand establishment and herbicide applications therefore percolation measurements began 4 8 weeks after planting depending on the site and continued until the final drain for harvest 2 3 water balance the complete rice field water balance can be represented by eq 1 where the change in soil

irrigation input data was obtained from the richvale irrigation district site 2 reclamation district 108 site 3 and reclamation district 1004 site 4 discontinuous irrigation input measurements were made with a sontek flowtracker xylem inc rye brook ny at sites 2 and 3 every time inlet flow gates were adjusted and every few days between adjustments with piecewise constant interpolation based on the previous observation continuous irrigation input measurements were made with a mcpropeller digital flowmeter mccrometer inc hemet ca at site 4 rainfall and reference et were obtained from the nearest weather station cimis 2018 and crop et was calculated using crop coefficients developed for california rice production montazar et al 2017 tailwater drainage during maintenance flow a constant low level of irrigation and tailwater drainage to maintain uniform water levels and manage salinity was calculated based on water height over a sharp crested weir bureau of reclamation 2001 recorded with a global water wl16 water level logger xylem inc rye brook ny in certain instances the sharp crested weir could not be used to calculate drainage due to the need of the growers to drain the field as quickly as possible in these cases water height measurements were taken throughout the field 56 80 locations immediately prior to the drain to calculate the volume of water removed although the sharp crested weir was used to calculate the volume of the final drain for harvest at site 2 due to the slower drain at this site it was later determined that the assumptions of the sharp crested weir weren t met in 2017 and field water height immediately prior to the drain had to be extrapolated from localized water height measurements at the percolation rings and the piezometer nest lateral seepage was calculated as a weighted average for each of the three fields for which a complete water balance was developed based on the length of each border levee and lateral seepage rate measurements from lahue and linquist 2019 that included all border levees of the three fields lateral seepage rates were extrapolated for the duration of flooding at each field the rice plant root zone was estimated to be 0 25 cm and this was used as the control volume to partition percolation and changes in soil moisture storage soil samples were taken from 0 cm and 25 cm below the soil surface in three locations per field just before the initial flood and just prior to harvest dried to constant weight at 105 c and the difference between the initial and final water content of the samples converted to volumetric water content with the soil bulk density was used to calculate the change in root zone soil moisture over the course of the growing season percolation was directly measured as described in the previous section though at site 2 in 2016 it was only measured at one unequalized ring rather than three equalized rings similarly lateral seepage measurements were conducted on only one border levee using the methodology outlined in lahue and linquist 2019 however measured percolation and lateral seepage values were comparable between years 2 4 soil analyses

of the water inputs to the field mean 13 2 whereas in the latter case it corresponds to 2 6 4 7 of the water inputs to the field mean 3 4 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of measurement approaches percolation and lateral seepage were relatively small components of the water balance in this study regardless of the manner in which they were measured or calculated table 2 point measurements rings and calculations darcy flux of percolation for the water balance sites generally agreed with each other means 2 1 cm and 3 2 cm respectively but combined cumulative percolation and lateral seepage based on point measurements mean 4 4 cm was smaller than combined percolation and lateral seepage calculated as the residual of the water balance mean 17 1 cm point measurements of percolation may significantly underestimate percolation compared to water balance calculations in cases where small areas with high percolation rates have an outsized influence on the water balance calculations e g racz et al 2012 while in field variability with respect to soils based on initial soil samples and percolation was low it is possible that small areas of high permeability existed and resulted in higher percolation rates for the whole field although point measurements may underestimate percolation the water balance approach likely overestimates percolation for several reasons 1 lateral seepage rates are more likely to have been underestimated by the point measurements in lahue and linquist 2019 given the greater observed variability in rates and the possibility for increased spatial heterogeneity due to the vertical stratification of soils and greater macrofaunal activity near the soil surface 2 some of the larger water balance terms may be underestimated particularly crop et as the crop coefficients developed for california rice production by montazar et al 2017 are lower during the majority of the growing season than those reported by other studies and linquist et al 2015 reported consistently higher crop et values 5 cm and crop coefficients in california rice fields and 3 leaks are common in commercial rice fields such as preferential flow pathways around field outlets and more rarely flooding over the levees run off due to excess irrigation leaks are distinct from lateral seepage through levees and are unpredictable and unmeasurable by their nature based on the above points we believe that cumulative percolation and lateral seepage were overestimated by the water balance approach and underestimated by direct measurements as such these two methodologies likely provide a reliable range for these flows 4 2 implications for rice field water management rice growers in california are frequently under pressure to reduce the amount of water applied to rice fields especially during periods of drought despite being a promising practice to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and rice grain arsenic awd is unlikely to significantly reduce irrigation water requirements for california rice production given the percolation and lateral seepage rates reported in this study combined percolation and lateral seepage would be reduced by only 0 7 2 7 cm season 1 based on point measurements and the water balance respectively assuming the total duration of awd drain events is 19 days as in carrijo et al 2018 and lahue et al 2016 recent research has found that tailwater drainage can be eliminated in some california rice fields without increasing floodwater salinity to detrimental levels marcos et al 2018 if fields are managed in this way the irrigation water requirement will be determined by crop et subsurface water losses percolation and lateral seepage and changes in soil moisture storage given that the contribution of rainfall during the growing season is generally minimal we suggest that the minimum water input requirement is approximately 108 cm based on conservative mean crop et estimates 85 cm from linquist et al 2015 the mean change in soil moisture observed in this study 6 cm and percolation and lateral seepage estimated in this study using the more conservative water balance approach 17 cm importantly despite our efforts to get representative percolation measurements for sacramento valley rice fields any particular field may have edaphic or hydrologic factors that significantly alter its water balance and irrigation water requirement one question that has arisen in california rice production is whether changing groundwater levels can alter the rice field water balance while this study cannot specifically address that question we note that although the highest percolation rate observed occurred in a field with a large unsaturated zone in the soil profile throughout the season site 8 and although there was a general trend for higher cumulative percolation at sites with unsaturated zones that persisted for longer into the season figs 1 3 cumulative percolation at site 8 over the growing season was still small 7 cm compared to typical water inputs to california rice fields 137 cm johnson and cody 2015 furthermore restrictive layers and confined groundwater groundwater restricted from upward movement by the restrictive layer were observed at several of the sites table 1 suggesting that interaction between the episaturated zone and the groundwater may be limited in some locations it is therefore likely that changes in groundwater levels will have modest effects on percolation rates for most fields however dropping groundwater levels may increase percolation rates for fields that have both an episaturated zone that is well connected to the groundwater and soils with a higher saturated hydraulic conductivity more research is needed to characterize infiltration rates and changes in soil profile moisture content immediately after flooding especially as it relates to the groundwater elevation prior to flooding 5 conclusions and areas for further research this study explored the magnitude and variability of percolation rates in california rice fields and quantified the contribution of subsurface water flows to the rice field water balance with different methodologies direct measurements point calculations and water balance calculations higher percolation and lateral seepage rates were calculated by the water balance approach than were directly measured suggesting that more research is needed to characterize spatial variability of subsurface water flows in rice fields and to determine the contribution of leaks to the rice field water balance large preferential flow pathways due to macrofaunal activity or poor contact between soil and field inlet or outlet structures nevertheless cumulative percolation and lateral seepage were small compared to total water inputs suggesting that efforts to reduce irrigation input requirements may be better focused on reducing tailwater drainage or crop et e g shorter duration cultivars the magnitude of these subsurface water flows also suggests that dropping groundwater levels are unlikely to significantly alter the contribution of percolation and lateral seepage to the water balance except in fields with relatively coarse textured soils and high saturated hydraulic conductivity however given that direct measurements of percolation and lateral seepage were not possible during the first few weeks of the growing season due to methodological constraints future studies should look at infiltration during the initial flooding of fields and the relationship between these infiltration rates and the depth to

10402,this study comprehensively used remote sensing rs and gis for independently monitoring crop water adequacy in response to existing irrigation management system in bari doab pakistan canals rotation plan is developed before start of each cropping season to distribute water on fixed turn basis the study combines the moderate landsat 8 and low resolution modis satellite imagery to assess near real time crop water deficit in canal command areas ccas of the study area landsat imagery were used to develop crop classification and determine cropping pattern using time series of ndvi modis ndvi product was employed to monitor the current crop health and develop annual reference ndvi cycle based on last 13 years imagery climatic data of wmo stations combined with dem have also been used to determine reference evapotranspiration based on penman monteith method these inputs were combined to estimate average crop water deficit in ccas for ongoing cropping season on 08 day interval the interval parallel to the canal rotation plan rs based reflectance crop coefficients kcr of current and reference crop cycle were developed to calculate potential and actual evapotranspiration and then translated their difference into crop water deficit lag time of 08 10 days is limitation of the study due to satellites overpass time but it can still prove very helpful considering the crop season spanned over 160 180 days results revealed that maximum crop water deficit up to 9 mm occurred in ccas during crop growing mid stage crop water deficit showed inverse relation when plotted against intense rainfall months crop water deficit results could be helpful for irrigation managers to modify canals rotation plan in near real time according to crop health and growing stage it would not only help in achieving equitable water distribution but also assuring supplies when required by the crops keywords crop water deficit remote sensing evapotranspiration ndvi normalized difference vegetation index crop coefficients canal command area 1 introduction a large part of world s growing population is dependent on irrigated agriculture and it consumes more than half about 56 of the global fresh water willer et al 2008 climate change and other factors including deteriorating water quality depleting groundwater resources and growing industrial and domestics demands are limiting water availability for irrigation rosegrant et al 2010 globally gap between supply and demand of irrigation water is expected to become high by the end of 2050 majorly caused by the population growth de fraiture and wichelns 2010d therefore irrigated agriculture will be affected by concerns and issues over scarcity of water hu et al 2016 a large amount of irrigation water get wasted or not managed efficiently to meet crop water requirement for achieving potential crop yield pereira et al 2012 thus irrigation management authorities must aim to increase the expertise of monitoring and quantifying crop water demand consumption and deficit rather than calculating supplied irrigation water only this can improve water productivity and efficiency as well qu et al 2015 pakistan is one of the countries facing severe shortage of irrigation water although the country uses 90 of fresh water for agriculture purposes rahut et al 2016 major sources of fresh water in the country including himalayan s glaciers and aquifers are depleting at enormous rate while global temperature rise and decrease in effective precipitation intensify the water scarcity situation qureshi et al 2010 annual water availability in the indus basin irrigation system ibis is already towards decline and has squeezed from 130 million acre feet maf to 120 maf by comparing average inflows of 1976 2000 and 2001 2016 respectively qureshi 2011a canal irrigation system which feeds about 80 of the agriculture land in pakistan is facing a rising trend in water shortages and is projected about 32 shortfall in annual supplies by 2025 qureshi 2011b canal water is supplied to the agriculture land on 08 daily rotation basis by implying the principal of equitable distribution fix amount of canal water per unit of land is supplied to the farmers irrespective of the type of crop grown shah et al 2016 rotation plan is developed at start of each crop season i e winter rabi and summer kharif normally secondary canals off taking from the main canal are divided into 03 groups and water is released in these groups on first second and third priority on 08 daily bases there is no scientific method adopted by the irrigation department to monitor canals fulfilling crop water demand and rotation plan is followed inflexibly shah et al 2016 there is a strong need to introduce new strategies and mechanisms to improve water use efficiency and productivity to ensure optimum use of irrigation water shah et al 2006 knowledge of crop water demand consumption and deficit are interlinked with each other and associated with crop specific evapotranspiration et characteristics allen et al 2011 et requirements are typically expressed in terms of crop coefficient kc values for different crops and their growing stages under various climatic conditions allen et al 2001 to calculate et particularly potential evapotranspiration pet there exist a wide range of different field methods and empirical equations abdelhadi et al 2000 djaman et al 2019 compared and evaluated 34 equations of measuring pet by taking most worldwide acceptable and fao s recommended penman monteith p m method as reference they concluded p m equation of pet petpen demonstrated good results even under limited missing parameters like solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 is also well known and most simple method to calculate pet pethar but it underestimates and overestimates pet under wind speed more than 3 m s and high relative humidity respectively allen et al 1998 all of these methods are not suitable for spatial analyses mainly due to limitations in spatial availability of required variables ahmad et al 2009 an accurate assessment of et and pet requires spatial detail of several parameters such as crop classification climatic parameters and kc values at different growing stages and climatic conditions bastiaanssen et al 2005 therefore rs datasets and gis techniques are increasingly used to model various crop water requirement parameters in spatial domain and their monitoring in near real time manner due to wide coverage range and regular temporal data availability allen et al 2007 yousaf et al 2018 there are two basic approaches that are commonly proposed for monitoring water efficiency of irrigated crops thorough remote sensing rs data courault et al 2005 first approach is based on normalized difference vegetation index ndvi in which reflectance based crop coefficients kcr are obtained through regression calculations between local ndvi crop cycles and fao defined crop coefficients glenn et al 2011 second method based on a series of satellite derived physical measurements calculates actual evapotranspiration via surface heat budget e g metric alexi disalexi sebal allen et al 2005 anderson et al 2011 bastiaanssen et al 2005 both methods have been successfully implemented in different regions of the world to estimate et allen et al 2007 tasumi et al 2005 zwart and bastiaanssen 2007 a major requirement of the second method is ground station based meteorological data whom availability and accessibility is usually limited particularly in developing countries tang et al 2009 although the estimation of et from these schemes is very useful for planning studies where backdated assessments are required but have relatively less potential in data limited regions for near real time decision making peschechera et al 2019 highlighted the adaptive capability of kcr in different climatic and specific field conditions as compared to standard crop coefficients approach crop water need or deficit additional requirement can be calculated as the difference of ndvi based et of current crop eta and the crop under ideal condition pet kumar and rajan 2014 successful applications at basin scale have been reported from the guadalquivir river basin in southern spain gonzález dugo et al 2013 and from northern italy rossi et al 2010 this research briefly highlights the use of rs and gis technology to estimate crop water deficit in canal command areas ccas at intervals parallel to the pid s 8 day rotation plan water deficit monitoring on near real time basis can be helpful for irrigation managers to ensure better water allocation by making adjustments in ongoing rotation plan limitation of 08 10 days lag time in availability of satellite imagery will not impact much for making adjustments in canal water allocation while monitoring the cropping season spanned over 160 180 days the main objective of this piece of work is to introduce flexibility in static rotation plans being practiced by pid since decades by monitoring crop health using satellite technology based on open source data the results can also help to promote guided groundwater abstraction by farmers incase canal water is insufficient to meet crop water demand which would eventually reduce excessive groundwater pumping being considered as one of the major issue in the study area basharat and tariq 2014 2 study area the study area chosen for this research is bari doab of punjab province in pakistan it is situated in ibis and bears canal water shortages up to 32 nawaz et al 2016 bari doab in pakistan side of border exists between ravi and sutlej rivers as doab meaning land between two rivers it is one of the most fertile agriculture region of south asia and is second largest irrigation system in punjab province basharat and tariq 2014 the study area is intensely cultivated covering an area about 22 750 km2 81 having majors crops of wheat rice maize sugarcane and orchards basharat 2012 the major part of the study area experiences double cropping practice ibis was designed in such a way that canal supply shortages are distributed in all ccas on equity basis through warabandi system rotational plan anwar et al 2016 rest of the water demand is fulfilled by groundwater pumping from the underlying unconfined aquifer awan et al 2016 main source of water of the ibis originates from snow and glacier melt in the himalayans discharged by the western rivers indus jhelum and chenab and eastern rivers ravi and sutlej eastern rivers have very insignificant contribution in the annual water availability for agriculture use in ibis being in administrative control of india according to indus water treaty iwt water is diverted from western rivers to the eastern rivers through network of link canals to meet crop demand which increases importance of careful management of the scarce water available in the bari doab the annual mean rainfall of study area ranges between 200 350 mm from east to west while most of the precipitation normally occurs during monsoon july to august ashraf et al 2010 temperature increases towards west of the doab while the mean minimum and maximum temperature ranges are 6 10 c and 32 36 c respectively bari doab fig 1 is comprised of 08 main canals 06 link canals 19 branch canals and about 823 small canals spread on length of 348 243 452 and 823 miles respectively 3 materials methods all the calculations regarding crop water deficit assessment were performed in model builder arc gis 10 5 using different spatial and statistical tools fig 2 shows the research flow diagram highlighting used input datasets and various processing procedures adopted to calculate crop water deficit 3 1 data sources 3 1 1 digital elevation model dem dem was used to extract aspect slope and elevation characteristics of land cover features for top of atmosphere toa calculation through gis techniques global multi resolution terrain elevation data 2010 gmted2010 of 7 5 arc sec 225 m was used danielson and gesh 2011 gmted2010 is relatively low resolution as compare to commonly used srtm 30 m but was used due to two factors one was the low elevation gradient of study area and the second was to make the model modifiable to apply at provincial or regional level with minimum resources and data processing time 3 1 2 landsat 8 imagery calculation of the individual water needs of different crops were required to be considered for producing accurate results land cover land use classification was performed to distinguish major crops grown during winter and summer cropping seasons which was only feasible through satellite imagery the basic requirements for suitable images selection included the spatial resolution that needs to be comparable with typical field size of the study area and the repetitive data acquisition to allow multiple observations of crops stages at required interval landsat 8 30 m data was used for crop classification a mosaic of 4 landsat images was needed to cover the study area as shown in fig 3 ndvi time series analysis of the study area was performed for the whole monitoring period covering both cropping seasons 80 landsat scenes were used in the process images with significant cloud cover were replaced by images of preceding years to fill the gaps in data characteristics of landsat scenes used in the research are mentioned in table 1 3 1 3 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis imagery landsat and modis terra aqua satellite imagery are capable to be used for definition of kcr as well as continuous monitoring of crops both imageries offer the comprehensive spectral ranges bands to calculate the parameters for either approach i e ndvi and actual evapotranspiration eta revisiting time for landsat is 16 days while modis imagery is available on daily basis with the later also offering prepared data products for different time intervals the availability of a good quality landsat image every 16 days is rather unlikely as a matter of cloud coverage marchane et al 2015 irregular image drop outs result inhomogeneous temporal monitoring pattern despite having relative low resolution as compare to landsat 30 m modis 250 imagery were chosen for continuous crop monitoring due to frequent data availability and its temporally stable composited products it is important to mention that operational satellite derived products and models on actual evapotranspiration and assessing crop water needs are still in development stage and need to be improved mu et al 2011 tadesse et al 2015 hence modis average ndvi product mod13q1 myd13q1 with 8 days alternative temporal availability total 46 intervals per year were used to calculate et of current in near real time crops the same ndvi product was also used to extract reference maximum ndvi cycle from 2003 to 2016 total 598 images of each period to calculate reference evapotranspiration pet of each crop two modis foot prints were used at one time to fully cover the study area as specified in table 2 and shown graphically in fig 3 3 1 4 temperature daily maximum and daily minimum temperature inputs required in eqs 8 and 9 are spatially interpolated weather station records temperature data used in the study belongs to the global surface summary of the day gsod data set that can be downloaded freely from the ncdc web site sparks et al 2017 lott 1998 geographical location of the wmo weather stations used in the study is shown in fig 3 the number of station records may vary and cause some bias in the temporal comparability of interpolated temperatures due to inconsistent reporting of data by countries this is unavoidable in practical scenario however flat topography of the study area reduces its impact and it is considered to be of only minor influence as long as record availability is evenly distributed across the region van wart et al 2013 zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 3 2 data processing 3 2 1 interpolation of temperature data temperature data downloaded from ncdc comes as a raw text file having station id along with daily minimum and daily maximum temperature values station ids were used to assign location coordinates lat long for converting it to gis friendly format temperature units were converted from fahrenheit to celsius and converted values were projected to sea level using lapse rate of 6 5 c per 1000 m and scaling back temperature values to their specific elevations using dem kim et al 2008 in model builder of arc map inverse distance weighting idw arcmap technique is used for spatial interpolation of temperature data with a flexible radius and a minimum of six stations were used during interpolation 3 2 2 crop classification in order to obtain spatial spread and quantitative measurement of crops in the study area land cover land use classification was performed using ndvi times series derived from landsat 8 images dated sep 2015 to nov 2016 ndvi images were developed using near infrared nir and red spectral bands of landsat 8 imagery sandholt et al 2002 by using the eq 1 mentioned below 1 n o r m a l i s e d v e g e t a t i o n i n d e x n d v i n e a r i n f r a r e d r e d n e a r i n f r a r e d r e d the ndvi time series curve is considered representation of crop phenology cycle and its shape pattern is used for crop identification wang et al 2018 apart from crop types bare soil built up area natural vegetation and water bodies were also distinguished the fourier component classifier algorithm was used for crop classification in which classification performed on the basis of how similar the annual ndvi patterns are as compare to reference cycle evans and geerken 2006 geerken et al 2005 auxiliary information collected from field surveys crop calendar high resolution google earth imagery agriculture statistics books and maps were used to identify suitable crop reference cycles as seen in fig 4 crop classification fig 5 showed double cropping pattern in major part of the study area wheat is the most dominant crop in winter season covering approximately 85 of the total cultivated area maize cotton and rice were identified as major crops of the summer season covering approximate area of 43 30 and 06 of total cultivated area respectively orchards and sugarcane were also identified separately from winter and summer crops as they need irrigation water throughout the year table 3 accuracy assessment of crop classification resulted in overall kappa statistics and accuracy percentage of 0 81 and 82 50 respectively the slight compromise in accuracy is due to spectral and blooming seasonal overlaps between different classes e g mixing of orchard and crops with natural vegetation trees grasses etc 3 2 3 integrating landsat crop classification into modis crop water need monitoring the difference in modis s spatial resolution and actual field size and size variability may result error in estimation of crop water requirement particularly where various crops fall within a single pixel of modis a modis pixel 250 m2 covers approximately 70 pixels of landsat 30 m2 image to reduce such influence crop types were classified using ndvi time series of landsat satellite and the result integrated into the crop irrigation water need assessment this was achieved by calculating the fraction each surface type crop occupies within a modis pixel knowing each crop types contribution to a modis pixel the water needs in this modis pixel can be calculated not only taking into account their distinct crop coefficients but also their spatial coverage fig 6 because the classification of landsat ndvi time series is a time consuming effort the classification could be repeatedly applied over the following years without any modification this assumes that there aren t any significant changes in cropped areas fallow areas in crop types and in cropping patterns this assumption may not be entirely true however an analysis of 13 years of modis time series suggests that inter annual changes in cropping pattern are minor 3 3 calculation of crop water needs crop water requirement can be expressed as the amount of water required to fulfill the plant water consumption due to et allen et al 2006 et is considered as amount of water consumed by plants due to transpiration and evaporation losses occurring from soil and water bodies rate of et depends upon climate characteristics crop type and its growing stages pereira et al 2015 water needs of individual crop are calculated in terms of crop coefficients kc defined in fao 65 publication er raki et al 2010 2 k c e t c e t 0 where et0 is the reference et represents the et of well watered grassy surface reference and etc refers to the crop under standard conditions the values of kc at different growth stages of crop were defined by allen et al 2006 through ground measurement as seen in fig 7 to calculate etc under standard conditions using single coefficient approach eq 2 can be written as 3 e t c e t 0 k c reflectance based crop coefficients kcr bausch 1987 toureiro et al 2017 can be calculated as 4 k c r c 1 n d v i c 2 where c1 and c2 are coefficients derived through regression analysis between kc and ndvi bausch 1987 each crop has different value of c1 and c2 coefficients therefore need to be calculated separately smaller ndvi values resulted in smaller kcr values while larger ndvi values produced larger kcr values replacing kc with kcr and et0 with pet eq 3 can be written as 5 e t c e t 0 k c r calculating the difference between two kcr i e current and reference and multiplying it by et0 pet gives the irrigation water need iw in millimeters mm kamble et al 2013 6 i w k c r r e f k c r c u r e t 0 m m kcr ref and kcr cur are associated with well performing crop without water stress and current monitoring crop respectively these kcrs are extracted from reference ndvi cycle and ndvi of current monitoring crop using modis ndvi products hargreaves approach was used to calculate pet et0 in mm which requires minimum maximum and mean temperature values and top of atmosphere radiation as inputs hargreaves and samani 1985 tomas burguera et al 2017 7 p e t 0 0023 r e s t m e a n 17 8 t m a x t m i n m m where res is the equivalent of extraterrestrial solar radiation in water depth mm tmean tmax and tmin are mean maximum and minimum temperature in centigrade c respectively for the conversion of top of atmosphere radiation to its equivalent in water depth following equation can be used testa et al 2011 8 w a t e r d e p t h i 0 238 8 595 5 0 55 t m e a n m m the top of atmospheric toa radiation i0 or extraterrestrial solar radiation measured normal to the sun rays is calculated as in eq 8 mao et al 2016 valipour 2015 9 i 0 1367 γ e s γ e s 2 w m 2 where γ e s is the average sun earth distance and γ e s the actual sun earth distance the average extraterrestrial irradiance is 1367 w m2 also called the solar constant and γ e s γ e s 2 is eccentricity εo the total electromagnetic radiation received on an inclined surface isurf can be measured as quej et al 2016 wild et al 2015 10 i s u r f i o cos θ where θ can be described as the angle between the normal to the surface and the solar beam the result isurf describes the incident solar radiation on the earth s surface assuming there are no atmospheric influences attenuations and is used as an input to the hargreaves equation for calculation of reference evapotranspiration hargreaves and allen 2003 pet calculated after hargreaves showed systematic pet underestimations at high temperatures hu et al 2011 tian et al 2018 however strong linear relation exists between pethargreaves and petpenman which was used to correct pethargreaves values to more accurate petpenman as seen in fig 8 lookup tool in arcmap was used to perform this operation 3 3 1 c1 and c2 for calculating reflectance based crop coefficients c1 and c2 were calculated through statistical regression analysis between ndvi values and fao defined kc ranges kamble et al 2013 as shown for the example of sugarcane in fig 9 the shaded period in grey describes the value included in the regression calculation for distinct classes to improve correlations cropping periods were split into two separate periods for optimum regression results the resultant c1 and c2 values were used in eq 3 for kcr calculation 4 results and discussions 4 1 crop water deficit assessment the output of the model comes in the form of vector map excel file and raster images for the whole investigation year on 8 day interval 46 investigations in total specimen of the pet mm and crop water deficit mm derived from the model in the form of vector map can be seen in fig 10 these results are average deficit values for each canal command in a particular 08 day period crop water deficit values at start of january are ranging from 0 05 to 0 30 mm for eight days which is quite satisfactory and doesn t need any immediate action to amend canal supply wheat being the dominant crop of the winter season is at initial stage in this period and doesn t need much water in cold weather prevailing at that time however water deficit values range from 4 92 mm to 7 36 mm for the results shown at bottom of the fig 10 this is maximum water demand period of summer crops due to peak growth stage of crops and high temperature days it requires immediate attention of the irrigation managers to either increase canal supply or arrange alternate supply to avoid crop water stress availability of these results on every 08 days with a lag time of 08 10 days could be very helpful for the irrigation managers to know the crops performance against the static canal rotation plan notified at start of the season prevailing for 160 180 days on average crop water deficit of each cca in this study for complete monitoring period jan 01 dec 31 2017 was derived and compared with crop calendar information fig 11 comparison revealed that ccas bear maximum crop water deficit in the growing mid stage of their major cultivated crops generally crops need maximum water in growing stage as describes by kc fig 7 in the uniform climate and crop type allen et al 2006 pattern of crop water deficit peak for all canal commands is identical where peak values were observed during march april and august september as shown in fig 11 these two durations of peaks coincide with mid stage of wheat most dominant winter crop and summer crops cotton maize rice etc as evapotranspiration and crop water deficit majorly depend upon temperature water availability and crop growth stage sudden change in crop deficit curves could be due to average temperature difference between two consecutive intervals and variation in irrigation supplies study area is the part of ibis in which annual canal water deliveries are approximately 36 less than the crop water needs jacoby et al 2018 shakir et al 2011 this shortage is distributed in all canal command areas on equity basis through 8 day rotational program anwar et al 2016 therefore maximum crop water demand and limited water availability in canals leads to rise in crop water deficit at mid stage of crops as reflected in the results this situation also leads to increase in groundwater pumping to neutralize the crop water deficit hassan and hassan 2017 crop water deficit mm and head discharge cusecs of main canals averaged at 8 day interval are presented in fig 12 generally canal discharge of ccas in study area from last week of december to first week of february was observed as zero due to annual closure period canal maintenance activities of cleaning lining and repairing are performed during this period minimum crop water deficit was observed in each cca during dec jan for winter season because of crops being at initial stage and falling within peak winter period minimum water deficit for summer season was observed during jun july that could occur due to multiple reasons across the canal commands summer crops being at initial stage good proportion of blank fields due to crops switch over period or maximum canal water and rain water availability due to high flow season increased snowmelt and monsoon period respectively awais et al 2017 fig 12 clarifies the ground situation more clearly how canals are operated and reciprocated by crop water performance there is a clear distinction between supplies of winter and summer seasons summer season receives more constant supplies than lot of ups and downs in supply of winter season providing fix amount of water irrespective of the type of crop grown and quality of underground water and static rotation plan are limitations in promoting water use efficiency a good part of the canal water is drained by famers in monsoon season when ample rainfall occurs and eventually canal water is not needed basharat 2012 the research results can be helpful for the irrigation managers to know crop water demand at different stages of the crop which has been calculated using reference ndvi cycle it will help them to plan reduction in canal supplies by integrating crop demand with weather forecast and save precious water by prior adjustment the saved water could be utilized in peak demand period where maximum crop water shortage is observed and pressure on groundwater could be minimized which is being depleted at 30 35 cm per year shakir et al 2011 it is evident that reduction in canal supplies other than monsoon directly means rise in crop water deficit and this pattern gets repeated for all canal commands during mid stage of winter season as shown in fig 12 case of mid staged summer crops is little different where maximum available canal supplies are not able to fulfill crop requirement due to hot weather conditions though punjab irrigation system is a supply based system where available water is distributed among farmers on equity basis research results could be useful in guiding farmers to use required amount of groundwater when canal water is insufficient to meet crop demand it would not only improve crop productivity but also reduce unnecessary pumping of groundwater conventional field irrigation practices also need to be amended to make crop irrigation efficient e g drip irrigation bed planting precision land levelling and water courses lining and earthen improvement warrant about 40 50 of irrigation water savings rizwan et al 2018 according to the water deficit analysis canal supply in the ccas was insufficient to satisfy the crop s requirements particularly during mid stage of the crops under these conditions the results of the current research will be helpful to develop an efficient and dynamic water distribution plan to minimize water deficit through near real time water deficit assessment 4 2 verification of results various scientific investigations carried out on the accuracy of kcr and their usefulness for crop water monitoring campos et al 2018 rajan and maas 2014 rossi et al 2010 confirm the accuracy of the current approach with error calculated within range of 0 13 though it may not be possible to calculate the absolute error by measuring the difference between modelled and actual crop water needs due to unavailability of field data from eddy covariance or lysimeter instruments but the accuracy of individual model parameters can be evaluated in this research verification of the model results is made by plotting the reflected crop coefficients against crop coefficients defined by fao as reference and any deviations are assumed as errors fig 13 the results showed that crop water needs calculated from reference coefficients defined by fao are mostly similar to the model predicted coefficients with deviation ranges up to 10 maximum deviations were typically found during the beginning and ending periods of cropping seasons because of low and constant values of ndvi while relevant kc values were changing during these stages a second reason of deviations is probably the noise in ndvi images occurred during signal processing and atmospheric correction the first source of error can be eliminated during ground processing but the second may take different orders of processing though some of atmospheric noise is clearly identifiable in ndvi images but applying noise correction is a specialized field and could go either way while making assumptions for noise occurrence therefore due to lack of efficient noise correction algorithms particularly for continuous monitoring no ndvi adjustment was applied furthermore for verification of results consistency a comparison of modeled crop irrigation needs with precipitation deviations from a long term mean is made for all ccas fig 14 crop water needs were observed maximum for the periods during which negative deviation of rainfall was recorded this is well documented that ccas which received significantly less precipitation during the period of june 18 to june 26 caused a strong increase in water demand during that period similar linkages are documented in the periods showing consistently high irrigation needs from march through may caused by persistent precipitation deficits 5 conclusions in this research it is concluded that remote sensing and gis can provide repetitive reliable and freely available data sources and methodology to assess and monitor crop water deficit on near real time basis the research approach can be helpful in improving canals rotation plan by adjusting and allocating water from less demand towards more demand area the methodology is based entirely on satellite based imageries i e modis landsat 8 and meteorological records and both datasets are currently available on required interval from open sources the developed model was applied to measure the crop water deficit of ccas in study area on near real time at 8 day interval accuracy of the research results has been assessed by calculating the deviations of model derived crop coefficients with fao s as reference which mostly ranged within 10 based on the analysis of model outcomes maximum crop water deficit occurred during growing mid stage due to limited shortage canal water availability and less efficient distribution system as the model can assess the crop water deficit on every 8 day the results could be utilized to modify and update canal water distribution plan in accordance with crop water demand fixed rotation plan needs to be made flexible to adjust variation in crop water demand within canal commands and minimize impact of weather induced events especially precipitation to avoid wastage of water the study area faces canal water shortage up to 35 remaining amount of crop water requirement is usually met through pumping of groundwater which is causing depletion of aquafer at 30 40 cm year in large part of the area research results could be beneficial to improve adequacy and increase water use efficiency by timely dissemination of crop water requirement information within irrigation department and across the farmers it could also help in lowering the pressure on groundwater consumption for irrigational purposes when farmers know the required proportion of water to be pumped 6 recommendations it is recommended that future work may be focused on the forecast of crop water demand by incorporating climatic forecast one week ahead this information in terms of predicted crop water demand be shared with all stake holders i e agriculture department and irrigation department to ensure better irrigation planning and scheduling the knowledge of potential available sources of water i e canal water groundwater and precipitation and crop water requirement in a particular duration would assist decision makers to allocate rational amount of water in particular canal commands it is also recommended to build water storage reservoirs in accordance with the surplus amount of water which is wasted during monsoon in arabian sea to lower the canal water shortage observed in peak demand season the current study is conducted at main canal command level which is helpful for irrigation managers to monitor crop performance and adjust canal releases from head it is recommended to downscale the model from main canal command to distributary canal level using high resolution satellite imagery which can provide decision makers more precise spatial and statistical information for water allocation

10402,this study comprehensively used remote sensing rs and gis for independently monitoring crop water adequacy in response to existing irrigation management system in bari doab pakistan canals rotation plan is developed before start of each cropping season to distribute water on fixed turn basis the study combines the moderate landsat 8 and low resolution modis satellite imagery to assess near real time crop water deficit in canal command areas ccas of the study area landsat imagery were used to develop crop classification and determine cropping pattern using time series of ndvi modis ndvi product was employed to monitor the current crop health and develop annual reference ndvi cycle based on last 13 years imagery climatic data of wmo stations combined with dem have also been used to determine reference evapotranspiration based on penman monteith method these inputs were combined to estimate average crop water deficit in ccas for ongoing cropping season on 08 day interval the interval parallel to the canal rotation plan rs based reflectance crop coefficients kcr of current and reference crop cycle were developed to calculate potential and actual evapotranspiration and then translated their difference into crop water deficit lag time of 08 10 days is limitation of the study due to satellites overpass time but it can still prove very helpful considering the crop season spanned over 160 180 days results revealed that maximum crop water deficit up to 9 mm occurred in ccas during crop growing mid stage crop water deficit showed inverse relation when plotted against intense rainfall months crop water deficit results could be helpful for irrigation managers to modify canals rotation plan in near real time according to crop health and growing stage it would not only help in achieving equitable water distribution but also assuring supplies when required by the crops keywords crop water deficit remote sensing evapotranspiration ndvi normalized difference vegetation index crop coefficients canal command area 1 introduction a large part of world s growing population is dependent on irrigated agriculture and it consumes more than half about 56 of the global fresh water willer et al 2008 climate change and other factors including deteriorating water quality depleting groundwater resources and growing industrial and domestics demands are limiting water availability for irrigation rosegrant et al 2010 globally gap between supply and demand of irrigation water is expected to become high by the end of 2050 majorly caused by the population growth de fraiture and wichelns 2010d therefore irrigated agriculture will be affected by concerns and issues over scarcity of water hu et al 2016 a large amount of irrigation water get wasted or not managed efficiently to meet crop water requirement for achieving potential crop yield pereira et al 2012 thus irrigation management authorities must aim to increase the expertise of monitoring and quantifying crop water demand consumption and deficit rather than calculating supplied irrigation water only this can improve water productivity and efficiency as well qu et al 2015 pakistan is one of the countries facing severe shortage of irrigation water although the country uses 90 of fresh water for agriculture purposes rahut et al 2016 major sources of fresh water in the country including himalayan s glaciers and aquifers are depleting at enormous rate while global temperature rise and decrease in effective precipitation intensify the water scarcity situation qureshi et al 2010 annual water availability in the indus basin irrigation system ibis is already towards decline and has squeezed from 130 million acre feet maf to 120 maf by comparing average inflows of 1976 2000 and 2001 2016 respectively qureshi 2011a canal irrigation system which feeds about 80 of the agriculture land in pakistan is facing a rising trend in water shortages and is projected about 32 shortfall in annual supplies by 2025 qureshi 2011b canal water is supplied to the agriculture land on 08 daily rotation basis by implying the principal of equitable distribution fix amount of canal water per unit of land is supplied to the farmers irrespective of the type of crop grown shah et al 2016 rotation plan is developed at start of each crop season i e winter rabi and summer kharif normally secondary canals off taking from the main canal are divided into 03 groups and water is released in these groups on first second and third priority on 08 daily bases there is no scientific method adopted by the irrigation department to monitor canals fulfilling crop water demand and rotation plan is followed inflexibly shah et al 2016 there is a strong need to introduce new strategies and mechanisms to improve water use efficiency and productivity to ensure optimum use of irrigation water shah et al 2006 knowledge of crop water demand consumption and deficit are interlinked with each other and associated with crop specific evapotranspiration et characteristics allen et al 2011 et requirements are typically expressed in terms of crop coefficient kc values for different crops and their growing stages under various climatic conditions allen et al 2001 to calculate et particularly potential evapotranspiration pet there exist a wide range of different field methods and empirical equations abdelhadi et al 2000 djaman et al 2019 compared and evaluated 34 equations of measuring pet by taking most worldwide acceptable and fao s recommended penman monteith p m method as reference they concluded p m equation of pet petpen demonstrated good results even under limited missing parameters like solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 is also well known and most simple method to calculate pet pethar but it underestimates and overestimates pet under wind speed more than 3 m s and high relative humidity respectively allen et al 1998 all of these methods are not suitable for spatial analyses mainly due to limitations in spatial availability of required variables ahmad et al 2009 an accurate assessment of et and pet requires spatial detail of several parameters such as crop classification climatic parameters and kc values at different growing stages and climatic conditions bastiaanssen et al 2005 therefore rs datasets and gis techniques are increasingly used to model various crop water requirement parameters in spatial domain and their monitoring in near real time manner due to wide coverage range and regular temporal data availability allen et al 2007 yousaf et al 2018 there are two basic approaches that are commonly proposed for monitoring water efficiency of irrigated crops thorough remote sensing rs data courault et al 2005 first approach is based on normalized difference vegetation index ndvi in which reflectance based crop coefficients kcr are obtained through regression calculations between local ndvi crop cycles and fao defined crop coefficients glenn et al 2011 second method based on a series of satellite derived physical measurements calculates actual evapotranspiration via surface heat budget e g metric alexi disalexi sebal allen et al 2005 anderson et al 2011 bastiaanssen et al 2005 both methods have been successfully implemented in different regions of the world to estimate et allen et al 2007 tasumi et al 2005 zwart and bastiaanssen 2007 a major requirement of the second method is ground station based meteorological data whom availability and accessibility is usually limited particularly in developing countries tang et al 2009 although the estimation of et from these schemes is very useful for planning studies where backdated assessments are required but have relatively less potential in data limited regions for near real time decision making peschechera et al 2019 highlighted the adaptive capability of kcr in different climatic and specific field conditions as compared to standard crop coefficients approach crop water need or deficit additional requirement can be calculated as the difference of ndvi based et of current crop eta and the crop under ideal condition pet kumar and rajan 2014 successful applications at basin scale have been reported from the guadalquivir river basin in southern spain gonzález dugo et al 2013 and from northern italy rossi et al 2010 this research briefly highlights the use of rs and gis technology to estimate crop water deficit in canal command areas ccas at intervals parallel to the pid s 8 day rotation plan water deficit monitoring on near real time basis can be helpful for irrigation managers to ensure better water allocation by making adjustments in ongoing rotation plan limitation of 08 10 days lag time in availability of satellite imagery will not impact much for making adjustments in canal water allocation while monitoring the cropping season spanned over 160 180 days the main objective of this piece of work is to introduce flexibility in static rotation plans being practiced by pid since decades by monitoring crop health using satellite technology based on open source data the results can also help to promote guided groundwater abstraction by farmers incase canal water is insufficient to meet crop water demand which would eventually reduce excessive groundwater pumping being considered as one of the major issue in the study area basharat and tariq 2014 2 study area the study area chosen for this research is bari doab of punjab province in pakistan it is situated in ibis and bears canal water shortages up to 32 nawaz et al 2016 bari doab in pakistan side of border exists between ravi and sutlej rivers as doab meaning land between two rivers it is one of the most fertile agriculture region of south asia and is second largest irrigation system in punjab province basharat and tariq 2014 the study area is intensely cultivated covering an area about 22 750 km2 81 having majors crops of wheat rice maize sugarcane and orchards basharat 2012 the major part of the study area experiences double cropping practice ibis was designed in such a way that canal supply shortages are distributed in all ccas on equity basis through warabandi system rotational plan anwar et al 2016 rest of the water demand is fulfilled by groundwater pumping from the underlying unconfined aquifer awan et al 2016 main source of water of the ibis originates from snow and glacier melt in the himalayans discharged by the western rivers indus jhelum and chenab and eastern rivers ravi and sutlej eastern rivers have very insignificant contribution in the annual water availability for agriculture use in ibis being in administrative control of india according to indus water treaty iwt water is diverted from western rivers to the eastern rivers through network of link canals to meet crop demand which increases importance of careful management of the scarce water available in the bari doab the annual mean rainfall of study area ranges between 200 350 mm from east to west while most of the precipitation normally occurs during monsoon july to august ashraf et al 2010 temperature increases towards west of the doab while the mean minimum and maximum temperature ranges are 6 10 c and 32 36 c respectively bari doab fig 1 is comprised of 08 main canals 06 link canals 19 branch canals and about 823 small canals spread on length of 348 243 452 and 823 miles respectively 3 materials methods all the calculations regarding crop water deficit assessment were performed in model builder arc gis 10 5 using different spatial and statistical tools fig 2 shows the research flow diagram highlighting used input datasets and various processing procedures adopted to calculate crop water deficit 3 1 data sources 3 1 1 digital elevation model dem dem was used to extract aspect slope and elevation characteristics of land cover features for top of atmosphere toa calculation through gis techniques global multi resolution terrain elevation data 2010 gmted2010 of 7 5 arc sec 225 m was used danielson and gesh 2011 gmted2010 is relatively low resolution as compare to commonly used srtm 30 m but was used due to two factors one was the low elevation gradient of study area and the second was to make the model modifiable to apply at provincial or regional level with minimum resources and data processing time 3 1 2 landsat 8 imagery calculation of the individual water needs of different crops were required to be considered for producing accurate results land cover land use classification was performed to distinguish major crops grown during winter and summer cropping seasons which was only feasible through satellite imagery the basic requirements for suitable images selection included the spatial resolution that needs to be comparable with typical field size of the study area and the repetitive data acquisition to allow multiple observations of crops stages at required interval landsat 8 30 m data was used for crop classification a mosaic of 4 landsat images was needed to cover the study area as shown in fig 3 ndvi time series analysis of the study area was performed for the whole monitoring period covering both cropping seasons 80 landsat scenes were used in the process images with significant cloud cover were replaced by images of preceding years to fill the gaps in data characteristics of landsat scenes used in the research are mentioned in table 1 3 1 3 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis imagery landsat and modis terra aqua satellite imagery are capable to be used for definition of kcr as well as continuous monitoring of crops both imageries offer the comprehensive spectral ranges bands to calculate the parameters for either approach i e ndvi and actual evapotranspiration eta revisiting time for landsat is 16 days while modis imagery is available on daily basis with the later also offering prepared data products for different time intervals the availability of a good quality landsat image every 16 days is rather unlikely as a matter of cloud coverage marchane et al 2015 irregular image drop outs result inhomogeneous temporal monitoring pattern despite having relative low resolution as compare to landsat 30 m modis 250 imagery were chosen for continuous crop monitoring due to frequent data availability and its temporally stable composited products it is important to mention that operational satellite derived products and models on actual evapotranspiration and assessing crop water needs are still in development stage and need to be improved mu et al 2011 tadesse et al 2015 hence modis average ndvi product mod13q1 myd13q1 with 8 days alternative temporal availability total 46 intervals per year were used to calculate et of current in near real time crops the same ndvi product was also used to extract reference maximum ndvi cycle from 2003 to 2016 total 598 images of each period to calculate reference evapotranspiration pet of each crop two modis foot prints were used at one time to fully cover the study area as specified in table 2 and shown graphically in fig 3 3 1 4 temperature daily maximum and daily minimum temperature inputs required in eqs 8 and 9 are spatially interpolated weather station records temperature data used in the study belongs to the global surface summary of the day gsod data set that can be downloaded freely from the ncdc web site sparks et al 2017 lott 1998 geographical location of the wmo weather stations used in the study is shown in fig 3 the number of station records may vary and cause some bias in the temporal comparability of interpolated temperatures due to inconsistent reporting of data by countries this is unavoidable in practical scenario however flat topography of the study area reduces its impact and it is considered to be of only minor influence as long as record availability is evenly distributed across the region van wart et al 2013 zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 3 2 data processing 3 2 1 interpolation of temperature data temperature data downloaded from ncdc comes as a raw text file having station id along with daily minimum and daily maximum temperature values station ids were used to assign location coordinates lat long for converting it to gis friendly format temperature units were converted from fahrenheit to celsius and converted values were projected to sea level using lapse rate of 6 5 c per 1000 m and scaling back temperature values to their specific elevations using dem kim et al 2008 in model builder of arc map inverse distance weighting idw arcmap technique is used for spatial interpolation of temperature data with a flexible radius and a minimum of six stations were used during interpolation 3 2 2 crop classification in order to obtain spatial spread and quantitative measurement of crops in the study area land cover land use classification was performed using ndvi times series derived from landsat 8 images dated sep 2015 to nov 2016 ndvi images were developed using near infrared nir and red spectral bands of landsat 8 imagery sandholt et al 2002 by using the eq 1 mentioned below 1 n o r m a l i s e d v e g e t a t i o n i n d e x n d v i n e a r i n f r a r e d r e d n e a r i n f r a r e d r e d the ndvi time series curve is considered representation of crop phenology cycle and its shape pattern is used for crop identification wang et al 2018 apart from crop types bare soil built up area natural vegetation and water bodies were also distinguished the fourier component classifier algorithm was used for crop classification in which classification performed on the basis of how similar the annual ndvi patterns are as compare to reference cycle evans and geerken 2006 geerken et al 2005 auxiliary information collected from field surveys crop calendar high resolution google earth imagery agriculture statistics books and maps were used to identify suitable crop reference cycles as seen in fig 4 crop classification fig 5 showed double cropping pattern in major part of the study area wheat is the most dominant crop in winter season covering approximately 85 of the total cultivated area maize cotton and rice were identified as major crops of the summer season covering approximate area of 43 30 and 06 of total cultivated area respectively orchards and sugarcane were also identified separately from winter and summer crops as they need irrigation water throughout the year table 3 accuracy assessment of crop classification resulted in overall kappa statistics and accuracy percentage of 0 81 and 82 50 respectively the slight compromise in accuracy is due to spectral and blooming seasonal overlaps between different classes e g mixing of orchard and crops with natural vegetation trees grasses etc 3 2 3 integrating landsat crop classification into modis crop water need monitoring the difference in modis s spatial resolution and actual field size and size variability may result error in estimation of crop water requirement particularly where various crops fall within a single pixel of modis a modis pixel 250 m2 covers approximately 70 pixels of landsat 30 m2 image to reduce such influence crop types were classified using ndvi time series of landsat satellite and the result integrated into the crop irrigation water need assessment this was achieved by calculating the fraction each surface type crop occupies within a modis pixel knowing each crop types contribution to a modis pixel the water needs in this modis pixel can be calculated not only taking into account their distinct crop coefficients but also their spatial coverage fig 6 because the classification of landsat ndvi time series is a time consuming effort the classification could be repeatedly applied over the following years without any modification this assumes that there aren t any significant changes in cropped areas fallow areas in crop types and in cropping patterns this assumption may not be entirely true however an analysis of 13 years of modis time series suggests that inter annual changes in cropping pattern are minor 3 3 calculation of crop water needs crop water requirement can be expressed as the amount of water required to fulfill the plant water consumption due to et allen et al 2006 et is considered as amount of water consumed by plants due to transpiration and evaporation losses occurring from soil and water bodies rate of et depends upon climate characteristics crop type and its growing stages pereira et al 2015 water needs of individual crop are calculated in terms of crop coefficients kc defined in fao 65 publication er raki et al 2010 2 k c e t c e t 0 where et0 is the reference et represents the et of well watered grassy surface reference and etc refers to the crop under standard conditions the values of kc at different growth stages of crop were defined by allen et al 2006 through ground measurement as seen in fig 7 to calculate etc under standard conditions using single coefficient approach eq 2 can be written as 3 e t c e t 0 k c reflectance based crop coefficients kcr bausch 1987 toureiro et al 2017 can be calculated as 4 k c r c 1 n d v i c 2 where c1 and c2 are coefficients derived through regression analysis between kc and ndvi bausch 1987 each crop has different value of c1 and c2 coefficients therefore need to be calculated separately smaller ndvi values resulted in smaller kcr values while larger ndvi values produced larger kcr values replacing kc with kcr and et0 with pet eq 3 can be written as 5 e t c e t 0 k c r calculating the difference between two kcr i e current and reference and multiplying it by et0 pet gives the irrigation water need iw in millimeters mm kamble et al 2013 6 i w k c r r e f k c r c u r e t 0 m m kcr ref and kcr cur are associated with well performing crop without water stress and current monitoring crop respectively these kcrs are extracted from reference ndvi cycle and ndvi of current monitoring crop using modis ndvi products hargreaves approach was used to calculate pet et0 in mm which requires minimum maximum and mean temperature values and top of atmosphere radiation as inputs hargreaves and samani 1985 tomas burguera et al 2017 7 p e t 0 0023 r e s t m e a n 17 8 t m a x t m i n m m where res is the equivalent of extraterrestrial solar radiation in water depth mm tmean tmax and tmin are mean maximum and minimum temperature in centigrade c respectively for the conversion of top of atmosphere radiation to its equivalent in water depth following equation can be used testa et al 2011 8 w a t e r d e p t h i 0 238 8 595 5 0 55 t m e a n m m the top of atmospheric toa radiation i0 or extraterrestrial solar radiation measured normal to the sun rays is calculated as in eq 8 mao et al 2016 valipour 2015 9 i 0 1367 γ e s γ e s 2 w m 2 where γ e s is the average sun earth distance and γ e s the actual sun earth distance the average extraterrestrial irradiance is 1367 w m2 also called the solar constant and γ e s γ e s 2 is eccentricity εo the total electromagnetic radiation received on an inclined surface isurf can be measured as quej et al 2016 wild et al 2015 10 i s u r f i o cos θ where θ can be described as the angle between the normal to the surface and the solar beam the result isurf describes the incident solar radiation on the earth s surface assuming there are no atmospheric influences attenuations and is used as an input to the hargreaves equation for calculation of reference evapotranspiration hargreaves and allen 2003 pet calculated after hargreaves showed systematic pet underestimations at high temperatures hu et al 2011 tian et al 2018 however strong linear relation exists between pethargreaves and petpenman which was used to correct pethargreaves values to more accurate petpenman as seen in fig 8 lookup tool in arcmap was used to perform this operation 3 3 1 c1 and c2 for calculating reflectance based crop coefficients c1 and c2 were calculated through statistical regression analysis between ndvi values and fao defined kc ranges kamble et al 2013 as shown for the example of sugarcane in fig 9 the shaded period in grey describes the value included in the regression calculation for distinct classes to improve correlations cropping periods were split into two separate periods for optimum regression results the resultant c1 and c2 values were used in eq 3 for kcr calculation 4 results and discussions 4 1 crop water deficit assessment the output of the model comes in the form of vector map excel file and raster images for the whole investigation year on 8 day interval 46 investigations in total specimen of the pet mm and crop water deficit mm derived from the model in the form of vector map can be seen in fig 10 these results are average deficit values for each canal command in a particular 08 day period crop water deficit values at start of january are ranging from 0 05 to 0 30 mm for eight days which is quite satisfactory and doesn t need any immediate action to amend canal supply wheat being the dominant crop of the winter season is at initial stage in this period and doesn t need much water in cold weather prevailing at that time however water deficit values range from 4 92 mm to 7 36 mm for the results shown at bottom of the fig 10 this is maximum water demand period of summer crops due to peak growth stage of crops and high temperature days it requires immediate attention of the irrigation managers to either increase canal supply or arrange alternate supply to avoid crop water stress availability of these results on every 08 days with a lag time of 08 10 days could be very helpful for the irrigation managers to know the crops performance against the static canal rotation plan notified at start of the season prevailing for 160 180 days on average crop water deficit of each cca in this study for complete monitoring period jan 01 dec 31 2017 was derived and compared with crop calendar information fig 11 comparison revealed that ccas bear maximum crop water deficit in the growing mid stage of their major cultivated crops generally crops need maximum water in growing stage as describes by kc fig 7 in the uniform climate and crop type allen et al 2006 pattern of crop water deficit peak for all canal commands is identical where peak values were observed during march april and august september as shown in fig 11 these two durations of peaks coincide with mid stage of wheat most dominant winter crop and summer crops cotton maize rice etc as evapotranspiration and crop water deficit majorly depend upon temperature water availability and crop growth stage sudden change in crop deficit curves could be due to average temperature difference between two consecutive intervals and variation in irrigation supplies study area is the part of ibis in which annual canal water deliveries are approximately 36 less than the crop water needs jacoby et al 2018 shakir et al 2011 this shortage is distributed in all canal command areas on equity basis through 8 day rotational program anwar et al 2016 therefore maximum crop water demand and limited water availability in canals leads to rise in crop water deficit at mid stage of crops as reflected in the results this situation also leads to increase in groundwater pumping to neutralize the crop water deficit hassan and hassan 2017 crop water deficit mm and head discharge cusecs of main canals averaged at 8 day interval are presented in fig 12 generally canal discharge of ccas in study area from last week of december to first week of february was observed as zero due to annual closure period canal maintenance activities of cleaning lining and repairing are performed during this period minimum crop water deficit was observed in each cca during dec jan for winter season because of crops being at initial stage and falling within peak winter period minimum water deficit for summer season was observed during jun july that could occur due to multiple reasons across the canal commands summer crops being at initial stage good proportion of blank fields due to crops switch over period or maximum canal water and rain water availability due to high flow season increased snowmelt and monsoon period respectively awais et al 2017 fig 12 clarifies the ground situation more clearly how canals are operated and reciprocated by crop water performance there is a clear distinction between supplies of winter and summer seasons summer season receives more constant supplies than lot of ups and downs in supply of winter season providing fix amount of water irrespective of the type of crop grown and quality of underground water and static rotation plan are limitations in promoting water use efficiency a good part of the canal water is drained by famers in monsoon season when ample rainfall occurs and eventually canal water is not needed basharat 2012 the research results can be helpful for the irrigation managers to know crop water demand at different stages of the crop which has been calculated using reference ndvi cycle it will help them to plan reduction in canal supplies by integrating crop demand with weather forecast and save precious water by prior adjustment the saved water could be utilized in peak demand period where maximum crop water shortage is observed and pressure on groundwater could be minimized which is being depleted at 30 35 cm per year shakir et al 2011 it is evident that reduction in canal supplies other than monsoon directly means rise in crop water deficit and this pattern gets repeated for all canal commands during mid stage of winter season as shown in fig 12 case of mid staged summer crops is little different where maximum available canal supplies are not able to fulfill crop requirement due to hot weather conditions though punjab irrigation system is a supply based system where available water is distributed among farmers on equity basis research results could be useful in guiding farmers to use required amount of groundwater when canal water is insufficient to meet crop demand it would not only improve crop productivity but also reduce unnecessary pumping of groundwater conventional field irrigation practices also need to be amended to make crop irrigation efficient e g drip irrigation bed planting precision land levelling and water courses lining and earthen improvement warrant about 40 50 of irrigation water savings rizwan et al 2018 according to the water deficit analysis canal supply in the ccas was insufficient to satisfy the crop s requirements particularly during mid stage of the crops under these conditions the results of the current research will be helpful to develop an efficient and dynamic water distribution plan to minimize water deficit through near real time water deficit assessment 4 2 verification of results various scientific investigations carried out on the accuracy of kcr and their usefulness for crop water monitoring campos et al 2018 rajan and maas 2014 rossi et al 2010 confirm the accuracy of the current approach with error calculated within range of 0 13 though it may not be possible to calculate the absolute error by measuring the difference between modelled and actual crop water needs due to unavailability of field data from eddy covariance or lysimeter instruments but the accuracy of individual model parameters can be evaluated in this research verification of the model results is made by plotting the reflected crop coefficients against crop coefficients defined by fao as reference and any deviations are assumed as errors fig 13 the results showed that crop water needs calculated from reference coefficients defined by fao are mostly similar to the model predicted coefficients with deviation ranges up to 10 maximum deviations were typically found during the beginning and ending periods of cropping seasons because of low and constant values of ndvi while relevant kc values were changing during these stages a second reason of deviations is probably the noise in ndvi images occurred during signal processing and atmospheric correction the first source of error can be eliminated during ground processing but the second may take different orders of processing though some of atmospheric noise is clearly identifiable in ndvi images but applying noise correction is a specialized field and could go either way while making assumptions for noise occurrence therefore due to lack of efficient noise correction algorithms particularly for continuous monitoring no ndvi adjustment was applied furthermore for verification of results consistency a comparison of modeled crop irrigation needs with precipitation deviations from a long term mean is made for all ccas fig 14 crop water needs were observed maximum for the periods during which negative deviation of rainfall was recorded this is well documented that ccas which received significantly less precipitation during the period of june 18 to june 26 caused a strong increase in water demand during that period similar linkages are documented in the periods showing consistently high irrigation needs from march through may caused by persistent precipitation deficits 5 conclusions in this research it is concluded that remote sensing and gis can provide repetitive reliable and freely available data sources and methodology to assess and monitor crop water deficit on near real time basis the research approach can be helpful in improving canals rotation plan by adjusting and allocating water from less demand towards more demand area the methodology is based entirely on satellite based imageries i e modis landsat 8 and meteorological records and both datasets are currently available on required interval from open sources the developed model was applied to measure the crop water deficit of ccas in study area on near real time at 8 day interval accuracy of the research results has been assessed by calculating the deviations of model derived crop coefficients with fao s as reference which mostly ranged within 10 based on the analysis of model outcomes maximum crop water deficit occurred during growing mid stage due to limited shortage canal water availability and less efficient distribution system as the model can assess the crop water deficit on every 8 day the results could be utilized to modify and update canal water distribution plan in accordance with crop water demand fixed rotation plan needs to be made flexible to adjust variation in crop water demand within canal commands and minimize impact of weather induced events especially precipitation to avoid wastage of water the study area faces canal water shortage up to 35 remaining amount of crop water requirement is usually met through pumping of groundwater which is causing depletion of aquafer at 30 40 cm year in large part of the area research results could be beneficial to improve adequacy and increase water use efficiency by timely dissemination of crop water requirement information within irrigation department and across the farmers it could also help in lowering the pressure on groundwater consumption for irrigational purposes when farmers know the required proportion of water to be pumped 6 recommendations it is recommended that future work may be focused on the forecast of crop water demand by incorporating climatic forecast one week ahead this information in terms of predicted crop water demand be shared with all stake holders i e agriculture department and irrigation department to ensure better irrigation planning and scheduling the knowledge of potential available sources of water i e canal water groundwater and precipitation and crop water requirement in a particular duration would assist decision makers to allocate rational amount of water in particular canal commands it is also recommended to build water storage reservoirs in accordance with the surplus amount of water which is wasted during monsoon in arabian sea to lower the canal water shortage observed in peak demand season the current study is conducted at main canal command level which is helpful for irrigation managers to monitor crop performance and adjust canal releases from head it is recommended to downscale the model from main canal command to distributary canal level using high resolution satellite imagery which can provide decision makers more precise spatial and statistical information for water allocation

10403,subsurface drains when installed in non cohesive soil are typically covered with an envelope to tackle problems of clogging and siltation selecting a suitable envelope material however is complicated and depends primarily on soil characteristics in the area where the drains are to be installed a new promising drainpipe envelope concept hydroluis has been developed which the designers claim works in a wide range of soils the hydroluis drainpipe consists of a corrugated inner pipe with three rows of perforations at the top and an unperforated outer pipe that covers the top two thirds of the inner pipe we analysed the hydraulic and filter functions of this new drainpipe in a soil tank laboratory model with a saline sodic problem soil from south western iran and compared hydroluis performance with that of a locally manufactured synthetic envelope material pp450 the silty clay soil used in this study was 40 clay with a plasticity index ip of 16 9 and an exchangeable sodium percentage esp of 60 4 the hydroluis drainpipe clogged during the first two weeks of the test due to invasion of the test soil into the space between the inner and outer pipes of the substantial volume of sediment that entered the hydroluis inner pipe 38 removed from the pipe in the first day in contrast the pp450 drainpipe showed good hydraulic and filter functions entering very little sediment to drainpipe during the entire test period and stabilizing at drainage rate of 28 mm day and entrance resistance of 55 days m at around day 50 our analyses suggest that the clogging and poor drainage function of the hydroluis drainpipe was caused by the higher flow velocity 21 5 times higher at the soil envelope interface of the drainpipe in addition to the lower hydroluis drainpipe s soil retention capacity 18 times lower compared to the pp450 drainpipe assuming stokes law governs filter function the results of hydroluis design evaluation also suggest that in stable soils very fine sand or coarser soil particles d 0 05 mm place no serious limitations for hydroluis drainpipe application whereas the current design is unsuitable for filtering fine silt particles 0 002 d 0 02 mm in conclusion we suppose the hydroluis drainpipe does not perform well in silty saline sodic soils such as those found in south western khuzestan province iran keywords subsurface drainage new drainpipe pp450 envelope filter function clogging soil tank test 1 introduction subsurface drains in arid and semi arid areas are primarily installed to reclaim waterlogged or salt affected lands and prevent soil waterlogging and salinization typically subsurface drains are covered with an envelope to restrict soil particles from entering the drainpipe filter function and to create a more permeable area around the pipe hydraulic function ritzema et al 2006 a wide variety of materials are used as envelopes for drainpipes ranging from organic and mineral materials to mineral fibres and synthetic material cavelaars et al 2006 granular mineral materials have been used for decades and are still commonly used in arid and semi arid countries yet they are expensive due to high transport cost stuyt and dierickx 2006 nowadays pre wrapped envelopes of synthetic material are used almost everywhere in the world because they are cheap light weight and simple to install even with trenchless drainage machinery in cohesionless soils the main causes of failure of subsurface drains are clogging and siltation of drainpipes or envelope with soil particles linked to improper selection of the envelope material clogging is defined as a decrease in the permeability of the soil drainpipe envelope system after installation due to particles of the base soil being carried towards the subsurface drainpipes by drag forces of the moving water stuyt and dierickx 2006 most soils in south western khuzestan province in arid iran are problem soils for which subsurface drainpipes need an effective envelope khuzestan s soils consist in large part of silt and clay and are saline and saline sodic and without structure in subsurface horizons pazira and homaee 2010 clogging of subsurface drains in khuzestan province is usually a result of the instability of local soils shallow saline groundwater and high soil salinity ghane 2007 compared the performance of two synthetic envelopes pp450 and pp700 with a gravel envelope in a sand tank model using a problem soil from abadan khuzestan province they reported that the gravel envelope performed better than the synthetic envelopes despite the acceptable performance of the synthetic envelopes formulation of criteria for envelope design is complicated and depends on soil characteristics and installation conditions stuyt and dierickx 2006 stuyt and willardson 1999 many physical criteria have been published during the past 50 years to suggest whether a soil is unstable and needs an envelope however the structural stability of a soil especially in arid regions is affected not only by a soil s physical properties but also by its salt and sodium content a high exchangeable sodium percentage esp usually indicates poor physical soil conditions and a likelihood of displacement of colloidal soil particles in general in arid climates drainpipe clogging problems are not experienced in non sodic soils with esp values below 15 stuyt et al 2000 yet so far no sufficient criteria are available to classify envelope need for soils with esp values higher than 15 especially saline sodic soils according to their chemical composition it is therefore recommended that the effectiveness of an envelope be proven in field trials at the locations where the subsurface drains are to be installed vlotman et al 2001 stuyt et al 2000 to tackle the complication of envelope design a new pipe envelope concept was recently developed in turkey that does not use any envelope material the new concept called hydroluis consists of a corrugated inner pipe with three rows of perforations at the top and an unperforated outer pipe that covers about the top two thirds of the inner pipe the 8 mm distance between the inner and outer pipes determines the flow velocity and thus the filter function of the pipe bahçeci et al 2018 bahçeci et al 2018 tested the hydroluis system in a field with a stable non saline soil clay 56 ece 1 ds m in turkey during 2015 and 2016 they concluded that the hydroluis envelope was a good alternative for a gravel or synthetic envelope for irrigated lands with a wide range of soil textures the hydroluis pipe was not however tested with a saline sodic problem soil investigating a new drainpipe in an area is usually conducted in two consecutive steps to prevent waste of time and money examining the drainpipe in the laboratory with the soil of experimental field in a short term and consequently if the laboratory results prove promising investigating the long term effects of the drainpipe installation in the field accordingly the objective of the laboratory experiments is to quantify the flow entrance resistance hydraulic function investigate clogging of pipe or envelope and explore substantial passage of mineral particles filter function for short time after drainpipe installation stuyt et al 2000 analogue models that have been extensively used in the laboratory for these purposes are soil tank and flow permeameter models examining a drainpipe in the laboratory has some important limitations compared to field that should be under considerations when interpreting the results first the drainpipe envelope combination is tested in a rather short time while in the field increase in entrance resistance or clogging may occur in long time wesseling and homma 1967 second the soil used in the test is disturbed although it should have similar soil texture and chemical composition to the field thus the test soil has different bulk density and hydraulic conductivity compared to the field soil tanks in particular have some additional limitations in comparison with flow permeameters rather large amount of homogeneous soil is needed to fill the soil tank models which is quite labour intensive and limits the repeatability of the test moreover applying varied hydraulic gradient cannot be easily maintained in the soil tank models in this study we have analysed the hydraulic and filter functions of the hydroluis pipe envelope system in a soil tank model with a saline sodic problem soil from south western iran and compared performance with a locally manufactured synthetic envelope drainpipe pp450 we have explained the possible causes of failure or success of each drainpipe in addition we have evaluate the filter function of the current hydroluis design and have given recommendations for future application or design of the next generations of the hydroluis drainpipe 2 material and methods 2 1 soil tank laboratory tests using soil sand tank models and flow permeameters have been extensively done worldwide with different envelope materials to formulate criteria for selecting the right envelope material wesseling and homma 1967 willardson et al 1968 qureshi et al 1990 fischer et al 1994 shi et al 1994 bonnell et al 1986 in our experiment we used a laboratory soil tank to investigate the drainage function of the hydroluis drainpipe envelope system under a possible maximum drainage rate of drainage practice in khuzestan province we chose the soil tank model for experiment among analogue models because the special design of hydroluis drainpipe with no envelope material can only be studied under this kind of laboratory experiments the soil tank in this experiment was constructed according to the method introduced by eichenauer et al 1994 the soil tank consisted of a steel frame measuring 150 cm in length 80 cm in width and 200 cm in height with four glass outer walls and two perforated steel inner walls fig 1 the perforated walls formed an inner tank measuring 60 cm in width leaving a 10 cm gap to the outer wall on two sides the perforations on the walls were 0 8 cm in diameter and 10 cm apart the drainpipe was installed horizontally in the middle of the inner tank with the centre of the pipe 50 cm above the tank floor the characteristics of the drainpipes used in this experiment are presented in table 1 ten piezometers were installed above below and to the sides of the drainpipe one piezometer p10 was installed between the inner and outer pipes the piezometers were connected to transparent pipes to enable measurement of their piezometric heads the soil tank model in this study attempts to simulate field conditions of a newly installed and backfilled drainpipe in a trench with 1 2 m depth in a saline sodic soil undergoing leaching practice for few months a constant water level of 110 cm above the drainpipe was maintained this level is representative of the leaching practices in khuzestan province where leaching after drainpipe installation is used to reclaim saline and or sodic soils before cultivation leaching here is usually done by making a continuous water pond on a field for a few months a representative saline sodic soil was collected from the top 50 cm depth of an uncultivated plot in the salman farsi sugarcane agro industrial area farm r8 18 48 27 n 30 56 e in the south western khuzestan province with no subsurface drains or history of leaching or cultivation practices the soil texture was identical from soil surface to 1 5 m depth the soil was collected from the more saline topsoil with the assumption that during leaching practice the salts from the topsoil layers would leach to drain level subsoil which then may affect soil particle bonds and movements near drainpipes the soil had a clay content of 40 plasticity index of 16 9 saturated electrical conductivity ece of 188 ds m a sodium adsorption ratio sar of 104 2 and an exchangeable sodium percentage esp of 60 4 table 2 based on the larry cihacek 2012 classification this soil with ec 4 esp 15 sar 13 and ph 8 5 is a saline sodic soil with a limited drainage ability we analysed particle size distribution of soil samples using a malvern mastersizer which employs laser diffraction to measure the size of soil particles ranging from 0 1 1000 μm malvern instruments 2004 the mastersizer provides fast simple and precise particle size distribution results allowing differentiation of a wide range of soils in comparison the traditionally used hydrometer method is more time consuming and error prone as it requires multiple steps over several days for our tests we used water from karoon river which is the irrigation source for the salman farsi sugarcane agro industry area in the laboratory the test soil was first air dried for nearly 10 days and then crushed and passed through sieve number 4 4 75 mm to remove trash the bottom 10 cm of the tank was filled with gravel and then further filled with 150 cm of the prepared soil in 5 cm increments after each increment the soil was slightly compacted manually once the soil level reached the drain level 45 cm from the bottom a hydroluis drainpipe 125 cm in length was installed and fixed to the inner tank at a slight slope of 1 to the outlet the drainpipe and envelope were completely sealed at the head end of the pipe which was in contact with soil the outlet end was connected to a pvc outlet pipe to allow measurement of drain discharge the filling of soil above the drainpipe then continued in a similar fashion to the previous stages until the soil level reached 160 cm above the soil tank floor discounting the 10 cm gravel layer at the bottom of the inner tank the depth of the test soil was 150 cm prior to commencing the test the soil was saturated the drainage outlet was blocked and water was allowed to enter the outer tank gradually over a period of about 5 days after each 5 cm increase in the water level of the outer tank the inflow was stopped and the water was allowed to infiltrate into the soil for at least one hour to ensure that no air bubbles remained in the soil the water level was thus increased until it reached 160 cm above the tank floor because some soil subsidence occurred during the saturation phase an additional amount of soil was added to the inner tank to restore the soil depth to 160 cm the test started on 1 august 2018 by opening the drain outlet during the test period piezometer water levels were measured daily and daily drain discharge was measured using a stopwatch and graduated cylinder the electrical conductivity and temperature of both internal water and drained water were measured on a daily basis using an ec meter and thermometer moreover the sediment load of the drained water was measured by putting a 10 l container under the outlet pvc pipe and measuring the dry weight of the gathered sediment on a weekly basis the laboratory test continued until an equilibrium was reached the entrance resistance of the soil envelope pipe combination to water movement was then calculated using the following equation dieleman and trafford 1976 1 we h q where we is the entrance resistance day m h is the head loss or the difference between the piezometer water level and the water level in the drainpipe m and q is the drain discharge per unit drain length m3 day m at the end of the experiment clogging and sedimentation of the envelope and pipe were analysed by excavating the pipe weighing the sediment in the inner pipe and the soil trapped between the inner and outer pipes and determining the soil texture of these sediments the same procedures were used to test the locally manufactured synthetic envelope pp450 drainpipe with the same soil and under the same laboratory conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 need for an envelope based on the currently used criteria for soil texture and stability our soil did not need an envelope table 3 similarly the particle size distribution of our soil was not within the range of particle size distributions likely to clog so here too no envelope was indicated as required fig 2 however experience in khuzestan province strongly suggests the use of an envelope around subsurface drains as soils here are inclined to dispersion due to the shallow saline water table and soil sodicity hasan oghli 2008 kooti 1994 these local experiences point to the limitations of using the criteria in the literature to determine need for an envelope in saline sodic soils in khuzestan province 3 2 hydraulic function the 11 piezometers in the hydroluis test showed slightly higher water levels than those in the pp450 test 4 65 higher on average under free drainage conditions for both drainpipes fig 3 all the piezometers above and to the sides of the hydroluis drainpipe p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 p11 had water levels nearly equivalent to the tank water level 163 cm indicating virtually no flow of water above and sideways of the drainpipe only the piezometers below the drainpipe p7 p8 and p9 and the piezometer between the inner and outer pipes p10 showed a lower water level during the test period this is logical as the outer pipe of the hydroluis system is unperforated so water can only enter the drainpipe from below the high water level in piezometer p10 for the hydroluis system indicated clogging of the perforations and or the space between the inner and outer pipes while an average head loss of around 3 2 cm in the direction of flow was observed below the pp450 drainpipe from piezometer p9 to p7 no logical trend in head loss was observed for the same piezometers below the hydroluis drainpipe changes in drainage rate and entrance resistance of the hydroluis drainpipe occurred in three phases fig 4 in phase 1 days 1 7 the hydroluis drainage rate dropped sharply from a high of around 250 mm day to just below 50 mm day in this phase the entrance resistance of the hydroluis drainpipe increased gradually from around 7 days m to around 50 days m in phase 2 days 7 15 the drainage rate of the pipe continued to decrease but more gradually to reach just under 4 mm day at the end of day 15 the entrance resistance of the hydroluis drainpipe suddenly jumped to around 800 days m at the end of this phase at the start of phase 3 days 15 71 the drainage rate of the hydroluis pipe stabilized at around 2 mm day remaining at this level for the rest of the test period the entrance resistance of the hydroluis drainpipe however continued to increase gradually in this phase reaching 1100 days m at the end of the experiment drainage rate and entrance resistance for the pp450 drainpipe started off similar to the hydroluis drainpipe but for the pp450 the drainage rate and entrance resistance changed more gradually and stabilized at around 28 mm day and 55 days m respectively at about day 50 these values are in the range of those reported by ghane 2007 who found a drainage rate of 140 mm day and an entrance resistance of 5 days m when testing a pp450 drainpipe in a silty clay loam soil in khuzestan province unknown chemical properties under the same laboratory conditions of this experiment head loss was high near both drainpipes and more or less the same for both systems increasing gradually from 104 mm day to almost 111 mm day during the test period head loss here is defined as the difference between the average water level for the piezometers 5 cm from the drainpipe and the water level in the drainpipe around 45 cm from the tank floor these results indicate good hydraulic function of the pp450 drainpipe and poor hydraulic function of the hydroluis drainpipe at the end of the experiment the entrance resistance of the hydroluis drainpipe was 20 times greater than that of the pp450 while the hydroluis drainage rate was 20 times lower than that of the pp450 drainpipe the poor hydraulic function of the hydroluis system can probably be explained by a sudden rush of unstable soil particles toward the pipe perforations and into the space between the inner and outer pipes in phase 1 alongside the almost complete clogging by the end of phase 2 and compaction of the soil between the inner and outer pipes in phase 3 3 3 filter function to understand the hydraulic behaviour of the drainpipes we must look at their filter function for the hydroluis system it is the space between the inner and outer pipes 8 mm that determines the filter function of the drainpipe bahçeci et al 2018 assumed this space would be filled with water or air during operation however upon excavation of the hydroluis pipe used in our test we found the space between the inner and outer pipes was almost completely filled with soil furthermore a thick sediment layer was collected on the inner pipe surface blocking the perforations fig 5 in contrast upon excavation of the pp450 drainpipe the perforations were found to be unclogged despite the considerable amount of soil retained in the envelope material surprisingly an insignificant amount of sediments observed inside the pp450 drainpipe during excavation in addition to visual inspection of the excavated drainpipes we analysed the filter function of both drainpipes by measuring soil particle sedimentation during the test fig 6 in the hydroluis system 916 g of sediment was removed with drain outflow on the first day of the experiment compared to almost no sediment in the pp450 drainpipe test similarly after excavation 1 35 kg of sediment was removed from the hydroluis inner pipe compared to an insignificant amount of sediment from the pp450 drainpipe examining the total amount of sediment that entered the hydroluis system 7070 g 4684 g 66 was retained in the space between the inner and outer pipes 1396 g remained in the inner pipe 19 and 1040 g 15 was removed with drain outflow of all the sediment that passed through the hydroluis inner pipe during the test around 38 passed on the first day examining the total amount of sediment that entered the pp450 drainpipe 1111 g 1090 g 98 was retained by the envelope material and the 2 that did enter the pipe was removed with the drain outflow if all the sediment entering the drainpipes during the tests had remained in and been uniformly deposited in the drainpipes it would have occupied around 17 1678 cm3 of the inner space of the hydroluis pipe and only 0 2 15 cm3 of the pp450 drainpipe fig 7 we thus conclude that the main cause of failure of the hydroluis system was the clogging of the space between the inner and outer pipes and that the clogging effect of the sediment accumulated in the inner pipe was insignificant the question then arises what soil particle sizes were responsible for the clogging silt and fine sand are considered as problem soil particles that can silt up into drainpipe and cause clogging this is why envelopes are used for filtering to better analyse the filter function of the hydroluis drainpipe and detect the soil particle sizes responsible for clogging we compared the original test soil with several sediment samples gathered during our test sediment removed with drain outflow on the first day sediment remained in the inner pipe and sediment retained between the inner and outer pipes the percentage of soil particles the coefficient of uniformity the coefficient of curvature and the particle size distribution of these sediments were found to be almost identical to the original soil table 4 and fig 8 therefore we can conclude that the space between the inner and outer pipes of the hydroluis system which was supposed to serve the filter function did not in fact filter the problem soil particle sizes in the drainage conditions of our test the test soil entered into both the inner pipe and the space between the inner and outer pipes no analysis of sediment particle size could be done for the pp450 drainpipe as the amount of sediment collected during the test was insufficient for testing both for the sediment collected each week and for the sediment left inside the drainpipe upon excavation 3 4 causes of failure in hydroluis performance from the above discussion we can conclude that in an unstable fine textured soil the hydroluis drainpipe may fail as soil may clog the space between the inner and outer pipes the pre wrapped pp450 envelope in contrast maintained acceptable drainage performance this raises the question of what could cause soil mass movement between the inner and outer pipes of the hydroluis system and why the pp450 envelope retains its filter function even in such an unstable fine textured soil first we look at the drag forces 3 4 1 drag forces at the soil envelope interface the performance of a drain envelope material depends mainly on the relative stability of soil particles at the soil envelope interface water passing through a saturated soil exerts a frictional drag force on soil particles as the soil water velocity increases approaching the drain envelop the forces exerted by the water on soil particles may reach a limit at which the soil particles can no longer resist the drag forces of the water at that point the soil particles begin to separate water velocity reaches its maximum at the soil envelope interface where flow lines have maximum convergence flow enters the pp450 drainpipe from a circular perimeter around the synthetic envelope while the design of the hydroluis drainpipe compels the flow to enter the drainpipe only from two narrow spaces below the drainpipe fig 9 this latter flow pattern results in greater convergence of flow lines at the hydroluis soil envelope interface increasing flow velocity and drag forces below the drainpipe the wetted area of the envelope in contact with the soil conveying the water determines the flow velocity at the soil envelope interface and thus the risk of soil erosion we compared the flow velocity v q a of the hydroluis and pp450 drainpipes at their soil envelope interface with a saturated soil profile using the following assumptions the hydroluis and pp450 drainpipes have the same drainage rate q envelopes are much more permeable than the soil nearby no clogging exists of the envelope perforations or in the soil we see that for the same drainage rate the flow velocity at the soil envelope interface is 21 5 times greater for the hydroluis drainpipe than the pp450 drainpipe eq 2 in other words soil erosion at the soil envelope interface is far more likely to occur with the hydroluis drainpipe than the pp450 drainpipe therefore with the hydroluis system soil particle movement takes place at lower hydraulic gradients and lower drainage rates compared to the pp450 drainpipe 2 v h y d v p p 450 a p p 450 a h y d π d 2 t 2 d π 10 2 0 487 2 0 8 21 5 where v is the flow velocity at the soil envelope interface cm hr a is the effective area of flow at the soil envelope interface per unit length of the drainpipe cm2 d is the diameter of the drainpipe cm t is the thickness of the synthetic envelope for the pp450 drainpipe cm and d is the distance between the inner and outer pipes for the hydroluis drainpipe cm 3 4 2 ability of drainpipes to retain soil particles at very low moisture contents soils behave more like solids though when moisture content is high the soil and water mix can behave more like a liquid in 1911 swedish scientist albert atterberg developed a method to describe the consistency of fine grained soils at varying moisture contents he defined the plastic limit pl and liquid limit ll as soil water contents at which the mechanical properties of soil change atterberg 1911 according to atterberg when soil water content exceeds the liquid limit the soil mass may flow like a liquid however the liquid behaviour of a soil seems to be related not only to soil water content but also to hydraulic gradient the plasticity limit and liquid limit of our test soil were 18 5 and 34 8 respectively resulting in a plasticity index pi of 16 3 according to sowers 1979 this classifies the test soil as medium plasticity 7 pi 17 therefore mass movement of the test soil is likely in saturated conditions with a high hydraulic gradient which is the case for most subsurface drainpipes after a heavy rainfall or irrigation this suggests that an envelope material is needed around the drainpipe to inhibit soil mass movement in such conditions a frequently used retention criterion for synthetic envelopes is o90 d90 ratio here o90 is the pore size for which 90 of envelope pores are smaller and d90 is the particle diameter of the soil in contact with the envelope for which 90 of the particles by weight is smaller stuyt 1992 found in three experimental plots in the netherlands that envelopes with large o90 values had poorer soil retention properties dierickx and van der sluys 1990 recommended the following simple retention criterion for synthetic geotextiles and prewrapped loose materials plms to minimize the risk of mineral clogging of subsurface drainage installations 1 o90 d90 4 for envelope thickness between 3 and 5 mm with o90 200 μm for pp450 o90 d90 is 3 75 times greater than the upper limit recommended by dierickx and van der sluys table 5 however the retention function of the pp450 envelope proved acceptable in our test soil on the other hand though the o90 d90 criterion was not developed for envelope designs such as the hydroluis envelopes the 18 times higher value of this retention criteria for the hydroluis drainpipe than pp450 drainpipe may explain the poor retention function and the mass movement of the base soil into the space between the inner and outer pipes of the hydroluis drainpipe 3 5 evaluation of the current hydroluis desing and recommendations for future application or design in this section the pattern of filter behaviour of the hydroluis drainpipe is described assuming the stokes law is the governing rule of the filter function then based on the stokes law the current design of hydroluis drainpipe is evaluated also suggestions are provided for application of the current design of hydroluis drainpipe or for designing new generations of hydroluis drainpipes in well structured soils with low hydraulic gradients the soil mass may stay stable and not enter the space between the inner and outer pipes of the hydroluis system even under saturated conditions yet individual soil particles will never stop moving and may clog the drainpipe gradually 3 5 1 stokes law governing filter function a soil particle may be filtered by the hydroluis drainpipe if the downward falling velocity of that particle in the water suspension between the inner and outer pipes is greater than the upward velocity of flow according to stokes law stokes 1851 the falling velocity of a soil particle is related to the diameter squared of that soil particle as follows 3 v g d s d w d 2 18 ƞ 980 2 65 0 997 d 2 18 0 0089 10112 d 2 where v is the velocity of the falling particle cm s g is acceleration due to gravity 980 cm s2 ds is the density of the particle g cm3 2 65 for most mineral soils dw is the density of the medium g cm3 0 997 for water at 25 c d is the diameter of the particle cm and ƞ is the absolute viscosity of the medium dyn s cm2 0 0089 for water at 25 c stokes law is based on assumptions which somewhat limit its application in real conditions these assumptions include i the falling soil particles are smooth spheres ii terminal velocity is reached instantaneously iii resistance when settling is due to fluid viscosity and is not influenced by the wall of the pipes iv soil particles move individually and there is no interaction between them and v no variation occurs in the temperature of the fluid 3 5 2 maximum allowable drainage rates and spacing accepting stokes assumptions we calculated the velocity of falling particles between the inner and outer pipes of the hydroluis system using eq 3 for the problem soil particle sizes silt and fine sand as classified by the usda soil science division staff 2017 based on the lower limit diameter in each textural class we calculated the maximum allowable velocity between the inner and outer pipes and the corresponding maximum allowable drain discharge per unit length of the hydroluis drainpipe table 6 for instance to avoid entry of fine silt particles into the drainpipe the velocity of falling particles between the inner and outer pipes of hydroluis must remain less than 1 46 cm hr corresponding to a drain discharge of 0 23 l hr m clay particles d 0 002 mm in subsurface drainage however are not considered problematic since these very fine particles can safely remain in suspension and be removed with drain outflow the drainage rate of the hydroluis drainpipe on the first day of the experiment when the most soil invasion into the pipe occurred was 6 24 l hr m 249 6 mm day this is 27 times greater than the lower limit calculated for the drain discharge for fine silt particles 0 23 l hr m 9 3 mm day thus if the test soil in our laboratory experiment had remained stable only fine silt particles would be expected to enter drainpipe to make the results of table 6 more practical we converted the maximum allowable drain discharge per unit length of hydroluis drainpipe to equivalent maximum drainage rates and drain spacing for problem soil particles fig 10 fine silt and coarse silt are the soil particles that if abundant in the soil profile can seriously limit the hydroluis drainpipe application in particular in soils with a large proportion of fine silt particles hydroluis drainpipe can only be used in unreasonable low spacing and drainage rates lm 5 6 m for qm 1 mm day coarser soil particles d 0 05 mm on the other hand are not an impediment to hydroluis drainpipe application in usual drainage practices 3 5 3 estimating maximum project drainage rate the maximum drainage rate of a project is an important factor for predicting the filter performance and possible clogging of the hydroluis drainpipe the maximum probable drainage rate needs to be carefully estimated in a particular drainage project to ensure that no problem soil particles enter the drainpipe the maximum drainage rate is dependent on project drainage properties such as the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile drainage depth drain spacing drain radius and depth to the impermeable layer skaggs 2017 proposed the maximum subsurface drainage rate equivalent to a saturated profile with a ponded surface providing that the hydraulic capacity of the drainage network is greater than the maximum drainage rate he suggested equations developed by kirkham 1957 for calculating this drainage rate therefore to use hydroluis drainpipe in a subsurface drainage project it is recommended that the maximum probable drainage rate of the project be compared to the maximum allowable drainage rate proposed in table 6 and fig 10 if necessary drain spacing can be adapted to account for the finest problem soil particles found in the soil profile 3 5 4 the role of inter pipes distance in filter function the distance between the inner and outer pipes d determines the inter pipe upward flow velocity and filter function of the hydroluis drainpipe future studies thus may focus on different d spacing to improve filter function of the hydroluis drainpipe in different soils increasing the d spacing is one feasible way to decrease inter pipes flow velocity and possibly improve the filter function in stable silty soils based on the stokes law coarse silt particles for example at a drain spacing of 100 m can only be filtered at a maximum drainage rate of 5 6 mm day with the current design of the hydroluis pipe fig 11 for coarse silt particles the design of the hydroluis drainpipe at this spacing can be improved by increasing the d spacing from 0 8 cm to 1 1 and 1 4 cm to safely withstand maximum drainage rates of 7 5 and 10 mm day respectively nevertheless the current hydroluis drainpipe design remains unsuitable for filtering fine silt particles even at low maximum drainage rates nor can it be logically improved by increasing d for instance a subsurface drainage project with a drain spacing of 30 m and a maximum drainage rate of just 2 mm day would need a hydroluis drainpipe with an unreasonable d spacing of 8 6 cm it should be noted that although increasing the distance between the inner and outer pipes may improve the filter function of the hydroluis drainpipe such an increase conflicts with the retention function of the drainpipe this is because the larger the distance between the inner and outer pipes larger o90 the poorer will be the retention function of the hydroluis drainpipe and easier will be mass movement of the base soil 3 6 justify good field performance of the hydroluis in turkey the above mentioned discussions may explain why the hydroluis drainpipe did not clog in the field test conducted by bahçeci et al 2018 in turkey as they reported the field in which the hydroluis drainpipe was installed had an average clay content of 59 a saturated electrical conductivity of 0 91 ds m and 34 of lime they however did not report detailed chemical compositions of their soil including esp percentage non saline soils ece 4 ds m with clay content more than 30 are generally stable enough and there is no need for an envelope in addition considerable amounts of lime a traditional soil amendment will increase the soil stability and stabilize soil particles to withstand higher drag forces at the soil envelope interface therefore considering the facts that clay soils generally have a low hydraulic conductivity we suppose that in absence of the problem soil particles in the soil profile the flow velocity at the soil envelope interface of hydroluis drainpipe under the maximum drainage rate of the field experiment in turkey would have remained below the limit at which soil erosion and mass movement of the base soil could occur 4 conclusion this study compared the hydraulic and filter functions of the hydroluis drainpipe envelope system to a locally manufactured synthetic envelope drainpipe pp450 in a soil tank laboratory model with a saline sodic problem soil from south western iran the test showed that existing criteria for determining the need for an envelope are inconsistent with local experiences with the saline sodic soils esp 15 in khuzestan province iran in the laboratory tests the hydraulic and filter functions of the hydroluis drainpipe were poor because soil around the drainpipe lost its stability and completely clogged the space between the inner and outer pipes in contrast the pp450 envelope had satisfactory drainage function stabilizing at a drainage rate of 28 mm day and an entrance resistance of 55 days m at around day 50 the results of pp450 drainpipe confirm previous findings in soil tank models performed with soils from khuzestan province this study showed that contrary to the assumption of the hydroluis designers soil particles of an unstable soil may clog the space between inner and outer pipes of hydroluis drainpipe and significantly reduce the pipe retention and hydraulic functions possible explanations for the poor drainage function and clogging of the hydroluis drainpipe are the 21 5 times higher flow velocity at the soil envelope interface in addition to the 18 times lower soil retention capacity of the hydroluis drainpipe compared to pp450 drainpipe therefore soil erosion at the soil envelope interface is far more likely to occur with the hydroluis drainpipe than the pp450 drainpipe installing hydroluis drainpipe in unstable soils or with high hydraulic gradients and drainage rates warrants careful consideration stokes law indicates that very fine sand or coarser soil particles d 0 05 mm place no important limitations on use of the hydroluis drainpipe in stable soils our results however indicate that silt particles can seriously limit the applicability of this drainpipe our results suggest that hydroluis as currently designed is unsuitable for filtering fine silt particles 0 002 d 0 02 mm even at low rates of drainage and close spacing therefore use of the hydroluis drainpipe in stable soils with a high percentage of fine silt is not recommended additionally to avoid entry of coarse silt 0 02 d 0 05 mm into the drainpipe it is suggested that the drain discharge per unit length of the hydroluis drainpipe remains lower than 23 3 l hr m for use of the hydroluis drainpipe in unstable soils or fine silty soils we recommend a voluminous or even thin layer of envelope beneath the hydroluis drainpipe this layer can significantly improve the hydraulic and filter functions of the drainpipe not only by diminishing the convergence of flow lines and flow velocity at the hydroluis soil envelope interface but also by reducing the retention ratio of o90 d90 it is doubtful that increasing the distance between the inner and outer pipes would improve the filter function of the hydroluis drainpipe because larger inter pipe distance would reduce the retention function of the drainpipe resulting in easier soil instability and mass movement of soil into the drainpipe thus we conclude that the hydroluis drainpipe does not perform well in saline sodic soils such as those found in south western khuzestan province iran this experiment however was carried out in the laboratory with a disturbed sample of a very unstable soil type results may differ under field conditions further laboratory and field studies are recommended to test the hydroluis drainpipe with different hydraulic gradients and drainage rates in different soil types to determine the stability limit of soil around the drainpipe and better understand the clogging process and likelihood credit authorship contribution statement seyed abdollah alavi formal analysis conceptualization visualization

10403,subsurface drains when installed in non cohesive soil are typically covered with an envelope to tackle problems of clogging and siltation selecting a suitable envelope material however is complicated and depends primarily on soil characteristics in the area where the drains are to be installed a new promising drainpipe envelope concept hydroluis has been developed which the designers claim works in a wide range of soils the hydroluis drainpipe consists of a corrugated inner pipe with three rows of perforations at the top and an unperforated outer pipe that covers the top two thirds of the inner pipe we analysed the hydraulic and filter functions of this new drainpipe in a soil tank laboratory model with a saline sodic problem soil from south western iran and compared hydroluis performance with that of a locally manufactured synthetic envelope material pp450 the silty clay soil used in this study was 40 clay with a plasticity index ip of 16 9 and an exchangeable sodium percentage esp of 60 4 the hydroluis drainpipe clogged during the first two weeks of the test due to invasion of the test soil into the space between the inner and outer pipes of the substantial volume of sediment that entered the hydroluis inner pipe 38 removed from the pipe in the first day in contrast the pp450 drainpipe showed good hydraulic and filter functions entering very little sediment to drainpipe during the entire test period and stabilizing at drainage rate of 28 mm day and entrance resistance of 55 days m at around day 50 our analyses suggest that the clogging and poor drainage function of the hydroluis drainpipe was caused by the higher flow velocity 21 5 times higher at the soil envelope interface of the drainpipe in addition to the lower hydroluis drainpipe s soil retention capacity 18 times lower compared to the pp450 drainpipe assuming stokes law governs filter function the results of hydroluis design evaluation also suggest that in stable soils very fine sand or coarser soil particles d 0 05 mm place no serious limitations for hydroluis drainpipe application whereas the current design is unsuitable for filtering fine silt particles 0 002 d 0 02 mm in conclusion we suppose the hydroluis drainpipe does not perform well in silty saline sodic soils such as those found in south western khuzestan province iran keywords subsurface drainage new drainpipe pp450 envelope filter function clogging soil tank test 1 introduction subsurface drains in arid and semi arid areas are primarily installed to reclaim waterlogged or salt affected lands and prevent soil waterlogging and salinization typically subsurface drains are covered with an envelope to restrict soil particles from entering the drainpipe filter function and to create a more permeable area around the pipe hydraulic function ritzema et al 2006 a wide variety of materials are used as envelopes for drainpipes ranging from organic and mineral materials to mineral fibres and synthetic material cavelaars et al 2006 granular mineral materials have been used for decades and are still commonly used in arid and semi arid countries yet they are expensive due to high transport cost stuyt and dierickx 2006 nowadays pre wrapped envelopes of synthetic material are used almost everywhere in the world because they are cheap light weight and simple to install even with trenchless drainage machinery in cohesionless soils the main causes of failure of subsurface drains are clogging and siltation of drainpipes or envelope with soil particles linked to improper selection of the envelope material clogging is defined as a decrease in the permeability of the soil drainpipe envelope system after installation due to particles of the base soil being carried towards the subsurface drainpipes by drag forces of the moving water stuyt and dierickx 2006 most soils in south western khuzestan province in arid iran are problem soils for which subsurface drainpipes need an effective envelope khuzestan s soils consist in large part of silt and clay and are saline and saline sodic and without structure in subsurface horizons pazira and homaee 2010 clogging of subsurface drains in khuzestan province is usually a result of the instability of local soils shallow saline groundwater and high soil salinity ghane 2007 compared the performance of two synthetic envelopes pp450 and pp700 with a gravel envelope in a sand tank model using a problem soil from abadan khuzestan province they reported that the gravel envelope performed better than the synthetic envelopes despite the acceptable performance of the synthetic envelopes formulation of criteria for envelope design is complicated and depends on soil characteristics and installation conditions stuyt and dierickx 2006 stuyt and willardson 1999 many physical criteria have been published during the past 50 years to suggest whether a soil is unstable and needs an envelope however the structural stability of a soil especially in arid regions is affected not only by a soil s physical properties but also by its salt and sodium content a high exchangeable sodium percentage esp usually indicates poor physical soil conditions and a likelihood of displacement of colloidal soil particles in general in arid climates drainpipe clogging problems are not experienced in non sodic soils with esp values below 15 stuyt et al 2000 yet so far no sufficient criteria are available to classify envelope need for soils with esp values higher than 15 especially saline sodic soils according to their chemical composition it is therefore recommended that the effectiveness of an envelope be proven in field trials at the locations where the subsurface drains are to be installed vlotman et al 2001 stuyt et al 2000 to tackle the complication of envelope design a new pipe envelope concept was recently developed in turkey that does not use any envelope material the new concept called hydroluis consists of a corrugated inner pipe with three rows of perforations at the top and an unperforated outer pipe that covers about the top two thirds of the inner pipe the 8 mm distance between the inner and outer pipes determines the flow velocity and thus the filter function of the pipe bahçeci et al 2018 bahçeci et al 2018 tested the hydroluis system in a field with a stable non saline soil clay 56 ece 1 ds m in turkey during 2015 and 2016 they concluded that the hydroluis envelope was a good alternative for a gravel or synthetic envelope for irrigated lands with a wide range of soil textures the hydroluis pipe was not however tested with a saline sodic problem soil investigating a new drainpipe in an area is usually conducted in two consecutive steps to prevent waste of time and money examining the drainpipe in the laboratory with the soil of experimental field in a short term and consequently if the laboratory results prove promising investigating the long term effects of the drainpipe installation in the field accordingly the objective of the laboratory experiments is to quantify the flow entrance resistance hydraulic function investigate clogging of pipe or envelope and explore substantial passage of mineral particles filter function for short time after drainpipe installation stuyt et al 2000 analogue models that have been extensively used in the laboratory for these purposes are soil tank and flow permeameter models examining a drainpipe in the laboratory has some important limitations compared to field that should be under considerations when interpreting the results first the drainpipe envelope combination is tested in a rather short time while in the field increase in entrance resistance or clogging may occur in long time wesseling and homma 1967 second the soil used in the test is disturbed although it should have similar soil texture and chemical composition to the field thus the test soil has different bulk density and hydraulic conductivity compared to the field soil tanks in particular have some additional limitations in comparison with flow permeameters rather large amount of homogeneous soil is needed to fill the soil tank models which is quite labour intensive and limits the repeatability of the test moreover applying varied hydraulic gradient cannot be easily maintained in the soil tank models in this study we have analysed the hydraulic and filter functions of the hydroluis pipe envelope system in a soil tank model with a saline sodic problem soil from south western iran and compared performance with a locally manufactured synthetic envelope drainpipe pp450 we have explained the possible causes of failure or success of each drainpipe in addition we have evaluate the filter function of the current hydroluis design and have given recommendations for future application or design of the next generations of the hydroluis drainpipe 2 material and methods 2 1 soil tank laboratory tests using soil sand tank models and flow permeameters have been extensively done worldwide with different envelope materials to formulate criteria for selecting the right envelope material wesseling and homma 1967 willardson et al 1968 qureshi et al 1990 fischer et al 1994 shi et al 1994 bonnell et al 1986 in our experiment we used a laboratory soil tank to investigate the drainage function of the hydroluis drainpipe envelope system under a possible maximum drainage rate of drainage practice in khuzestan province we chose the soil tank model for experiment among analogue models because the special design of hydroluis drainpipe with no envelope material can only be studied under this kind of laboratory experiments the soil tank in this experiment was constructed according to the method introduced by eichenauer et al 1994 the soil tank consisted of a steel frame measuring 150 cm in length 80 cm in width and 200 cm in height with four glass outer walls and two perforated steel inner walls fig 1 the perforated walls formed an inner tank measuring 60 cm in width leaving a 10 cm gap to the outer wall on two sides the perforations on the walls were 0 8 cm in diameter and 10 cm apart the drainpipe was installed horizontally in the middle of the inner tank with the centre of the pipe 50 cm above the tank floor the characteristics of the drainpipes used in this experiment are presented in table 1 ten piezometers were installed above below and to the sides of the drainpipe one piezometer p10 was installed between the inner and outer pipes the piezometers were connected to transparent pipes to enable measurement of their piezometric heads the soil tank model in this study attempts to simulate field conditions of a newly installed and backfilled drainpipe in a trench with 1 2 m depth in a saline sodic soil undergoing leaching practice for few months a constant water level of 110 cm above the drainpipe was maintained this level is representative of the leaching practices in khuzestan province where leaching after drainpipe installation is used to reclaim saline and or sodic soils before cultivation leaching here is usually done by making a continuous water pond on a field for a few months a representative saline sodic soil was collected from the top 50 cm depth of an uncultivated plot in the salman farsi sugarcane agro industrial area farm r8 18 48 27 n 30 56 e in the south western khuzestan province with no subsurface drains or history of leaching or cultivation practices the soil texture was identical from soil surface to 1 5 m depth the soil was collected from the more saline topsoil with the assumption that during leaching practice the salts from the topsoil layers would leach to drain level subsoil which then may affect soil particle bonds and movements near drainpipes the soil had a clay content of 40 plasticity index of 16 9 saturated electrical conductivity ece of 188 ds m a sodium adsorption ratio sar of 104 2 and an exchangeable sodium percentage esp of 60 4 table 2 based on the larry cihacek 2012 classification this soil with ec 4 esp 15 sar 13 and ph 8 5 is a saline sodic soil with a limited drainage ability we analysed particle size distribution of soil samples using a malvern mastersizer which employs laser diffraction to measure the size of soil particles ranging from 0 1 1000 μm malvern instruments 2004 the mastersizer provides fast simple and precise particle size distribution results allowing differentiation of a wide range of soils in comparison the traditionally used hydrometer method is more time consuming and error prone as it requires multiple steps over several days for our tests we used water from karoon river which is the irrigation source for the salman farsi sugarcane agro industry area in the laboratory the test soil was first air dried for nearly 10 days and then crushed and passed through sieve number 4 4 75 mm to remove trash the bottom 10 cm of the tank was filled with gravel and then further filled with 150 cm of the prepared soil in 5 cm increments after each increment the soil was slightly compacted manually once the soil level reached the drain level 45 cm from the bottom a hydroluis drainpipe 125 cm in length was installed and fixed to the inner tank at a slight slope of 1 to the outlet the drainpipe and envelope were completely sealed at the head end of the pipe which was in contact with soil the outlet end was connected to a pvc outlet pipe to allow measurement of drain discharge the filling of soil above the drainpipe then continued in a similar fashion to the previous stages until the soil level reached 160 cm above the soil tank floor discounting the 10 cm gravel layer at the bottom of the inner tank the depth of the test soil was 150 cm prior to commencing the test the soil was saturated the drainage outlet was blocked and water was allowed to enter the outer tank gradually over a period of about 5 days after each 5 cm increase in the water level of the outer tank the inflow was stopped and the water was allowed to infiltrate into the soil for at least one hour to ensure that no air bubbles remained in the soil the water level was thus increased until it reached 160 cm above the tank floor because some soil subsidence occurred during the saturation phase an additional amount of soil was added to the inner tank to restore the soil depth to 160 cm the test started on 1 august 2018 by opening the drain outlet during the test period piezometer water levels were measured daily and daily drain discharge was measured using a stopwatch and graduated cylinder the electrical conductivity and temperature of both internal water and drained water were measured on a daily basis using an ec meter and thermometer moreover the sediment load of the drained water was measured by putting a 10 l container under the outlet pvc pipe and measuring the dry weight of the gathered sediment on a weekly basis the laboratory test continued until an equilibrium was reached the entrance resistance of the soil envelope pipe combination to water movement was then calculated using the following equation dieleman and trafford 1976 1 we h q where we is the entrance resistance day m h is the head loss or the difference between the piezometer water level and the water level in the drainpipe m and q is the drain discharge per unit drain length m3 day m at the end of the experiment clogging and sedimentation of the envelope and pipe were analysed by excavating the pipe weighing the sediment in the inner pipe and the soil trapped between the inner and outer pipes and determining the soil texture of these sediments the same procedures were used to test the locally manufactured synthetic envelope pp450 drainpipe with the same soil and under the same laboratory conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 need for an envelope based on the currently used criteria for soil texture and stability our soil did not need an envelope table 3 similarly the particle size distribution of our soil was not within the range of particle size distributions likely to clog so here too no envelope was indicated as required fig 2 however experience in khuzestan province strongly suggests the use of an envelope around subsurface drains as soils here are inclined to dispersion due to the shallow saline water table and soil sodicity hasan oghli 2008 kooti 1994 these local experiences point to the limitations of using the criteria in the literature to determine need for an envelope in saline sodic soils in khuzestan province 3 2 hydraulic function the 11 piezometers in the hydroluis test showed slightly higher water levels than those in the pp450 test 4 65 higher on average under free drainage conditions for both drainpipes fig 3 all the piezometers above and to the sides of the hydroluis drainpipe p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 p11 had water levels nearly equivalent to the tank water level 163 cm indicating virtually no flow of water above and sideways of the drainpipe only the piezometers below the drainpipe p7 p8 and p9 and the piezometer between the inner and outer pipes p10 showed a lower water level during the test period this is logical as the outer pipe of the hydroluis system is unperforated so water can only enter the drainpipe from below the high water level in piezometer p10 for the hydroluis system indicated clogging of the perforations and or the space between the inner and outer pipes while an average head loss of around 3 2 cm in the direction of flow was observed below the pp450 drainpipe from piezometer p9 to p7 no logical trend in head loss was observed for the same piezometers below the hydroluis drainpipe changes in drainage rate and entrance resistance of the hydroluis drainpipe occurred in three phases fig 4 in phase 1 days 1 7 the hydroluis drainage rate dropped sharply from a high of around 250 mm day to just below 50 mm day in this phase the entrance resistance of the hydroluis drainpipe increased gradually from around 7 days m to around 50 days m in phase 2 days 7 15 the drainage rate of the pipe continued to decrease but more gradually to reach just under 4 mm day at the end of day 15 the entrance resistance of the hydroluis drainpipe suddenly jumped to around 800 days m at the end of this phase at the start of phase 3 days 15 71 the drainage rate of the hydroluis pipe stabilized at around 2 mm day remaining at this level for the rest of the test period the entrance resistance of the hydroluis drainpipe however continued to increase gradually in this phase reaching 1100 days m at the end of the experiment drainage rate and entrance resistance for the pp450 drainpipe started off similar to the hydroluis drainpipe but for the pp450 the drainage rate and entrance resistance changed more gradually and stabilized at around 28 mm day and 55 days m respectively at about day 50 these values are in the range of those reported by ghane 2007 who found a drainage rate of 140 mm day and an entrance resistance of 5 days m when testing a pp450 drainpipe in a silty clay loam soil in khuzestan province unknown chemical properties under the same laboratory conditions of this experiment head loss was high near both drainpipes and more or less the same for both systems increasing gradually from 104 mm day to almost 111 mm day during the test period head loss here is defined as the difference between the average water level for the piezometers 5 cm from the drainpipe and the water level in the drainpipe around 45 cm from the tank floor these results indicate good hydraulic function of the pp450 drainpipe and poor hydraulic function of the hydroluis drainpipe at the end of the experiment the entrance resistance of the hydroluis drainpipe was 20 times greater than that of the pp450 while the hydroluis drainage rate was 20 times lower than that of the pp450 drainpipe the poor hydraulic function of the hydroluis system can probably be explained by a sudden rush of unstable soil particles toward the pipe perforations and into the space between the inner and outer pipes in phase 1 alongside the almost complete clogging by the end of phase 2 and compaction of the soil between the inner and outer pipes in phase 3 3 3 filter function to understand the hydraulic behaviour of the drainpipes we must look at their filter function for the hydroluis system it is the space between the inner and outer pipes 8 mm that determines the filter function of the drainpipe bahçeci et al 2018 assumed this space would be filled with water or air during operation however upon excavation of the hydroluis pipe used in our test we found the space between the inner and outer pipes was almost completely filled with soil furthermore a thick sediment layer was collected on the inner pipe surface blocking the perforations fig 5 in contrast upon excavation of the pp450 drainpipe the perforations were found to be unclogged despite the considerable amount of soil retained in the envelope material surprisingly an insignificant amount of sediments observed inside the pp450 drainpipe during excavation in addition to visual inspection of the excavated drainpipes we analysed the filter function of both drainpipes by measuring soil particle sedimentation during the test fig 6 in the hydroluis system 916 g of sediment was removed with drain outflow on the first day of the experiment compared to almost no sediment in the pp450 drainpipe test similarly after excavation 1 35 kg of sediment was removed from the hydroluis inner pipe compared to an insignificant amount of sediment from the pp450 drainpipe examining the total amount of sediment that entered the hydroluis system 7070 g 4684 g 66 was retained in the space between the inner and outer pipes 1396 g remained in the inner pipe 19 and 1040 g 15 was removed with drain outflow of all the sediment that passed through the hydroluis inner pipe during the test around 38 passed on the first day examining the total amount of sediment that entered the pp450 drainpipe 1111 g 1090 g 98 was retained by the envelope material and the 2 that did enter the pipe was removed with the drain outflow if all the sediment entering the drainpipes during the tests had remained in and been uniformly deposited in the drainpipes it would have occupied around 17 1678 cm3 of the inner space of the hydroluis pipe and only 0 2 15 cm3 of the pp450 drainpipe fig 7 we thus conclude that the main cause of failure of the hydroluis system was the clogging of the space between the inner and outer pipes and that the clogging effect of the sediment accumulated in the inner pipe was insignificant the question then arises what soil particle sizes were responsible for the clogging silt and fine sand are considered as problem soil particles that can silt up into drainpipe and cause clogging this is why envelopes are used for filtering to better analyse the filter function of the hydroluis drainpipe and detect the soil particle sizes responsible for clogging we compared the original test soil with several sediment samples gathered during our test sediment removed with drain outflow on the first day sediment remained in the inner pipe and sediment retained between the inner and outer pipes the percentage of soil particles the coefficient of uniformity the coefficient of curvature and the particle size distribution of these sediments were found to be almost identical to the original soil table 4 and fig 8 therefore we can conclude that the space between the inner and outer pipes of the hydroluis system which was supposed to serve the filter function did not in fact filter the problem soil particle sizes in the drainage conditions of our test the test soil entered into both the inner pipe and the space between the inner and outer pipes no analysis of sediment particle size could be done for the pp450 drainpipe as the amount of sediment collected during the test was insufficient for testing both for the sediment collected each week and for the sediment left inside the drainpipe upon excavation 3 4 causes of failure in hydroluis performance from the above discussion we can conclude that in an unstable fine textured soil the hydroluis drainpipe may fail as soil may clog the space between the inner and outer pipes the pre wrapped pp450 envelope in contrast maintained acceptable drainage performance this raises the question of what could cause soil mass movement between the inner and outer pipes of the hydroluis system and why the pp450 envelope retains its filter function even in such an unstable fine textured soil first we look at the drag forces 3 4 1 drag forces at the soil envelope interface the performance of a drain envelope material depends mainly on the relative stability of soil particles at the soil envelope interface water passing through a saturated soil exerts a frictional drag force on soil particles as the soil water velocity increases approaching the drain envelop the forces exerted by the water on soil particles may reach a limit at which the soil particles can no longer resist the drag forces of the water at that point the soil particles begin to separate water velocity reaches its maximum at the soil envelope interface where flow lines have maximum convergence flow enters the pp450 drainpipe from a circular perimeter around the synthetic envelope while the design of the hydroluis drainpipe compels the flow to enter the drainpipe only from two narrow spaces below the drainpipe fig 9 this latter flow pattern results in greater convergence of flow lines at the hydroluis soil envelope interface increasing flow velocity and drag forces below the drainpipe the wetted area of the envelope in contact with the soil conveying the water determines the flow velocity at the soil envelope interface and thus the risk of soil erosion we compared the flow velocity v q a of the hydroluis and pp450 drainpipes at their soil envelope interface with a saturated soil profile using the following assumptions the hydroluis and pp450 drainpipes have the same drainage rate q envelopes are much more permeable than the soil nearby no clogging exists of the envelope perforations or in the soil we see that for the same drainage rate the flow velocity at the soil envelope interface is 21 5 times greater for the hydroluis drainpipe than the pp450 drainpipe eq 2 in other words soil erosion at the soil envelope interface is far more likely to occur with the hydroluis drainpipe than the pp450 drainpipe therefore with the hydroluis system soil particle movement takes place at lower hydraulic gradients and lower drainage rates compared to the pp450 drainpipe 2 v h y d v p p 450 a p p 450 a h y d π d 2 t 2 d π 10 2 0 487 2 0 8 21 5 where v is the flow velocity at the soil envelope interface cm hr a is the effective area of flow at the soil envelope interface per unit length of the drainpipe cm2 d is the diameter of the drainpipe cm t is the thickness of the synthetic envelope for the pp450 drainpipe cm and d is the distance between the inner and outer pipes for the hydroluis drainpipe cm 3 4 2 ability of drainpipes to retain soil particles at very low moisture contents soils behave more like solids though when moisture content is high the soil and water mix can behave more like a liquid in 1911 swedish scientist albert atterberg developed a method to describe the consistency of fine grained soils at varying moisture contents he defined the plastic limit pl and liquid limit ll as soil water contents at which the mechanical properties of soil change atterberg 1911 according to atterberg when soil water content exceeds the liquid limit the soil mass may flow like a liquid however the liquid behaviour of a soil seems to be related not only to soil water content but also to hydraulic gradient the plasticity limit and liquid limit of our test soil were 18 5 and 34 8 respectively resulting in a plasticity index pi of 16 3 according to sowers 1979 this classifies the test soil as medium plasticity 7 pi 17 therefore mass movement of the test soil is likely in saturated conditions with a high hydraulic gradient which is the case for most subsurface drainpipes after a heavy rainfall or irrigation this suggests that an envelope material is needed around the drainpipe to inhibit soil mass movement in such conditions a frequently used retention criterion for synthetic envelopes is o90 d90 ratio here o90 is the pore size for which 90 of envelope pores are smaller and d90 is the particle diameter of the soil in contact with the envelope for which 90 of the particles by weight is smaller stuyt 1992 found in three experimental plots in the netherlands that envelopes with large o90 values had poorer soil retention properties dierickx and van der sluys 1990 recommended the following simple retention criterion for synthetic geotextiles and prewrapped loose materials plms to minimize the risk of mineral clogging of subsurface drainage installations 1 o90 d90 4 for envelope thickness between 3 and 5 mm with o90 200 μm for pp450 o90 d90 is 3 75 times greater than the upper limit recommended by dierickx and van der sluys table 5 however the retention function of the pp450 envelope proved acceptable in our test soil on the other hand though the o90 d90 criterion was not developed for envelope designs such as the hydroluis envelopes the 18 times higher value of this retention criteria for the hydroluis drainpipe than pp450 drainpipe may explain the poor retention function and the mass movement of the base soil into the space between the inner and outer pipes of the hydroluis drainpipe 3 5 evaluation of the current hydroluis desing and recommendations for future application or design in this section the pattern of filter behaviour of the hydroluis drainpipe is described assuming the stokes law is the governing rule of the filter function then based on the stokes law the current design of hydroluis drainpipe is evaluated also suggestions are provided for application of the current design of hydroluis drainpipe or for designing new generations of hydroluis drainpipes in well structured soils with low hydraulic gradients the soil mass may stay stable and not enter the space between the inner and outer pipes of the hydroluis system even under saturated conditions yet individual soil particles will never stop moving and may clog the drainpipe gradually 3 5 1 stokes law governing filter function a soil particle may be filtered by the hydroluis drainpipe if the downward falling velocity of that particle in the water suspension between the inner and outer pipes is greater than the upward velocity of flow according to stokes law stokes 1851 the falling velocity of a soil particle is related to the diameter squared of that soil particle as follows 3 v g d s d w d 2 18 ƞ 980 2 65 0 997 d 2 18 0 0089 10112 d 2 where v is the velocity of the falling particle cm s g is acceleration due to gravity 980 cm s2 ds is the density of the particle g cm3 2 65 for most mineral soils dw is the density of the medium g cm3 0 997 for water at 25 c d is the diameter of the particle cm and ƞ is the absolute viscosity of the medium dyn s cm2 0 0089 for water at 25 c stokes law is based on assumptions which somewhat limit its application in real conditions these assumptions include i the falling soil particles are smooth spheres ii terminal velocity is reached instantaneously iii resistance when settling is due to fluid viscosity and is not influenced by the wall of the pipes iv soil particles move individually and there is no interaction between them and v no variation occurs in the temperature of the fluid 3 5 2 maximum allowable drainage rates and spacing accepting stokes assumptions we calculated the velocity of falling particles between the inner and outer pipes of the hydroluis system using eq 3 for the problem soil particle sizes silt and fine sand as classified by the usda soil science division staff 2017 based on the lower limit diameter in each textural class we calculated the maximum allowable velocity between the inner and outer pipes and the corresponding maximum allowable drain discharge per unit length of the hydroluis drainpipe table 6 for instance to avoid entry of fine silt particles into the drainpipe the velocity of falling particles between the inner and outer pipes of hydroluis must remain less than 1 46 cm hr corresponding to a drain discharge of 0 23 l hr m clay particles d 0 002 mm in subsurface drainage however are not considered problematic since these very fine particles can safely remain in suspension and be removed with drain outflow the drainage rate of the hydroluis drainpipe on the first day of the experiment when the most soil invasion into the pipe occurred was 6 24 l hr m 249 6 mm day this is 27 times greater than the lower limit calculated for the drain discharge for fine silt particles 0 23 l hr m 9 3 mm day thus if the test soil in our laboratory experiment had remained stable only fine silt particles would be expected to enter drainpipe to make the results of table 6 more practical we converted the maximum allowable drain discharge per unit length of hydroluis drainpipe to equivalent maximum drainage rates and drain spacing for problem soil particles fig 10 fine silt and coarse silt are the soil particles that if abundant in the soil profile can seriously limit the hydroluis drainpipe application in particular in soils with a large proportion of fine silt particles hydroluis drainpipe can only be used in unreasonable low spacing and drainage rates lm 5 6 m for qm 1 mm day coarser soil particles d 0 05 mm on the other hand are not an impediment to hydroluis drainpipe application in usual drainage practices 3 5 3 estimating maximum project drainage rate the maximum drainage rate of a project is an important factor for predicting the filter performance and possible clogging of the hydroluis drainpipe the maximum probable drainage rate needs to be carefully estimated in a particular drainage project to ensure that no problem soil particles enter the drainpipe the maximum drainage rate is dependent on project drainage properties such as the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile drainage depth drain spacing drain radius and depth to the impermeable layer skaggs 2017 proposed the maximum subsurface drainage rate equivalent to a saturated profile with a ponded surface providing that the hydraulic capacity of the drainage network is greater than the maximum drainage rate he suggested equations developed by kirkham 1957 for calculating this drainage rate therefore to use hydroluis drainpipe in a subsurface drainage project it is recommended that the maximum probable drainage rate of the project be compared to the maximum allowable drainage rate proposed in table 6 and fig 10 if necessary drain spacing can be adapted to account for the finest problem soil particles found in the soil profile 3 5 4 the role of inter pipes distance in filter function the distance between the inner and outer pipes d determines the inter pipe upward flow velocity and filter function of the hydroluis drainpipe future studies thus may focus on different d spacing to improve filter function of the hydroluis drainpipe in different soils increasing the d spacing is one feasible way to decrease inter pipes flow velocity and possibly improve the filter function in stable silty soils based on the stokes law coarse silt particles for example at a drain spacing of 100 m can only be filtered at a maximum drainage rate of 5 6 mm day with the current design of the hydroluis pipe fig 11 for coarse silt particles the design of the hydroluis drainpipe at this spacing can be improved by increasing the d spacing from 0 8 cm to 1 1 and 1 4 cm to safely withstand maximum drainage rates of 7 5 and 10 mm day respectively nevertheless the current hydroluis drainpipe design remains unsuitable for filtering fine silt particles even at low maximum drainage rates nor can it be logically improved by increasing d for instance a subsurface drainage project with a drain spacing of 30 m and a maximum drainage rate of just 2 mm day would need a hydroluis drainpipe with an unreasonable d spacing of 8 6 cm it should be noted that although increasing the distance between the inner and outer pipes may improve the filter function of the hydroluis drainpipe such an increase conflicts with the retention function of the drainpipe this is because the larger the distance between the inner and outer pipes larger o90 the poorer will be the retention function of the hydroluis drainpipe and easier will be mass movement of the base soil 3 6 justify good field performance of the hydroluis in turkey the above mentioned discussions may explain why the hydroluis drainpipe did not clog in the field test conducted by bahçeci et al 2018 in turkey as they reported the field in which the hydroluis drainpipe was installed had an average clay content of 59 a saturated electrical conductivity of 0 91 ds m and 34 of lime they however did not report detailed chemical compositions of their soil including esp percentage non saline soils ece 4 ds m with clay content more than 30 are generally stable enough and there is no need for an envelope in addition considerable amounts of lime a traditional soil amendment will increase the soil stability and stabilize soil particles to withstand higher drag forces at the soil envelope interface therefore considering the facts that clay soils generally have a low hydraulic conductivity we suppose that in absence of the problem soil particles in the soil profile the flow velocity at the soil envelope interface of hydroluis drainpipe under the maximum drainage rate of the field experiment in turkey would have remained below the limit at which soil erosion and mass movement of the base soil could occur 4 conclusion this study compared the hydraulic and filter functions of the hydroluis drainpipe envelope system to a locally manufactured synthetic envelope drainpipe pp450 in a soil tank laboratory model with a saline sodic problem soil from south western iran the test showed that existing criteria for determining the need for an envelope are inconsistent with local experiences with the saline sodic soils esp 15 in khuzestan province iran in the laboratory tests the hydraulic and filter functions of the hydroluis drainpipe were poor because soil around the drainpipe lost its stability and completely clogged the space between the inner and outer pipes in contrast the pp450 envelope had satisfactory drainage function stabilizing at a drainage rate of 28 mm day and an entrance resistance of 55 days m at around day 50 the results of pp450 drainpipe confirm previous findings in soil tank models performed with soils from khuzestan province this study showed that contrary to the assumption of the hydroluis designers soil particles of an unstable soil may clog the space between inner and outer pipes of hydroluis drainpipe and significantly reduce the pipe retention and hydraulic functions possible explanations for the poor drainage function and clogging of the hydroluis drainpipe are the 21 5 times higher flow velocity at the soil envelope interface in addition to the 18 times lower soil retention capacity of the hydroluis drainpipe compared to pp450 drainpipe therefore soil erosion at the soil envelope interface is far more likely to occur with the hydroluis drainpipe than the pp450 drainpipe installing hydroluis drainpipe in unstable soils or with high hydraulic gradients and drainage rates warrants careful consideration stokes law indicates that very fine sand or coarser soil particles d 0 05 mm place no important limitations on use of the hydroluis drainpipe in stable soils our results however indicate that silt particles can seriously limit the applicability of this drainpipe our results suggest that hydroluis as currently designed is unsuitable for filtering fine silt particles 0 002 d 0 02 mm even at low rates of drainage and close spacing therefore use of the hydroluis drainpipe in stable soils with a high percentage of fine silt is not recommended additionally to avoid entry of coarse silt 0 02 d 0 05 mm into the drainpipe it is suggested that the drain discharge per unit length of the hydroluis drainpipe remains lower than 23 3 l hr m for use of the hydroluis drainpipe in unstable soils or fine silty soils we recommend a voluminous or even thin layer of envelope beneath the hydroluis drainpipe this layer can significantly improve the hydraulic and filter functions of the drainpipe not only by diminishing the convergence of flow lines and flow velocity at the hydroluis soil envelope interface but also by reducing the retention ratio of o90 d90 it is doubtful that increasing the distance between the inner and outer pipes would improve the filter function of the hydroluis drainpipe because larger inter pipe distance would reduce the retention function of the drainpipe resulting in easier soil instability and mass movement of soil into the drainpipe thus we conclude that the hydroluis drainpipe does not perform well in saline sodic soils such as those found in south western khuzestan province iran this experiment however was carried out in the laboratory with a disturbed sample of a very unstable soil type results may differ under field conditions further laboratory and field studies are recommended to test the hydroluis drainpipe with different hydraulic gradients and drainage rates in different soil types to determine the stability limit of soil around the drainpipe and better understand the clogging process and likelihood credit authorship contribution statement seyed abdollah alavi formal analysis conceptualization visualization

s1 hastings silty clay loam 2 and hastings silt loam s3 in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons irrigation and nitrogen management strategies as well as soil type all influenced the kcr and kco values which exhibited inter annual variation on average greater variation in kc curves between frf vrf and pp nitrogen treatment were observed under vri treatments as compared with fri results showed that kc values are more dependent on the amount rather than the timing of the nitrogen application in all three seasons higher kc values were observed in the fri treatment than vri with kcr ranging from 0 07 to 1 30 in fri and 0 07 to 1 20 in vri kc curves also differed between nitrogen treatments and the difference was more prominent in the vri treatments than in the fri in all years in general maximum kc was observed in pp nitrogen treatment followed by frf and vrf on a monthly average basis maximum kc values were observed in july and august in all soil types and minimum kc values were

strategies and different soil types keywords crop coefficients evapotranspiration irrigation nitrogen soil characteristics variable rate 1 introduction with increasing competition for freshwater resources between agricultural domestic and industrial sectors improved strategies for efficient use of available water resources in agriculture is required for feeding the increasing population especially with the change in climatic conditions approximately 90 of global freshwater resources during the past century were withdrawn for irrigation shiklomanov 2000 jury and henry 2005 in the united states agriculture accounts for approximately 80 of consumptive water use with california nebraska texas arkansas and idaho amongst the highest irrigation water withdrawal states usda ers 2018 approximately 60 of the area under irrigation in the united states use groundwater as a source resulting in groundwater depletion rates greater than the recharge in many areas including ogallala aquifer which is one of the world s largest aquifers that underlies an area of approximately 450 660 km2 in portions of eight states south dakota nebraska wyoming colorado kansas oklahoma new mexico and texas comprising of approximately 80 of the usa high plains region with extensive water withdrawal for irrigation between 1960 and 2000 groundwater depletion in irrigated regions of the united states including the heavily irrigated areas such as the high plains and the california central valley aquifers has been doubled wada et al 2010 efficient irrigation management strategies that use less water without impacting the crop yields need to be developed or existing methods should be further evaluated improved and implemented especially in water limiting regions to increase crop water productivity cwp and protect the sustainability of water resources cwp in irrigated agriculture can be increased by reducing the unbeneficial use of freshwater through development of efficient management strategies and advancing irrigation technologies at the farm or field level irmak 2015a 2015b in certain conditions precision agricultural technologies such as variable rate irrigation vri systems and microirrigation systems have the potential to enable the growers farmers to apply water and agrochemicals site specifically and variably within a field to match soil and plant needs evans and sadler 2008 in some or most cases variable rate technology is assumed to improve crop yield cwp and reduce nitrogen leaching for instance hedley and yule 2009 compared vri and fixed uniform rate irrigation fri scenarios for three years of climate data on 156 ha pasture and 53 ha maize field sites in new zealand and reported 23 to 26 of irrigation water savings with vri when compared with fri hedley et al 2009 on 40 ha pasture 24 ha potato and 22 ha maize sites in new zealand evaluated irrigation water use drainage water use and nitrogen leaching between vri and fri they reported an annual water use reduction of 9 to 19 under vri when compared with fri these studies have used computer simulations to compare conventional and advanced vri technology however the water and or energy saving and other assumed benefits of vri such as increasing yield or cwp have not been independently and sufficiently or even conclusively verified through field based research sadler et al 2002 emphasized the importance and need of site specific crop production functions for strategic decision making for site specific management in a three year field study sadler et al 2002 measured the mean response of maize to irrigation and compared variation in crop response within and among soil map units the water treatments had consistently significant main effects in the analysis of variance anova in both linear and quadratic forms at the 1 level and the variation within soil map units was significant at the 5 level in the latter two years and at the 1 level in the first year they observed variation in yield among soil map units at any point on the response curves being approximated 25 of the maximum yield in all three years variations in the mean irrigation amount to produce a maximum yield in the eight most common map units were 61 61 and 120 of the base rate amount they suggested that this information and data would have significant implications for the design management and economic profitability of irrigation in spatially varying soils they concluded that spatial variation in crop response to irrigation by year soil type and among soil types makes it essential to derive the site specific crop response data to accurately simulate crop growth models for vri for any economic analysis evans and sadler 2008 stated that appropriately localized and real time estimates of crop water demand are either unaffordable or not available their assessments that were made in 2008 are still valid today in terms of the absence of practical methodologies for determining and deploying site specific crop coefficients for variable water applications whether crop production is practiced under deficit limited or full irrigation settings the crop evapotranspiration etc and associated crop coefficients kc values can be impacted by these management practices especially when irrigation strategies are coupled with different nitrogen management strategies for example sharma and irmak 2020a and 2020b xu et al 2020 and li et al 2019 investigated the differences in grain yield etc and cwp between fri and vri management under fixed rate fertigation frf variable rate fertigation vrf and pre plant pp nitrogen sharma and irmak 2020a and 2020b reported that soil properties and field topography played an important role in deciding the irrigation and nitrogen management strategies at field level and that the crop response in terms of yield etc and cwp to fri and vri under frf vrf and pp strategies within a field differed significantly the spatial dependence of grain yield and etc on irrigation and nitrogen management are reported in other studies as well tardieu and katerji 1991 reported a reduction in maize grain yield due to the increase in soil mechanical resistance because of reduced water uptake by the root system under water deficit conditions djaman and irmak 2013 represented the differences in etc values between different irrigation regimes in south central nebraska they reported a reduction in seasonal etc relative to full irrigation treatment fit to be 22 9 7 and 2 for the rainfed 50 fit 60 fit and 75 fit respectively in 2009 and reductions of 9 4 2 and 1 in 2010 for the same treatments respectively liu et al 2010 reported significant impacts of different water management practices on maize etc crop coefficients grain yield and cwp in the same field in loess plateau china payero et al 2008 reported a difference of 75 mm of etc between lowest irrigation and maximum irrigation treatments in 2005 and a difference of 187 mm in 2006 payero et al 2009 reported a variation in etc of 7 2 and 18 8 among treatments and indicated that irrigation timing could have a considerable effect on etc and kc borsato et al 2019 compared the impacts of drip irrigation and two sprinkler center pivot and hose reel systems on environmental economic and energetic performance under irrigated and non irrigated maize cropping they combined impact and efficiency indicators addressing a sustainability analysis for the irrigation practice under the three different irrigation systems the sustainability for the irrigation systems was assessed using water related indicators water use efficiency irrigation water use efficiency and water footprint biomass crop growth rate relative growth rate harvest index and yield response factor and energy indicators energy footprint performance and energy cost footprint for the environmental aspect and the economic based indicators water productivity and economic water footprint for the economic aspect the results showed that center pivot system was the best solution for irrigation practice since it demonstrated higher economic and environmental performance they also observed that maize under the pivot system had higher biomass production economic benefits and wue to achieve the most effective and efficient within season irrigation scheduling for different water and nitrogen application strategies such as vri and fertigation accurate quantification of etc under each management strategy is essential while extensive irrigation management research and automated weather monitoring networks have advanced over time that resulted in improving fri applications such advances in developing crop coefficients and associated spatial etc for variable rate water and fertilizer applications for site specific water use determinations are significantly lacking while kc and etc values are critical variables that are needed to manage vri and fri irrigation management strategies there is a significant lack of data and information on the kc and etc values for vri managed cropping systems under different soil types and nitrogen management sadler et al 2000 compared variation in water use and stress of maize within and among soil map units in one field at two sites in each of four map units they measured site specific effects of soil variation on crop water use from 40 days after planting until after maturity in the southeastern usa coastal plain they observed that maize appears to be particularly susceptible to soil variation especially during periods of drought on the 4th day during vegetative growth drought stress was evaluated on eight transects using infrared thermometer measurements of canopy temperature they reported that maize at the eight sites arrived at final water use via fundamentally different paths further variation between sites within soils was significant indicating that soil map units are not homogenous with respect to water relations these findings indicate the need for developing site specific crop coefficients to determine spatial water use for vri management stone and sadler 2015 utilized a bayesian semiparametric model to spatially estimate irrigated yield rainfed yield maximum yield and irrigation at maximum yield and provide credible intervals measures of uncertainty around these estimates for comparing with the previous analysis they also examined whether the conclusions from this rigorous re analysis were different from the prior analysis and if the results would force any modifications to the conclusions obtained with the prior analyses the model simultaneously accounted for spatial correlation and relationships within the treatments and had the ability to contribute information to nearby neighbors the model based yield estimates were in excellent agreement with the observed spatial maize yields and were able to estimate the high and low yields more accurately than did the previous analysis their conclusions supported the original analysis in identifying significant spatial differences in crop responses across and within soil map units in spatially variable water management applications these spatial differences were great enough to be considered in irrigation system design and management emphasizing the need to experimentally determine variables such as crop coefficients to determine spatial etc some studies have reported the impact of coupled irrigation management and nitrogen management on seasonal and daily etc that resulted in differences in kc during the growing season for the same crop at the same location djaman and irmak 2013 developed grass reference kco and alfalfa reference kcr crop coefficient values under rainfed limited and fully irrigated settings as a function of the thermal unit and days after emergence they reported the midseason average kco values to be 1 26 1 20 1 11 1 08 and 1 10 for the fit 75 fit 60 fit 50 fit and rainfed treatments respectively and midseason average kcr values to be 1 05 1 00 0 97 0 95 and 0 92 for the same treatments respectively with the prevalent interest in the variable rate management for improving crop productivity it is essential to develop site specific local crop coefficients for variable rate management both irrigation and nitrogen however at this point minimal if any studies have investigated the effects of vri combined vrf on kc of the same crop in comparison to fri and frf as well as pre plant fertilizer management pp furthermore it is not well understood as to how kc values under different water fri and vri and nitrogen vrf frf and pp management practices can be potentially impacted by soil types the main objective of this research was to develop et crop coefficients for maize under fixed uniform rate fri and variable rate irrigation vri and fixed uniform rate fertigation frf variable rate fertigation vrf and pre plant nitrogen pp management in three typical soil types to the best of our knowledge this research is the first to quantify the aforementioned variables under three different soil types in the same environment and soil and crop management practices furthermore the research aimed to develop kcr to kco ratios k values to enable crop coefficients developed for one reference surface to be used with the other surface 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site this project

etc reported in this work and those reported by sharma and irmak 2020a and 2020b as reported by sharma and irmak 2020a and 2020b extensive and comprehensive field research campaigns were conducted at the unl south central agricultural laboratory scal research facility near clay center nebraska in 2015 2016 and 2017 maize growing seasons scal is located at latitude 40 34 n and longitude 98 8 w with an elevation of 552 m above mean sea level the long term average annual precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures at the research site is 680 mm 25 c and 5 c respectively the research was conducted on a 2 3 ha field with a west to east elevation gradient ranging from 550 8 m to 552 1 m above mean sea level the research site is in the transition zone between subhumid and semiarid zones with strong winds and a high vapor pressure deficit during summer fixed and variable rate water and nitrogen applications were achieved using a two span 75 m long 7000sl variable rate linear move sprinkler irrigation system three soil types existed in the research field 1 crete silt loam 0 to 1 slopes s1 2 hastings silty clay loam 3 to 7 slopes s2 and 3 hastings silt loam 1 to 3 slopes s3 fig 1 soil samples were collected from 42 locations before planting in each growing season to facilitate the quantification of spatial variation in soil properties the research field was sampled to determine the existing conditions of the soil to determine soil fertilizer recommendations as well as determining irrigation management variables soil cores collected from 42 locations in the field showed average sand silt and clay content ranging from 15 to 57 20 to 74 and 7 to 39 respectively measured volumetric water content at field capacity for soil 3 s3 was significantly lower than soil 1 s1 and soil 2 s2 soil water holding capacity swhc of s1 was also significantly higher than soil 3 other soil physical characteristics were also significantly different p 0 05 between the soils which provided a unique opportunity to investigate soil type impact on kc values under fri vri with frf vrf and pp management practices which has not been documented before the electrical conductivity ec of s1 was significantly lower than s3 and ec of s2 was not significantly different from the other two soil types the range in fc and pwp was 26 to 43 and 11 5 to 30 respectively sharma and irmak 2020a the research was designed and implemented as completely randomized design with three levels of irrigation fri vri and ni and three levels of nitrogen n fertilizer management of frf vrf and pp nitrogen on three soil types with a total of 9 treatments fig 1 the treatment combination of no irrigation ni and pre plant n application pp was not studied in this research instead no irrigation and no nitrogen combination treatment was evaluated each treatment was replicated 3 times in each soil type resulting in a total of 81 plots fig 1 treatments were randomly assigned to the plots in each growing season the plots were aligned with the linear move system s zones in the direction of the travel of the system south north each plot was 6 m x 6 m in size with a 6 m buffer plot on all four sides of each plot fig 1 the buffer plots were established in order to prevent eliminate sprinkler wetting overlap between the plots table 1 summarizes some of the agronomic operations management practices for three growing seasons the research field was disk tilled before planting each season maize seed was planted in rows at a depth of 0 06 m row spacing was 0 76 m and the seeding rate in all three growing seasons was 84 500 plants ha 2 2 irrigation and fertilizer management the volumetric water content vwc for all irrigation treatments was determined by measuring soil matric smp values smp was measured using watermark granular matrix sensors wgms irrometer co riverside ca installed at four depths 0 30 0 60 0 90 and 1 20 m in two replications in each soil type wgms were installed in the middle of each plot the instrumentation was installed immediately following the crop emergence each year and was removed from the field at the end of each growing season for harvesting wgms were used to monitor soil matric potential smp kpa on an hourly basis which was then converted to vwc using pre determined soil water retention curves for each soil type and for individual soil layers for the research site developed by irmak 2019 since soil textures varied at different depths at the same point in the field different soil water retention curves developed by irmak 2020 were used for each depth at the same location depending on the measured soil texture thus when vri applications were made the soil heterogeneity spatial variability in both horizontal and vertical domains in the soil profile were considered for determining irrigation requirements this is critical for successfully and properly implementing vri strategy but to the best of the knowledge of the authors this required management strategy accounting for horizontal and vertical domain spatial variability for determining spatial irrigation requirements has not been considered by other researchers when both horizontal and vertical domains spatial variability is considered in total there were six soil types in the research field these soil types were silt loam silty clay loam clay loam loam sandy clay loam and sandy loam the vwc estimated from the soil water retention curves irmak 2019 were then multiplied by the representative depth intervals to determine the total soil water stored in each soil layer with a 0 30 m increments and then summed up to obtain total soil water for the 0 1 20 m soil profile for each plot soil water holding capacity swhc was calculated by subtracting soil water at pwp from soil water at fc for each plot approximately a 40 depletion in available swhc was allowed and irrigation was triggered whenever the total soil water stored in 1 20 m profile as measured from wgms fell just below this 40 threshold this threshold is called management allowable depletion mad the timing of irrigation for both vri and fri was decided in this manner however for fri plots the irrigation amount for each irrigation event was fixed to be 25 4 mm each time any of the fri plots needed irrigation all plots for this treatment were irrigated with 25 4 mm depth of water considering no variability in the field and assuming that crop responds in the same manner at all locations in the field this is the common practice that producers follow in nebraska and other midwestern regions where center pivot irrigation is practiced a total of 1 7 5 irrigations of 25 4 mm each and 2 irrigations of 31 7 mm each and 10 irrigations were applied to fri plots in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively for vri plots irrigation amounts were applied to replenish the soil moisture to approximately 90 of the fc the detailed timing and amount of irrigation in each treatment is presented in table 2 which is adapted from sharma and irmak 2020a measured soil moisture readings from wgmss were used to trigger irrigation for variable irrigation plots thus the number and amount of irrigation events for each vri plot are different from fri the irrigation amounts were estimated by taking the average of two replications of each vri treatment for this research irrigation amounts and timing in each experimental plot was needed prior to irrigation to calculate the irrigation amounts for fri and vri irrigation to accomplish this the wgms data were downloaded from each plot every other day and put into a plot specific irrigation scheduling worksheet that was developed in the irmak research laboratory computed irrigation values were then used to develop spatial irrigation control maps for irrigation to each experimental unit the final map was then uploaded to the linear move control panel and vri was practiced three n fertilizer treatments were investigated in this research fixed uniform rate fertilizer frf variable rate fertilizer vrf and pre plant fertilizer pp management for the pp treatment a 246 kg ha of urea ammonium nitrate uan 32 0 0 in 2015 2016 and 2017 was applied before planting in season fertilizer was applied in vrf and frf treatments using the linear move sprinkler system the n fertilizer rate for vrf plots was calculated

shapiro et al 2008 for vrf treatment on average 217 234 and 221 kg ha 1 n fertilizer was applied to fri vri and ni treatments respectively in 2015 in 2016 these values were 205 206 and 202 kg ha 1 respectively and in 2017 they were 172 161 and 168 kg ha 1 respectively a constant rate of 246 kg ha 1 of n fertilizer was applied to all frf plots since multiple applications of n are generally more efficient than single large doses due to n loss potential the n fertilizer application was divided into two applications half of the required n was applied at the vegetative growth stage of v2 and another application at v8 stage shapiro et al 2008 for both vrf and frf plots table 1 2 3 crop evapotranspiration maize evapotranspiration etc was calculated using a general soil water balance equation 2 e t c p i u r u n o f f δ s w s d p where etc is crop evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm i is irrigation mm u is upward water flux mm run off is surface runoff from individual treatments mm δsws is the change in soil water storage mm in the soil profile between the beginning and the end of the calculation period and dp is the deep percolation from the crop root zone mm since the water table is approximately 30 m below the surface upward water flux was assumed to be negligible from hourly soil water storage data an hour of the day was selected which was considered to be showing the soil water present in the profile at that particular day then the growing season was divided into the soil water depletion periods weekly or bi weekly to few days such that all the days with precipitation events remain inside these periods there was no precipitation at the start of the period and this period ends 1 2 days after the precipitation this was done because on the day of precipitation soil water in the profile is dynamic resulting in fluctuations in the sensor readings change in soil water storage δsws was calculated by subtracting sws at the beginning of the period from sws value at the end of the period week to a few days depending upon the precipitation deep percolation was estimated using the daily soil water balance computer program payero et al 2009 bryant et al 1992 djaman and irmak 2013 irmak 2015a and 2015b the surface runoff was estimated using the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs formerly known as the soil conservation service scs curve number procedure usda nrcs 1985 the runoff was determined for each day over the growing seasons and then summed up for individual treatment each year the scs curve number method relates runoff curve number cn to runoff accounting for initial abstraction losses and the soil infiltration rate the following equation was used to estimate runoff from each treatment 3 r o p i a 2 p i a s f o r p 0 2 s where ia is initial abstraction mm and s is the potential maximum retention after run off begins mm and was calculated as 4 s 25400 c n 254 initial abstraction ia represents the water loss before run off begins and includes water retained in surface depressions water intercepted by vegetation evaporation and infiltration the ia value is usually well correlated with soil and surface residue cover parameters from many small agricultural watershed studies usda nrcs 1985 ia is approximated by the following empirical equation 5 i a 0 2 s the curve number used in this method is dependent on the surface cover type hydrological soil group treatment and hydrologic condition according to the silt loam s1 and s3 and silty clay loam s2 soil at the site and known row cropping in all soil types curve numbers were determined as 78 and 89 respectively for average antecedent run off condition from the usda nrcs 1985 tables 2 4 grass and alfalfa reference evapotranspiration one of the commonly used approaches to quantify etc is to use experimentally developed crop specific coefficients kc and reference evapotranspiration etref typically alfalfa or grass reference et etr and eto respectively to estimate etc this method is called the two step approach that relates kc to etref i e etc kc x etref assuming simplifications of several surface energy balance principles etr and eto values were calculated using the standardized penman monteith equation asce environmental and water resources institute ewri 2005 which is a derivation of penman monteith 1965 equation with a fixed canopy resistance irmak et al 2012 on a daily time step equation 6 the etref is the reference potential evapotranspiration from either the short grass eto or alfalfa etr without water stress and represent the weather and climate potential for evapotranspiration in a given region the high plains regional climate center hprcc automated weather station measured climate variables were used as input data to calculate etr and eto the standardized etref equation is 6 e t r e f 0 408 δ r n g γ c n t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 c d u 2 where reference etref is grass reference et eto or alfalfa reference et etr mm d 1 δ is slope of saturation vapor pressure vs air temperature curve kpa oc 1 rn is net radiation at the surface mj m 2 d 1 g is soil heat flux density mj m 2 d 1 and assumed to be

cd and cn values on a daily time step for grass and alfalfa reference surfaces were 900 and 0 34 and 1600 and 0 38 respectively asce environmental and water resources institute ewri 2005 irmak et al 2003 daily values of δ rn ea and es were calculated for albedo 0 23 using equations given in asce environmental and water resources institute ewri 2005 and food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao 1998 the stefan boltzman constant σ to calculate rnl was taken as 4 901 10 9 mj k 4 m 2 d 1 irmak et al 2003 2 5 grass and alfalfa reference crop coefficients growing degree days calculation and statistical analysis the etc values calculated from the soil water balance approach over the three growing seasons were used to calculate grass reference and alfalfa reference single normal kco and kcr crop coefficients the kco and kcr accounts for difference in the crop canopy and aerodynamic resistance relative to reference crop grass and alfalfa respectively the kc serves as an aggregation of the physical and physiological difference between crops for all treatments cumulative etc for each soil water depletion period was calculated the corresponding etref for each soil water depletion period was also calculated for each treatment the crop coefficients kco and kcr were calculated as the ratio of soil water balance determined et and etref from the penman monteith equation as described in fao 56 food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao 1998 7 k c e t c e t r e f where etc and etref are in mm and kc is the single normal crop coefficient unitless the kco and kcr data were plotted against cumulative growing degree days cgdd and third order polynomial equations were fitted to the data detailed information on gdd calculation is presented in irmak 2015a b etc data were statistically analyzed using proc glimmix procedure in sas sas institute inc cary nc to compare the effects of irrigation treatment nitrogen n treatment and soil type on maize grain yield and etc the means were separated using the least significant difference lsd test at 95 level of significance to identify any potential significant differences in etc between treatments when no significant interactions occurred between the treatments the main effects were evaluated the strength of the developed kc and cgdd relationships were measured using the coefficient of determination r2 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions and reference evapotranspiration etr and eto monthly average weather variables for 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons as well as long term average values 1983 2017 are presented in table 3 a total of 42 47 and 49 precipitation events occurred in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons planting to harvesting respectively the total growing season precipitation in 2015 2016 and 2017 were 353 375 and 467 mm respectively the total growing season precipitation in 2015 was lower than in 2016 and 2017 the 2015 growing season experienced very heavy rainfall in june 226 mm which was 131 mm higher than the long term average on average the 2015 growing season was warmer than 2016 and 2017 with mean air temperature in 2015 to be 20 3 c whereas 19 8 c and 19 1 c in 2016 and 2017 respectively the highest monthly average temperature in all years occurred in july table 3 on average greater wind velocity existed in 2016 as compared with 2015 and 2017 also greater wind speeds were observed in the early growing season in all three years from may to june which is common for the research area the 2017 growing season experienced below normal wind velocities late in the growing season in august and september because of the minimal precipitation amounts in june in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons as compared with 2015 large differences in relative humidity rh were observed between the seasons the monthly average rh in june was 75 60 and 61 for 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively as compared with the long term average of 68 5 the incoming solar radiation was on average greater in 2017 than in 2015 and 2016 distribution of penman monteith pm equation estimated daily eto and etr and gdd values from mid april to mid october in three growing seasons are presented in fig 2 a b and c respectively the etr values ranged from 1 1 to 10 6 mm in 2015 from 0 8 to 11 5 mm in 2016 and 0 5 to 10 5 mm in 2017 the eto values ranged from 1 0 to 7 5 mm in 2015 from 0 70 to 8 4 mm in 2016 and from 0 5 to 7 8 mm in 2017 maximum etr and eto values were observed on june 28 in 2015 32 dap on june 21 in 2016 46 dap and again on june 21 in 2017 44 dap the corresponding average weather conditions on these days included wind speed of 3 78 4 62 and 4 64 m s 1 rs of 304 323 and 306 w m 2 average air temperature tavg of 23 0 27 3 and 27 1 c vpd of 1 42 1 99 and 1 78 kpa and rhmean of 53 5 52 0 and 55 4 in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively greater variability and higher values of eto and etr were observed in the initial growing season generally from mid may to mid july which is typically the vegetative growth period for maize in all three growing seasons 65 75 dap less variations were observed in both eto and etr in the maize reproductive stages which is generally between mid july to mid october in all three growing seasons maximum daily gdd values occurred in the middle of the season from late june to mid july and followed a quadratic distribution over the growing seasons there were substantial differences in the gdds from planting to harvest between 2015 and 2016 and 2017 due to differences in climatic conditions between the years maize reached its physiological maturity at different gdds the seasonal cumulative gdd from planting to harvest was 1 640 c dap 145 in 2015 1 781 c dap 160 in 2016 and 1 783 c dap 170 in 2017 3 2 crop evapotranspiration etc seasonal maize etc under different irrigation and nitrogen levels determined using the soil water balance approach is presented in table 4 in 2015 etc ranged from 324 mm in s3 ni frf treatment to 389 mm in s1 fri pp treatment the etc values for all soil types and treatments were higher in 2016 and 2017 than in 2015 due to higher seasonal rainfall and higher vpd due to very heavy rainfall at the beginning of the growing season and more uniform temporal distribution of rainfall until dap 100 in 2015 there were fewer irrigation events three in 2015 than in 2016 nine and 2017 ten etc ranged from 343 mm in s2 ni vrf to 649 mm in s1 fri pp treatment in 2016 whereas in 2017 it ranged from 362 mm in s2 vri vrf treatment to 634 mm in s3 fri vrf treatment in 2015 no significant difference p 0 05 in etc was observed between soil types irrigation or nitrogen treatments this was expected since irrigation amounts for this season were very low and were similar in all treatments in 2016 no significant interaction between soil type irrigation or nitrogen treatment was observed however irrigation had a significant effect on etc in 2016 plots under fri had maximum etc which was significantly higher than etc in vri and ni on a three year average etc was 528 460 and 378 mm in fri vri and ni treatments respectively in the 2017 growing season the soil and nitrogen management interactions were significant p 0 05 and irrigation level had a significant effect on etc in this season etc in vrf treatment was significantly lower than frf and pp treatment in s1 and s2 this means that applying in season nitrogen variably and uniformly might have different impacts on crop growth and development as well as associated etc values which in turn can impact kc values in different soil types similar to 2016 etc in fri treatment 577 mm was significantly p 0 05 higher than vri treatment 560 mm in the 2017 growing season similar weekly or biweekly soil moisture depletion period trends data not shown of etc were observed for all irrigation and nitrogen treatments within a year however magnitudes varied among the treatments maximum measured soil moisture depletion period etc was from mid august to late august in 2015 from late july to mid august in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons in general fri treatment with frf and pp nitrogen levels had maximum etc in the mid growing season especially during july and august as compared with other treatments due to higher nitrogen and water availability due to higher irrigation and nitrogen amounts in these treatments lai and plant height data not shown was greater as compared with other treatments resulting in greater etc the etc results from 2015 2016 and 2017 growing season indicated that greater differences in etc existed between irrigation treatments within a nitrogen level as compared to nitrogen treatments within an irrigation level supporting that irrigation has a greater impact on etc than nitrogen and that these impacts may also translate into differences in kc values of maize under different management practices 3 3 weekly bi weekly alfalfa and grass reference crop coefficients kcr and kco alfalfa

were fitted to all treatments for three years as well as for the pooled data and the equations and r2 values are presented in table 5 8 while kco values were also quantified for all treatments in all soil types and for all years only kcr values are discussed in detail previous studies on kc have fitted the kc curves ranging from third to fifth order polynomials djaman and irmak 2013 piccinni et al 2009 kang et al 2003 in 2015 kcr ranged from 0 10 to 1 10 0 10 to 1 10 and 0 02 to 1 0 for fri vri and ni respectively in s1 in s2 kcr ranged from 0 10 to 1 20 0 03 to 1 10 and 0 10 to 0 80 for fri vri and ni respectively and in s3 it ranged from 0 06 to 1 0 0 10 to 0 95 and 0 01 to 1 10 in fri vri and ni respectively averaged over the soil types kcr ranged from 0 10 to 1 0 0 07 to 0 93 and 0 05 to 0 82 for fri vri and ni respectively maximum kcr was observed under fri treatment in s1 and s2 whereas in s3 maximum kcr was observed in ni on average of three soil types maximum kcr was observed in fri treatment when the average of all three soil types for each treatment is considered the kcr values under fri with frf vrf and pp treatment were 0 85 0 96 and 1 0 respectively under vri with frf vrf and pp treatment maximum kcr values were 0 94 0 90 and 0 87 respectively and under ni with frf and vrf treatment maximum kcr was 0 82 and 0 79 respectively in general maximum kcr was observed in pp nitrogen treatment followed by frf and vrf the maximum values of kcr in 2015 occurred between gdd values of 900 and 1 200 c mid august which corresponded to the r2 to r3 growth stages in this season and the minimum values occurred in the early and late season when transpiration rates were lowest in general greater kcr values existed in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons as compared with 2015 in 2016 kcr ranged from 0 09 to 1 50 0 to 1 40 and 0 to 0 90 for fri vri and ni respectively in s1 in s2 kcr ranged from 0 004 to 1 50 0 06 to 1 52 and 0 to 0 90 for fri vri and ni respectively and in s3 it ranged from 0 002 to 1 50 0 02 to 1 20 and 0 004 to 0 80 in fri vri and ni respectively on average of three soil types kcr ranged from 0 07 to 1 40 0 04 to 1 30 and 0 08 to 0 80 in fri vri and ni respectively similar to 2015 maximum kcr value occurred in fri treatment followed by the vri and ni treatments however the nitrogen treatment effect on kcr was not consistent such that the maximum kcr within fri treatment was observed under the vrf treatment 1 36 maximum kcr within vri was observed under pp treatment 1 30 and maximum kcr within ni was observed under the frf treatment 0 78 the maximum kcr values in 2016 for fri and vri treatment occurred in early august which corresponded to r2 to r4 growth stage gdd 1119 to 1400 c in that season in 2017 the kcr values were in a similar range as in 2016 for fri and vri treatment and was slightly lower for ni treatments on average of three soil types maximum kcr for frf vrf and pp nitrogen treatment were 1 43 1 23 and 1 24 under fri management 0 95 1 30 and 1 30 under vri management and 1 05 and 0 90 under ni respectively maximum kcr for all treatments occurred at gdd 800 to 1400 c late july to late august and early september which corresponded to r1 to r4 growth stage similar maximum kcr peaks were observed by other researchers in the past for example piccinni et al 2009 reported that maximum kco values of 1 20 under non limiting water and n conditions at milk and dough growth stages sammis et al 1985 found a maximum kcr value of 1 44 for the month of july gdd 900 1200 c for maize grown in new mexico under fit and n fertilizer rate of 224 kg ha 1 3 4 monthly kcr and kco values while kc values presented as a function of cgdd can be very beneficial for different applications and daily or weekly kc values can be determined by solving the associated equations for within season water management modeling of water resources demand and use crop modeling hydrologic modeling and other applications tabulating kc values can be useful in practical applications by irrigators practitioners and other water management professionals monthly kcr values with standard deviations sd for all treatments and for the three year pooled data for each soil type are presented in table 9 the statistical significance t test α 0 05 of the differences between three year average kcr values for all fri vri and ni under frf vrf and pp fertilizer management in all three soil types are presented in table 10 maximum kcr values were observed for the month of july and august during peak crop development and maximum water use period in all soil types and minimum kcr values were observed in june during the early stage of crop growth and development with minimum water use rates for all soil types overall the maximum kcr value was observed in fri pp treatment in s1 1 02 fri vrf treatment in s2 1 06 and fri vrf treatment in s3 1 02 this indicates that there was no consistent effect of nitrogen treatments on kcr which suggests that the kcr values are more dependent on the amount rather than the timing of the nitrogen application because the amount of nitrogen in both frf and pp treatment under fri averaged over three growing seasons was 246 kg ha 1 which was similar to the amount applied to vrf treatment 201 kg ha 1 on average of nitrogen treatments greater kcr values were observed in fri treatment followed by vri and ni treatments the monthly kcr values agreed with the mid season kcr values of 1 26 and 1 05 respectively for the full irrigation treatment obtained by djaman and irmak 2013 the difference in kcr values between years indicates that climatic conditions that affect atmospheric evaporative demands strongly influence the kc value the results of this research also indicated that kc values are the function of crop growth and development as well as strongly dependent on the irrigation management strategy similar results have been reported in the literature on average of three soils in all three growing seasons greater differences in kcr curves between frf vrf and pp nitrogen treatment were observed under vri treatments as compared with fri greater variability under vri treatments can be attributed to lower irrigation amounts and less frequent irrigations that resulted in more variability in water distribution and perhaps uneven soil water evaporation and plant water uptake non uniform distribution of irrigation in vri treatment may have affected the uptake of water etc as well as soluble n nitrate n which resulted in more variability in kcr curves the variation that could be caused by vri management has not been investigated the only research the authors are aware is the research reported by sharma and irmak 2020b who investigated and compared maize growth and development grain yield irrigation yield production functions iypf evapotranspiration yield production functions etypf and crop water productivity cwp under vri fri and no irrigation ni with frf vrf and pp management in the same environment and management practices they observed that vri did not improve maize growth and development grain yield or cwp as compared with fri management they also reported that vri strategy increased the variation in grain yield etc and cwp as compared with fri management increased variation in etc in vri treatments as compared with fri treatments in the same field and crop and soil management and same climatic conditions would result in increased variation in kc values in vri in comparison with fri management they determined that soil type had a significant impact on the variation in yield etc iypf etypf and cwp under their experimental conditions for example s1 had the lowest grain yield variability as compared with s2 and s3 the coefficient of variation cv of grain yield ranged from 8 in crete silt loam soil under fri management to as high as 35 3 in hastings silt loam soil under vri management fri treatments in all soil types and years had less variation in maize grain yield as compared with vri suggesting that the increased variation in vri kc values is not random and caused by increased variation in etc under vri management which was manifested into variation in kc values djaman and irmak 2013 reported greater variability in maize kco and kcr values under rainfed and limited irrigation levels as compared with fit the difference in kcr curves between nitrogen treatments at each irrigation level as well as between irrigation levels is also evident from the pooled data graphs fig 6 the strong dependence of kcr and kco on cgdd was also observed in pooled data for all treatments and years the lowest kcr and kco values were obtained for ni treatment and the fri treatments had the highest values similar temporal trends existed between kcr and kco therefore a discussion on kco was not included however monthly kco values are presented in table 9 the results indicated that considerable differences in estimated etc exist between different irrigation and nitrogen management strategies and kc values for the same treatments differed between the soil types therefore the kc curves presented in this research for various nitrogen and irrigation management strategies in three different soil types can aid irrigators state agencies and others to make decisions on in season irrigation management and can aid in better understanding of how different irrigation and nitrogen management strategies can influence kcr and kco values in different soil types this would in turn enable etc estimations that can account for these influences by using different sets of kcr or kco values depending on the soil types investigated there were significant differences p 0 05 approximately 50 of the time in monthly average kc values between the treatments table 10 under vri with frf and pp fertilizer management all kcr values were significantly different in soil types whereas under fri with frf and pp management the kcr values were significantly different only in s1 soil 2 had significantly different kcr values under vri with frf and vrf under vri with frf and pp and under ni with frf and vrf out of 21 statistical analyses that were conducted s1 s2 and s3 had 27 10 and 14 of the time significant difference in kcr values between the treatments with most differences occurring in s1 for irrigated treatments in ni treatment frf and vrf only s2 had significantly different kcr values 3 5 impact of irrigation and fertilizer management and soil type on kcr to kco ratios the kcr values sometimes need to be converted to kco or vice versa to enable crop coefficients developed for one reference surface to be used with the other surface for example in the midwestern united states etr and kcr values are much more commonly used than eto and kco in eastern southern western southwestern and southern us eto and kco are most commonly used eto and kco also are most commonly used globally thus practical approaches to convert kc values developed for one surface to another surface are needed to make this conversion instead of re calculating or re measuring kc values which can be extremely difficult given the needed research instrumentation time and other resources required irmak et al 2003 and irmak et al 2008 developed etr to eto ratios kr values for several climatic regions ranging from tropical humid to semi arid to make conversions between kcr and kco for growing and non growing dormant seasons they determined the seasonal behavior of kr values between the locations and in the same location for different seasons monthly average kr values from daily values were developed for bushland texas clay center nebraska davis california gainesville florida phoenix arizona and rockport missouri for the calendar year and for the growing season may september using several different et methods their approach is robust and beneficial for making conversions in areas where detailed climate data are available to solve the penman monteith equation for etr or eto estimations to make the conversions however to the best of authors knowledge the impact of irrigation fri vri and ni and nitrogen frf vrf and pp management practices on kcr to kco ratios in different soil types have not been studied and the potential impact of nitrogen management strategies on kcr to kco ratios has not been investigated here we propose another method to determine kcr to kco ratios k values to be able to make conversions between kcr and kco this conversion k values would also be beneficial to be able to use kcr or kco values developed for a region in another region for irrigation management et estimations and other purposes where kc values are not available monthly june july august and september k values for each growing season individually as well as for a three year average for all treatments for each soil type were developed table 11 the standard deviations between k values for each treatment were calculated to determine variations while the k values were determined for a portion of the growing season june september this period covers most of the period in which irrigation is practiced the k values ranged from 0 78 to 0 98 and they were at their lowest during june increased in july and august and decreased in september unlike significant differences observed between the kc values between the treatments and between the soil types for the same treatment differences in k values between the treatments as well as for the same treatment in different soil types were small for the same month which indicates that the ratios are independent of the nature of irrigation and nitrogen management practices for example in s1 the k values for all irrigation and nitrogen treatments were within 0 79 and 0 80 0 83 and 0 86 0 85 and 0 88 and within 0 80 and 0 83 for june july august and september respectively however k values for the same treatment differed considerably between the months for the same soil type in general sd values were higher for ni and vri treatments than fri treatments and vrf sd values were higher than frf treatments conversions between kcr and kco is a straightforward process for example the three year average kcr value in june for fri frf treatment in s1 is 0 35 table 9 and the kco value needs to be determined the kcr to kco ratio for the same treatment in the same soil is 0 80 table 11 since kcr kco k 0 35 kco 0 80 then kco 0 44 the same value in table 11 for that treatment in s1 similar to the etr to eto ratios kr values developed by irmak et al 2003 and irmak et al 2008 the kcr to kco ratios k values developed in this research can be useful for making conversions from kcr to kco or vice versa to enable using crop coefficients developed for one reference surface with the other to determine crop water use for locations with similar climatic characteristics of this research when locally measured k values are not available 4 summary and conclusions this research quantified etc kcr and kco curves and algorithms as a function of cgdd for maize under different irrigation fri vri and ni under different nitrogen management practices frf vrf and pp in three soil types for maize for three growing seasons on average the 2015 growing season was warmer than 2016 and 2017 and growing season precipitation in 2015 2016 and 2017 was 353 375 and 467 mm respectively our results showed that soil type irrigation management and nitrogen management strategies all had an impact on kc values in 2015 the maximum kcr occurred between cgdd values of 900 and 1200 c mid august which corresponded to the r2 to r3 growth stages in the fri pp treatment inter annual variations were observed in kc values greater kcr values were observed in 2016 and 2017 as compared with 2015 the maximum kcr values in 2016 for the fri and vri treatments occurred in august which was also at the r2 to r4 growth stages cgdd 1119 to 1400 c in that season similar to 2015 the maximum kcr values were observed in the fri treatment in 2016 as well in 2017 kcr values were in a similar range as in 2016 for the fri and vri treatments and on average maximum kcr was observed in the fri treatment maximum kcr for all treatments occurred at cgdd 800 to 1400 c late july to early september which was at the vt to r4 growth stages on a monthly average basis maximum kcr and kco values were observed in july and august in all soil types and minimum kc values were observed in june overall the maximum kcr value was observed in the fri pp treatment in s1 1 02 the fri vrf treatment in s2 1 06 and the fri vrf treatment in s3 1 02 the results of this research indicated that the magnitude of kcr and kco depends on the irrigation management strategies amount and timing of water in general the maximum kcr and kco values were observed in fri the difference between the kcr curves at different nitrogen levels were observed which was more pronounced in the vri and ni treatments than in fri for all years kcr to kco ratios k values were quantified and tabulated for each irrigation and nitrogen management strategy in each soil type this conversion k values would be beneficial in terms of using kcr or kco values developed for a region in another region for irrigation management etc estimations and other purposes where kc values are not available with increasing interest in variable rate technology and due to increasing nitrogen application restrictions and decline in water resources it is critical to understand the impact of various irrigation and nitrogen management strategies on crop water use to plan and manage water and fertilizers efficiently to the best of our knowledge this research is the first to investigate the impact of variable rate irrigation and nitrogen management strategy on crop coefficients for maize under different soil types the crop coefficient curves presented in this research can aid irrigators state agencies and others for accurate crop water use estimates under different irrigation and nitrogen management strategies and soil types to make field level and larger scale irrigation management decisions and water resources assessments planning management and allocation decisions for the climate soil and cropping systems conditions similar to those presented in this research further research to investigate the applicability transferability of the crop coefficients developed in this research in other regions with similar characteristics is needed declaration of competing interest the authors declare no

under different soil types have not been investigated or quantified in this research alfalfa and grass reference crop coefficients kcr and kco curves were developed for fixed rate or uniform rate fertigation frf variable rate fertigation vrf and pre plant nitrogen pp management under fixed rate or uniform rate irrigation fri and variable rate irrigation vri for three soil types crete silt loam s1 hastings silty clay loam 2 and hastings silt loam s3 in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons irrigation and nitrogen management strategies as well as soil type all influenced the kcr and kco values which exhibited inter annual variation on average greater variation in kc curves between frf vrf and pp nitrogen treatment were observed under vri treatments as compared with fri results showed that kc values are more dependent on the amount rather than the timing of the nitrogen application in all three seasons higher kc values were observed in the fri treatment than vri with kcr ranging from 0 07 to 1 30 in fri and 0 07 to 1 20 in vri kc curves also differed between nitrogen treatments and the difference was more prominent in the vri treatments than in the fri in all years in general maximum kc was observed in pp nitrogen treatment followed by frf and vrf on a monthly average basis maximum kc values were observed in july and august in all soil types and minimum kc values were observed in june when soil types are considered overall the maximum kcr value was observed in fri pp treatment in s1 1 02 fri vrf treatment in s2 1 06 and fri vrf treatment in s3 1 02 the kcr and kco equations as a function of growing degree days were developed and monthly average kcr and kco values were tabulated for practical applications to the best of the authors knowledge this research is the first that investigated and quantified the impact of vri and vrf strategies under frf vrf and pp fertilizer management strategies on maize kc values the kcr and kco values quantified in this research can aid irrigators state agencies and other water management and agricultural professionals for more accurate crop water use determinations under different irrigation and nitrogen management strategies and different soil types keywords crop coefficients evapotranspiration irrigation nitrogen soil characteristics variable rate 1 introduction with increasing competition for freshwater resources between agricultural domestic and industrial sectors improved strategies for efficient use of available water resources in agriculture is required for feeding the increasing population especially with the change in climatic conditions approximately 90 of global freshwater resources during the past century were withdrawn for irrigation shiklomanov 2000 jury and henry 2005 in the united states agriculture accounts for approximately 80 of consumptive water use with california nebraska texas arkansas and idaho amongst the highest irrigation water withdrawal states usda ers 2018 approximately 60 of the area under irrigation in the united states use groundwater as a source resulting in groundwater depletion rates greater than the recharge in many areas including ogallala aquifer which is one of the world s largest aquifers that underlies an area of approximately 450 660 km2 in portions of eight states south dakota nebraska wyoming colorado kansas oklahoma new mexico and texas comprising of approximately 80 of the usa high plains region with extensive water withdrawal for irrigation between 1960 and 2000 groundwater depletion in irrigated regions of the united states including the heavily irrigated areas such as the high plains and the california central valley aquifers has been doubled wada et al 2010 efficient irrigation management strategies that use less water without impacting the crop yields need to be developed or existing methods should be further evaluated improved and implemented especially in water limiting regions to increase crop water productivity cwp and protect the sustainability of water resources cwp in irrigated agriculture can be increased by reducing the unbeneficial use of freshwater through development of efficient management strategies and advancing irrigation technologies at the farm or field level irmak 2015a 2015b in certain conditions precision agricultural technologies such as variable rate irrigation vri systems and microirrigation systems have the potential to enable the growers farmers to apply water and agrochemicals site specifically and variably within a field to match soil and plant needs evans and sadler 2008 in some or most cases variable rate technology is assumed to improve crop yield cwp and reduce nitrogen leaching for instance hedley and yule 2009 compared vri and fixed uniform rate irrigation fri scenarios for three years of climate data on 156 ha pasture and 53 ha maize field sites in new zealand and reported 23 to 26 of irrigation water savings with vri when compared with fri hedley et al 2009 on 40 ha pasture 24 ha potato and 22 ha maize sites in new zealand evaluated irrigation water use drainage water use and nitrogen leaching between vri and fri they reported an annual water use reduction of 9 to 19 under vri when compared with fri these studies have used computer simulations to compare conventional and advanced vri technology however the water and or energy saving and other assumed benefits of vri such as increasing yield or cwp have not been independently and sufficiently or even conclusively verified through field based research sadler et al 2002 emphasized the importance and need of site specific crop production functions for strategic decision making for site specific management in a three year field study sadler et al 2002 measured the mean response of maize to irrigation and compared variation in crop response within and among soil map units the water treatments had consistently significant main effects in the analysis of variance anova in both linear and quadratic forms at the 1 level and the variation within soil map units was significant at the 5 level in the latter two years and at the 1 level in the first year they observed variation in yield among soil map units at any point on the response curves being approximated 25 of the maximum yield in all three years variations in the mean irrigation amount to produce a maximum yield in the eight most common map units were 61 61 and 120 of the base rate amount they suggested that this information and data would have significant implications for the design management and economic profitability of irrigation in spatially varying soils they concluded that spatial variation in crop response to irrigation by year soil type and among soil types makes it essential to derive the site specific crop response data to accurately simulate crop growth models for vri for any economic analysis evans and sadler 2008 stated that appropriately localized and real time estimates of crop water demand are either unaffordable or not available their assessments that were made in 2008 are still valid today in terms of the absence of practical methodologies for determining and deploying site specific crop coefficients for variable water applications whether crop production is practiced under deficit limited or full irrigation settings the crop evapotranspiration etc and associated crop coefficients kc values can be impacted by these management practices especially when irrigation strategies are coupled with different nitrogen management strategies for example sharma and irmak 2020a and 2020b xu et al 2020 and li et al 2019 investigated the differences in grain yield etc and cwp between fri and vri management under fixed rate fertigation frf variable rate fertigation vrf and pre plant pp nitrogen sharma and irmak 2020a and 2020b reported that soil properties and field topography played an important role in deciding the irrigation and nitrogen management strategies at field level and that the crop response in terms of yield etc and cwp to fri and vri under frf vrf and pp strategies within a field differed significantly the spatial dependence of grain yield and etc on irrigation and nitrogen management are reported in other studies as well tardieu and katerji 1991 reported a reduction in maize grain yield due to the increase in soil mechanical resistance because of reduced water uptake by the root system under water deficit conditions djaman and irmak 2013 represented the differences in etc values between different irrigation regimes in south central nebraska they reported a reduction in seasonal etc relative to full irrigation treatment fit to be 22 9 7 and 2 for the rainfed 50 fit 60 fit and 75 fit respectively in 2009 and reductions of 9 4 2 and 1 in 2010 for the same treatments respectively liu et al 2010 reported significant impacts of different water management practices on maize etc crop coefficients grain yield and cwp in the same field in loess plateau china payero et al 2008 reported a difference of 75 mm of etc between lowest irrigation and maximum irrigation treatments in 2005 and a difference of 187 mm in 2006 payero et al 2009 reported a variation in etc of 7 2 and 18 8 among treatments and indicated that irrigation timing could have a considerable effect on etc and kc borsato et al 2019 compared the impacts of drip irrigation and two sprinkler center pivot and hose reel systems on environmental economic and energetic performance under irrigated and non irrigated maize cropping they combined impact and efficiency indicators addressing a sustainability analysis for the irrigation practice under the three different irrigation systems the sustainability for the irrigation systems was assessed using water related indicators water use efficiency irrigation water use efficiency and water footprint biomass crop growth rate relative growth rate harvest index and yield response factor and energy indicators energy footprint performance and energy cost footprint for the environmental aspect and the economic based indicators water productivity and economic water footprint for the economic aspect the results showed that center pivot system was the best solution for irrigation practice since it demonstrated higher economic and environmental performance they also observed that maize under the pivot system had higher biomass production economic benefits and wue to achieve the most effective and efficient within season irrigation scheduling for different water and nitrogen application strategies such as vri and fertigation accurate quantification of etc under each management strategy is essential while extensive irrigation management research and automated weather monitoring networks have advanced over time that resulted in improving fri applications such advances in developing crop coefficients and associated spatial etc for variable rate water and fertilizer applications for site specific water use determinations are significantly lacking while kc and etc values are critical variables that are needed to manage vri and fri irrigation management strategies there is a significant lack of data and information on the kc and etc values for vri managed cropping systems under different soil types and nitrogen management sadler et al 2000 compared variation in water use and stress of maize within and among soil map units in one field at two sites in each of four map units they measured site specific effects of soil variation on crop water use from 40 days after planting until after maturity in the southeastern usa coastal plain they observed that maize appears to be particularly susceptible to soil variation especially during periods of drought on the 4th day during vegetative growth drought stress was evaluated on eight transects using infrared thermometer measurements of canopy temperature they reported that maize at the eight sites arrived at final water use via fundamentally different paths further variation between sites within soils was significant indicating that soil map units are not homogenous with respect to water relations these findings indicate the need for developing site specific crop coefficients to determine spatial water use for vri management stone and sadler 2015 utilized a bayesian semiparametric model to spatially estimate irrigated yield rainfed yield maximum yield and irrigation at maximum yield and provide credible intervals measures of uncertainty around these estimates for comparing with the previous analysis they also examined whether the conclusions from this rigorous re analysis were different from the prior analysis and if the results would force any modifications to the conclusions obtained with the prior analyses the model simultaneously accounted for spatial correlation and relationships within the treatments and had the ability to contribute information to nearby neighbors the model based yield estimates were in excellent agreement with the observed spatial maize yields and were able to estimate the high and low yields more accurately than did the previous analysis their conclusions supported the original analysis in identifying significant spatial differences in crop responses across and within soil map units in spatially variable water management applications these spatial differences were great enough to be considered in irrigation system design and management emphasizing the need to experimentally determine variables such as crop coefficients to determine spatial etc some studies have reported the impact of coupled irrigation management and nitrogen management on seasonal and daily etc that resulted in differences in kc during the growing season for the same crop at the same location djaman and irmak 2013 developed grass reference kco and alfalfa reference kcr crop coefficient values under rainfed limited and fully irrigated settings as a function of the thermal unit and days after emergence they reported the midseason average kco values to be 1 26 1 20 1 11 1 08 and 1 10 for the fit 75 fit 60 fit 50 fit and rainfed treatments respectively and midseason average kcr values to be 1 05 1 00 0 97 0 95 and 0 92 for the same treatments respectively with the prevalent interest in the variable rate management for improving crop productivity it is essential to develop site specific local crop coefficients for variable rate management both irrigation and nitrogen however at this point minimal if any studies have investigated the effects of vri combined vrf on kc of the same crop in comparison to fri and frf as well as pre plant fertilizer management pp furthermore it is not well understood as to how kc values under different water fri and vri and nitrogen vrf frf and pp management practices can be potentially impacted by soil types the main objective of this research was to develop et crop coefficients for maize under fixed uniform rate fri and variable rate irrigation vri and fixed uniform rate fertigation frf variable rate fertigation vrf and pre plant nitrogen pp management in three typical soil types to the best of our knowledge this research is the first to quantify the aforementioned variables under three different soil types in the same environment and soil and crop management practices furthermore the research aimed to develop kcr to kco ratios k values to enable crop coefficients developed for one reference surface to be used with the other surface 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site this project is part of a larger and ongoing long term field research project in the irmak research laboratory that is also investigating crop evapotranspiration grain yield irrigation yield production functions evapotranspiration yield production functions and crop water productivity sharma and irmak 2020b and the effect of vri fri and no irrigation ni under vrf frf and pp n management on soil water dynamics in different soils sharma and irmak 2020a thus the materials and methods including experimental details and cultural practices soil moisture measurements irrigation and nitrogen management practices etc reported in this work and those reported by sharma and irmak 2020a and 2020b as reported by sharma and irmak 2020a and 2020b extensive and comprehensive field research campaigns were conducted at the unl south central agricultural laboratory scal research facility near clay center nebraska in 2015 2016 and 2017 maize growing seasons scal is located at latitude 40 34 n and longitude 98 8 w with an elevation of 552 m above mean sea level the long term average annual precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures at the research site is 680 mm 25 c and 5 c respectively the research was conducted on a 2 3 ha field with a west to east elevation gradient ranging from 550 8 m to 552 1 m above mean sea level the research site is in the transition zone between subhumid and semiarid zones with strong winds and a high vapor pressure deficit during summer fixed and variable rate water and nitrogen applications were achieved using a two span 75 m long 7000sl variable rate linear move sprinkler irrigation system three soil types existed in the research field 1 crete silt loam 0 to 1 slopes s1 2 hastings silty clay loam 3 to 7 slopes s2 and 3 hastings silt loam 1 to 3 slopes s3 fig 1 soil samples were collected from 42 locations before planting in each growing season to facilitate the quantification of spatial variation in soil properties the research field was sampled to determine the existing conditions of the soil to determine soil fertilizer recommendations as well as determining irrigation management variables soil cores collected from 42 locations in the field showed average sand silt and clay content ranging from 15 to 57 20 to 74 and 7 to 39 respectively measured volumetric water content at field capacity for soil 3 s3 was significantly lower than soil 1 s1 and soil 2 s2 soil water holding capacity swhc of s1 was also significantly higher than soil 3 other soil physical characteristics were also significantly different p 0 05 between the soils which provided a unique opportunity to investigate soil type impact on kc values under fri vri with frf vrf and pp management practices which has not been documented before the electrical conductivity ec of s1 was significantly lower than s3 and ec of s2 was not significantly different from the other two soil types the range in fc and pwp was 26 to 43 and 11 5 to 30 respectively sharma and irmak 2020a the research was designed and implemented as completely randomized design with three levels of irrigation fri vri and ni and three levels of nitrogen n fertilizer management of frf vrf and pp nitrogen on three soil types with a total of 9 treatments fig 1 the treatment combination of no irrigation ni and pre plant n application pp was not studied in this research instead no irrigation and no nitrogen combination treatment was evaluated each treatment was replicated 3 times in each soil type resulting in a total of 81 plots fig 1 treatments were randomly assigned to the plots in each growing season the plots were aligned with the linear move system s zones in the direction of the travel of the system south north each plot was 6 m x 6 m in size with a 6 m buffer plot on all four sides of each plot fig 1 the buffer plots were established in order to prevent eliminate sprinkler wetting overlap between the plots table 1 summarizes some of the agronomic operations management practices for three growing seasons the research field was disk tilled before planting each season maize seed was planted in rows at a depth of 0 06 m row spacing was 0 76 m and the seeding rate in all three growing seasons was 84 500 plants ha 2 2 irrigation and fertilizer management the volumetric water content vwc for all irrigation treatments was determined by measuring soil matric smp values smp was measured using watermark granular matrix sensors wgms irrometer co riverside ca installed at four depths 0 30 0 60 0 90 and 1 20 m in two replications in each soil type wgms were installed in the middle of each plot the instrumentation was installed immediately following the crop emergence each year and was removed from the field at the end of each growing season for harvesting wgms were used to monitor soil matric potential smp kpa on an hourly basis which was then converted to vwc using pre determined soil water retention curves for each soil type and for individual soil layers for the research site developed by irmak 2019 since soil textures varied at different depths at the same point in the field different soil water retention curves developed by irmak 2020 were used for each depth at the same location depending on the measured soil texture thus when vri applications were made the soil heterogeneity spatial variability in both horizontal and vertical domains in the soil profile were considered for determining irrigation requirements this is critical for successfully and properly implementing vri strategy but to the best of the knowledge of the authors this required management strategy accounting for horizontal and vertical domain spatial variability for determining spatial irrigation requirements has not been considered by other researchers when both horizontal and vertical domains spatial variability is considered in total there were six soil types in the research field these soil types were silt loam silty clay loam clay loam loam sandy clay loam and sandy loam the vwc estimated from the soil water retention curves irmak 2019 were then multiplied by the representative depth intervals to determine the total soil water stored in each soil layer with a 0 30 m increments and then summed up to obtain total soil water for the 0 1 20 m soil profile for each plot soil water holding capacity swhc was calculated by subtracting soil water at pwp from soil water at fc for each plot approximately a 40 depletion in available swhc was allowed and irrigation was triggered whenever the total soil water stored in 1 20 m profile as measured from wgms fell just below this 40 threshold this threshold is called management allowable depletion mad the timing of irrigation for both vri and fri was decided in this manner however for fri plots the irrigation amount for each irrigation event was fixed to be 25 4 mm each time any of the fri plots needed irrigation all plots for this treatment were irrigated with 25 4 mm depth of water considering no variability in the field and assuming that crop responds in the same manner at all locations in the field this is the common practice that producers follow in nebraska and other midwestern regions where center pivot irrigation is practiced a total of 1 7 5 irrigations of 25 4 mm each and 2 irrigations of 31 7 mm each and 10 irrigations were applied to fri plots in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively for vri plots irrigation amounts were applied to replenish the soil moisture to approximately 90 of the fc the detailed timing and amount of irrigation in each treatment is presented in table 2 which is adapted from sharma and irmak 2020a measured soil moisture readings from wgmss were used to trigger irrigation for variable irrigation plots thus the number and amount of irrigation events for each vri plot are different from fri the irrigation amounts were estimated by taking the average of two replications of each vri treatment for this research irrigation amounts and timing in each experimental plot was needed prior to irrigation to calculate the irrigation amounts for fri and vri irrigation to accomplish this the wgms data were downloaded from each plot every other day and put into a plot specific irrigation scheduling worksheet that was developed in the irmak research laboratory computed irrigation values were then used to develop spatial irrigation control maps for irrigation to each experimental unit the final map was then uploaded to the linear move control panel and vri was practiced three n fertilizer treatments were investigated in this research fixed uniform rate fertilizer frf variable rate fertilizer vrf and pre plant fertilizer pp management for the pp treatment a 246 kg ha of urea ammonium nitrate uan 32 0 0 in 2015 2016 and 2017 was applied before planting in season fertilizer was applied in vrf and frf treatments using the linear move sprinkler system the n fertilizer rate for vrf plots was calculated using n recommendation equation proposed by university of nebraska lincoln fertilizer guidelines shapiro et al 2008 1 n n e e d l b a c 35 1 2 e y 8 n o 3 n p p m 0 14 e y o m c o t h e r n c r e d i

nitrogen credits were assumed to be negligible priceadj is the adjustment for market price of maize grain and cost of nitrogen and timingadj is the adjustment factor for fall spring and split nitrogen applications the expected yield was 105 percent of the five year average yield of the field five year yield for the research field was obtained from the irmak research laboratory field research database depository nitrate n and omc for each plot were obtained from extensive soil sampling conducted in each spring before planting and n requirement for each vrf plot was determined separately price and timing adjustments were calculated using the equation from shapiro et al 2008 based on the current maize market price procedures and associated values for priceadj timingadj are presented in shapiro et al 2008 for vrf treatment on average 217 234 and 221 kg ha 1 n fertilizer was applied to fri vri and ni treatments respectively in 2015 in 2016 these values were 205 206 and 202 kg ha 1 respectively and in 2017 they were 172 161 and 168 kg ha 1 respectively a constant rate of 246 kg ha 1 of n fertilizer was applied to all frf plots since multiple applications of n are generally more efficient than single large doses due to n loss potential the n fertilizer application was divided into two applications half of the required n was applied at the vegetative growth stage of v2 and another application at v8 stage shapiro et al 2008 for both vrf and frf plots table 1 2 3 crop evapotranspiration maize evapotranspiration etc was calculated using a general soil water balance equation 2 e t c p i u r u n o f f δ s w s d p where etc is crop evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm i is irrigation mm u is upward water flux mm run off is surface runoff from individual treatments mm δsws is the change in soil water storage mm in the soil profile between the beginning and the end of the calculation period and dp is the deep percolation from the crop root zone mm since the water table is approximately 30 m below the surface upward water flux was assumed to be negligible from hourly soil water storage data an hour of the day was selected which was considered to be showing the soil water present in the profile at that particular day then the growing season was divided into the soil water depletion periods weekly or bi weekly to few days such that all the days with precipitation events remain inside these periods there was no precipitation at the start of the period and this period ends 1 2 days after the precipitation this was done because on the day of precipitation soil water in the profile is dynamic resulting in fluctuations in the sensor readings change in soil water storage δsws was calculated by subtracting sws at the beginning of the period from sws value at the end of the period week to a few days depending upon the precipitation deep percolation was estimated using the daily soil water balance computer program payero et al 2009 bryant et al 1992 djaman and irmak 2013 irmak 2015a and 2015b the surface runoff was estimated using the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs formerly known as the soil conservation service scs curve number procedure usda nrcs 1985 the runoff was determined for each day over the growing seasons and then summed up for individual treatment each year the scs curve number method relates runoff curve number cn to runoff accounting for initial abstraction losses and the soil infiltration rate the following equation was used to estimate runoff from each treatment 3 r o p i a 2 p i a s f o r p 0 2 s where ia is initial abstraction mm and s is the potential maximum retention after run off begins mm and was calculated as 4 s 25400 c n 254 initial abstraction ia represents the water loss before run off begins and includes water retained in surface depressions water intercepted by vegetation evaporation and infiltration the ia value is usually well correlated with soil and surface residue cover parameters from many small agricultural watershed studies usda nrcs 1985 ia is approximated by the following empirical equation 5 i a 0 2 s the curve number used in this method is dependent on the surface cover type hydrological soil group treatment and hydrologic condition according to the silt loam s1 and s3 and silty clay loam s2 soil at the site and known row cropping in all soil types curve numbers were determined as 78 and 89 respectively for average antecedent run off condition from the usda nrcs 1985 tables 2 4 grass and alfalfa reference evapotranspiration one of the commonly used approaches to quantify etc is to use experimentally developed crop specific coefficients kc and reference evapotranspiration etref typically alfalfa or grass reference et etr and eto respectively to estimate etc this method is called the two step approach that relates kc to etref i e etc kc x etref assuming simplifications of several surface energy balance principles etr and eto values were calculated using the standardized penman monteith equation asce environmental and water resources institute ewri 2005 which is a derivation of penman monteith 1965 equation with a fixed canopy resistance irmak et al 2012 on a daily time step equation 6 the etref is the reference potential evapotranspiration from either the short grass eto or alfalfa etr without water stress and represent the weather and climate potential for evapotranspiration in a given region the high plains regional climate center hprcc automated weather station measured climate variables were used as input data to calculate etr and eto the standardized etref equation is 6 e t r e f 0 408 δ r n g γ c n t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 c d u 2 where reference etref is grass reference et eto or alfalfa reference et etr mm d 1 δ is slope of saturation vapor pressure vs air temperature curve kpa oc 1 rn is net radiation at the surface mj m 2 d 1 g is soil heat flux density mj m 2 d 1 and assumed to be

cd and cn values on a daily time step for grass and alfalfa reference surfaces were 900 and 0 34 and 1600 and 0 38 respectively asce environmental and water resources institute ewri 2005 irmak et al 2003 daily values of δ rn ea and es were calculated for albedo 0 23 using equations given in asce environmental and water resources institute ewri 2005 and food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao 1998 the stefan boltzman constant σ to calculate rnl was taken as 4 901 10 9 mj k 4 m 2 d 1 irmak et al 2003 2 5 grass and alfalfa reference crop coefficients growing degree days calculation and statistical analysis the etc values calculated from the soil water balance approach over the three growing seasons were used to calculate grass reference and alfalfa reference single normal kco and kcr crop coefficients the kco and kcr accounts for difference in the crop canopy and aerodynamic resistance relative to reference crop grass and alfalfa respectively the kc serves as an aggregation of the physical and physiological difference between crops for all treatments cumulative etc for each soil water depletion period was calculated the corresponding etref for each soil water depletion period was also calculated for each treatment the crop coefficients kco and kcr were calculated as the ratio of soil water balance determined et and etref from the penman monteith equation as described in fao 56 food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao 1998 7 k c e t c e t r e f where etc and etref are in mm and kc is the single normal crop coefficient unitless the kco and kcr data were plotted against cumulative growing degree days cgdd and third order polynomial equations were fitted to the data detailed information on gdd calculation is presented in irmak 2015a b etc data were statistically analyzed using proc glimmix procedure in sas sas institute inc cary nc to compare the effects of irrigation treatment nitrogen n treatment and soil type on maize grain yield and etc the means were separated using the least significant difference lsd test at 95 level of significance to identify any potential significant differences in etc between treatments when no significant interactions occurred between the treatments the main effects were evaluated the strength of the developed kc and cgdd relationships were measured using the coefficient of determination r2 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions and reference evapotranspiration etr and eto monthly average weather variables for 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons as well as long term average values 1983 2017 are presented in table 3 a total of 42 47 and 49 precipitation events occurred in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons planting to harvesting respectively the total growing season precipitation in 2015 2016 and 2017 were 353 375 and 467 mm respectively the total growing season precipitation in 2015 was lower than in 2016 and 2017 the 2015 growing season experienced very heavy rainfall in june 226 mm which was 131 mm higher than the long term average on average the 2015 growing season was warmer than 2016 and 2017 with mean air temperature in 2015 to be 20 3 c whereas 19 8 c and 19 1 c in 2016 and 2017 respectively the highest monthly average temperature in all years occurred in july table 3 on average greater wind velocity existed in 2016 as compared with 2015 and 2017 also greater wind speeds were observed in the early growing season in all three years from may to june which is common for the research area the 2017 growing season experienced below normal wind velocities late in the growing season in august and september because of the minimal precipitation amounts in june in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons as compared with 2015 large differences in relative humidity rh were observed between the seasons the monthly average rh in june was 75 60 and 61 for 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively as compared with the long term average of 68 5 the incoming solar radiation was on average greater in 2017 than in 2015 and 2016 distribution of penman monteith pm equation estimated daily eto and etr and gdd values from mid april to mid october in three growing seasons are presented in fig 2 a b and c respectively the etr values ranged from 1 1 to 10 6 mm in 2015 from 0 8 to 11 5 mm in 2016 and 0 5 to 10 5 mm in 2017 the eto values ranged from 1 0 to 7 5 mm in 2015 from 0 70 to 8 4 mm in 2016 and from 0 5 to 7 8 mm in 2017 maximum etr and eto values were observed on june 28 in 2015 32 dap on june 21 in 2016 46 dap and again on june 21 in 2017 44 dap the corresponding average weather conditions on these days included wind speed of 3 78 4 62 and 4 64 m s 1 rs of 304 323 and 306 w m 2 average air temperature tavg of 23 0 27 3 and 27 1 c vpd of 1 42 1 99 and 1 78 kpa and rhmean of 53 5 52 0 and 55 4 in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively greater variability and higher values of eto and etr were observed in the initial growing season generally from mid may to mid july which is typically the vegetative growth period for maize in all three growing seasons 65 75 dap less variations were observed in both eto and etr in the maize reproductive stages which is generally between mid july to mid october in all three growing seasons maximum daily gdd values occurred in the middle of the season from late june to mid july and followed a quadratic distribution over the growing seasons there were substantial differences in the gdds from planting to harvest between 2015 and 2016 and 2017 due to differences in climatic conditions between the years maize reached its physiological maturity at different gdds the seasonal cumulative gdd from planting to harvest was 1 640 c dap 145 in 2015 1 781 c dap 160 in 2016 and 1 783 c dap 170 in 2017 3 2 crop evapotranspiration etc seasonal maize etc under different irrigation and nitrogen levels determined using the soil water balance approach is presented in table 4 in 2015 etc ranged from 324 mm in s3 ni frf treatment to 389 mm in s1 fri pp treatment the etc values for all soil types and treatments were higher in 2016 and 2017 than in 2015 due to higher seasonal rainfall and higher vpd due to very heavy rainfall at the beginning of the growing season and more uniform temporal distribution of rainfall until dap 100 in 2015 there were fewer irrigation events three in 2015 than in 2016 nine and 2017 ten etc ranged from 343 mm in s2 ni vrf to 649 mm in s1 fri pp treatment in 2016 whereas in 2017 it ranged from 362 mm in s2 vri vrf treatment to 634 mm in s3 fri vrf treatment in 2015 no significant difference p 0 05 in etc was observed between soil types irrigation or nitrogen treatments this was expected since irrigation amounts for this season were very low and were similar in all treatments in 2016 no significant interaction between soil type irrigation or nitrogen treatment was observed however irrigation had a significant effect on etc in 2016 plots under fri had maximum etc which was significantly higher than etc in vri and ni on a three year average etc was 528 460 and 378 mm in fri vri and ni treatments respectively in the 2017 growing season the soil and nitrogen management interactions were significant p 0 05 and irrigation level had a significant effect on etc in this season etc in vrf treatment was significantly lower than frf and pp treatment in s1 and s2 this means that applying in season nitrogen variably and uniformly might have different impacts on crop growth and development as well as associated etc values which in turn can impact kc values in different soil types similar to 2016 etc in fri treatment 577 mm was significantly p 0 05 higher than vri treatment 560 mm in the 2017 growing season similar weekly or biweekly soil moisture depletion period trends data not shown of etc were observed for all irrigation and nitrogen treatments within a year however magnitudes varied among the treatments maximum measured soil moisture depletion period etc was from mid august to late august in 2015 from late july to mid august in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons in general fri treatment with frf and pp nitrogen levels had maximum etc in the mid growing season especially during july and august as compared with other treatments due to higher nitrogen and water availability due to higher irrigation and nitrogen amounts in these treatments lai and plant height data not shown was greater as compared with other treatments resulting in greater etc the etc results from 2015 2016 and 2017 growing season indicated that greater differences in etc existed between irrigation treatments within a nitrogen level as compared to nitrogen treatments within an irrigation level supporting that irrigation has a greater impact on etc than nitrogen and that these impacts may also translate into differences in kc values of maize under different management practices 3 3 weekly bi weekly alfalfa and grass reference crop coefficients kcr and kco alfalfa

were fitted to all treatments for three years as well as for the pooled data and the equations and r2 values are presented in table 5 8 while kco values were also quantified for all treatments in all soil types and for all years only kcr values are discussed in detail previous studies on kc have fitted the kc curves ranging from third to fifth order polynomials djaman and irmak 2013 piccinni et al 2009 kang et al 2003 in 2015 kcr ranged from 0 10 to 1 10 0 10 to 1 10 and 0 02 to 1 0 for fri vri and ni respectively in s1 in s2 kcr ranged from 0 10 to 1 20 0 03 to 1 10 and 0 10 to 0 80 for fri vri and ni respectively and in s3 it ranged from 0 06 to 1 0 0 10 to 0 95 and 0 01 to 1 10 in fri vri and ni respectively averaged over the soil types kcr ranged from 0 10 to 1 0 0 07 to 0 93 and 0 05 to 0 82 for fri vri and ni respectively maximum kcr was observed under fri treatment in s1 and s2 whereas in s3 maximum kcr was observed in ni on average of three soil types maximum kcr was observed in fri treatment when the average of all three soil types for each treatment is considered the kcr values under fri with frf vrf and pp treatment were 0 85 0 96 and 1 0 respectively under vri with frf vrf and pp treatment maximum kcr values were 0 94 0 90 and 0 87 respectively and under ni with frf and vrf treatment maximum kcr was 0 82 and 0 79 respectively in general maximum kcr was observed in pp nitrogen treatment followed by frf and vrf the maximum values of kcr in 2015 occurred between gdd values of 900 and 1 200 c mid august which corresponded to the r2 to r3 growth stages in this season and the minimum values occurred in the early and late season when transpiration rates were lowest in general greater kcr values existed in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons as compared with 2015 in 2016 kcr ranged from 0 09 to 1 50 0 to 1 40 and 0 to 0 90 for fri vri and ni respectively in s1 in s2 kcr ranged from 0 004 to 1 50 0 06 to 1 52 and 0 to 0 90 for fri vri and ni respectively and in s3 it ranged from 0 002 to 1 50 0 02 to 1 20 and 0 004 to 0 80 in fri vri and ni respectively on average of three soil types kcr ranged from 0 07 to 1 40 0 04 to 1 30 and 0 08 to 0 80 in fri vri and ni respectively similar to 2015 maximum kcr value occurred in fri treatment followed by the vri and ni treatments however the nitrogen treatment effect on kcr was not consistent such that the maximum kcr within fri treatment was observed under the vrf treatment 1 36 maximum kcr within vri was observed under pp treatment 1 30 and maximum kcr within ni was observed under the frf treatment 0 78 the maximum kcr values in 2016 for fri and vri treatment occurred in early august which corresponded to r2 to r4 growth stage gdd 1119 to 1400 c in that season in 2017 the kcr values were in a similar range as in 2016 for fri and vri treatment and was slightly lower for ni treatments on average of three soil types maximum kcr for frf vrf and pp nitrogen treatment were 1 43 1 23 and 1 24 under fri management 0 95 1 30 and 1 30 under vri management and 1 05 and 0 90 under ni respectively maximum kcr for all treatments occurred at gdd 800 to 1400 c late july to late august and early september which corresponded to r1 to r4 growth stage similar maximum kcr peaks were observed by other researchers in the past for example piccinni et al 2009 reported that maximum kco values of 1 20 under non limiting water and n conditions at milk and dough growth stages sammis et al 1985 found a maximum kcr value of 1 44 for the month of july gdd 900 1200 c for maize grown in new mexico under fit and n fertilizer rate of 224 kg ha 1 3 4 monthly kcr and kco values while kc values presented as a function of cgdd can be very beneficial for different applications and daily or weekly kc values can be determined by solving the associated equations for within season water management modeling of water resources demand and use crop modeling hydrologic modeling and other applications tabulating kc values can be useful in practical applications by irrigators practitioners and other water management professionals monthly kcr values with standard deviations sd for all treatments and for the three year pooled data for each soil type are presented in table 9 the statistical significance t test α 0 05 of the differences between three year average kcr values for all fri vri and ni under frf vrf and pp fertilizer management in all three soil types are presented in table 10 maximum kcr values were observed for the month of july and august during peak crop development and maximum water use period in all soil types and minimum kcr values were observed in june during the early stage of crop growth and development with minimum water use rates for all soil types overall the maximum kcr value was observed in fri pp treatment in s1 1 02 fri vrf treatment in s2 1 06 and fri vrf treatment in s3 1 02 this indicates that there was no consistent effect of nitrogen treatments on kcr which suggests that the kcr values are more dependent on the amount rather than the timing of the nitrogen application because the amount of nitrogen in both frf and pp treatment under fri averaged over three growing seasons was 246 kg ha 1 which was similar to the amount applied to vrf treatment 201 kg ha 1 on average of nitrogen treatments greater kcr values were observed in fri treatment followed by vri and ni treatments the monthly kcr values agreed with the mid season kcr values of 1 26 and 1 05 respectively for the full irrigation treatment obtained by djaman and irmak 2013 the difference in kcr values between years indicates that climatic conditions that affect atmospheric evaporative demands strongly influence the kc value the results of this research also indicated that kc values are the function of crop growth and development as well as strongly dependent on the irrigation management strategy similar results have been reported in the literature on average of three soils in all three growing seasons greater differences in kcr curves between frf vrf and pp nitrogen treatment were observed under vri treatments as compared with fri greater variability under vri treatments can be attributed to lower irrigation amounts and less frequent irrigations that resulted in more variability in water distribution and perhaps uneven soil water evaporation and plant water uptake non uniform distribution of irrigation in vri treatment may have affected the uptake of water etc as well as soluble n nitrate n which resulted in more variability in kcr curves the variation that could be caused by vri management has not been investigated the only research the authors are aware is the research reported by sharma and irmak 2020b who investigated and compared maize growth and development grain yield irrigation yield production functions iypf evapotranspiration yield production functions etypf and crop water productivity cwp under vri fri and no irrigation ni with frf vrf and pp management in the same environment and management practices they observed that vri did not improve maize growth and development grain yield or cwp as compared with fri management they also reported that vri strategy increased the variation in grain yield etc and cwp as compared with fri management increased variation in etc in vri treatments as compared with fri treatments in the same field and crop and soil management and same climatic conditions would result in increased variation in kc values in vri in comparison with fri management they determined that soil type had a significant impact on the variation in yield etc iypf etypf and cwp under their experimental conditions for example s1 had the lowest grain yield variability as compared with s2 and s3 the coefficient of variation cv of grain yield ranged from 8 in crete silt loam soil under fri management to as high as 35 3 in hastings silt loam soil under vri management fri treatments in all soil types and years had less variation in maize grain yield as compared with vri suggesting that the increased variation in vri kc values is not random and caused by increased variation in etc under vri management which was manifested into variation in kc values djaman and irmak 2013 reported greater variability in maize kco and kcr values under rainfed and limited irrigation levels as compared with fit the difference in kcr curves between nitrogen treatments at each irrigation level as well as between irrigation levels is also evident from the pooled data graphs fig 6 the strong dependence of kcr and kco on cgdd was also observed in pooled data for all treatments and years the lowest kcr and kco values were obtained for ni treatment and the fri treatments had the highest values similar temporal trends existed between kcr and kco therefore a discussion on kco was not included however monthly kco values are presented in table 9 the results indicated that considerable differences in estimated etc exist between different irrigation and nitrogen management strategies and kc values for the same treatments differed between the soil types therefore the kc curves presented in this research for various nitrogen and irrigation management strategies in three different soil types can aid irrigators state agencies and others to make decisions on in season irrigation management and can aid in better understanding of how different irrigation and nitrogen management strategies can influence kcr and kco values in different soil types this would in turn enable etc estimations that can account for these influences by using different sets of kcr or kco values depending on the soil types investigated there were significant differences p 0 05 approximately 50 of the time in monthly average kc values between the treatments table 10 under vri with frf and pp fertilizer management all kcr values were significantly different in soil types whereas under fri with frf and pp management the kcr values were significantly different only in s1 soil 2 had significantly different kcr values under vri with frf and vrf under vri with frf and pp and under ni with frf and vrf out of 21 statistical analyses that were conducted s1 s2 and s3 had 27 10 and 14 of the time significant difference in kcr values between the treatments with most differences occurring in s1 for irrigated treatments in ni treatment frf and vrf only s2 had significantly different kcr values 3 5 impact of irrigation and fertilizer management and soil type on kcr to kco ratios the kcr values sometimes need to be converted to kco or vice versa to enable crop coefficients developed for one reference surface to be used with the other surface for example in the midwestern united states etr and kcr values are much more commonly used than eto and kco in eastern southern western southwestern and southern us eto and kco are most commonly used eto and kco also are most commonly used globally thus practical approaches to convert kc values developed for one surface to another surface are needed to make this conversion instead of re calculating or re measuring kc values which can be extremely difficult given the needed research instrumentation time and other resources required irmak et al 2003 and irmak et al 2008 developed etr to eto ratios kr values for several climatic regions ranging from tropical humid to semi arid to make conversions between kcr and kco for growing and non growing dormant seasons they determined the seasonal behavior of kr values between the locations and in the same location for different seasons monthly average kr values from daily values were developed for bushland texas clay center nebraska davis california gainesville florida phoenix arizona and rockport missouri for the calendar year and for the growing season may september using several different et methods their approach is robust and beneficial for making conversions in areas where detailed climate data are available to solve the penman monteith equation for etr or eto estimations to make the conversions however to the best of authors knowledge the impact of irrigation fri vri and ni and nitrogen frf vrf and pp management practices on kcr to kco ratios in different soil types have not been studied and the potential impact of nitrogen management strategies on kcr to kco ratios has not been investigated here we propose another method to determine kcr to kco ratios k values to be able to make conversions between kcr and kco this conversion k values would also be beneficial to be able to use kcr or kco values developed for a region in another region for irrigation management et estimations and other purposes where kc values are not available monthly june july august and september k values for each growing season individually as well as for a three year average for all treatments for each soil type were developed table 11 the standard deviations between k values for each treatment were calculated to determine variations while the k values were determined for a portion of the growing season june september this period covers most of the period in which irrigation is practiced the k values ranged from 0 78 to 0 98 and they were at their lowest during june increased in july and august and decreased in september unlike significant differences observed between the kc values between the treatments and between the soil types for the same treatment differences in k values between the treatments as well as for the same treatment in different soil types were small for the same month which indicates that the ratios are independent of the nature of irrigation and nitrogen management practices for example in s1 the k values for all irrigation and nitrogen treatments were within 0 79 and 0 80 0 83 and 0 86 0 85 and 0 88 and within 0 80 and 0 83 for june july august and september respectively however k values for the same treatment differed considerably between the months for the same soil type in general sd values were higher for ni and vri treatments than fri treatments and vrf sd values were higher than frf treatments conversions between kcr and kco is a straightforward process for example the three year average kcr value in june for fri frf treatment in s1 is 0 35 table 9 and the kco value needs to be determined the kcr to kco ratio for the same treatment in the same soil is 0 80 table 11 since kcr kco k 0 35 kco 0 80 then kco 0 44 the same value in table 11 for that treatment in s1 similar to the etr to eto ratios kr values developed by irmak et al 2003 and irmak et al 2008 the kcr to kco ratios k values developed in this research can be useful for making conversions from kcr to kco or vice versa to enable using crop coefficients developed for one reference surface with the other to determine crop water use for locations with similar climatic characteristics of this research when locally measured k values are not available 4 summary and conclusions this research quantified etc kcr and kco curves and algorithms as a function of cgdd for maize under different irrigation fri vri and ni under different nitrogen management practices frf vrf and pp in three soil types for maize for three growing seasons on average the 2015 growing season was warmer than 2016 and 2017 and growing season precipitation in 2015 2016 and 2017 was 353 375 and 467 mm respectively our results showed that soil type irrigation management and nitrogen management strategies all had an impact on kc values in 2015 the maximum kcr occurred between cgdd values of 900 and 1200 c mid august which corresponded to the r2 to r3 growth stages in the fri pp treatment inter annual variations were observed in kc values greater kcr values were observed in 2016 and 2017 as compared with 2015 the maximum kcr values in 2016 for the fri and vri treatments occurred in august which was also at the r2 to r4 growth stages cgdd 1119 to 1400 c in that season similar to 2015 the maximum kcr values were observed in the fri treatment in 2016 as well in 2017 kcr values were in a similar range as in 2016 for the fri and vri treatments and on average maximum kcr was observed in the fri treatment maximum kcr for all treatments occurred at cgdd 800 to 1400 c late july to early september which was at the vt to r4 growth stages on a monthly average basis maximum kcr and kco values were observed in july and august in all soil types and minimum kc values were observed in june overall the maximum kcr value was observed in the fri pp treatment in s1 1 02 the fri vrf treatment in s2 1 06 and the fri vrf treatment in s3 1 02 the results of this research indicated that the magnitude of kcr and kco depends on the irrigation management strategies amount and timing of water in general the maximum kcr and kco values were observed in fri the difference between the kcr curves at different nitrogen levels were observed which was more pronounced in the vri and ni treatments than in fri for all years kcr to kco ratios k values were quantified and tabulated for each irrigation and nitrogen management strategy in each soil type this conversion k values would be beneficial in terms of using kcr or kco values developed for a region in another region for irrigation management etc estimations and other purposes where kc values are not available with increasing interest in variable rate technology and due to increasing nitrogen application restrictions and decline in water resources it is critical to understand the impact of various irrigation and nitrogen management strategies on crop water use to plan and manage water and fertilizers efficiently to the best of our knowledge this research is the first to investigate the impact of variable rate irrigation and nitrogen management strategy on crop coefficients for maize under different soil types the crop coefficient curves presented in this research can aid irrigators state agencies and others for accurate crop water use estimates under different irrigation and nitrogen management strategies and soil types to make field level and larger scale irrigation management decisions and water resources assessments planning management and allocation decisions for the climate soil and cropping systems conditions similar to those presented in this research further research to investigate the applicability transferability of the crop coefficients developed in this research in other regions with similar characteristics is needed declaration of competing interest the authors declare no
