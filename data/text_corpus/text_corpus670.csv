3350,hydraulic diffusivity or imbibition is a well known unsaturated hydrodynamics phenomenon in water resources and geosciences study currently there have been numerous analytical or numerical models describing the spontanneous imbibition of porous rock and soil however the most existing models do not consider hydrostatic pressure and elaborate pore geometry characteristics assuming that the penetration direction is one dimensional and infinitely continuous a long term co current spontaneous imbibition si model is proposed by average and fractal geometries respectively accordingly obtaining the general expression of dimensionless comprehensive parameter the practicability and accuracy of the model are verified by experimental data and compared with other models the influence mechanisms of tortuosity pore throat fractal shape and topological characteristics on initial and equilibrium si behaviors are comprehensively revealed the new models are applied to inversely predict the dimensionless comprehensive parameters variations of which with porosity are analyzed along with their influence on long term si characteristics the results are shown as follows compared with the existing classical models the prediction accuracy of the new model consistent with experiment is greatly improved generalizing the existing models the dimensionless comprehensive parameters based on average and fractal geometries show the decreasing trend in power law and increasing trend in linear with the increase of porosity respectively the equilibrium height or mass is only related to topology factor fractal dimension and shape factor whereas the equilibrium time is also correlated to pore throat ratio and tortuosity the sensitivities of fractal dimension topological factor and shape factor to equilibrium time are stronger than that of equilibrium mass or height the sensitivities of topological characteristics pore throat structure tortuosity pore geometry and fractal characteristics to si reduce successively for porous media the influences of dimensionless comprehensive parameter on evolution of si mass with time go through four stages i e no influence at initial stage increasing influence at initial later stage weakening influence at later stage and increasing influence at end whereas on evolution of si velocity versus time and recovery rate go through two stages that is significant influence at initial stage and no influence at later stage keywords fractal geometry theory generalized geometry model long term spontaneous imbibition multi factor analysis 1 introduction spontaneous imbibition si is a kind of natural phenomenon that exists widely and is extensively used in engineering science promoting and inhibiting the si as well as revealing the mechanism of si are widely concerned in engineering and have aroused the extensive interest of engineers and technicians for a long time the si phenomenon has its representation and application in mining engineering zhao et al 2018a zhao et al 2018b oil or gas reservoir exploitation hu et al 2020 hydrological geology cueto et al 2009 building construction roveri et al 2020 concrete dam roels et al 2003 soil physics gruener et al 2012 chemical industry zhang 2011 and environmental science nitao and buscheck 1991 and only there are differences of transport and bearing media among them the hydrostatic pressure i e gravity head accompanying the whole process of si because of the difference of focusing on macro or micro scale of research objects has different influence on si of porous media thus whether or not to consider the effect of gravity and its spatio temporal effect is a problem worthy of attention some researchers david et al 2011 cheng et al 2015 utilized the dimensionless bond number to judge the relative competition between capillary and gravity and believed that the tiny pores in porous media lead to the capillary pressure much greater than the hydrostatic pressure caused by gravity and hence the gravity can be ignored in whole imbibition process however some other researchers cai et al 2012 fries and dreyer 2008 thought that the gravity can be ignored in early imbibition belleghem et al 2016 kang et al 2013 and with the increase of gravity head its influence on imbibition behavior was remarkable in later stage in particular the concerned problems in numerous engineering projects such as pollutant migration sudicky and frind 1982 underground water infiltration zhang et al 2019 leaching solution seepage confined water imbibition solute transport houseworth 2006 are tend to be the long term si of large macro pore fissure media therefore it is of great significance to study the spatio temporal evolution mechanism of si in the coupling action of hydrostatic and capillary pressures the microscopic pore structures of porous media are extremely complicated as the specific performances including the pore size distribution psd across multiple scales zhao et al 2019 twisting interconnected pore channels nikitsin and backiel brzozowska 2013 different geometric shape pores afsharpoor and javadpour 2016 rough pores wall wei and wang 2003 as well as the local shrinkage or expansion along pores young 2004 and interconnection between different pores raeesi and piri 2009 particularly obvious for natural pore structures rock soil etc in some studies the microscopic imaging such as ct was used to construct the real pore structure at a certain scale thus developing the numerical simulation of unsaturated infiltration two phase or multi phase flow raeini et al 2014 however the modeling procedure was cumbersome moreover the size of the established model was greatly limited due to its large calculation amount and limited computed system in other studies the real pore structures were simplified into the equivalent geometric models ryazanov et al 2009 pia and sanna 2014 at present there are two kinds of popular models i e capillary bundle and pore network models roveri et al 2020 simultaneously there are still unstructured seepage models based on unsaturated darcy s law handy 1960 schmid et al 2011 mcwhorter and sunada 1990 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1991 compared with the other modeling methods the capillary bundle models are prone to understand and operate and can obtain the calculation results close to the experimental results or values by other precise modeling technologies so far many researchers have applied and modified the capillary bundle models cai et al 2012 shi et al 2018 benavente et al 2002 washburn 1921 unfortunately there is not a kind of model that can fully incorporate the real geometry properties of microscopic pore structure and hence the universality of their application is limited to some extent whether or without taking into account the influence of gravity on si of porous media has been studied by many scholars zhmud et al 2000 hamraoui and nylander 2002 xue et al 2006 fries and dreyer 2008 made a detailed discussion on spatio temporal effect of gravity in the si of porous media and concluded that when the imbibition height was less than 10 of equilibrium state ignoring the gravity had no significant loss of calculation accuracy the kinetics equation involving the gravity term is implicit with no easy solution and convenient application especially for porous media with small pore size the above conditions accord to the laboratory scale specimen roveri et al 2020 belleghem et al 2016 therefore the theoretical models constructed by some researchers effectively describe the si behavior of small macro scale sample disregarding of gravity contribution benavente et al 2002 raimondo et al 2009 li and horne 2004 also some studies have experimentally verified the point of view hassanein et al 2006 hanžic and ilic 2003 cnudde et al 2008 in contrast the actual engineering scale is much larger than the experimental scale and the si process is continuous for a long time so the theoretical models ignoring gravity that inevitably cause severe calculation error are limited and not general in large scale engineering problems in view of these problems some researchers have constructed several long term si theoretical models considering the influence of gravity and studied the influence of pore structure and wetting phase on spatio temporal characteristics of si equilibrium state cai et al 2012 cai et al 2014 cai et al 2010 unfortunately as mentioned above they did not fully involve the geometric characteristics of pore structure at the beginning of model construction thus leading to that the geometric factors related to the long term si characteristics can not be comprehensively analyzed comprehensively considering the topological tortuous fractal pore throat and geometric features of pore structure a more general model with gravity describing the long term si is established by average and fractal geometries respectively based on our model the influence mechanism of a real pore structure on long term si characteristics is revealed for porous media the proposed model is verified by experimental data of the different organic or inorganic wetting phases si in different consolidated or unconsolidated porous media and its prediction accuracy is compared with that of the existing classical models on this basis the influences of every structure parameter on initial indicators sorptivity or capillary coefficient and final indicators equilibrium time or height weight of si are analyzed along with their sensitivity to si behavior in addition the dimensionless comprehensive parameters are predicted inversely by our model combined with the experimental data and their variation law with porosity is studied for average and fractal geometry models respectively finally the influences of dimensionless comprehensive parameter and porosity on evolution trend of si mass or velocity over time as well as si velocity versus recovery rate are analyzed 2 theoretical model prior to the construction of model there are a few pieces of assumption and limitation as follows a there is no moisture exchange with the surrounding environment along with isothermal adiabatic transport b the macroscopic transport direction is one dimensional and infinitely continuous c the pore wall roughness and entrance pressure loss are ignored d the wetting evolution is quasi static and fully developed in capillary tube e the model is limited in the liquid gas system when the viscous force gas pressure and gravitational force can be ignored in gas phase f the wetting liquid vertically imbibes into a bundle of capillaries from lower permeable end and the gas phase is expelled from the upper free boundary g the wetting front is assumed to be advanced in a pistonlike manner h the wetting liquid with laminar flow is viscous and incompressible i the microscopic flow satisfies the hagen poiseuille h p equation and laplace young l y equation 2 1 the model characterized by average geometry currently it has been proved that the pore sizes of porous media often spanned multiple scales and the minimum pore size was far smaller than the maximum pore size feng et al 2004 according to lw equation the imbibition rate is different for different classes of pores so the wetting phenomenon of multi front is supposed to occur shi et al 2018 pia et al 2014 however many scholars have found the uniform and flat wetting front without uneven end faces in the imbibition of various porous materials natural or artificial by means of numerical simulation and physical imaging belleghem et al 2016 therefore it is reasonable that the apparent flow rate through the porous media can be calculated as the weighted average of wetting rates of different classes pores the weight n i is the number of ith class pores 1 q av i 1 n n i q si r i 1 n n i π δ 4 r av 4 8 α 4 τ av 2 μ 1 l sav 2 σ cos θ δ r av ρ g l sav where q av is the apparent volume flow rate r av is the average pore radius τ av is the average tortuosity l sav is the wetting distance the number of every class pores can be measured by using imaging x ray ct or physical mip method according to the law of conservation mass the both sides of eq 1 are divided by π r av 2 to obtain the velocity of wetting front 2 v av t δ 3 r av 4 α 4 τ av 2 μ σ cos θ l sav t δ 4 r av 2 ρ g 8 α 4 τ av 2 μ as shown in fig 1 b the pores in porous medium are often interconnected to form a pore network having obvious topological geometric feature currently the effective medium approximation ema theory has been used to calculate the effective pore radius of heterogeneous pore network to describe the influence of pore structure topology on seepage characteristics doyen 1988 schlueter 1955 taking the average coordination number z 2 6 and respectively benavente et al 2002 applied the ema to solve the effective pore radius of 12 different kinds of rock samples thus the ratios of effective pore radius r ef to the measured average pore radius r av by mip method are approximately ranged from 10 4 to 101 the majority less than 1 but may also be greater than 1 for pore structure with excellent connectivity for this one defines the topological factor χ r ef r av to characterize the connectivity between capillary bundles the concept of topological factor is substituted into eq 2 derived from the independent capillary bundles to yield a modified dynamic equation describing the water imbibition of interconnected pore network 3 v av t d l sav t dt χ δ 3 r av 4 α 4 τ av 2 μ σ cos θ l sav t χ 2 δ 4 r av 2 ρ g 8 α 4 τ av 2 μ where r ef is the effective pore radius let d l sav t d t 0 in eq 3 the maximum or equilibrium height of wetting phase imbibed by porous media can be obtained as follows 4 h m 2 σ cos θ χ δ r av ρ g where h m is the equilibrium height eq 4 shows that different from previous studies the equilibrium height is not only related to the pore size but also related to the pore connectivity and shape moreover the more irregular pore shape and the weaker pore connectivity result in higher imbibition equilibrium height because the both conditions are conductive to the increase of capillary pressure however this is just the opposite of the difference affecting on initial imbibition as shown below its imbibition is relatively weak for porous media with irregular pore shape and weak pore connectivity despite of relatively slow imbibition rate for the above types of porous media the wetting phase can penetrate into their greater depth along with more mass thus it is very necessary to focus on long term imbibition process in many engineering fields such as nuclear waste storage chemical leaching mining and underground reservoir storage but the types of reservoirs are unfavorable for the exploitation of oil or gas by short term imbibition assuming that the wetting phase is imbibed into porous media in a piston like means li and horne 2004 and the pores after wetting front can not be completely saturated one expects a following relationship between imbibition mass and water head 5 m cp t ρ ϕ s wf s wi l sav t where m cp is the imbibition mass per unit area ϕ is the porosity s wf and s wi are saturated and initial wetting phase content respectively for simplicity we apply the assumption that the area porosity is equal to the volume porosity yu et al 2003 after taking the derivative of both sides of eq 5 with respect to time substituting eqs 3 into 5 and rearranging yield 6 d m cp t dt ρ 2 ϕ 2 s wf s wi 2 χ δ 3 r av σ cos θ 4 α 4 τ av 2 μ 1 m cp t ρ 2 ϕ s wf s wi χ 2 δ 4 r av 2 g 8 α 4 τ av 2 μ similarly if d m cp t d t 0 in eq 6 the maximum mass of imbibed wetting phase per unit area can be obtained as follows 7 m e 2 ϕ s wf s wi σ cos θ χ δ r av g where m e is the maximum or equilibrium mass per unit area different from the imbibition equilibrium height the cumulative maximum imbibition mass is not related to the wetting phase density but to porosity and water content the larger porosity and saturated water content lead to more mass imbibed into porous media and the two quantitative indexes are also positively correlated with the capillary imbibition rate as described below similarly the pore shape and connectivity are negatively correlated with the equilibrium mass as the analytical results of eqs 3 and 6 the imbibition mass or height is an implicit function of time but the imbibition time is an explicit function of the both quantities and can be expressed by 8 t a b 2 ln 1 b a i i b for eq 3 a χ δ 3 r av σ cos θ 4 α 4 τ av 2 μ b χ 2 δ 4 r av 2 ρ g 8 α 4 τ av 2 μ for eq 6 a ρ 2 ϕ 2 s wf s wi 2 χ δ 3 r av σ cos θ 4 α 4 τ av 2 μ b ρ 2 ϕ s wf s wi χ 2 δ 4 r av 2 g 8 α 4 τ av 2 μ where i denotes the imbibition indexes mass or height when the imbibition mass or height reaches 99 of theoretical equilibrium state it is considered that the imbibition has entered into a stable state i e the imbibition mass or height basically does not increase cai et al 2012 fries and dreyer 2008 amico and lekakou 2002 inserting i 0 99i e in eq 8 gives 9 t e 3 62 a b 2 3 62 b i e 57 92 α 4 τ av 2 σ cos θ μ χ 3 δ 5 ρ 2 g 2 r av 3 where t e denotes the equilibrium time i e denotes the equilibrium mass or height the above equation shows that compared with the equilibrium mass or height the steady state time is correlated to all structural parameters α δ χ and τ but independent of the saturation and porosity it is also found that compared with the equilibrium mass or height the equilibrium time is more sensitive to the pores topology and shape with their higher power exponent moreover it is shown that for the more tortuous pore structure with obvious pore throat the time required to reach the equilibrium state is correspondingly extended which is consistent with the actual physical conditions while the height and mass of imbibition equilibrium are independent of the two geometric characteristics in addition the equilibrium time is more sensitive to the representative size of pore structure than the equilibrium height or mass up to third power ignoring the influence of gravity i e the second term on the right side of equal sign eqs 3 and 6 are integrated to obtain the following expressions by separating the variables 10a l sav 2 s 2 t χ δ 3 r av σ cos θ

capillary coefficient defining the ratio of wetting mass per unit area to square root of time cai et al 2014 established a generalized model considering the influence of pore structure parameters ϕ δ r av τ av and wetting phase saturation s wf s wi along with a comparative analysis with the existing models fries and dreyer 2008 handy 1960 benavente et al 2002 li and horne 2004 aronofsky et al 1958 and found the other models were particular cases of cai model or could be transformed from this model however compared with the cai model our model takes into account the additional influences of pore structure topology and pore throat characteristics by introducing their quantitative indexes thus when χ 1 and α 1 the model in this paper is reduced to cai model 2 2 the model characterized by fractal geometry many researchers avnir et al 1983 katz and thompson 1985 hansen and skjeltorp 1988 have discovered that the pore size distribution of natural porous media sandstone shale etc had statistical self similarity within a certain observational scale i e the pore size distribution had fractal characteristics for fractal porous media the smaller the pore size is the greater its number and vice versa yu et al 2003 accordingly we have 11 d n f λ d λ d f λ max d f λ d f 1 d λ where d n is the number of pores with dimensions between λ and λ d λ with the negative sign indicating that the number of pores decreases with increasing pore size f λ is the probability density function d f is the fractal dimension of the pore size distribution λ max is the maximum pore size λ is the arbitrary pore size and d λ is the micro increment for the pore size combining eqs a 9 and 11 a integral from λ min to λ max yields an expression for the apparent total volume flow rate as follows 12

volume flow rate r min and r max are the minimum and maximum pore radius respectively β is the ratio of minimum to maximum pore radius for fractal pore structure the cross sectional pore area can be expressed as 13 a p r min r max π r 2 d n π d f r max 2 2 d f 1 β 2 d f where a p is the pore area combining eqs 12 and 13 yields an expression of the apparent imbibition velocity of the wetting phase

the aforementioned factors the imbibition equilibrium mass or height and time are also related to the heterogeneity d f and pore size distribution β of porous media in a similar way of section 2 1 we have 18a l sav 2 s 2 t δ 3 σ cos θ 2 α 4 τ av 2 μ 2 d f r max 1 β 3 d f 1 β 2 d f 3 d f t 18b m cp 2 c 2 t ρ 2 ϕ 2 s wf s wi 2 δ 3 σ cos θ 2 α 4 τ av 2 μ 2 d f r max 1 β 3 d f 1 β 2 d f 3 d f t cai et al 2012 also considered the influence of heterogeneity and tortuosity of pore structure in capillary imbibition and only introduced two corresponding quantitative indexes d f τ av into their model their model did not relate to other factors such as pore geometry δ pore throat α and wetting phase saturation s wf s wi and hence had no universality however our model takes the above factors into account without exception and is more general when δ α s wf all taken as 1 and s wi taken as 0 our model is reduced to cai model the imbibition characteristic parameters namely the sorptivity or capillary coefficient obtained by two methods are identical for same porous media then combining eqs 10 and 18 yields 19 χ r ave 2 d f 3 d f 1 β 3 d f 1 β 2 d f r max yun et al 2008 proposed a following relationship between average and maximum pore radius 20 r ave r max d f 4 d f 1 4 inserting eq 20 into eq 19 and rearranging yield a following fractal calculation of topological factor for

dimension that is the stronger the heterogeneity of pore structure is the weaker the inter connectivity of pores for larger pore size distribution range the corresponding pore connectivity is weakened and the relationship is gradually obvious with the increase of fractal dimension for the pore structure with weak heterogeneity small fractal dimension the pore size distribution has no influence on the topological characteristics of pore network see fig 2 a however the pore structure with larger porosity has stronger pore connectivity and it is in line with the actual physics to some extent with the increase of the heterogeneity of pore structure larger fractal dimension the influence of porosity on topological characteristics is gradually weakened see fig 2b the weak heterogeneity tends to homogenity represent a tight pore structure resulting in a concentrated pore size distribution along with the weak and strong influence of β and porosity on topology respectively the strong heterogeneity represents a loose pore structure resulting in a discrete pore size distribution along with the strong and weak influence of β and porosity on topology respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of model 3 1 1 test 1 experimental data is cited from the research results of benavente et al 2002 and measured parameters ϕ r av c ex and δ are listed in table 1 the wetting phase is water θ 0 μ 0 001 n s m2 σ 0 0728 n m and ρ 1000 kg m3 the measured and predicted parameters are put into eqs 10b and 18b to calculate the theoretical capillary coefficients listed in table 1 respectively compared with the models in this paper three classical models available from literature are selected to calculate the corresponding capillary coefficients listed in table 1 meanwhile the comparison results of our and existing models are plotted in fig 3 fig 3 and table 1 indicate that the predicted values of our models represented by average and fractal geometries are near the measured capillary coefficients with their average error controlled within 3 6 and 3 7 respectively however in terms of the prediction accuracy of a single sample the overall prediction effect of the fractal geometry model is better than that of the average geometry model compare with other three existing models the proposed two models estimate more accurate results it further proves from the experimental perspective that our models consider more influencing factors and hence are close to the real geometric properties of rocky pore structure moreover the existing models can be regarded as special cases of our models reducing the factors thus our models prove to be universal it is worth noting that some porous media do not have fractal characteristics hence the hydroscopicity of porous structure without statistical self similarity should be described by the average geometrical model indeed there are a few of fitting parameters including the pore throat ratio α ratio of minimum pore radius to maximum pore radius β tortousity τ av and empirical constant f due to their not measurement from literature benavente et al 2002 however all the values of the four parameters are well founded and are not arbitrary with the pore throat ratio α taken 2 677 hammecker and jeannette 1994 the ratio of minimum to maximum pore radius β taken 0 01 0 001 and 0 0001 feng et al 2004 yu and li 2001 the empirical constant f taken 0 41 0 60 and 0 63 comiti and renaud 1989 kontogeorgos and founti 2013 and the tortuosity τ av taken 3 benavente et al 2002 dullien et al 1977 doyen 1988 in addition the fractal dimension d f cai et al 2010 cai et al 2012 and tortuosity τ av cai et al 2014 roveri et al 2020 cai et al 2012 are calculated by substituting the measured porosity and fitting parameters β and f into eqs b 1 and b 2 respectively even so the real microcosm including natural micro pore structure is fairly complicated and hence some micro geometry parameters need be characterized by appropriate methods such as x ray ct and sem not taking empirical and fitting values consequently a rigorous validation of models is necessary in the future by measuring the real geometry parameters including the fractal dimesnion d f tortuosity τ av and pore throat ratio α based on x ray ct zhao et al 2017 zhao et al 2018b zhao et al 2019 3 1 2 test 2 in this test the experimental data from unconsolidated glass bead pack and silica class and consolidated berea bentheim and membrane media is used to verify our models where the wetting phases contain organic decanol and n c16h24 and inorganic water fluids the detailed sample characteristics and fluids physical properties are listed in table 2 the comparison of the model predictions with the experimental results is shown in fig 4 for the imbibition weight vs time all the samples are in the initial dry state i e s wi 0 and they could be completely saturated after imbibition wetting front i e s wf 1 fig 4 shows that the predicted results of our models characterized by fractal and average geometries are identical with the test values for natural and artificial materials and their best fitting errors are 0 7 0 9 2 0 4 4 and 5 5 for fig 4 a b c d and e respectively hence our models can accurately describe the dynamic evolution of different wetting phases imbibed into different porous media in these tests the influence of gravity on media imbibition can be completely ignored at selected time scales thus one can conclude that ignoring gravity is effective for small pores imbibition at long time and large pores imbibition at short time respectively however the critical height or time at which the gravity begins to exert a significant influence needs to be accurately identified with the increase of pore sizes their capillary pressures decrease along with increasing influence of gravity when the pores size increases to a certain critical scale capillary pores the capillary phenomenon can not be produced basically there is also a lower limit of pore size and the pores lower than the critical size can not lead to capillary imbibition but dynamic diffusion of liquid molecules therefore it is necessary to accurately identify the scale range of capillary pores for models 6 and 15 with the gravity term the approximate solution of lambert function is basically consistent with their numerical solution however for the large pores the lambert solution gradually deviates from the numerical solution as time increases see a enlarged illustration in fig 4b the model represented by fractal geometry is applied to predict the membrane imbibition characterization lower than the measured points see fig 4f and the possible reason is that the kind of materials do not have the fractal characteristics of pore size distribution and hence its imbibition behavior can not be described by fractal model in contrast the model represented by average geometry can perfectly characterize the wetting evolution process of membrane imbibition therefore the premise of applying fractal geometry model is to determine whether or not the pore structure has fractal characteristics but the average geometry model can be applied to both the fractal and non fractal structures in addition it is worth noting that the theoretical predictions are higher the measured values in the later imbibition of some samples the reason may be that our models are derived under the assumption that the seepage direction extends indefinitely and the wetting front can never reach the upper boundary however the longitudinal scale of experimental samples is often far less than the equilibrium height of the wetting front after a certain time the wetting front will migrate to the upper boundary and then the imbibition state enters another wetting evolution stage cnudde et al 2008 roveri et al 2020 in which our models fail to quantitatively describe the wetting evolution law 3 2 estimation of parameters benavente et al 2015 selected 15 kinds of porous rocks with different physical properties and pore structures to carry out hydroscopicity experiments according to eq c 2 their measured capillary coefficients are used to reversely estimate the comprehensive parameter ξ 11 the experimental data and predicted results are shown in table 3 the variation law of dimensionless comprehensive parameter with porosity is plotted in fig 5 along with the curves fitting these data points as can be seen from fig 5 the estimated dimensionless parameter ξ 11 shows a power law attenuation trend with the increase of pore space size thus it can explain the abnormal phenomenon that some porous structures with large pore size have weak water imbibition characteristics for the porous structures with porosity less than 10 or average pore radius smaller than 1 μm the parameter ξ 11 decreases sharply with the increase of both whereas the porosity or pore radius exceeds the above threshold the attenuation state tends to be flat it can be demonstrated that for the porous media with small pore size dense and homogeneous the composite structure parameters χ δ α and τ i e ξ 11 has important influence on their imbibition characteristics whereas for porous media with large pore structure the ξ 11 because of mutual coupling parameters χ δ α and τ has no effect on their imbibition characteristics and hence their strong or weak imbibition is only related to their pore space sizes comiti and renaud 1989 proposed a empirical relationship b2 showing the decreasing tortuosity with the increase of porosity based on the theoretical relations and experimental data cai et al 2014 found that the geometrical factor linearly decreased with increasing porosity according to theoretical relationship 21 the topological factor increases with the increase of porosity simultaneously we conclude that the dimensionless comprehensive correction parameter ξ 11 decreases with the increase of porosity by fitting the experimental data see fig 5 therefore the pore throat ratio may decrease with the increase of porosity that is with the increase of pore space the throat gradually becomes large and transforms into the pore on the contrary the pore throat gradually shrinks or even closes with the decrease of porosity for the dense and homogeneous porous media benavente et al 2015 the goodnesses of power law fitting the data points are r2 0 82467 0 85031 and 0 92201 for three kinds of relationships ξ 11 r av 0 5 ξ 11 ϕ and ξ 11 ϕ r av 0 5 respectively where the fitting goodness of ξ 11 ϕ r av 0 5 is greater than 0 9 thus it can illustrate that the feature size of pore space is the comprehensive characterization of porosity and pore size and the imbibition behavior of pore structure is determined by the feature size and other multiple geometrical factors coupling each other according to simple washburn equation the flow resistance would be smaller with the increase of porosity or pore size resulting in faster imbibition process however a lot of measured data show that there is no strong positive correlation between si characteristics parameters including sorptivity or capillary coefficients and porosity or pore size in the natural porous media roveri et al 2020 benavente et al 2002 benavente et al 2015 hammecker et al 1993 pia et al 2014 casteleyn et al 2010 by contrast our model can explain this abnormal phenomenon as shown in fig 5 the abnormal phenomenon mainly attribute to both sides namely the complicated micro pore structure mps and capillary transport hydrodynamics cth on the one hand although the increase of pore sace szie porosity or pore size can lead to the strong si perfunctorily the capillary pressure may decrease with the increase of porosity resulting in larger pore radius and contact angle bao and wang 2017 along with the prominent gravity and inertia pressure zhmud et al 2000 fries and dreyer 2008 and hence the coupling pressure effectiveness may give rise to the abnormal phenomenon on the other hand with the increase of porosity the remarkable heterogeneity and anisotropy can weaken the si cai et al 2010 cai et al 2012 and the considerable 3d topology resulting in strong 3d transport characteristics just reduce the apparent macro one dimensional si studied by us also the pore wall surface and cross section geometry become rough and irregular with the increase of porosity respectively and these remarkable geometrical characteristics may dissipate more energy benavente et al 2002 salam and wang 2022 resulting in the abnormal phenomenon in the literature cheng et al 2015 dullien et al 1977 amadu and pegg 2018 the observation method x ray ct imaging and neutron beams imaging were used to study the variation of wetting front with time in the water imbibition for different rocks sandstone limestone and grainstone the specific pore structure and hydrodynamic experimental data are listed in table 4 in which the maximum pore size is calculated by the measured permeability through the theoretical relation b3 and the dimensionless comprehensive correction parameter is inversely predicted by measured sorptivity coefficient through eq c 2 the variation law of dimensionless comprehensive parameter with porosity is plotted in fig 6 along with the linear fitting these data points fig 6 indicates that the parameter ξ 21 tends to increase with the increase of pore space size and it is different from the variation law of the parameter ξ 11 with the pore space size yu and li 2001 obtained a theoretical relation b 1 indicating that the fractal dimension increased with the increase of porosity thus substituting the β 2 d f with ϕ in eq c 1 theoretically shows that the parameter ξ 21 increases with the increase of porosity moreover the fitting results of scattered points in fig 6 show that the dimensionless comprehensive correction parameter ξ 21 may linearly increase with the increase of pore space size however a small number of experimental samples and experimental errors may cause low fitting correlations r2 less than 0 7 therefore it is necessary to increase the number of experimental samples to verify the above linear relationship it is also noted that the maximum pore size is reverse predicted from permeability and not based on measured results 3 3 parameters analysis taking the wetting phase for water its physical parameters are the same as above the pore structure parameters are as follows the average pore radius r av 0 3066 μm pore throat ratio α 2 677 average tortuosity τ av 1 1 porosity φ 0 2 wetting saturation s wf 0 9 and initial saturation s wi 0 based on average geometry model the variation laws of equilibrium state characteristics height mass and time and initial imbibition characteristics capillary and sorptivity coefficients with pore and topology geometries are plotted as shown in fig 7 a b and c taking the topological factor χ 0 1 shape factor δ 0 766 and other parameters as above the variation laws of equilibrium time and capillary coefficient versus pore throat ratio and tortuosity are plotted in fig 7 d fig 7 a and b show that the equilibrium mass or height decreases with the increase of shape and topology factors whereas the capillary or sorptivity coefficient increases with the increase of the both dimensionless parameters when the pore geometry is extremely irregular very small shape factor the influence of pore network topology on the height or mass of imbibition equilibrium is extremely sensitive as the pore geometry tends to be regular the shape factor greater than 0 1 the influence of pore structure topology on equilibrium quantities is gradually weakened however the effect of pore network topology on initial imbibition characteristics is just the opposite of the above situation fig 7 c shows that both the equilibrium height and time decrease with the increase of shape factor compared with the linearly decreasing equilibrium height the equilibrium time is more sensitive to the shape factor and tends to nonlinearly decrease with the increase of the shape factor the equilibrium time greatly decays for small shape factor and its decreasing extent is gradually weakened with the increase of the shape factor fig 7 d indicates that the capillary coefficient and equilibrium time decrease and increase with the increase of pore throat ratio as well as tortuosity respectively in the case of large pore throat the effect of tortuosity on capillary coefficient is more sensitive but with the increase of pore throat ratio its influence is gradually weakened in contrast the equilibrium time is insensitive to tortuosity for large pore throat and the influence of tortuosity enhances with the increase of pore throat ratio taking the wetting phase for organic fluid its physical parameters are as follows θ 5 ρ 0 77 g cm 3 μ 0 0031 n s m 2 and σ 0 02715 n m 1 the pore structure parameters are as follows the maximum pore radius r ma 18 μm pore throat ratio α 1 average tortuosity τ av 3 ratio of minimum to maximum pore size β 0 01 porosity φ 0 1 wetting saturation s wf 0 7 and initial saturation s wi 0 based on fractal geometry model the variation laws of equilibrium state and initial imbibition characteristics with the pore shape factor and fractal dimension are plotted in fig 8 a b and c taking the shape factor δ 0 866 fractal dimension d f 1 2 and other parameters as above the variation laws of equilibrium time and sorptivity coefficient versus pore throat ratio and tortuosity are plotted in fig 8 d fig 8 a and b show that the equilibrium height mass and sorptivity capillary coefficient increase and decrease with the increase of fractal dimension but decrease and increase with the increase of shape factor respectively the variation of the imbibition characteristics with fractal dimension is relatively gentle and does not show their drastic changing trend sudden increase or decrease with the shape factor at a turning point as mentioned above compared with the topological factor mentioned above the fractal dimension and shape factor are much less sensitive to the imbibition behavior of pore structure fig 8 c conveys that both the equilibrium mass and time show an increasing trend with the increase of fractal dimension it is found that its influence degree is weak for small fractal dimension but the influence sensitivity gradually increases with the increase of fractal dimension compared with the equilibrium mass the equilibrium time is more sensitive to fractal dimension fig 8 d depicts that the sorptivity coefficient and equilibrium time decrease and increase with the increase of tortuosity as well as pore throat ratio respectively the influence of the pore throat ratio on equilibrium time is weak for small tortuosity and its influence gradually enhances with the increase of the tortuosity the case of the sorptivity coefficient versus pore throat ratio is on the contrary based on the above analysis it is found that the tortuosity is more sensitive to the imbibition of porous media than the fractal dimension whereas its influence is weaker than the pore throat ratio according to the above comprehensive analysis one can conclude that the sensitivity of topological characteristics pore throat structure tortuosity characteristics pore geometry and fractal characteristics to the imbibition of porous media reduces successively 3 4 forward analysis the pore structure parameters are taken as follows α 2 677 χ 0 1 β 0 01 f 0 6 and ϕ 0 5 the wetting phase is water with the above mentioned physical parameters its initial s wi and wetting s wf saturation are viewed as 0 and 1 respectively the permeability k of pore structure is 2 54 10 11 m2 the respective pore shape factors δ 0 531 0 766 equilateral triangle and 0 866 square along with the other designated parameters are substituted into eq c 1 to calculate the dimensionless comprehensive correction parameters here the tortuosity and fractal dimension are calculated by eqs b 2 and b 1 respectively thus the effect of the comprehensive correction factor on the long term imbibition behavior of porous media is quantitatively studied by using the models characterized by average and fractal geometries see fig 9 where the maximum pore radius is calculated by using eq b3 4 8 for k and then the average pore radius is calculated based on theoretical relationship 20 fig 9 show that at the beginning of imbibition less than 104 s the dimensionless parameter ξ has no notable effect on the evolution characteristics of imbibition over time whereas in later imbibition greater than 104 s first of all the increasing energy consumption due to the wetting phase viscous force leads to the gradual strengthening influence of ξ on imbibition evolution then with the gradual increasing adverse effect of gravity the influence of ξ again begins to wane finally with the imbibition gradually tending to equilibrium state the influence of ξ again begins to strengthen gradually the larger the dimensionless parameter ξ is the faster the corresponding imbibition rate will be and the faster the equilibrium state will be reached in contrast for the smaller ξ although the imbibition rate is reduced the imbibition time will last longer and hence the more wetting phase can penetrate into the porous media reaching equilibrium state compared with the governing equation characterized by fractal geometry the imbibition dynamic equation based on average geometry describes a steeper evolution curve of mass versus time and it indicates that the topological characteristics of pore structure is more sensitive to long term imbibition behavior than fractal characteristics for the weaker connectivity of pore structure the imbibition process will last longer with the greater equilibrium weight taking the respective porosity ϕ 0 4 0 3 and 0 2 shape factor δ 0 866 and other parameters as above the variation laws of wetting rate with time are plotted in fig 10 the dimensionless comprehensive correction parameter is calculated by eq c 1 the tortuosity fractal dimension maximum pore radius and average pore radius are obtained in the same way as above fig 10 shows that in early stage of si less than 104 s the porosity and dimensionless comprehensive parameter have obvious effect on evolution behavior of imbibition rate with time because of capillary pressure playing a major role in capillary kinetics whereas in its later stage greater than 104 s have no notable influence on its evolution characteristics due to the increasing controlling action of gravity against capillary pressure it is just contrary the trend of curve depicted in fig 9 with the increase of porosity and dimensionless comprehensive parameter the corresponding imbibition rate enlarges compared with the kinetics equation expressed by the average geometry the dynamic equation based on fractal geometry describes generally higher and steeper evolution curve mainly because of that the pore topological characteristics is more sensitive to imbibition behavior than the pore space and fractal characteristics fig 9 shows that the influence of dimensionless comprehensive parameter on evolution law of imbibition mass over time can be roughly divided into four stages as follows the first stage no influence the second stage appearing influence the third stage weakening influence and the fourth stage strengthening influence however fig 10 depicts that the influence of ξ on the evolution law of imbibition rate over time only goes roughly two stages the first stage notable effect and the second stage no effect taking the respective porosity φ 0 6 0 5 and 0 4 for eq d1a the respective porosity φ 0 3 0 2 and 0 1 for eq d1b the shape factor δ 0 866 and other parameters as above the variation laws of wetting velocity with recovery rate are depicted as shown in fig 11 the dimensionless comprehensive correction parameter tortuosity fractal dimension maximum pore radius and average pore radius are obtained in the same way as above the length of core is taken as l t 10 cm it can be seen from fig 11 that the imbibition rate increases with the increase of reciprocal of gas recovery rate that is the recovery rate is low at initial stage of imbibition while the imbibition velocity is large the recovery rate is large at its later stage while the imbibition velocity is small in later stage of imbibition the dimensionless comprehensive parameter have no effect on the evolution law of imbibition velocity versus recovery rate while in its early stage have significant effect on evolution process under the same recovery rate the larger the porosity and dimensionless comprehensive parameter are the larger the imbibition velocity in particular the curves described by equation based on fractal geometry suffer from significantly stronger influence of the both parameters than the equation based on average geometry the curves described by relationship between recovery rate and wetting velocity based on fractal geometry are not all lower than that expressed by average geometry as a whole whereas existing in overlapping and crossover phenomenon among them for instance although the porosity ϕ 0 3 is smaller than ϕ 0 5 the curve described by equation characterized by fractal geometry is higher than that expressed by average geometry which is caused by dimensionless parameters ξ 21 greater ξ 11 similarly although the porosity ϕ 0 2 smaller than 0 4 the curves described through both methods is basically close to each other therefore one expects that the variation trend of initial imbibition velocity with recovery rate is sensitive to both the porosity and dimensionless comprehensive parameter the underground geotechnical enginneering often involves the multi phase and multi field coupling actions the research on si is more practical in complex environment for instance the three phase system including water oil and gas is widely found in secondary enhanced oil recovery afzali et al 2020 what s more the deep enivronment involving the mining sequestration of carbon dioxide or nuclear waste and oil or gas exploitation is dramatically affected by temperature stress chemical and seepage fields the fracture with various scales is also coupled in other fields particularly the srtree capillary coupling phenomenon has aroused widespread interest in oil recovery when naturally fractured carbonate reservoirs been located in high stress environment haghi et al 2018 therefore it is necessary and significative to consider the pore deformation induced by stress into the proposed model as a tentative work the macroscopic and microscopic 3d cases are universal in practical activity ferer et al 1996 the underground engineering usually has complex boundary conditions reuslting in macroscopic simultaneous transport along all three directions rangel german and kovscek 2002 particularly clearly revealing the microscopic transport mechanism is distinctly important for increasing oil recovery rates and controling gas reservoir damage zacharoudiou and boek 2016 qin et al 2021 the current model mainly focuses on the influence of various microscopic geometry factors on a one dimensional si consequently we will try and figure out how the current model is implemented to the 3d cases based on three sets of orthogonal capillary bundles 4 conclusions based on average and fractal geometries a general long term si model which is closer to the real porous media is established by considering multiple geometric factors of pore structure comprehensively according to the model the theoretical relationship between topological factor of the pore network and area fractal dimension of the pores is derived and a more all round expression of the dimensionless comprehensive correction parameter is proposed the prediction results of our model are quantitatively compared with the experimental results as well as the prediction values by existing classical models meanwhile the sensitivity of geometric parameters to the initial and steady imbibition characteristics relationship between dimensionless comprehensive parameter and porosity and influence of comprehensive parameter on long term imbibition evolution are analyzed the remarkable conclusions are as follows 1 the prediction results by two new models are in good agreement with the experimental results and our models with better predicted accuracy can unify the existing classical models it is effective to ignore the gravity for short term imbibition in porous media with small pore size and lambert approximation solution of the implicit equations is basically consistent with their numerical solution thus showing the effectiveness of the approximation solution because of not all the microscopic pore size distributions having fractal characteristics for porous media the equation characterized by the average geometry is more practical than that expressed by the fractal geometry 2 the dimensionless comprehensive parameter by average geometry decreases with increasing porosity satisfying the quantitative decaying relationship in power law means it conveys that the comprehensive parameter presents the severe attenuation and remain basically unchanged with its increasing for the porosity smaller and greater than 10 respectively the pore throat ratio has a tendency to decrease with increasing porosity in other words the throat channel gradually turns into pore cavity with non significant pore throat characteristics for large porosity the dimensionless comprehensive parameter by fractal geometry seems to present a linear increasing tendency with the increase of porosity 3 the connectivity of pore structure weakens with the increase of its heterogeneity and strengthens with the increase of porosity for the pore structure characterized by weaker connectivity more irregular pore shape and stronger heterogeneity its initial imbibition is weaker whereas the corresponding imbibition time is longer along with the imbibed more wetting phase the equilibrium time is related to the pore throat ratio and tortuosity but which the equilibrium mass or height has nothing to do with the shape and topology factors are more sensitive to the equilibrium time than the equilibrium mass or height the sensitivity of topological characteristics pore throat structure tortuous characteristics pore geometry and fractal characteristics to the imbibition behavior of porous media reduces in turn 4 the influence of the dimensionless comprehensive parameter on the long term evolution process of imbibition weight versus time is divided into four stages the first stage initially no effect by capillary force controlling the second stage early gradually appearing effect governed by viscous resistance the third stage later gradually weakening effect mastered by gravity head and the fourth stage enhanced effect at equilibrium state the influence of the comprehensive parameter on the long term evolution process of the imbibition velocity versus time and recovery rate can be divided into two stages significant and no influence in initial and later imbibition respectively compared with the fractal characteristics the topological characteristics of pore structure is more sensitive to the evolution process of imbibition mass and velocity versus time both the porosity and dimensionless comprehensive parameter have important effects on the evolution process of imbibition velocity with recovery rate

notable pore throat characteristics in the microscopic pore structure of porous media and corresponding investigators simplified the feature into different geometric forms to construct equivalent models geistlinger and mohammadian 2015 valvatne and blunt 2004 joekar niasar et al 2010 leventis et al 2000 generated a three dimension lattice pore network by interconnection of spheres pores and cylinders throats and developed a imbibition numerical model of cement mortar pore structure the similar equivalent geometric models are applied in other researches consequently according to the existing results the compact porous structure is also simplified into one dimensional non uniform capillary bundles as shown in fig 1a for our work the actual penetration velocity is low for the dense porous media and the cross section size of capillary gradually transforms in pore element so the local energy loss caused by size change can be ignored hammecker and jeannette 1994 believed that the volumetric flow rate depended on transverse size of throat channel in capillary with pore throat structure and hence the volume flow rate of a single capillary in fig 1a is expressed as a1 q r π 8 δ p l s r 4 μ at a certain pressure difference where q r is the volume flow rate δ p is the pressure difference l s is the straight length of capillary r is the radius of pore throat μ is the dynamic viscosity coefficient introducing the definition of pore throat ratio α r r into eq a 1 yields a2 q r q r α q r π 8 α 4 δ p l s r 4 μ where r is the equivalent spherical radius of pore cavity the above equations are derived from the capillary with circular cross section and hence do not conform to real pore geometry for this applying the shape factor of irregular cross section benavente et al 2002 cai et al 2014 qin and van brummelen 2019 yang et al 2020 to correct eq a 2 results in a3 q r π δ 4 8 α 4 δ p l s r 4 μ where δ is the shape factor which is defined as the ratio of hydraulic diameter of irregular section to that of equivalent circular section the actual pore channels are convoluted as shown in fig 1c therefore further amendment of eq a 3 by using the tortuosity factor cai et al 2012 derives the following formula a4 q r π δ 4 8 α 4 δ p τ l s r 4 μ where τ is tortuosity factor which is defined as the ratio of tortuous to straight length for a capillary introducing the quasi static laplace young l y equation p c 2 σ cos θ δ r the characteristic dimension of capillary as shown in fig 1a is pore radius r hammecker et al 1993 jointly corrected by shape factor and substituting the δ p p c ρ g l si into eq a 4 one can obtain a5 q ti r π δ 4 r i 4 8 α 4 τ i μ 1 l si 2 σ cos θ δ r i ρ g l si where q ti r is the volume flow rate of i th convoluted capillary and the rests with the subscript i have the identical reference meaning σ is the gas liquid interfacial tension θ is the solid liquid contact angle l si is the height of capillary water head ρ is the liquid density g is the acceleration of gravity the tortuosity τ i is defined as a ratio of tortuous length l ti to straight length l si namely a6 l ti τ i l si taking the derivative of both sides of equation a 6 with repect to time one can obtain a7 v ti d l ti dt τ i d l si dt τ i v si where v ti is the actual velocity of meniscus in tortuous tube v si is the apparent velocity along imbibition gradient according the law of conservation mass q av where q is the volume flow rate a is the cross sectional area and v is the flow velocity we derive a8 q ti π r i 2 τ i q si π r i 2 the relationship q ti τ i q si is substituted into eq a 5 as a result of obtaining the apparent flow rate expression a9 q si r π δ 4 r i 4 8 α 4 τ i 2 μ 1 l si 2 σ cos θ δ r i ρ g l si describing the migration of water head for a single capillary where q si is the volume flow rate along imbibition gradient eq a 9 is final modified h p equation considering pore throat characteristics tortuosity characteristics and pore shape appendix b the parameters ϕ r av and k are measured by experiment whereas the quantities d f λ max and τ av will be estimated by using theoretical models the area

tortuosity τ av can be calculated by comiti and renaud 1989 kontogeorgos and founti 2013 b2 τ av 1 f ln ϕ where f is the empirical constant taken as 0 41 sphere 0 60 best fitting and 0 63 cube moreover the fixed value τ av 3 is also used here benavente et al 2002 dullien et al 1977 the maximum pore diameter λ max can be obtained by cai et al 2010 b3a λ max d s 4 2 ϕ 1 ϕ ϕ 1 ϕ π 4 1 ϕ 1 b3b d s 4 1 ϕ ϕ kk ϕ where d s is the average particle diameter k is the permeability k is the kozeny constant taken as 4 8 here appendix c for the governing equations derived by above two methods the

3350,hydraulic diffusivity or imbibition is a well known unsaturated hydrodynamics phenomenon in water resources and geosciences study currently there have been numerous analytical or numerical models describing the spontanneous imbibition of porous rock and soil however the most existing models do not consider hydrostatic pressure and elaborate pore geometry characteristics assuming that the penetration direction is one dimensional and infinitely continuous a long term co current spontaneous imbibition si model is proposed by average and fractal geometries respectively accordingly obtaining the general expression of dimensionless comprehensive parameter the practicability and accuracy of the model are verified by experimental data and compared with other models the influence mechanisms of tortuosity pore throat fractal shape and topological characteristics on initial and equilibrium si behaviors are comprehensively revealed the new models are applied to inversely predict the dimensionless comprehensive parameters variations of which with porosity are analyzed along with their influence on long term si characteristics the results are shown as follows compared with the existing classical models the prediction accuracy of the new model consistent with experiment is greatly improved generalizing the existing models the dimensionless comprehensive parameters based on average and fractal geometries show the decreasing trend in power law and increasing trend in linear with the increase of porosity respectively the equilibrium height or mass is only related to topology factor fractal dimension and shape factor whereas the equilibrium time is also correlated to pore throat ratio and tortuosity the sensitivities of fractal dimension topological factor and shape factor to equilibrium time are stronger than that of equilibrium mass or height the sensitivities of topological characteristics pore throat structure tortuosity pore geometry and fractal characteristics to si reduce successively for porous media the influences of dimensionless comprehensive parameter on evolution of si mass with time go through four stages i e no influence at initial stage increasing influence at initial later stage weakening influence at later stage and increasing influence at end whereas on evolution of si velocity versus time and recovery rate go through two stages that is significant influence at initial stage and no influence at later stage keywords fractal geometry theory generalized geometry model long term spontaneous imbibition multi factor analysis 1 introduction spontaneous imbibition si is a kind of natural phenomenon that exists widely and is extensively used in engineering science promoting and inhibiting the si as well as revealing the mechanism of si are widely concerned in engineering and have aroused the extensive interest of engineers and technicians for a long time the si phenomenon has its representation and application in mining engineering zhao et al 2018a zhao et al 2018b oil or gas reservoir exploitation hu et al 2020 hydrological geology cueto et al 2009 building construction roveri et al 2020 concrete dam roels et al 2003 soil physics gruener et al 2012 chemical industry zhang 2011 and environmental science nitao and buscheck 1991 and only there are differences of transport and bearing media among them the hydrostatic pressure i e gravity head accompanying the whole process of si because of the difference of focusing on macro or micro scale of research objects has different influence on si of porous media thus whether or not to consider the effect of gravity and its spatio temporal effect is a problem worthy of attention some researchers david et al 2011 cheng et al 2015 utilized the dimensionless bond number to judge the relative competition between capillary and gravity and believed that the tiny pores in porous media lead to the capillary pressure much greater than the hydrostatic pressure caused by gravity and hence the gravity can be ignored in whole imbibition process however some other researchers cai et al 2012 fries and dreyer 2008 thought that the gravity can be ignored in early imbibition belleghem et al 2016 kang et al 2013 and with the increase of gravity head its influence on imbibition behavior was remarkable in later stage in particular the concerned problems in numerous engineering projects such as pollutant migration sudicky and frind 1982 underground water infiltration zhang et al 2019 leaching solution seepage confined water imbibition solute transport houseworth 2006 are tend to be the long term si of large macro pore fissure media therefore it is of great significance to study the spatio temporal evolution mechanism of si in the coupling action of hydrostatic and capillary pressures the microscopic pore structures of porous media are extremely complicated as the specific performances including the pore size distribution psd across multiple scales zhao et al 2019 twisting interconnected pore channels nikitsin and backiel brzozowska 2013 different geometric shape pores afsharpoor and javadpour 2016 rough pores wall wei and wang 2003 as well as the local shrinkage or expansion along pores young 2004 and interconnection between different pores raeesi and piri 2009 particularly obvious for natural pore structures rock soil etc in some studies the microscopic imaging such as ct was used to construct the real pore structure at a certain scale thus developing the numerical simulation of unsaturated infiltration two phase or multi phase flow raeini et al 2014 however the modeling procedure was cumbersome moreover the size of the established model was greatly limited due to its large calculation amount and limited computed system in other studies the real pore structures were simplified into the equivalent geometric models ryazanov et al 2009 pia and sanna 2014 at present there are two kinds of popular models i e capillary bundle and pore network models roveri et al 2020 simultaneously there are still unstructured seepage models based on unsaturated darcy s law handy 1960 schmid et al 2011 mcwhorter and sunada 1990 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1991 compared with the other modeling methods the capillary bundle models are prone to understand and operate and can obtain the calculation results close to the experimental results or values by other precise modeling technologies so far many researchers have applied and modified the capillary bundle models cai et al 2012 shi et al 2018 benavente et al 2002 washburn 1921 unfortunately there is not a kind of model that can fully incorporate the real geometry properties of microscopic pore structure and hence the universality of their application is limited to some extent whether or without taking into account the influence of gravity on si of porous media has been studied by many scholars zhmud et al 2000 hamraoui and nylander 2002 xue et al 2006 fries and dreyer 2008 made a detailed discussion on spatio temporal effect of gravity in the si of porous media and concluded that when the imbibition height was less than 10 of equilibrium state ignoring the gravity had no significant loss of calculation accuracy the kinetics equation involving the gravity term is implicit with no easy solution and convenient application especially for porous media with small pore size the above conditions accord to the laboratory scale specimen roveri et al 2020 belleghem et al 2016 therefore the theoretical models constructed by some researchers effectively describe the si behavior of small macro scale sample disregarding of gravity contribution benavente et al 2002 raimondo et al 2009 li and horne 2004 also some studies have experimentally verified the point of view hassanein et al 2006 hanžic and ilic 2003 cnudde et al 2008 in contrast the actual engineering scale is much larger than the experimental scale and the si process is continuous for a long time so the theoretical models ignoring gravity that inevitably cause severe calculation error are limited and not general in large scale engineering problems in view of these problems some researchers have constructed several long term si theoretical models considering the influence of gravity and studied the influence of pore structure and wetting phase on spatio temporal characteristics of si equilibrium state cai et al 2012 cai et al 2014 cai et al 2010 unfortunately as mentioned above they did not fully involve the geometric characteristics of pore structure at the beginning of model construction thus leading to that the geometric factors related to the long term si characteristics can not be comprehensively analyzed comprehensively considering the topological tortuous fractal pore throat and geometric features of pore structure a more general model with gravity describing the long term si is established by average and fractal geometries respectively based on our model the influence mechanism of a real pore structure on long term si characteristics is revealed for porous media the proposed model is verified by experimental data of the different organic or inorganic wetting phases si in different consolidated or unconsolidated porous media and its prediction accuracy is compared with that of the existing classical models on this basis the influences of every structure parameter on initial indicators sorptivity or capillary coefficient and final indicators equilibrium time or height weight of si are analyzed along with their sensitivity to si behavior in addition the dimensionless comprehensive parameters are predicted inversely by our model combined with the experimental data and their variation law with porosity is studied for average and fractal geometry models respectively finally the influences of dimensionless comprehensive parameter and porosity on evolution trend of si mass or velocity over time as well as si velocity versus recovery rate are analyzed 2 theoretical model prior to the construction of model there are a few pieces of assumption and limitation as follows a there is no moisture exchange with the surrounding environment along with isothermal adiabatic transport b the macroscopic transport direction is one dimensional and infinitely continuous c the pore wall roughness and entrance pressure loss are ignored d the wetting evolution is quasi static and fully developed in capillary tube e the model is limited in the liquid gas system when the viscous force gas pressure and gravitational force can be ignored in gas phase f the wetting liquid vertically imbibes into a bundle of capillaries from lower permeable end and the gas phase is expelled from the upper free boundary g the wetting front is assumed to be advanced in a pistonlike manner h the wetting liquid with laminar flow is viscous and incompressible i the microscopic flow satisfies the hagen poiseuille h p equation and laplace young l y equation 2 1 the model characterized by average geometry currently it has been proved that the pore sizes of porous media often spanned multiple scales and the minimum pore size was far smaller than the maximum pore size feng et al 2004 according to lw equation the imbibition rate is different for different classes of pores so the wetting phenomenon of multi front is supposed to occur shi et al 2018 pia et al 2014 however many scholars have found the uniform and flat wetting front without uneven end faces in the imbibition of various porous materials natural or artificial by means of numerical simulation and physical imaging belleghem et al 2016 therefore it is reasonable that the apparent flow rate through the porous media can be calculated as the weighted average of wetting rates of different classes pores the weight n i is the number of ith class pores 1 q av i 1 n n i q si r i 1 n n i π δ 4 r av 4 8 α 4 τ av 2 μ 1 l sav 2 σ cos θ δ r av ρ g l sav where q av is the apparent volume flow rate r av is the average pore radius τ av is the average tortuosity l sav is the wetting distance the number of every class pores can be measured by using imaging x ray ct or

approximation ema theory has been used to calculate the effective pore radius of heterogeneous pore network to describe the influence of pore structure topology on seepage characteristics doyen 1988 schlueter 1955 taking the average coordination number z 2 6 and respectively benavente et al 2002 applied the ema to solve the effective pore radius of 12 different kinds of rock samples thus the ratios of effective pore radius r ef to the measured average pore radius r av by mip method are approximately ranged from 10 4 to 101 the majority less than 1 but may also be greater than 1 for pore structure with excellent connectivity for this one defines the topological factor χ r ef r av to characterize the connectivity between capillary bundles the concept of topological factor is substituted into eq 2 derived from the independent capillary bundles to yield a modified dynamic equation describing the water imbibition of interconnected pore network 3 v av t d l sav t dt χ δ 3 r

porous media can be obtained as follows 4 h m 2 σ cos θ χ δ r av ρ g where h m is the equilibrium height eq 4 shows that different from previous studies the equilibrium height is not only related to the pore size but also related to the pore connectivity and shape moreover the more irregular pore shape and the weaker pore connectivity result in higher imbibition equilibrium height because the both conditions are conductive to the increase of capillary pressure however this is just the opposite of the difference affecting on initial imbibition as shown below its imbibition is relatively weak for porous media with irregular pore shape and weak pore connectivity despite of relatively slow imbibition rate for the above types of porous media the wetting phase can penetrate into their greater depth along with more mass thus it is very necessary to focus on long term imbibition process in many engineering fields such as nuclear waste storage chemical leaching mining and underground reservoir storage but the types of reservoirs are unfavorable for the exploitation of oil or gas by short term imbibition assuming that the wetting phase is imbibed into porous media in a piston like means li and horne 2004 and the pores after wetting front can not be completely saturated one expects a following relationship between imbibition mass and water head 5 m cp t ρ ϕ s wf s wi l sav t where m cp is the imbibition mass per unit area ϕ is the porosity s wf and s wi are saturated and initial wetting phase content respectively for simplicity we apply the assumption that the area porosity is equal to the volume porosity yu et al 2003 after taking the derivative of both sides of eq 5 with respect to time substituting eqs 3 into 5 and rearranging yield 6 d m cp t dt ρ 2 ϕ 2 s wf s wi 2 χ δ 3 r av σ cos θ 4 α 4 τ av 2 μ 1 m cp t ρ 2 ϕ s wf s wi χ 2 δ 4 r av 2 g 8 α 4 τ av 2 μ similarly if d m cp t d t 0 in eq 6 the maximum mass of imbibed wetting phase per unit area can be obtained as follows 7 m e 2 ϕ s wf s wi σ cos θ χ δ r av g where m e is the maximum or equilibrium mass per unit area different from the imbibition equilibrium height the cumulative maximum imbibition mass is not related to the wetting phase density but to porosity and water content the larger porosity and saturated water content lead to more mass imbibed into porous media and the two quantitative indexes are also positively correlated with the capillary imbibition rate as described below similarly the pore shape and connectivity are negatively correlated with the equilibrium mass as the analytical results of eqs 3 and 6 the imbibition mass or height is an implicit function of time but the imbibition time is an explicit function of the both quantities and can be expressed by 8 t a b 2 ln 1 b a i i b for eq 3 a χ δ 3 r av σ cos θ 4 α 4 τ av 2 μ b χ 2 δ 4 r av 2 ρ g 8 α 4 τ av 2 μ for eq 6 a ρ 2 ϕ 2 s wf s wi 2 χ δ 3 r av σ cos θ 4 α 4 τ av 2 μ b ρ 2 ϕ s wf s wi χ 2 δ 4 r av 2 g 8 α 4 τ av 2 μ where i denotes the imbibition indexes mass or height when the imbibition mass or height reaches 99 of theoretical equilibrium state it is considered that the imbibition has entered into a stable state i e the imbibition mass or height basically does not increase cai et al 2012 fries and dreyer 2008 amico and lekakou 2002 inserting i 0 99i e in eq 8 gives 9 t e 3 62 a b 2 3 62 b i e 57 92 α 4 τ av 2 σ cos θ μ χ 3 δ 5 ρ 2 g 2 r av 3 where t e denotes the equilibrium time i e denotes the equilibrium mass or height the above equation shows that compared with the equilibrium mass or height the steady state time is correlated to all structural parameters α δ χ and τ but independent of the saturation and porosity it is also found that compared with the equilibrium mass or height the equilibrium time is more sensitive to the pores topology and shape with their higher power exponent moreover it is shown that for the more tortuous pore structure with obvious pore throat the time required to reach the equilibrium state is correspondingly extended which is consistent with the actual physical conditions while the height and mass of imbibition equilibrium are independent of the two geometric characteristics in addition the equilibrium time is more sensitive to the representative size of pore structure than the equilibrium height or mass up to third power ignoring the influence of gravity i e the second term on the right side of equal sign eqs 3 and 6 are integrated to obtain the following expressions by separating the variables 10a l sav 2 s 2 t χ δ 3 r av σ cos θ

and found the other models were particular cases of cai model or could be transformed from this model however compared with the cai model our model takes into account the additional influences of pore structure topology and pore throat characteristics by introducing their quantitative indexes thus when χ 1 and α 1 the model in this paper is reduced to cai model 2 2 the model characterized by fractal geometry many researchers avnir et al 1983 katz and thompson 1985 hansen and skjeltorp 1988 have discovered that the pore size distribution of natural porous media sandstone shale etc had statistical self similarity within a certain observational scale i e the pore size distribution had fractal characteristics for fractal porous media the smaller the pore size is the greater its number and vice versa yu et al 2003 accordingly we have 11 d n f λ d λ d f λ max d f λ d f 1 d λ where d n is the number of pores with dimensions between λ and λ d λ with the negative sign indicating that the number of pores decreases with increasing pore size f λ is the probability density function d f is the fractal dimension of the pore size distribution λ max is the maximum pore size λ is the arbitrary pore size and d λ is the micro increment for the pore size combining eqs a 9 and 11 a integral from λ min to λ max yields an expression for the apparent total volume flow rate as follows 12

the aforementioned factors the imbibition equilibrium mass or height and time are also related to the heterogeneity d f and pore size distribution β of porous media in a similar way of section 2 1 we

al 2012 also considered the influence of heterogeneity and tortuosity of pore structure in capillary imbibition and only introduced two corresponding quantitative indexes d f τ av into their model their model did not relate to other factors such as pore geometry δ pore throat α and wetting phase saturation s wf s wi and hence had no universality however our model takes the above factors into account without exception and is more general when δ α s wf all taken as 1 and s wi taken as 0 our model is reduced to cai model the imbibition characteristic parameters namely the sorptivity or capillary coefficient obtained by two methods are identical for same porous media then combining eqs 10 and 18 yields 19 χ r ave 2 d f 3 d f 1 β 3 d f 1 β 2 d f r max yun et al 2008 proposed a

dimension that is the stronger the heterogeneity of pore structure is the weaker the inter connectivity of pores for larger pore size distribution range the corresponding pore connectivity is weakened and the relationship is gradually obvious with the increase of fractal dimension for the pore structure with weak heterogeneity small fractal dimension the pore size distribution has no influence on the topological characteristics of pore network see fig 2 a however the pore structure with larger porosity has stronger pore connectivity and it is in line with the actual physics to some extent with the increase of the heterogeneity of pore structure larger fractal dimension the influence of porosity on topological characteristics is gradually weakened see fig 2b the weak heterogeneity tends to homogenity represent a tight pore structure resulting in a concentrated pore size distribution along with the weak and strong influence of β and porosity on topology respectively the strong heterogeneity represents a loose pore structure resulting in a discrete pore size distribution along with the strong and weak influence of β and porosity on topology respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of model 3 1 1 test 1 experimental data is cited from the research results of benavente et al 2002 and measured parameters ϕ r av c ex and δ are listed in table 1 the wetting phase is water θ 0 μ 0 001 n s m2 σ 0 0728 n m and ρ 1000 kg m3 the measured and predicted parameters are put into eqs 10b and 18b to calculate the theoretical capillary coefficients listed in table 1 respectively compared with the models in this paper three classical models available from literature are selected to calculate the corresponding capillary coefficients listed in table 1 meanwhile the comparison results of our and existing models are plotted in fig 3 fig 3 and table 1 indicate that the predicted values of our models represented by average and fractal geometries are near the measured capillary coefficients with their average error controlled within 3 6 and 3 7 respectively however in terms of the prediction accuracy of a single sample the overall prediction effect of the fractal geometry model is better than that of the average geometry model compare with other three existing models the proposed two models estimate more accurate results it further proves from the experimental perspective that our models consider more influencing factors and hence are close to the real geometric properties of rocky pore structure moreover the existing models can be regarded as special cases of our models reducing the factors thus our models prove to be universal it is worth noting that some porous media do not have fractal characteristics hence the hydroscopicity of porous structure without statistical self similarity should be described by the average geometrical model indeed there are a few of fitting parameters including the pore throat ratio α ratio of minimum pore radius to maximum pore radius β tortousity τ av and empirical constant f due to their not measurement from literature benavente et al 2002 however all the values of the four parameters are well founded and are not arbitrary with the pore throat ratio α taken 2 677 hammecker and jeannette 1994 the ratio of minimum to maximum pore radius β taken 0 01 0 001 and 0 0001 feng et al 2004 yu and li 2001 the empirical constant f taken 0 41 0 60 and 0 63 comiti and renaud 1989 kontogeorgos and founti 2013 and the tortuosity τ av taken 3 benavente et al 2002 dullien et al 1977 doyen 1988 in addition the fractal dimension d f cai et al 2010 cai et al 2012 and tortuosity τ av cai et al 2014 roveri et al 2020 cai et al 2012 are calculated by substituting the measured porosity and fitting parameters β and f into eqs b 1 and b 2 respectively even so the real microcosm including natural micro pore structure is fairly complicated and hence some micro geometry parameters need be characterized by appropriate methods such as x ray ct and sem not taking empirical and fitting values consequently a rigorous validation of models is necessary in the future by measuring the real geometry parameters including the fractal dimesnion d f tortuosity τ av and pore throat ratio α based on x ray ct zhao et al 2017 zhao et al 2018b zhao et al 2019 3 1 2 test 2 in this test the experimental data from unconsolidated glass bead pack and silica class and consolidated berea bentheim and membrane media is used to verify our models where the wetting phases contain organic decanol and n c16h24 and inorganic water fluids the detailed sample characteristics and fluids physical properties are listed in table 2 the comparison of the model predictions with the experimental results is shown in fig 4 for the imbibition weight vs time all the samples are in the initial dry state i e s wi 0 and they could be completely saturated after imbibition wetting front i e s wf 1 fig 4 shows that the predicted results of our models characterized by fractal and average geometries are identical with the test values for natural and artificial materials and their best fitting errors are 0 7 0 9 2 0 4 4 and 5 5 for fig 4 a b c d and e respectively hence our models can accurately describe the dynamic evolution of different wetting phases imbibed into different porous media in these tests the influence of gravity on media imbibition can be completely ignored at selected time scales thus one can conclude that ignoring gravity is effective for small pores imbibition at long time and large pores imbibition at short time respectively however the critical height or time at which the gravity begins to exert a significant influence needs to be accurately identified with the increase of pore sizes their capillary pressures decrease along with increasing influence of gravity when the pores size increases to a certain critical scale capillary pores the capillary phenomenon can not be produced basically there is also a lower limit of pore size and the pores lower than the critical size can not lead to capillary imbibition but dynamic diffusion of liquid molecules therefore it is necessary to accurately identify the scale range of capillary pores for models 6 and 15 with the gravity term the approximate solution of lambert function is basically consistent with their numerical solution however for the large pores the lambert solution gradually deviates from the numerical solution as time increases see a enlarged illustration in fig 4b the model represented by fractal geometry is applied to predict the membrane imbibition characterization lower than the measured points see fig 4f and the possible reason is that the kind of materials do not have the fractal characteristics of pore size distribution and hence its imbibition behavior can not be described by fractal model in contrast the model represented by average geometry can perfectly characterize the wetting evolution process of membrane imbibition therefore the premise of applying fractal geometry model is to determine whether or not the pore structure has fractal characteristics but the average geometry model can be applied to both the fractal and non fractal structures in addition it is worth noting that the theoretical predictions are higher the measured values in the later imbibition of some samples the reason may be that our models are derived under the assumption that the seepage direction extends indefinitely and the wetting front can never reach the upper boundary however the longitudinal scale of experimental samples is often far less than the equilibrium height of the wetting front after a certain time the wetting front will migrate to the upper boundary and then the imbibition state enters another wetting evolution stage cnudde et al 2008 roveri et al 2020 in which our models fail to quantitatively describe the wetting evolution law 3 2 estimation of parameters benavente et al 2015 selected 15 kinds of porous rocks with different physical properties and pore structures to carry out hydroscopicity experiments according to eq c 2 their measured capillary coefficients are used to reversely estimate the comprehensive parameter ξ 11 the experimental data and predicted results are shown in table 3 the variation law of dimensionless comprehensive parameter with porosity is plotted in fig 5 along with the curves fitting these data points as can be seen from fig 5 the estimated dimensionless parameter ξ 11 shows a power law attenuation trend with the increase of pore space size thus it can explain the abnormal phenomenon that some porous structures with large pore size have weak water imbibition characteristics for the porous structures with porosity less than 10 or average pore radius smaller than 1 μm the parameter ξ 11 decreases sharply with the increase of both whereas the porosity or pore radius exceeds the above threshold the attenuation state tends to be flat it can be demonstrated that for the porous media with small pore size dense and homogeneous the composite structure parameters χ δ α and τ i e ξ 11 has important influence on their imbibition characteristics whereas for porous media with large pore structure the ξ 11 because of mutual coupling parameters χ δ α and τ has no effect on their imbibition characteristics and hence their strong or weak imbibition is only related to their pore space sizes comiti and renaud 1989 proposed a empirical relationship b2 showing the decreasing tortuosity with the increase of porosity based on the theoretical relations and experimental data cai et al 2014 found that the geometrical factor linearly decreased with increasing porosity according to theoretical relationship 21 the topological factor increases with the increase of porosity simultaneously we conclude that the dimensionless comprehensive correction parameter ξ 11 decreases with the increase of porosity by fitting the experimental data see fig 5 therefore the pore throat ratio may decrease with the increase of porosity that is with the increase of pore space the throat gradually becomes large and transforms into the pore on the contrary the pore throat gradually shrinks or even closes with the decrease of porosity for the dense and homogeneous porous media benavente et al 2015 the goodnesses of power law fitting the data points are r2 0 82467 0 85031 and 0 92201 for three kinds of relationships ξ 11 r av 0 5 ξ 11 ϕ and ξ 11 ϕ r av 0 5 respectively where the fitting goodness of ξ 11 ϕ r av 0 5 is greater than 0 9 thus it can illustrate that the feature size of pore space is the comprehensive characterization of porosity and pore size and the imbibition behavior of pore structure is determined by the feature size and other multiple geometrical factors coupling each other according to simple washburn equation the flow resistance would be smaller with the increase of porosity or pore size resulting in faster imbibition process however a lot of measured data show that there is no strong positive correlation between si characteristics parameters including sorptivity or capillary coefficients and porosity or pore size in the natural porous media roveri et al 2020 benavente et al 2002 benavente et al 2015 hammecker et al 1993 pia et al 2014 casteleyn et al 2010 by contrast our model can explain this abnormal phenomenon as shown in fig 5 the abnormal phenomenon mainly attribute to both sides namely the complicated micro pore structure mps and capillary transport hydrodynamics cth on the one hand although the increase of pore sace szie porosity or pore size can lead to the strong si perfunctorily the capillary pressure may decrease with the increase of porosity resulting in larger pore radius and contact angle bao and wang 2017 along with the prominent gravity and inertia pressure zhmud et al 2000 fries and dreyer 2008 and hence the coupling pressure effectiveness may give rise to the abnormal phenomenon on the other hand with the increase of porosity the remarkable heterogeneity and anisotropy can weaken the si cai et al 2010 cai et al 2012 and the considerable 3d topology resulting in strong 3d transport characteristics just reduce the apparent macro one dimensional si studied by us also the pore wall surface and cross section geometry become rough and irregular with the increase of porosity respectively and these remarkable geometrical characteristics may dissipate more energy benavente et al 2002 salam and wang 2022 resulting in the abnormal phenomenon in the literature cheng et al 2015 dullien et al 1977 amadu and pegg 2018 the observation method x ray ct imaging and neutron beams imaging were used to study the variation of wetting front with time in the water imbibition for different rocks sandstone limestone and grainstone the specific pore structure and hydrodynamic experimental data are listed in table 4 in which the maximum pore size is calculated by the measured permeability through the theoretical relation b3 and the dimensionless comprehensive correction parameter is inversely predicted by measured sorptivity coefficient through eq c 2 the variation law of dimensionless comprehensive parameter with porosity is plotted in fig 6 along with the linear fitting these data points fig 6 indicates that the parameter ξ 21 tends to increase with the increase of pore space size and it is different from the variation law of the parameter ξ 11 with the pore space size yu and li 2001 obtained a theoretical relation b 1 indicating that the fractal dimension increased with the increase of porosity thus substituting the β 2 d f with ϕ in eq c 1 theoretically shows that the parameter ξ 21 increases with the increase of porosity moreover the fitting results of scattered points in fig 6 show that the dimensionless comprehensive correction parameter ξ 21 may linearly increase with the increase of pore space size however a small number of experimental samples and experimental errors may cause low fitting correlations r2 less than 0 7 therefore it is necessary to increase the number of experimental samples to verify the above linear relationship it is also noted that the maximum pore size is reverse predicted from permeability and not based on measured results 3 3 parameters analysis taking the wetting phase for water its physical parameters are the same as above the pore structure parameters are as follows the average pore radius r av 0 3066 μm pore throat ratio α 2 677 average tortuosity τ av 1 1 porosity φ 0 2 wetting saturation s wf 0 9 and initial saturation s wi 0 based on average geometry model the variation laws of equilibrium state characteristics height mass and time and initial imbibition characteristics capillary and sorptivity coefficients with pore and topology geometries are plotted as shown in fig 7 a b and c taking the topological factor χ 0 1 shape factor δ 0 766 and other parameters as above the variation laws of equilibrium time and capillary coefficient versus pore throat ratio and tortuosity are plotted in fig 7 d fig 7 a and b show that the equilibrium mass or height decreases with the increase of shape and topology factors whereas the capillary or sorptivity coefficient increases with the increase of the both dimensionless parameters when the pore geometry is extremely irregular very small shape factor the influence of pore network topology on the height or mass of imbibition equilibrium is extremely sensitive as the pore geometry tends to be regular the shape factor greater than 0 1 the influence of pore structure topology on equilibrium quantities is gradually weakened however the effect of pore network topology on initial imbibition characteristics is just the opposite of the above situation fig 7 c shows that both the equilibrium height and time decrease with the increase of shape factor compared with the linearly decreasing equilibrium height the equilibrium time is more sensitive to the shape factor and tends to nonlinearly decrease with the increase of the shape factor the equilibrium time greatly decays for small shape factor and its decreasing extent is gradually weakened with the increase of the shape factor fig 7 d indicates that the capillary coefficient and equilibrium time decrease and increase with the increase of pore throat ratio as well as tortuosity respectively in the case of large pore throat the effect of tortuosity on capillary coefficient is more sensitive but with the increase of pore throat ratio its influence is gradually weakened in contrast the equilibrium time is insensitive to tortuosity for large pore throat and the influence of tortuosity enhances with the increase of pore throat ratio taking the wetting phase for organic fluid its physical parameters are as follows θ 5 ρ 0 77 g cm 3 μ 0 0031 n s m 2 and σ 0 02715 n m 1 the pore structure parameters are as follows the maximum pore radius r ma 18 μm pore throat ratio α 1 average tortuosity τ av 3 ratio of minimum to maximum pore size β 0 01 porosity φ 0 1 wetting saturation s wf 0 7 and initial saturation s wi 0 based on fractal geometry model the variation laws of equilibrium state and initial imbibition characteristics with the pore shape factor and fractal dimension are plotted in fig 8 a b and c taking the shape factor δ 0 866 fractal dimension d f 1 2 and other parameters as above the variation laws of equilibrium time and sorptivity coefficient versus pore throat ratio and tortuosity are plotted in fig 8 d fig 8 a and b show that the equilibrium height mass and sorptivity capillary coefficient increase and decrease with the increase of fractal dimension but decrease and increase with the increase of shape factor respectively the variation of the imbibition characteristics with fractal dimension is relatively gentle and does not show their drastic changing trend sudden increase or decrease with the shape factor at a turning point as mentioned above compared with the topological factor mentioned above the fractal dimension and shape factor are much less sensitive to the imbibition behavior of pore structure fig 8 c conveys that both the equilibrium mass and time show an increasing trend with the increase of fractal dimension it is found that its influence degree is weak for small fractal dimension but the influence sensitivity gradually increases with the increase of fractal dimension compared with the equilibrium mass the equilibrium time is more sensitive to fractal dimension fig 8 d depicts that the sorptivity coefficient and equilibrium time decrease and increase with the increase of tortuosity as well as pore throat ratio respectively the influence of the pore throat ratio on equilibrium time is weak for small tortuosity and its influence gradually enhances with the increase of the tortuosity the case of the sorptivity coefficient versus pore throat ratio is on the contrary based on the above analysis it is found that the tortuosity is more sensitive to the imbibition of porous media than the fractal dimension whereas its influence is weaker than the pore throat ratio according to the above comprehensive analysis one can conclude that the sensitivity of topological characteristics pore throat structure tortuosity characteristics pore geometry and fractal characteristics to the imbibition of porous media reduces successively 3 4 forward analysis the pore structure parameters are taken as follows α 2 677 χ 0 1 β 0 01 f 0 6 and ϕ 0 5 the wetting phase is water with the above mentioned physical parameters its initial s wi and wetting s wf saturation are viewed as 0 and 1 respectively the permeability k of pore structure is 2 54 10 11 m2 the respective pore shape factors δ 0 531 0 766 equilateral triangle and 0 866 square along with the other designated parameters are substituted into eq c 1 to calculate the dimensionless comprehensive correction parameters here the tortuosity and fractal dimension are calculated by eqs b 2 and b 1 respectively thus the effect of the comprehensive correction factor on the long term imbibition behavior of porous media is quantitatively studied by using the models characterized by average and fractal geometries see fig 9 where the maximum pore radius is calculated by using eq b3 4 8 for k and then the average pore radius is calculated based on theoretical relationship 20 fig 9 show that at the beginning of imbibition less than 104 s the dimensionless parameter ξ has no notable effect on the evolution characteristics of imbibition over time whereas in later imbibition greater than 104 s first of all the increasing energy consumption due to the wetting phase viscous force leads to the gradual strengthening influence of ξ on imbibition evolution then with the gradual increasing adverse effect of gravity the influence of ξ again begins to wane finally with the imbibition gradually tending to equilibrium state the influence of ξ again begins to strengthen gradually the larger the dimensionless parameter ξ is the faster the corresponding imbibition rate will be and the faster the equilibrium state will be reached in contrast for the smaller ξ although the imbibition rate is reduced the imbibition time will last longer and hence the more wetting phase can penetrate into the porous media reaching equilibrium state compared with the governing equation characterized by fractal geometry the imbibition dynamic equation based on average geometry describes a steeper evolution curve of mass versus time and it indicates that the topological characteristics of pore structure is more sensitive to long term imbibition behavior than fractal characteristics for the weaker connectivity of pore structure the imbibition process will last longer with the greater equilibrium weight taking the respective porosity ϕ 0 4 0 3 and 0 2 shape factor δ 0 866 and other parameters as above the variation laws of wetting rate with time are plotted in fig 10 the dimensionless comprehensive correction parameter is calculated by eq c 1 the tortuosity fractal dimension maximum pore radius and average pore radius are obtained in the same way as above fig 10 shows that in early stage of si less than 104 s the porosity and dimensionless comprehensive parameter have obvious effect on evolution behavior of imbibition rate with time because of capillary pressure playing a major role in capillary kinetics whereas in its later stage greater than 104 s have no notable influence on its evolution characteristics due to the increasing controlling action of gravity against capillary pressure it is just contrary the trend of curve depicted in fig 9 with the increase of porosity and dimensionless comprehensive parameter the corresponding imbibition rate enlarges compared with the kinetics equation expressed by the average geometry the dynamic equation based on fractal geometry describes generally higher and steeper evolution curve mainly because of that the pore topological characteristics is more sensitive to imbibition behavior than the pore space and fractal characteristics fig 9 shows that the influence of dimensionless comprehensive parameter on evolution law of imbibition mass over time can be roughly divided into four stages as follows the first stage no influence the second stage appearing influence the third stage weakening influence and the fourth stage strengthening influence however fig 10 depicts that the influence of ξ on the evolution law of imbibition rate over time only goes roughly two stages the first stage notable effect and the second stage no effect taking the respective porosity φ 0 6 0 5 and 0 4 for eq d1a the respective porosity φ 0 3 0 2 and 0 1 for eq d1b the shape factor δ 0 866 and other parameters as above the variation laws of wetting velocity with recovery rate are depicted as shown in fig 11 the dimensionless comprehensive correction parameter tortuosity fractal dimension maximum pore radius and average pore radius are obtained in the same way as above the length of core is taken as l t 10 cm it can be seen from fig 11 that the imbibition rate increases with the increase of reciprocal of gas recovery rate that is the recovery rate is low at initial stage of imbibition while the imbibition velocity is large the recovery rate is large at its later stage while the imbibition velocity is small in later stage of imbibition the dimensionless comprehensive parameter have no effect on the evolution law of imbibition velocity versus recovery rate while in its early stage have significant effect on evolution process under the same recovery rate the larger the porosity and dimensionless comprehensive parameter are the larger the imbibition velocity in particular the curves described by equation based on fractal geometry suffer from significantly stronger influence of the both parameters than the equation based on average geometry the curves described by relationship between recovery rate and wetting velocity based on fractal geometry are not all lower than that expressed by average geometry as a whole whereas existing in overlapping and crossover phenomenon among them for instance although the porosity ϕ 0 3 is smaller than ϕ 0 5 the curve described by equation characterized by fractal geometry is higher than that expressed by average geometry which is caused by dimensionless parameters ξ 21 greater ξ 11 similarly although the porosity ϕ 0 2 smaller than 0 4 the curves described through both methods is basically close to each other therefore one expects that the variation trend of initial imbibition velocity with recovery rate is sensitive to both the porosity and dimensionless comprehensive parameter the underground geotechnical enginneering often involves the multi phase and multi field coupling actions the research on si is more practical in complex environment for instance the three phase system including water oil and gas is widely found in secondary enhanced oil recovery afzali et al 2020 what s more the deep enivronment involving the mining sequestration of carbon dioxide or nuclear waste and oil or gas exploitation is dramatically affected by temperature stress chemical and seepage fields the fracture with various scales is also coupled in other fields particularly the srtree capillary coupling phenomenon has aroused widespread interest in oil recovery when naturally fractured carbonate reservoirs been located in high stress environment haghi et al 2018 therefore it is necessary and significative to consider the pore deformation induced by stress into the proposed model as a tentative work the macroscopic and microscopic 3d cases are universal in practical activity ferer et al 1996 the underground engineering usually has complex boundary conditions reuslting in macroscopic simultaneous transport along all three directions rangel german and kovscek 2002 particularly clearly revealing the microscopic transport mechanism is distinctly important for increasing oil recovery rates and controling gas reservoir damage zacharoudiou and boek 2016 qin et al 2021 the current model mainly focuses on the influence of various microscopic geometry factors on a one dimensional si consequently we will try and figure out how the current model is implemented to the 3d cases based on three sets of orthogonal capillary bundles 4 conclusions based on average and fractal geometries a general long term si model which is closer to the real porous media is established by considering multiple geometric factors of pore structure comprehensively according to the model the theoretical relationship between topological factor of the pore network and area fractal dimension of the pores is derived and a more all round expression of the dimensionless comprehensive correction parameter is proposed the prediction results of our model are quantitatively compared with the experimental results as well as the prediction values by existing classical models meanwhile the sensitivity of geometric parameters to the initial and steady imbibition characteristics relationship between dimensionless comprehensive parameter and porosity and influence of comprehensive parameter on long term imbibition evolution are analyzed the remarkable conclusions are as follows 1 the prediction results by two new models are in good agreement with the experimental results and our models with better predicted accuracy can unify the existing classical models it is effective to ignore the gravity for short term imbibition in porous media with small pore size and lambert approximation solution of the implicit equations is basically consistent with their numerical solution thus showing the effectiveness of the approximation solution because of not all the microscopic pore size distributions having fractal characteristics for porous media the equation characterized by the average geometry is more practical than that expressed by the fractal geometry 2 the dimensionless comprehensive parameter by average geometry decreases with increasing porosity satisfying the quantitative decaying relationship in power law means it conveys that the comprehensive parameter presents the severe attenuation and remain basically unchanged with its increasing for the porosity smaller and greater than 10 respectively the pore throat ratio has a tendency to decrease with increasing porosity in other words the throat channel gradually turns into pore cavity with non significant pore throat characteristics for large porosity the dimensionless comprehensive parameter by fractal geometry seems to present a linear increasing tendency with the increase of porosity 3 the connectivity of pore structure weakens with the increase of its heterogeneity and strengthens with the increase of porosity for the pore structure characterized by weaker connectivity more irregular pore shape and stronger heterogeneity its initial imbibition is weaker whereas the corresponding imbibition time is longer along with the imbibed more wetting phase the equilibrium time is related to the pore throat ratio and tortuosity but which the equilibrium mass or height has nothing to do with the shape and topology factors are more sensitive to the equilibrium time than the equilibrium mass or height the sensitivity of topological characteristics pore throat structure tortuous characteristics pore geometry and fractal characteristics to the imbibition behavior of porous media reduces in turn 4 the influence of the dimensionless comprehensive parameter on the long term evolution process of imbibition weight versus time is divided into four stages the first stage initially no effect by capillary force controlling the second stage early gradually appearing effect governed by viscous resistance the third stage later gradually weakening effect mastered by gravity head and the fourth stage enhanced effect at equilibrium state the influence of the comprehensive parameter on the long term evolution process of the imbibition velocity versus time and recovery rate can be divided into two stages significant and no influence in initial and later imbibition respectively compared with the fractal characteristics the topological characteristics of pore structure is more sensitive to the evolution process of imbibition mass and velocity versus time both the porosity and dimensionless comprehensive parameter have important effects on the evolution process of imbibition velocity with recovery rate

notable pore throat characteristics in the microscopic pore structure of porous media and corresponding investigators simplified the feature into different geometric forms to construct equivalent models geistlinger and mohammadian 2015 valvatne and blunt 2004 joekar niasar et al 2010 leventis et al 2000 generated a three dimension lattice pore network by interconnection of spheres pores and cylinders throats and developed a imbibition numerical model of cement mortar pore structure the similar equivalent geometric models are applied in other researches consequently according to the existing results the compact porous structure is also simplified into one dimensional non uniform capillary bundles as shown in fig 1a for our work the actual penetration velocity is low for the dense porous media and the cross section size of capillary gradually transforms in pore element so the local energy loss caused by size change can be ignored hammecker and jeannette 1994 believed that the volumetric flow rate depended on transverse size of throat channel in capillary with pore throat structure and hence the volume flow rate of a single capillary in fig 1a is expressed as a1 q r π 8 δ p l s r 4 μ at a certain pressure difference where q r is the volume flow rate δ p is the pressure difference l s is the straight length of capillary r is the radius of pore throat μ is the dynamic viscosity coefficient introducing the definition of pore throat ratio α r r into eq a 1 yields a2 q r q r α q r π 8 α 4 δ p l s r 4 μ where r is the equivalent spherical radius of pore cavity the above equations are derived from the capillary with circular cross section and hence do not conform to real pore geometry for this applying the shape factor of irregular cross section benavente et al 2002 cai et al 2014 qin and van brummelen 2019 yang et al 2020 to correct eq a 2 results in a3 q r π δ 4 8 α 4 δ p l s r 4 μ where δ is the shape factor which is defined as the ratio of hydraulic diameter of irregular section to that of equivalent circular section the actual pore channels are convoluted as shown in fig 1c therefore further amendment of eq a 3 by using the tortuosity factor cai et al 2012 derives the following formula a4 q r π δ 4 8 α 4 δ p τ l s r 4 μ where τ is tortuosity factor which is defined as the ratio of tortuous to straight length for a capillary introducing the quasi static laplace young l y equation p c 2 σ cos θ δ r the characteristic dimension of capillary as shown in fig 1a is pore radius r hammecker et al 1993 jointly corrected by shape factor and substituting the δ p p c ρ g l si into eq a 4 one can obtain a5 q ti r π δ 4 r i 4 8 α 4 τ i μ 1 l si 2 σ cos θ δ r i ρ g l si where q ti r is the volume flow rate of i th convoluted capillary and the

moreover the fixed value τ av 3 is also used here benavente et al 2002 dullien et al 1977 the maximum pore diameter λ max can be obtained by cai et al 2010 b3a λ max d s 4 2 ϕ 1 ϕ ϕ 1 ϕ π 4 1 ϕ 1 b3b

3351,field and numerical studies suggest that baseflow is composed of waters from a spectrum of groundwater flow paths termed the groundwater flow system gwfs from shallow hillslope contributions to watershed scale deep circulation originating in headwaters and discharging into lowland rivers here we explore the evolution of the gwfs under prolonged droughts to understand its dynamics and multiscale nature and to elucidate its role in baseflow generation and recession at the watershed scale we consider three drought scenarios of varying severity and simulate groundwater flow in a 2 d cross section of an idealized watershed with deep permeable bedrock tracking the evolution of flow paths baseflow and residence times during the recession process we find that baseflow generation at different drainage stages and within different subwatersheds is influenced distinctly by flow paths of different scales depending on the relative strength of the flow paths and the position of the subwatersheds relative to the recharge discharge zones of the deeper watershed scale groundwater circulation despite having the same local relief geology and climate baseflow from each subwatershed has a distinct recession behavior and time dependent residence time distribution also the hydraulic and transport characteristics of baseflow generation co evolve and are strongly affected by the connection state of the water table to subwatersheds these findings suggest that asynchrony and dissimilarity of baseflow generation from hillslopes under the impact of the watershed scale groundwater flow and interactions with local scale and intermediate scale groundwater flow must be taken into account when interpreting baseflow recession data and building conceptual baseflow models at the watershed scale keywords baseflow groundwater flow system deep groundwater mountainous watersheds 1 introduction baseflow supplied by groundwater discharge to surface water bodies is a critical streamflow component and acts as a nexus connecting subsurface and surface hydrological geochemical and ecological environments beck et al 2013 fan et al 2013 yao et al 2017 berghuijs et al 2016 jasechko et al 2016 trancoso et al 2017 sabo et al 2016 maher and chamberlain 2014 for example baseflow contributes to more than 50 of mean annual streamflow in more than 50 of global land area beck

generation process is not only important for hydrological purposes such as streamflow prediction and drought mitigation but it is also important for understanding and simulating geophysical geochemical ecological and environmental processes in which the baseflow generation process is actively involved baseflow generation is often conceptualized as discharge from groundwater stored in an unconfined aquifer resting on a horizontal or inclined impermeable bedrock see e g troch et al 2013 for a review this hillslope centric conceptualization is commonly modelled by the boussinesq equation or its variants most often in cross section see e g rupp and selker 2006 for a review and is widely used to understand baseflow recession and its controlling factors estimate watershed geomorphic and hydrogeologic parameters and conceptualize watershed rainfall runoff processes this hillslope centric conceptualization greatly simplifies real world landscape conditions such as complex topography and geology zecharias and brutsaert 1988 tague and grant 2004 mcguire et al 2005 gleeson and manning 2008 yao et al 2017 rapp et al 2020 condon et al 2020 and it cannot represent hydrological processes occurring at multiple spatial scales beyond that of hillslopes it cannot be used to explain watershed scale emergent baseflow generation behavior with active contribution from

connection between dynamically active drainage density and baseflow recession characteristics at the watershed scale biswal and marani 2010 mutzner et al 2013 ghosh et al 2016 prancevic and kirchner

of the multiscale gwfs especially inter subwatershed subsurface flow paths in watershed hydrology is gaining increasing attention from the research community and has been shown to influence watershed scale streamflow generation and solute transport land surface processes and climate modeling ameli et al 2018 fan et al 2019 frisbee et al 2011 frisbee et al 2017 krakauer et al 2014 peralta tapia et al 2015 despite some distinct and interesting features of potential contribution of multiple scale gwfs to baseflow generation revealed by a few field studies e g ameli et al 2018 frisbee et al 2011 peralta tapia et al 2015 we lack a comprehensive understanding on how baseflow and flow paths of multiple scales in the gwfs evolve during the dry season or under a long term drought this lack of understanding is partly due to the scarcity of distributed observations on subsurface hydrological processes and the traditional disregard of the deep flow paths of the gwfs in watershed hydrology studies because of this lack of understanding the role of the dynamics of the multiscale gwfs is seldom considered in baseflow hydrograph analysis and in parameterizing baseflow component in conceptual hydrological models e g clark et al 2016 fan et al 2019 piovano et al 2020 in order to improve the conceptualization and parsimonious modeling of baseflow generation in watersheds influenced by multiscale gwfss it s important to clarify the distinct roles of the different scale flow components of the gwfs in baseflow generation in this study we analyze baseflow generation and the coevolution and roles of flow paths of different scales in the gwfs under prescribed long term droughts in a 2 d vertical cross section of an idealized high order watershed fig 1 a the cross section of the idealized watershed is characterized by a sinusoidal topography with a linear regional slope and a homogeneous deep permeable bedrock which simplifies the bedrock permeability depth profile and the shallow highly permeable soil and weathered bedrock zone that could exist in some but not all natural watersheds this simple conceptualization dramatically extends the hillslope model to include deep groundwater we hypothesize that baseflow generation and recession behaviour are significantly and distinctly affected by the dynamics and interactions of flow paths at scales larger than that of typical riparian zones and hillslopes we test our hypothesis by exploring the time varying dynamics of both baseflow generation and the multiscale gwfs and the relationships between them specifically we focus on the relationship between baseflow discharge and groundwater storage and the relationship between baseflow residence time and groundwater age which are the two fundamental constitutive relationships widely used in parsimonious lumped watershed streamflow generation and solute transport modeling respectively our simple 2d conceptualization which preserves the ideas of neighboring subwatersheds allows us to address the essence of our research questions without the additional complexity of a stream network we show that even with simple topographic and hydrogeologic settings complex and scale dependent baseflow dynamics emerge due to the changing effects of the multiscale gwfs on baseflow generation in different subwatersheds and during the different stages of prolonged droughts this study provides mechanistic and conceptual understanding of watershed scale baseflow generation from the multiscale gwfs the additional complexity introduced by the stream network pattern can be addressed in future studies it is not expected to change the crux of our new findings 2 methods 2 1 prescribed long term droughts as simple forcings to reveal the effects of prolonged droughts we start with a fully saturated steady state gwfs where the water table coincides with the topography e g a wet climate and or low conductivity permeable media and compute the amount and spatial distribution of recharge along the top boundary the initial flow system can be created by applying a relatively large spatially uniform recharge to raise the water table to the land surface over the entire model domain to represent a drought we change the boundary to one with a prescribed uniform potential recharge rate we ignore the effect of topography or vegetation on recharge that is lower than the average recharge rate for the fully saturated case we use a spatially constant recharge rate of zero to represent a hypothetical extreme drought we also use two nonzero reduced uniform potential recharge rates to represent droughts of less severity these rates are equal to one twentieth 14 8 mm yr and one half 148 0 mm yr of the spatially averaged recharge rate found for the pre drought fully saturated case 295 5 mm yr the 295 5 mm yr recharge rate for the pre drought fully saturated case is reasonable and exists in natural bedrock watersheds e g the santa ynez mountains of southern california the two nonzero reduced recharge rates 14 8 mm yr and 148 0 mm yr represent moderate and mild droughts respectively the three droughts with 0 14 8 mm yr and 148 0 mm yr recharge rates allow the system to reach three different representative final equilibrium states section 3 note that at fully saturated locations where the water table coincides with the land surface part or all applied potential recharge is rejected by the system creating a spatially non uniform distribution of net recharge accepted by the system for the initial flow field and the flow field during drainage under the moderate and mild drought scenarios this type of simple forcing is used for three reasons 1 this system configuration is representative of real situations when a watershed in a humid region experiences a prolonged drought haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 gleeson and manning 2008 condon and maxwell 2015 2 different stages of the long term drainage represent average drainage conditions of watersheds in different climate regions dai et al 2021 3 the emphasis of this study is on the role of the dynamical gwfs in baseflow generation at multiple spatial scales and the control of topographic structure even though using more complex recharge forcing with spatial temporal variations in intensity duration and intermittency can add an additional level of complexity to stimulate new insights into the system response it can also obscure the role of topography and the dynamical gwfs in baseflow generation system response under more complex recharge conditions with the interactive effect of topographic structure bears its own importance and can be explored in a separate study 2 2 model domain configuration groundwater flow and transport modeling in cross sectional domains has been and is widely used to study fluxes and age distributions in gwfss in particular 2 d simplified representations are parsimonious tools that allow us to gain insights into the role of key topographic and geologic features on the flow and transport characteristics in gwfss e g tóth 1963 freeze and witherspoon 1966 tóth 2009 cardenas and jiang 2010 gomez and wilson 2013 welch and allen 2014 gleeson et al 2016 in this study groundwater flow and transport are simulated in a 2 d vertical cross section of an idealized watershed to investigate the dynamics of baseflow and a gwfs during prolonged droughts the topography of the top boundary and land surface of the 2 d cross section is represented by 1 z s x z 0 a 0 m 1 x a 0 sin 2 π λ x 3 π 2 where z 0 determines the depth l of the basin below the lowest point of land surface m 1 represents the watershed scale topographic slope and a 0 and λ represent the amplitude l and wavelength l of the sinusoidal local relief respectively the parameter values used in this study are z 0 1000 m m 1 0 02 a 0 60 m λ 1500 m and x 0 l x with l x 6760 m we also varied most of these geometric parameters in sensitivity analyses which for brevity we haven t included here they don t change the core of our findings this 2 d domain can be viewed as a transverse cross section of a 3 d watershed see e g fig 1 in cardenas 2007 for an illustration the regions between neighbouring peaks are designated as subwatersheds and are numbered 1 5 from high elevation upstream to low elevation downstream fig 1a for our 2 d domain the ratio of the linear regional topographic rise to the local topographic amplitude is m 1 l x a 0 2 25 and the ratio of the width of the domain to the local topographic wavelength is l x λ 4 5 these dimensionless ratios measure the topographic structure and relative strengths of the local and the regional scale groundwater flow paths and can be used in future studies on the control of topographic structure on baseflow generation the 2d tothian conceptualization has played an unprecedented role in improving our understanding of multiscale gwfss anderson 2008 but to the best of our knowledge it has never been used to study the dynamics of watershed scale baseflow generation e g discharge sensitivity and transient residence time distribution and its relationship to multiscale gwfss as we do in this paper nor have more complex 3d conceptualizations ones that recognize deep groundwater attempted to address this topic 2 3 groundwater flow and baseflow simulation we use the finite difference code modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 harbaugh 2005 to simulate saturated groundwater flow eq 2 below in the 2d model domain fig 1b while accounting for gravity drainage from the vadose zone through the phreatic surface boundary condition eq 5 below bear 1972 the spatiotemporal variation of the phreatic surface i e the water table is unknown and is estimated as part of the numerical non linear solution vadose zone capillary effects are negligible in this drainage situation as the vertical scale of the 2d saturated flow 10s to 100s of meters is much larger than the length scale of capillary forces dagan and kroszynski 1973 dagan 1989 e g gardner s capillary length parameter which ranges from 0 1 to 5 m in typical permeable geological media this is why for example groundwater well tests in phreatic aquifers almost always ignore the effects of capillary forces on delayed yield tartakovsky and neuman 2007 we also neglect compressibility effects as the phreatic surface drops much too slowly over time for compressibility to have any effect storage depletion is entirely due to draining the porous media specific yield at the phreatic surface eq 5 below we assume that the effective porosity for groundwater flow and the specific yield are equal to the porous media porosity we track the evolution and location of the hydraulic head at the top layer to define fluxes across the land surface specifically if the hydraulic head at the top layer is higher than or equal to the land surface elevation we use a drain boundary condition to simulate head dependent drainage flux eq 4 which becomes stream baseflow and is removed from the model this is also a seepage face boundary condition the drain elevation is set to be land surface elevation the drain flux baseflow is calculated as the drain conductance c d times the difference between top layer hydraulic head and the drain elevation eq 4 on the other hand if the hydraulic head at the top layer is lower than the land surface we impose a phreatic surface boundary with prescribed recharge eq 5 bear 1972 as the water table drops during the mild and moderate droughts the discharge area decreases and the recharge area and therefore the total recharge increases no flow boundary conditions are assumed at the lateral and bottom boundaries eq 6 under these assumptions the mathematical statement for flow is given by 2 k h 0

sandstones e g dingman 2015 but to account for other possible values our results are presented dimensionlessly see below the drain conductance is high indicating little surface resistance e g a clogged streambed to discharging groundwater the recharge r r z has rates r 14 8 or 148 0 mm yr for the moderate and mild drought scenarios respectively these rates are typical of relatively dry to somewhat more humid bedrock systems respectively during the drainage the water table is defined as the phreatic surface where the pressure head is zero i e places where the hydraulic head equals elevation head or x h x z and it is described by the non linear kinematic boundary condition in eq 5 which is based on the continuity of water flux across the phreatic surface along the normal vector bear 1972 dagan 1989 modflow nwt treats cells above the water table as dry cells water content θ 0 and cells below the water table as fully saturated θ θ s where θ s is saturated water content and is assumed to be equal to porosity flux out of the model domain across the drain boundary is lumped at each time step for each subwatershed fig 1a and for the entire domain to get the baseflow discharge the initial condition i e initial hydraulic head for the drainage h 0 x is taken as the solution of the steady state fully saturated groundwater flow problem eq 7 with land surface elevation as a specified hydraulic head top boundary condition eq 8 with no flow lateral and bottom boundary conditions eq 9 as represented by the following mathematical statement 7 k h 0 0 x ω 8 h 0 x y z z s x y z s x y x y ω 1 9 n k h 0 0 x ω 2 ω 3 where ω 1 is the entire top boundary of the model domain the recharge rate r x at the land surface needed to sustain the steady state groundwater flow field is calculated at the constant head boundary ω 1 based on the simulated hydraulic head for the case of a hypothetical long term extreme drought represented by zero recharge top boundary condition r 0

case of a less severe drought represented by a reduced non zero recharge top boundary condition the gwfs asymptotically approaches a steady state with water table as a subdued imitation of the land surface the mathematical statement for this final steady state groundwater flow field can be derived from the mathematical statement of the transient drainage problem eqs 2 6 by removing the initial condition eq 3 from the original mathematical statement and letting h t 0 in eq 5 thus the groundwater flow field during drainage under a non zero reduced recharge approaches the solution of the

scenarios the water table disconnects sequentially from the subwatersheds we define a drainage stage as the drainage time period between two consecutive disconnections of water table from the land surface of subwatersheds critical differences of drainage behavior occur when the water table is connected to a different number of subwatersheds our three drought scenarios are essentially designed to have different numbers of subwatersheds attached to the water table as the system approaches a final steady state our extreme moderate and mild drought scenarios lead to water table disconnection from all two and no subwatersheds respectively as the system approaches final steady state section 3 1 1 2 4 spatial and temporal discretization the domain fig 1a is discretized into cuboid cells with dimensions in the horizontal i e x and y directions δ x δ y 10 m this results in 676 columns of cells in the x direction and one row of cells in the y direction the vertical i e z direction is discretized into 500 layers which are indexed by integers k 0 to 499 from the top to the bottom the thickness of the first layer k 0 is set to be 0 5 m uniformly over the entire domain the rest of the layers are grouped into shallow layers k 1 to 200 intermediate layers k 201 to 300 and deep layers k 301 to 499 zones for each location x y layer thickness is constant within each of the shallow intermediate and deep zones and the ratio of layer thicknesses of the three zones is 1 2 4 because the total thickness of the domain varies at different x y locations the layer thickness within each zone also varies at different x y locations the layer thicknesses within the three zones are in the ranges 0 84 1 05 m 1 67 2 10 m and 3 34 4 20 m we drain the domain for 1 million days 2 738 years to study the baseflow generation behavior during the full range of watershed storage condition from fully saturated to nearly zero drainable storage for the case of an extreme drought with zero recharge at the end of the simulation the drainable storage reaches 0 04 the initial drainable storage for the case of a reduced non zero recharge running the model 1 million days ensures the final flow field to be very close to the steady state flow field described by eqs 10 13 a total of 1 000 time steps are used and the time step duration changes according to a geometric progression harbaugh 2005 a time step multiplier which is the ratio of the duration of each time step to that of the preceding time step equal to 1 011 is used the size of the time steps ranges from 0 19 day at the beginning of the drainage process to 10 880 days at the end of the simulation 2 5 estimation of groundwater age and residence time distributions groundwater age is the time it takes for a particular water parcel to flow from the water table at its recharge location to the location within the aquifer where it is sampled physically or studied theoretically kazemi et al 2006 groundwater residence time is the time it takes for a water parcel to travel from the recharge area to the discharge area e g streams springs wells groundwater discharge into streams provides stream baseflow baseflow residence time typically called travel or transit time by the surface water hydrology community they often use the term residence time to represent something similar to the groundwater community s age is defined as the time for a water parcel to travel from its entrance into the watershed as recharge to its discharge into the streams as baseflow so by definition groundwater residence time equals baseflow residence time groundwater age of a water parcel in storage is calculated using forward particle tracking the particle tracking is started for the fully saturated steady state groundwater flow eqs 7 9 3 10 6 days 8 214 years before the beginning of the drainage i e a spin up phase to fill up the domain with particles and run afterwards for 1 10 6 days 2 738 years in the transient flow field induced by the drainage eqs 2 6 a tracking time duration of 3 10 6 days in the initial fully saturated steady state groundwater flow is close to the longest residence time of the steady state flow field that can be identified with the largest spatial density of particles that our computational capacity can support support information text s1 and fig s1 in the forward tracking particles are released during the progression of the simulation and each particle is used to represent a volume of about v p 0 2 m3 recharge assuming a 10 m width for the cross section in the y direction this is equivalent to about 1 2 million particles to fill the model domain the choice of v p 0 2 m3 is a trade off between computational capacity and achieving smooth enough baseflow residence time distributions rtds the actual recharge volume represented by each particle is adjusted to ensure that an integer number of particles are released during each modflow time step text s2 presents the details of the particle releasing strategy a total number of 82 004 388 and 92 084 407 particles are used for the simulations under the extreme and mild drought scenarios respectively particle tracking is performed using modpath version 6 pollock 2012 modpath tracks numerical particles in the groundwater flow field using a semi analytical tracking algorithm particle velocities across cell faces are calculated using darcy s law based on hydraulic heads from the solution to the groundwater flow problem section 2 3 and an effective porosity ϕ 0 03 a bilinear interpolation is used to calculate particle velocity within each cell and analytical formulas are derived for the particle travel time and exit location in each cell only advective transport is simulated by the particle tracking and dispersion and reaction are ignored the readers are referred to pollock 2012 for more details about the algorithm the pre and post processing for modflow and modpath modeling are assisted by the python package flopy bakker et al 2016 the groundwater age distribution and groundwater residence time distribution rtd are calculated for any time of interest as the probability distribution of groundwater age and groundwater residence time associated with particles with the probability of particle age proportional to the volume of recharge represented by the particle then we can get 14 s pt τ t t pid ω s τ t t pt v pid 15 s pt t pid ω s t pt v pid and 16 q pt τ t t pid ω q τ t t pt v pid 17 q pt t pid ω q t pt v pid where v pid is the water volume associated with the particle numbered pid s pt τ t t is the total volume l3 of water parcels associated with particles in storage with age less than t at time t s pt t is the total volume l3 of water parcels associated with all particles in storage at time t q pt τ t t is the total volume of water parcels associated with particles with residence time less than t and exiting some discharge region of interest per unit time l3 t 1 at time t q pt t is the total volume of water parcels associated with all particles exiting the discharge region of interest per unit time l3 t 1 at time t ω s τ t t pt is the index set of particles in storage and with age less than t at time t ω s t pt is the index set of all particles in storage at time t ω q τ t t pt is the index set of particles with residence time less than t and exiting some discharge region of interest in ω 1 out ω q t pt is the index set of all particles exiting the discharge region of interest in ω 1 out then the groundwater age distribution and groundwater rtd in the form of cumulative distribution function at any time t can be estimated as 18 p s t t s pt τ t t s pt t 19 p q t t q pt τ t t q pt t theoretically eqs 16 17 and 19 can be used to calculate baseflow rtd at any time instant t practically due to the discrete nature of the solution technique and the limit on the number of particles set by the computational capacity the number of particles exiting the domain at any time instant t can be small and the calculated baseflow rtd can be coarse so the baseflow rtds presented later in figs 5 7 are calculated in time intervals selected using the strategy documented in text s3 2 6 storage selection function storage selection sas function relates the age distribution of storage within and the rtd of flux out of a watershed it s used as a closure relationship in lumped watershed scale modeling of conservative solute transport and can be interpreted in terms of a watershed s preference for discharging water of different ages three slightly different but closely related formulations of sas function exist in the literature botter et al 2011 van der velde et al 2012 harman 2015 in this paper we use the concept of absolute storage selection asas function botter et al 2011 in our description of the solute retention mixing and releasing behavior of the multiscale gwfs in the context of our paper the asas function at any time t can be calculated as the quotient between the probability density functions of the residence time of baseflow and the age of groundwater in storage 20 ω q t t p q t t p s t t dp q t t dt dp s t t dt where p q t t and p s t t are the probability density functions of baseflow residence time and groundwater age respectively 2 7 flushing intensity flushing intensity zlotnik et al 2011 gomez velez et al 2014 is an integrated measure of the capacity of the groundwater flow field to transport water mass by advection at different depths and is defined by 21 f z 1 s s q x 2 x q y 2 x q z 2 x ds where z is depth below land surface l q x q y q z are components of the darcy flux l t s is the area of the layer over which the magnitude of flux is integrated l2 flushing intensity provides a quantitative measure of the groundwater flow field strength at different depths we compare flushing intensity at different time instants of the drainage to indicate the change of the relative strength of the groundwater flow cells of different scales at different depths fig s4 2 8 discharge sensitivity analysis assuming no water flow across the lateral boundaries of a watershed water balance of the watershed can be described as 22 ds dt p et q where s is storage l3 t is time t p is precipitation l3 t et is evapotranspiration l3 t and q is discharge l3 t from the watershed outlet the discharge sensitivity 23 g q dq ds is a lumped measure of the relationship between s within and q out of a watershed which are two fundamental and interactively related components of water balance of a watershed g q is controlled by watershed landscape conditions such as topography and hydrogeology e g brutsaert and nieber 1977 zecharias and brutsaert 1988 zecharias and brutsaert 1988 biswal and marani 2010 mutzner et al 2013 berghuijs et al 2016 it is a characteristic function of watersheds and can serve as a closure relationship to solve a watershed scale water balance equation for lumped rainfall runoff modeling e g kirchner 2009 a conceptual explanation of discharge sensitivity can be found in text s4 for readers who are not familiar with this concept while calculating g q eq 22 from model output at discrete time steps the change of discharge and storage between two consecutive time steps can be approximated as dq q t δ t q t and ds s t δ t s t respectively since the 2 d cross sectional domain ω used in this study fig 1a can be viewed as half of a transverse cross section of a 3 d basin fig 1 cardenas 2007 then subwatershed 5 only captures half of the groundwater flow draining into the main stream for this reason the discharge from subwatershed 5 q 5 and the drainable storage of the model domain s are both doubled before discharge sensitivity analysis so the discharge sensitivity for subwatersheds and the entire domain as a function of twice the total discharge from the entire domain ω are calculated in this study as 24 g i q t dq i d 2 s 1 2 dq i ds i 1 2 3 4 25 g 5 q t d 2 q 5 d 2 s dq 5 ds 26 g q t d 2 i 1 5 q i d 2 s i 1 5 dq i ds where q i i 1 2 3 4 5 represent baseflow discharge from different subwatershed areas shown in fig 1a q t 2 i 1 5 q i denotes twice the discharge from the entire model domain ω s denotes the drainable storage within ω fig 1a 2 9 nondimensionalization and scaling the dimensionless results presented in section 3 are obtained by dividing variables by their corresponding characteristic values the total discharge q 0 54 7 m3 day and the total drainable storage s 0 2 6 10 5 m3 i e the total pore volume in the domain above the lowest drainage point for the entire domain ω of the fully saturated steady state model eqs 7 9 are used to calculate the characteristic values for discharge q c storage s c and time t c following the consideration of domain symmetry in the last paragraph of section 2 8 we use q c 2 q 0 and s c 2 s 0 the fully saturated steady state turnover time of the total drainable storage s 0 q 0 is used as the characteristic time scale t c 4 782 days this time scale is used to non dimensionalize drainage time baseflow residence time and groundwater age the dimensionless discharge storage and time are then calculated as q q q c s s s c and t t t c respectively dimensionless discharge sensitivity is calculated as g i q t dq i d 2 s d q i q c d 2 s s c t c dq i d 2 s t c g i q t for i 1 2 3 4 and g 5 q t d 2 q 5 d 2 s d 2 q 5 q c d 2 s s c t c dq 5 ds t c g 5 q t we choose the wavelength λ and half the amplitude a 0 2 of the local topographic relief as characteristic values for the length scale and hydraulic head respectively the value of hydraulic conductivity k is selected to be the characteristic value for specific discharge darcy velocity k λ is used as the characteristic value for the stream function the dimensionless results presented below apply to other property values and recharge rates in addition to those given above to do so the spatial geometry must remain the same the values of k r c d and ϕ can change but they must change together so that their relative ratios remain the same 3 results and discussion 3 1 baseflow from multiscale groundwater flow system in this subsection we analyze the baseflow recession characterized by discharge and discharge sensitivity and the evolution of the groundwater flow field including the changing shape and position of the water table and the reorganization of the gwfs characterized by hydraulic head and streamlines for the three drought scenarios we show that the changes in the baseflow recession behavior is closely related to the evolution of the gwfs and that the flow paths of different scales play different roles in baseflow generation 3 1 1 evolution of multiscale groundwater flow system the evolution of the gwfs is characterized by the changing shape of the water table the disconnections of the water table from subwatersheds i e when the water table beneath a subwatershed completely drops below the land surface and the reorganization of the flow field an animation of the drainage process is provided in the supporting information movie s1 illustrating the sequential disconnection of the water table from subwatersheds 1 to 4 under the extreme drought scenario at the beginning of the drainage the water table closely follows the topography and has local and watershed scale relief mimicing that of the land surface topography fig 2 a the gwfs can be subdivided into different flow cells first the local scale flow cells are delineated by streamlines connecting hills and neighbouring valleys second the intermediate scale flow cells are delineated by streamlines connecting upstream hills and downstream valleys third the watershed scale flow cell carries flow from the highest hill to the mainstream as the drainage progresses the water table drops and flattens and the penetration depth of the local scale flow cells decreases figs 2 s2 and s3 respectively for the extreme moderate and mild droughts note that to make it easier to read the paper when figs s2 and s3 are cross referenced in company with fig 2 it s not mandatory for the readers to look at figs s2 and s3 in these cases fig 2 is sufficient to support our discussion with figs s2 and s3 providing additional examples and evidence the flushing intensity of the shallow groundwater flow field decreases faster than does the deeper intensity fig s4b indicating that the flow field becomes more controlled by the deep watershed scale flow component which is driven by the watershed scale water table slope also notice that the groundwater subwatershed divides are biased towards the upstream right side of the hills due to the influence of the watershed scale water table slope figs 2 s2 and s3 the groundwater watershed divides also migrate further to the upstream right side of the hills as the drainage progresses this means that groundwater contributing to baseflow can cross surface drainage divides and the sources can evolve during a baseflow recession event this challenges the single hillslope conceptualization widely used to study baseflow recession behavior e g troch et al 2013 the evolution of the groundwater flow field is also characterized by the disappearance of the local flow cells and the merging of the local groundwater flow field into the deeper watershed scale groundwater flow field e g notice the change of the local groundwater flow field near the drainage area of subwatershed 1 shown in figs 2c and 2d s2c and s2d as is discussed in the following subsections these features of the gwfs evolution explain features in baseflow recession behavior and the evolution of its rtd 3 1 2 similar dissimilar baseflow recession behavior from different subwatersheds the decreasing pattern of subwatershed discharge q i t and the magnitude of discharge sensitivity g i q t i 1 2 5 for subwatersheds 1 5 are very similar for different subwatersheds during drainage stage i which takes place before subwatershed 1 dries up figs 3 s5 and s6 despite differences in the rate of recharge during the drought the similarity of g i q t is a result of the similar hydraulic response of local subwatershed scale flow cells to the drought during this early stage of the drainage this is revealed by the similar spatial patterns of hydraulic head contours and instantaneous streamlines near the discharge regions of subwatersheds 1 5 figs 2a and 2b s2a and s2b s3 at any time instant the discharge discharge sensitivity and the change of water table shape are determined by the instantaneous shape of the water table and the topography where the water table remains attached to the land surface eqs 4 and 5 the similar patterns of the local scale flow cells can be attributed to the similar undulations of the local water table which is a subdued imitation of the local topographic relief figs 2a and 2b s2a and s2b s3 this indicates the dominant control of local landscape and groundwater flow field on baseflow discharge dynamics during the early stage of recession for drainage under the extreme drought scenario after the disconnection of water table from subwatershed 2 at the end of drainage stage ii the discharge sensitivity g i q t i 3 4 5 for the subwatersheds start to deviate more from each other fig 3d complex shapes for g 4 q t and g 5 q t emerge after subwatershed 3 dries up at the end of drainage stage iii similar evolution patterns of g i q t occur during drainage stages ii and iii under the moderate drought figs 3e and s6 additionally the deviation of g i q t i 1 2 3 4 5 from each other becomes more dramatic as the watershed scale topographic slope m 1 increases not shown in a domain with relatively gentle watershed scale topographic slope the local scale flow cells during the early stage of the drainage are driven more by local water table undulations which mimic local topographic relief figs 2a and 2b s2a and s2b s3 and are less influenced by the watershed scale water table slope this leads to similar discharge processes from different subwatersheds as discussed in the paragraph above however at later stages of the drainage figs 2c 2o s2c s2i or for watersheds with relatively large watershed scale topographic slope not shown the gwfs is influenced more by the watershed scale water table slope fig s4b in this situation baseflow generation becomes scale dependent and distinct recession behaviors occur for upstream and downstream subwatersheds this is because despite the potentially similar local water table undulations and local flow cells drainage locations of upstream and downstream subwatersheds tap different positions e g downwelling and upwelling flow regions of the deeper watershed scale groundwater flow field and thus have different discharge patterns after the disconnection of water table from subwatershed 4 under the extreme drought the discharge sensitivity of subwatershed 5 stays nearly constant as discharge further decreases and mimics the discharge recession behavior of a linear reservoir stage v in fig 3d in fact during this period of the drainage the water table has little local undulation and the groundwater flow is primarily driven by the essentially horizontal hydraulic head gradient induced by the large scale remnant watershed scale water table slope figs 2m 2o s4 the groundwater flow during this period can be approximately described by a linearized dupuit boussinesq equation brutsaert and nieber 1977 troch et al 2013 the above analysis indicates that in watersheds with a multiscale gwfs baseflow generation cannot be viewed as simply occurring within hillslopes or conceptualized as drainage from hillslopes overlying horizontal or inclined impermeable bedrocks deep groundwater circulation through the large watershed scale flow system can lead to different baseflow generation behaviors e g baseflow discharge rate or solute concentration for upstream and downstream subwatersheds as is supported by evidence from natural watersheds e g frisbee et al 2011 frisbee et al 2017 peralta tapia et al 2015 ameli et al 2018 asano et al 2020 furthermore the importance of the large scale groundwater flow paths increases as the watersheds become drier such as in late recession stages or in arid regions existing observation based baseflow recession studies focus mostly on relatively short recession time scales and narrow discharge ranges e g recession between rainfall events or seasons kirchner 2009 teuling et al 2010 ajami et al 2011 so oftentimes only a relatively simple segment of g q is observed but we need to be cautious if we attempt to use the observed simple g q segment beyond the q observation ranges since as shown by our results dramatic changes of the functional form of g q can exist due to the evolving relative importance of flow paths of different scales 3 1 3 effect of water table disconnection and gwfs reorganization on baseflow recession disconnections of water table from the land surface in lower order subwatersheds are accompanied by abrupt changes of the discharge sensitivity g i q t of the higher order subwatersheds fig 3d and 3e specifically before drainage stage iv under the extreme drought fig 3d and and drainage stage iii under the moderate drought fig 3e the slopes of discharge sensitivity of downstream subwatersheds increase when water table disconnects from upstream subwatersheds the disconnection of water table from subwatersheds does not occur for the mild drought these phenomena happen because the water table disconnections from subwatersheds cause abrupt changes in the pattern of water table evolution and the reorganization of the gwfs we use disconnections of the water table from subwatershed 1 under the extreme and moderate droughts to elaborate this point figs 2a 2d s2a s2d before the disconnection of water table from subwatershed 1 the drainage is accompanied by the lowering and flattening of the local water table mounds between drainage regions of neighbouring subwatersheds the local water table mounds induce separate local flow cells transporting water toward drainage regions on the two sides of each water table mound figs 2a 2c s2a s2c the larger watershed scale shape of the water table is barely influenced because the water table is pinned at the drainage regions in each subwatershed i e a topographic constraint on the water table the drainage and baseflow recession behavior as reflected by the discharge sensitivity function evolve gradually and smoothly during the time period before the first disconnection at the end of drainage stage i figs 3d and 3e when the water table disconnects from subwatershed 1 the two local scale components of the gwfs on the two sides of outlet 1 disappear and the local flow field near outlet 1 becomes part of the larger watershed scale flow component figs 2c and 2d s2c and s2d the water table between outlets 1 and 2 and the water table upstream of outlet 1 now evolve together water table disconnections from subwatersheds change the shape of the larger watershed scale water table and reorganize the gwfs thus perturbing baseflow recession behavior in downstream subwatersheds these phenomena indicate that in watersheds where multiscale gwfss exist e g mountainous watersheds with deep and permeable bedrock flow cells of the gwfs supplying baseflow to individual subwatersheds interact with one another baseflow generation in different subwatersheds should not be treated as being independent 3 2 baseflow residence time and groundwater age under the extreme drought scenario joint analysis of baseflow recession from both a groundwater hydraulic perspective by analyzing the groundwater flow field baseflow discharge and storage discharge relationship and a solute transport perspective by analyzing groundwater age baseflow residence time and selective drainage of water of different ages provides a more holistic view of the watershed s functioning in storing and releasing water and solutes mcdonnell and beven 2014 discharge is driven by the instantaneous hydraulic head potential energy gradient of water stored in the watershed discharge sensitivity tells us the relative magnitude of discharge change caused by the change of storage and potential energy gradient which are a result of the net flux in out of the watershed discharge and discharge sensitivity provide measures of the hydraulic response of the watershed but contain no information about the evolving baseflow source and water quality baseflow residence time distribution rtd measures the age composition of water parcels in the baseflow and indicates whether baseflow comes from nearby riparian zones hillslopes arriving through short flow paths or from faraway mountains arriving through long and deep flow paths or both baseflow rtd together with the age distribution of groundwater in storage indicate how watersheds selectively drain groundwater of different ages from flow paths of different scales baseflow rtd and groundwater age distribution analyses provide an explicit view of how the multiscale gwfs influences baseflow generation and elucidates the important role of deep groundwater circulation here we examine these issues in detail for the case of an extreme drought with no recharge 3 2 1 spatiotemporal evolution of groundwater age the spatial distribution of groundwater age at the beginning of the drainage shows distinct age zones associated with the local and watershed scale flow paths induced by the local relief amplitudes and the watershed scale topographic slope fig 4 a the local scale gwfs components are mainly composed of relatively young water and have similar spatial patterns of groundwater age in different subwatersheds this is a result of the similar steady state groundwater flow patterns in the local flow cells at the beginning of the drainage due to the same climate condition local relief and homogeneous hydraulic conductivity fig 2a however due to the downwelling of the deep watershed scale flow field near the headwater and upwelling near the main stream the young age zone of local scale flow cells near the headwater extends deeper into the modeling domain than those near the main stream e g fig 4a the water flowing through the deep watershed scale flow field ages from the headwater to the main stream fig 4 this is trivially true but has significant implications for understanding baseflow generation and source at the watershed scale the portion of baseflow contributed by the local scale flow cells may have similar rtd at different subwatersheds however the portion of baseflow contributed by the deep watershed scale flow field can have very different rtd for upstream and downstream subwatersheds e g increasingly heavier tail at large residence time from upstream to downstream as is discussed in the following section the deep watershed scale flow cell has been hypothesized as a direct contribution to the observed water aging and increasing baseflow mineral solute concentration from upstream to downstream in natural watersheds with deep and permeable bedrock indicating the importance of deep groundwater circulation in streamflow generation and conceptualization e g frisbee et al 2011 frisbee et al 2017 peralta tapia et al 2015 during the entire drainage process the gwfs experiences aging and the local scale flow cells are stretched downstream by the deeper watershed scale flow field fig 4 but the main spatial pattern of groundwater age inherited from the initial steady state groundwater flow field is preserved this age pattern as determined by past hydrological conditions before the drainage marks the organization and evolution of the gwfs and explains the evolving baseflow rtd during the drainage section 3 2 2 due to factors such as hydrogeologic heterogeneity topographic complexity spatial variations and intermittency of precipitation events and climatic variations at different spatial temporal scales the spatial pattern of groundwater age at the beginning of baseflow recession in natural watersheds is typically more complex than what is presented in fig 4a however we are not attempting to reproduce the complex groundwater age distribution and baseflow rtd observed in natural watersheds rather we use groundwater age distribution and baseflow rtd as indicators markers for the evolution of the multiscale components of the gwfs in order to reveal their role in baseflow generation we focus on the relationships between the multiscale gwfs and baseflow generation rather than the detailed composition of the water our conclusions don t depend on the specific patterns of groundwater age distribution or baseflow rtd which are manifestations of the accumulated effect of recharge subsurface mixing and discharge that the watershed has experienced in the past even for a system with more complex age patterns and more complex baseflow rtd the timing and proportion of the contribution of the multiscale components of the gwfs to baseflow and baseflow recession behavior are determined by the system hydraulic conditions at the beginning of and during the drainage process rather than by the specific patterns of groundwater age distribution or baseflow rtd which are formed during the history of the watershed before the recession event the fully saturated steady state groundwater flow field used as the initial condition for the drainage in our model can represent a long term average groundwater flow condition this is particularly true in a humid watershed where the groundwater table closely follows land surface topography but it also can apply to semiarid climates with enhanced recharge at higher elevations wilson and guan 2004 stephens and umstot 2019 the initial groundwater age pattern although simple and lacking of the more detailed age patterns induced by complex meteorological perturbations and subsurface mixing represents the overall long term average age pattern the relatively simple age pattern associated with flow cells of different scales clearly marks and delineates these different flow cells and traces the role of the gwfs in baseflow generation which serves to meet our research purpose although adding more complexity might reveal more interesting subsurface mixing phenomena the specificity of the complexity is not relevant to our research purpose and can obscure the generality we want to achieve in this study 3 2 2 evolution of baseflow residence time distribution and sources the temporal evolution and spatial patterns of groundwater age is directly related to the evolution of baseflow rtd figs 5 and s9 during the first stage of the drainage i e from the beginning of the drainage to the disconnection of water table from subwatershed 1 subwatersheds 1 3 have very similar baseflow rtd figs 5 a c i and s9 the similarity in rtd is a result of the similar spatial patterns of the gwfs directly supplying baseflow to subwatersheds 1 3 figs 2a 2c 4a 4c the rtd is characterized by one mode spanning young residence times this is caused by the dominating contribution of local scale flow paths to baseflow figs 4a 4c and 8a as can be seen from the baseflow source areas annotated by i i i 1 2 3 in fig 8a for this first drainage stage baseflow is primarily contributed by young groundwater beneath the drainage area as a result of the downstream aging and increasing contribution to baseflow of water flowing through the regional scale flow paths the rtds from higher order subwatersheds have longer tails at large residence times figs 5d i and 5e i although the overall shape of the rtds is similar to that for subwatersheds 1 3 however a gap i e a horizontal segment in the rtds and a jump following the gap can be found around a residence time of 100 t c this is because subwatersheds 4 and 5 directly tap the upwelling region of the deep watershed scale flow field and gain a larger proportion of baseflow from the old water in that flow field figs 4a 4c and 8a the temporal change of rtds is small during the first stage of the drainage but with a slight shift of the mode toward younger residence times figs 5 a f i and s9 this indicates an increasing proportion of younger baseflow from local scale flow cells during the second stage of the drainage the shape and the evolution patterns of rtd for subwatersheds 2 4 figs 5 b d ii are similar to that during the first drainage stage however rtd for subwatershed 5 shows an increase in the weight of the mode at a residence time of about 300 t c fig 5e ii indicating an increasing proportion to baseflow from regional scale flow paths fig 8a during stages iii v of the drainage the temporal evolution of rtd for subwatersheds 4 and 5 is dominated by the natural aging of groundwater as indicated by the shift of the rtd toward large residence times figs 5d iii 5d iv 5e iii 5e iv and 5e v the relative probability mass covered by the two modes at relatively young and old residence times changes little as shown by the unchanging vertical rises of the rtd curves preceding and following the horizontal gap at around 100 t c e g fig 5e iv this indicates that the relative contribution to baseflow by local and regional scale flow paths is stable probably due to the stable relative magnitude of the flushing intensity of the local and regional scale flow cells at this late stage of the drainage fig s4a the evolution of baseflow rtd figs 5 and s9 reveals the changing proportions of young old groundwater in supplying baseflow caused by the reorganization and changing relative strengths of flow cells of different scales in the gwfs figs 2 and s4 unlike the discharge sensitivity no abrupt changes of rtd occur when the water table disconnects from the various subwatersheds fig 5 a hydraulic perturbation is revealed immediately in water discharge and solute export rate mcdonnell and beven 2014 but the solute composition of discharge as indicated by rtd is determined by both the composition of water available to be discharged and the proportion of discharge from water of different compositions in storage one way to describe the selective discharge of groundwater of different compositions is the storage selection sas function eq 20 e g harman 2015 contrasting fig 4c with 4d 4f with 4g 4i with 4j and 4l with 4m shows that there are no immediate or dramatic changes of groundwater age or its spatial pattern when the water table disconnections occur so the relatively stable rtd before and after a water table disconnection indicates that the sas function is not dramatically perturbed at the time of a water table disconnection although water table disconnections do not cause sudden changes of sas functions and flow paths the water table disconnection and the accompanied gwfs reorganization cause the evolution of flow paths to be different from that before the disconnection which is reflected in the different evolution schemes of rtd before and after water table disconnections e g compare fig 5d ii with 5d iii 5e i with 5e ii and 5e ii with 5e iii this is especially true for high order subwatersheds the different rtd evolution schemes are related to the changes in baseflow sources due to the evolution of the multiscale gwfs baseflow during different stages of the drainage is mainly from groundwater storage close to the drainage areas fig 8a rather than entirely from hillslope storage that assumes an impermeable bedrock underlying hillslopes e g fig 2 in pauritsch et al 2015 during the first stage of the drainage baseflow is mainly from storage below the drainage areas of each subwatershed zones labeled i i in fig 8a for i 1 2 3 4 5 a large proportion of the drained storage is from the local flow cells and a small proportion is from the upwelling of the larger watershed scale flow cell into subwatershed 5 fig 8a the evolving proportions and timing of water drained from local and watershed scale flow cells contribute to the evolution scheme of baseflow rtd figs 5 a e i as the drainage progresses the source regions for baseflow expand radially outward from each of the drainage areas fig 8a for subwatersheds 1 4 the storage near and below the peaks of the hills never drains out as local baseflow from these subwatersheds but instead as the water table drops flows deeper into the domain and becomes part of the deep watershed scale component of the gwfs fig 2 this portion of water storage eventually subsidizes the main stream as is also indicated by observations and modeling in natural watersheds manning and solomon 2005 manning 2011 rumsey et al 2015 ameli et al 2018 also notice that due to the bias of the groundwater watershed divides toward the upstream direction under the influence of the watershed scale water table slope fig 2 hillslopes of the same shape on the two sides of the stream don t contribute equally to baseflow fig 8a 3 3 baseflow residence time and groundwater age under the moderate and mild drought scenarios the shape and evolution patterns of rtd under the moderate and mild drought scenarios differ from that under the extreme drought mainly in the late drainage period as the flow fields under different drought scenarios asymptotically approach different steady state flow fields figs 5 7 for these two less severe drought scenarios the complexity of the final steady state baseflow rtd increases from upstream to downstream figs 6 and 7 moreover both the moderate and mild droughts produce more complex final steady state rtds than does the extreme drought as is reflected by the number of modes in the rtd s approaching final steady states figs 5 7 under the moderate and mild droughts flow paths of a wide range of scales all play important roles in contributing to baseflow especially at the late period of the drought and or in higher order subwatersheds while during the early period of a drought or for lower order subwatersheds local scale flow cells dominate the contribution to baseflow and thus produce less complex rtds during the first drainage stage under the moderate drought the spatial distribution of baseflow sources is similar to that under the extreme drought figs 8a and 8 b baseflow is entirely contributed by water in storage that is recharged before the start of the drought for both the moderate and extreme droughts the second drainage stage under the drought is defined as the time interval between the disconnections of water table from subwatershed 1 and 2 however compared to the extreme drought more young water in storage contributes to baseflow during the second drainage stage under the moderate drought figs 8a and 8b this is because the second drainage stage under the moderate drought t 1 5 4 1 see plot label in fig s2 persists for a much longer time than does the second drainage stage under the extreme drought t 1 2 2 1 see plot label in fig 2 the slower declining water table sustained by the recharge drives more young water out of the domain as baseflow for higher order subwatersheds during the third drainage stage under the moderate drought fig 8b and during the entire drainage stage under the mild drought fig 8c a significant amount of groundwater contributing to baseflow to individual subwatersheds is from inter subwatershed upstream regions this explains the complex baseflow rtd during these drainage stages figs 6 and 7 during the second and third drainage stages under the moderate drought and during the entire drainage stage under the mild drought baseflow is contributed by both water in storage at the beginning of the drought and new recharge occuring after the beginning of the drought bottom and top parts respectively of the panels shown in figs 8b and 8c for any one specific subwatershed new recharge from both within and without the subwatershed contributes to baseflow the multiscale gwfs breaks the barriers of the topographic divide between subwatersheds and makes baseflow source identification discharge and water quality prediction much more complex 3 4 implications for the conceptualization of baseflow generation the conceptualization of baseflow generation is widely used to interpret baseflow recession behavior and identify controlling factors infer watershed hydrogeologic and geomorphic parameters based on discharge observations and parameterize the baseflow component in conceptual hydrological models when using hydraulic groundwater theory see e g troch et al 2013 for a review to interpret baseflow recession behavior and infer watershed scale equivalent hydrogeologic parameters it is traditionally assumed that discharge from the entire watershed is a simple aggregation of simultaneous discharging processes from identical hillslopes arranged in parallel along the stream network brutsaert and nieber 1977 rupp and selker 2006 harman et al 2009 relax the identical hillslope assumption and show that the heterogeneity of recession time scales of individual hillslopes can generate the range of recession slope curves observed in nature however harman et al 2009 still conceptually assume that individual hillslopes are arranged in parallel and have no interactions with each other our results from physically based modeling clearly demonstrate that baseflow discharge processes from different hillslopes or different subwatersheds are not independent if they are supplied by a multiscale gwfs where flow paths of multiple scales can interact with each other biswal and marani 2010 relate watershed stream network structure to baseflow recession characteristics moving one step forward beyond the traditional focus on hillslope scale dynamics while studying baseflow generation they show the relation between the contraction of an active drainage stream network and watershed scale baseflow recession characteristics under the following assumptions 1 baseflow during recession varies slowly in time and can be described by a succession of steady states 2 discharge processes from hillslopes along unit width stream segments are identical in their words spatially constant 3 active stream heads recede at constant speed a close examination of the second and third assumptions reveals some contradiction if discharge processes from hillslopes are spatially constant i e identical and synchronized then how can the stream network dry up gradually from upstream to downstream different segments of the entire stream network should dry up at the same pace when the discharge into all stream segments approaches zero synchronically based on our results and some additional thought experiments the most questionable assumption which leads to the contradiction is the second one that assumes that discharge into per unit length stream segment is spatially constant this assumption of being spatially constant prohibits the study of the impact of any spatial structure on baseflow recession their first assumption remedies the contradiction all three assumptions together actually conceptualize watershed scale baseflow recession as the successive and sudden shutting down of discharge from unit width stream segments along the stream network from upstream to downstream if we conceptualize the water table in a watershed as a connected entirety with the stream water stage being the groundwater water table in the stream e g winter et al 1998 then the receding of active stream heads during the dry season is a manifestation of the lowering of water table at the watershed scale which is likely to occur in sloping basins as stated by biswal and marani 2010 thus recognizing the importance of the dynamics of the multiscale gwfs in addition to the dynamics of baseflow from individual hillslopes is essential for understanding the control of watershed scale geomorphological structure on baseflow generation and recession behavior e g wang et al 2018 the assumptions used in the above cited studies are more appropriate for watersheds with shallow impermeable bedrock and gentle watershed scale topographic slope the role of nested multiscale gwfs is rarely considered in baseflow generation studies our modeling suggests that assuming discharge processes from hillslopes to be identical and independent is likely inappropriate for watersheds with deep and permeable bedrock and multiscale topographic relief e g frisbee et al 2017 ameli et al 2018 these types of watersheds are often found in mountainous headwater regions with fractured bedrock wilson and guan 2004 gleeson and manning 2008 welch and allen 2014 the interactions of multiscale components of the gwfs and their evolving role in baseflow generation can make the baseflow generation behavior significantly different from that of individual hillslopes or aggregations of hillslopes in a 3 d watershed topography is hierarchically organized with lower order subwatersheds overlying and embedded in higher order subwatersheds the hillslopes of subwatersheds of different orders usually have different wavelengths amplitudes and orientations rodríguez iturbe and rinaldo 1997 perron et al 2008 under ideal climatic and hydrogeologic conditions the water table can be a subdued imitation of the land surface topography e g tóth 1963 freeze and witherspoon 1966 the water table relief thus shares the multiscale nature of the land surface topography and can be viewed as a linear combination of undulations at different spatial scales with different amplitudes and orientations e g wörman et al 2006 wörman et al 2007 the water table gradient beneath the hillslopes and the underlying 3 d groundwater flow directions do not have to be along the sloping directions of the lowest order hillslopes the influence of the evolving watershed scale water table relief must be taken into account when interpreting baseflow recession at the watershed scale and building conceptual baseflow models in many rainfall runoff models baseflow generation is conceptualized as discharge processes from single or multiple reservoirs arranged sequentially or in parallel and is parameterized as linear or nonlinear storage discharge relationships e g gelhar and wilson 1974 clark et al 2008 luo et al 2012 stoelzle et al 2015 our results show that baseflow generation behavior as characterized by the storage discharge relationship is not static but changes as the watershed wetness condition changes moreover even with the same local hydrogeologic and geomorphic conditions subwatersheds with different deep watershed scale or even inter watershed scale groundwater flow conditions can have significantly different baseflow generation behavior in other words the baseflow generation behavior of individual watersheds is determined not only by their within watershed landscape and climate conditions but also influenced by the landscape and climate conditions of the higher order watersheds encompassing them this calls for caution in the regionalization of rainfall runoff model structures to ungauged basins based only on physiographic and or meteorological attributes e g yadav et al 2007 santhi et al 2008 3 5 simplifications limitations and future study a 2 d sinusoidal topography with a linear regional slope is used for our model domain this topographic configuration although simple incorporates the general undulating and multiscale features of natural topography and drives the formation of a multiscale gwfs with nested flow paths adding complexity to the topography can correspondingly increase the complexity of the groundwater flow field but will also make the topography and thus the topography driven groundwater flow field more unique and specific to a certain type of landscape and make the conclusions less universal and harder to transcend place compared to 2 d cross sectional models 3 d watershed models can incorporate the 3 d features of landscapes such as the stream network and diverse hillslope plain view shapes and can simulate more complex 3 d groundwater flow fields baseflow recession behavior influenced by stream network patterns and the interaction between groundwater table and 3 d topography e g the drying up of the stream network godsey and kirchner 2014 should be studied in the future the homogeneous hydraulic conductivity field used in our simulations does not incorporate geological features such as a shallow highly permeable soil and weathered bedrock a change of bedrock permeability with depth e g due to compression hydrostratigraphic layering or structural features such as faults we choose to use a single homogeneous hydraulic conductivity scenario for three reasons first a shallow highly permeable zone is important to baseflow generation in some but not all natural watersheds there are also many places where shallow soil and highly weathered bedrock is uncommon or do not exist for example bedrock watersheds with no unconsolidated soils are common in the western us such as the sierra nevadas and the coastal ranges of california e g the sandstones of the santa ynez mountains watersheds with little weathered bedrock at the top are also common in the carbonates of florida and door county wisconsin in any event the conditions simulated here are also equivalent to hilly terrain with silty sands silt loess or glacial till aquifers even without rescaling second our focus is on the contributions of deeper components of the gwfs to baseflow including the flow paths at the scales of hillslopes and deeper flow paths at larger inter subwatershed and watershed scales although we simplify the shallow soil and weathered bedrock zone we do consider a wide spectrum of flow paths from hillslope scale to watershed scale third using a single hydraulic conductivity scenario also helps us to better focus on demonstrating and improving our mechanistic understanding of the role of multiscale groundwater flow paths in watershed scale baseflow generation a shallow highly permeable zone could allow preferential groundwater flow at the early stage of the drainage and potentially further distinguish the contributions of shallow and deep flow paths to baseflow our modeling and analysis framework can be extended in the future to implement a depth decaying permeability profile that potentially addresses some of these issues 4 summary conclusions and implications in this paper we study baseflow generation and recession behavior in watersheds with deep and permeable bedrock this special landscape setting favors the development of a groundwater flow system gwfs with deep as well as shallow flow components which can play an important role in stream baseflow generation we analyze numerically simulated baseflow generation and the gwfs in a 2 d cross section of an idealized watershed for three different prolonged droughts leading to three different examples of water table disconnections from subwatersheds baseflow discharge and residence time distribution rtd as well as the groundwater flow field and groundwater age distribution are analyzed to understand the dynamics of baseflow and the multiscale gwfs during prolonged droughts fig 9 the changes of baseflow discharge sensitivity and rtd as indicators of watershed scale baseflow generation and solute export characteristics are explained by the evolution of the groundwater flow field the interactions among flow components of different scales in the gwfs and the evolving shape and position of water table and its disconnections from subwatersheds fig 9 based on our analysis we conclude that flow paths of different spatial and temporal scales of the gwfs interactively influence baseflow generation but with distinct and evolving roles during the sequential stages of the drainage and for each subwatershed depending on the relative strength of the flow paths and the relative positions of the subwatersheds to the recharge discharge zones of the watershed scale flow paths during the early stage of the drainage baseflow recession in all subwatersheds is primarily influenced by the local subwatershed scale flow paths which contribute young water originating from recharge in the nearby hillslope areas to the baseflow the baseflow discharge sensitivity function has a power law form which matches the behavior recorded by field observations as the drainage progresses the lowering of the water table the flattening of local water table undulations and the disconnection of water table from subwatersheds diminish local subwatershed scale flow paths and their relative importance in shaping baseflow recession behavior during this period of the drainage the watershed scale deep component of the gwfs takes more and more control of baseflow generation contributing a larger proportion of older water to baseflow and leading to more complex baseflow recession behavior as the drainage progresses the evolving multiscale components of the gwfs and their changing relative strength and contribution to baseflow generation lead to increasingly dissimilar baseflow discharge sensitivity and rtd from different subwatersheds despite their similar landscape and climate conditions and produce spatial scale dependent baseflow generation behavior during the early stage of the drainage the local subwatershed scale components of the gwfs have similar hydraulic head and age patterns due to the same local topographic relief climate and geology this similarity in early stage subwatershed scale flow component contributes to similar discharge recession behavior and rtd of baseflow from lower order subwatersheds the highest order subwatershed is strongly influenced by the deep watershed scale component of the gwfs and has the most distinct rtd patterns during the early stage of the drainage the different positions of subwatersheds relative to watershed scale downwelling and upwelling flow zones strengthens the dissimilarity in baseflow recession behavior and rtd among different subwatersheds especially during the later stages of the drainage the influence of the deep watershed scale component of the gwfs on baseflow generation is most significant in the highest order subwatershed and is evident even in the early stages of drainage when the watershed topographic slope increases this scale dependent influence of the watershed scale flow component becomes more obvious not shown and can have more significant effect on baseflow generation in all subwatersheds even during the early stage of the drainage we earlier noted section 2 1 that the different drought induced drainage stages modeled in this study can also be used to represent the average drainage conditions and their responses to droughts for otherwise similar watersheds in different climates with similar topography and geology watersheds in drier climates produce older and more chemically evolved baseflow as indicated by the final equilibrium rtd under reduced recharge rates however baseflow from watersheds in temperate climates has much more complex residence time distribution than baseflow from topographically and geologically similar watersheds in both humid and dry climates under a drought discharge sensitivity of watersheds in drier climates is smaller than that of watersheds in more humid climates for watersheds in different climates the sensitivity of baseflow residence time distribution or sensitivity of discharge of different residence times to drought perturbations is worth future study also note that our conceptual model with a homogeneous hydraulic conductivity field corresponds to natural watersheds with deep and permeable bedrock the heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity field such as a depth decaying k ingebritsen and manning 1999 cardenas and jiang 2010 can influence the relative contribution of flow paths of different scales to baseflow generation however our findings are due to the multiscale nature of the gwfs and should persist even in watersheds with heterogeneous geology as long as there is a multiscale gwfs with its various subwatersheds having time varying connections to flow paths of different scales our results call for caution in conceptualizing baseflow generation at the watershed scale as a synchronized or sequential aggregation of baseflow generated independently from individual hillslopes first baseflow may not be entirely contributed by water storage within the hillslopes on the two sides of the streams depending on the depth and complexity of the gwfs second for watersheds with a developed gwfs e g in hilly or mountainous regions with deep and permeable bedrock the watershed scale baseflow generation mechanism cannot be represented by a simple aggregation e g multiplication linear combination or convolution of hillslope or subwatershed scale baseflow generation processes this is indicated by the asynchrony and dissimilarity of baseflow generation from hillslopes under the impact of the watershed scale gwfs and the dynamic interactions among flow components of different scales credit authorship contribution statement chao wang conceptualization methodology software formal analysis

3351,field and numerical studies suggest that baseflow is composed of waters from a spectrum of groundwater flow paths termed the groundwater flow system gwfs from shallow hillslope contributions to watershed scale deep circulation originating in headwaters and discharging into lowland rivers here we explore the evolution of the gwfs under prolonged droughts to understand its dynamics and multiscale nature and to elucidate its role in baseflow generation and recession at the watershed scale we consider three drought scenarios of varying severity and simulate groundwater flow in a 2 d cross section of an idealized watershed with deep permeable bedrock tracking the evolution of flow paths baseflow and residence times during the recession process we find that baseflow generation at different drainage stages and within different subwatersheds is influenced distinctly by flow paths of different scales depending on the relative strength of the flow paths and the position of the subwatersheds relative to the recharge discharge zones of the deeper watershed scale groundwater circulation despite having the same local relief geology and climate baseflow from each subwatershed has a distinct recession behavior and time dependent residence time distribution also the hydraulic and transport characteristics of baseflow generation co evolve and are strongly affected by the connection state of the water table to subwatersheds these findings suggest that asynchrony and dissimilarity of baseflow generation from hillslopes under the impact of the watershed scale groundwater flow and interactions with local scale and intermediate scale groundwater flow must be taken into account when interpreting baseflow recession data and building conceptual baseflow models at the

streamflow component and acts as a nexus connecting subsurface and surface hydrological geochemical and ecological environments beck et al 2013 fan et al 2013 yao et al 2017 berghuijs et al 2016 jasechko et al 2016 trancoso et al 2017 sabo et al 2016 maher and chamberlain 2014 for example baseflow contributes to more than 50 of mean annual streamflow in more than 50 of global land area beck

generation process is not only important for hydrological purposes such as streamflow prediction and drought mitigation but it is also important for understanding and simulating geophysical geochemical ecological and environmental processes in which the baseflow generation process is actively involved baseflow generation is often conceptualized as discharge from groundwater stored in an unconfined aquifer resting on a horizontal or inclined impermeable bedrock see e g troch et al 2013 for a review this hillslope centric conceptualization is commonly modelled by the boussinesq equation or its variants most often in cross section see e g rupp and selker 2006 for a review and is widely used to understand baseflow recession and its controlling factors estimate watershed geomorphic and hydrogeologic parameters and conceptualize watershed rainfall runoff processes this hillslope centric conceptualization greatly simplifies real world landscape conditions such as

hydrological processes occurring at multiple spatial scales beyond that of hillslopes it cannot be used to explain watershed scale emergent baseflow generation behavior with active contribution from

scale streamflow generation and flood forecasting or when estimating hillslope and small catchment scale geomorphic and hydrogeologic properties baseflow generation from the larger watershed scale flow paths of the gwfs can be more important in hydrogeochemical hydrogeomorphic and hydrogeophysical processes that have longer characteristic time scales than typical rainstorm flood events such as

of the multiscale gwfs especially inter subwatershed subsurface flow paths in watershed hydrology is gaining increasing attention from the research community and has been shown to influence watershed scale streamflow generation and solute transport land surface processes and climate modeling ameli et al 2018 fan et al 2019 frisbee et al 2011 frisbee et al 2017 krakauer et al 2014 peralta tapia et al 2015 despite some distinct and interesting features of potential contribution of multiple scale gwfs to baseflow generation revealed by a few field studies e g ameli et al 2018 frisbee et al 2011 peralta tapia et al 2015 we lack a comprehensive understanding on how baseflow and flow paths of multiple scales in the gwfs evolve during the dry season or under a long term drought this lack of understanding is partly due to the scarcity of distributed observations on subsurface hydrological processes and the traditional disregard of the deep flow paths of the gwfs in watershed hydrology studies because of this lack of understanding the role of the dynamics of the multiscale gwfs is seldom considered in baseflow hydrograph analysis and in parameterizing baseflow component in conceptual hydrological models e g clark et al 2016 fan et al 2019 piovano et al 2020 in order to improve the conceptualization and parsimonious modeling of baseflow generation in watersheds influenced by multiscale gwfss it s important to clarify the distinct roles of the different scale flow components of the gwfs in baseflow generation in this study we analyze baseflow generation and the coevolution and roles of flow paths of different scales in the gwfs under prescribed long term droughts in a 2 d vertical cross section of an idealized high order watershed fig 1 a the cross section of the idealized watershed is characterized by a sinusoidal topography with a linear regional slope and a homogeneous deep permeable bedrock which simplifies the bedrock permeability depth profile and the shallow highly permeable soil and weathered bedrock zone that could exist in some but not all natural watersheds this simple conceptualization dramatically extends the hillslope model to include deep groundwater we hypothesize that baseflow generation and recession behaviour are significantly and distinctly affected by the dynamics and interactions of flow paths at scales larger than that of typical riparian zones and hillslopes we test our hypothesis by exploring the time varying dynamics of both baseflow generation and the multiscale gwfs and the relationships between them specifically we focus on the relationship between baseflow discharge and groundwater storage and the relationship between baseflow residence time and groundwater age which are the two fundamental constitutive relationships widely used in parsimonious lumped watershed streamflow generation and solute transport modeling respectively our simple 2d conceptualization which preserves the ideas of neighboring subwatersheds allows us to address the essence of our research questions without the additional complexity of a stream network we show that even with simple topographic and hydrogeologic settings complex and scale dependent baseflow dynamics emerge due to the changing effects of the multiscale gwfs on baseflow generation in different subwatersheds and during the different stages of prolonged droughts this study provides mechanistic and conceptual understanding of watershed scale baseflow generation from the multiscale gwfs the additional complexity introduced by the stream network pattern can be addressed in future studies it is not expected to change the crux of our new findings 2 methods 2 1 prescribed long term droughts as simple forcings to reveal the effects of prolonged droughts we start with a fully saturated steady state gwfs where the water table coincides with the topography e g a wet climate and or low conductivity permeable media and compute the amount and spatial distribution of recharge along the top boundary the initial flow system can be created by applying a relatively large spatially uniform recharge to raise the water table to the land surface over the entire model domain to represent a drought we change the boundary to one with a prescribed uniform potential recharge rate we ignore the effect of topography or vegetation on recharge that is lower than the average recharge rate for the fully saturated case we use a spatially constant recharge rate of zero to represent a hypothetical extreme drought we also use two nonzero reduced uniform potential recharge rates to represent droughts of less severity these rates are equal to one twentieth 14 8 mm yr and one half 148 0 mm yr of the spatially averaged recharge rate found for the pre drought fully saturated case 295 5 mm yr the 295 5 mm yr recharge rate for the pre drought fully saturated case is reasonable and exists in natural bedrock watersheds e g the santa ynez mountains of southern california the two nonzero reduced recharge rates 14 8 mm yr and 148 0 mm yr represent moderate and mild droughts respectively the three droughts with 0 14 8 mm yr and 148 0 mm yr recharge rates allow the system to reach three different representative final equilibrium states section 3 note that at fully saturated locations where the water table coincides with the land surface part or all applied potential recharge is rejected by the system creating a spatially non uniform distribution of net recharge accepted by the system for the initial flow field and the flow field during drainage under the moderate and mild drought scenarios this type of simple forcing is used for three reasons 1 this system configuration is representative of real situations when a watershed in a humid region experiences a prolonged drought haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 gleeson and manning 2008 condon and maxwell 2015 2 different stages of the long term drainage represent average drainage conditions of watersheds in different climate regions dai et al 2021 3 the emphasis of this study is on the role of the dynamical gwfs in baseflow generation at multiple spatial scales and the control of topographic structure even though using more complex recharge forcing with spatial temporal variations in intensity duration and intermittency can add an additional level of complexity to stimulate new insights into the system response it can also obscure the role of topography and the dynamical gwfs in baseflow generation system response under more complex recharge conditions with the interactive effect of topographic structure bears its own importance and can be explored in a separate study 2 2 model domain configuration groundwater flow and transport modeling in cross sectional domains has been and is widely used to study fluxes and age distributions in gwfss in particular 2 d simplified representations are parsimonious tools that allow us to gain insights into the role of

during prolonged droughts the topography of the top boundary and land surface of the 2 d cross section is represented by 1 z s x z 0 a 0 m 1 x a 0 sin 2 π λ x 3 π 2 where z 0 determines the depth l of the basin below the lowest point of land surface m 1 represents the watershed scale topographic slope and a 0 and λ represent the amplitude l and wavelength l of the sinusoidal local relief respectively the parameter values used in this study are z 0 1000 m m 1 0 02 a 0 60 m λ 1500 m and x 0 l x with l x 6760 m we also varied most of these geometric parameters in sensitivity analyses which for brevity we haven t included here they don t change the core of our findings this 2 d domain can be viewed as a transverse cross section of a 3 d watershed see e g fig 1 in cardenas 2007 for an illustration the regions between neighbouring peaks are designated as subwatersheds and are numbered 1 5 from high elevation upstream to low elevation downstream fig 1a for our 2 d domain the ratio of the linear regional topographic rise to the local topographic amplitude is m 1 l x a 0 2 25 and the ratio of the width of the domain to the local topographic wavelength is l x λ 4 5 these dimensionless ratios measure the topographic structure and relative strengths of the local and the regional scale groundwater flow paths and can be used in future studies on the control of topographic structure on baseflow generation the 2d tothian conceptualization has played an unprecedented role in improving our understanding of multiscale gwfss anderson 2008 but to the best of our knowledge it has never been used to study the dynamics of watershed scale baseflow generation e g discharge sensitivity and transient residence time distribution and its relationship to multiscale gwfss as we do in this paper nor have more complex 3d conceptualizations ones that recognize deep groundwater attempted to address this topic 2 3 groundwater flow and baseflow simulation we use the finite difference code modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 harbaugh 2005 to simulate saturated groundwater flow eq 2 below in the 2d model domain fig 1b while accounting for gravity drainage from the vadose zone through the phreatic surface boundary condition eq 5 below bear 1972 the spatiotemporal variation of the phreatic surface i e the water table is unknown and is estimated as part of the numerical non linear solution vadose zone capillary effects are negligible in this drainage situation as the vertical scale of the 2d saturated flow 10s to 100s of meters is much larger than the length scale of capillary forces dagan and kroszynski 1973 dagan 1989 e g gardner s capillary length parameter which ranges from 0 1 to 5 m in typical permeable geological media this is why for example groundwater well tests in phreatic aquifers almost always ignore the effects of capillary forces on delayed yield tartakovsky and neuman 2007 we also neglect compressibility effects as the phreatic surface drops much too slowly over time for compressibility to have any effect storage depletion is entirely due to draining the porous media specific yield at the phreatic surface eq 5 below we assume that the effective porosity for groundwater flow and the specific yield are equal to the porous media porosity we track the evolution and location of the hydraulic head at the top layer to define fluxes across the land surface specifically if the hydraulic head at the top layer is higher than or equal to the land surface elevation we use a drain boundary condition to simulate head dependent drainage flux eq 4 which becomes stream baseflow and is removed from the model this is also a seepage face boundary condition the drain elevation is set to be land surface elevation the drain flux baseflow is calculated as the drain conductance c d times the difference between top layer hydraulic head and the drain elevation eq 4 on the other hand if the hydraulic head at the top layer is lower than the land surface we impose a phreatic surface boundary with prescribed recharge eq 5 bear 1972 as the water table drops during the mild and moderate droughts the discharge area decreases and the recharge area and therefore the total recharge increases no flow boundary conditions are assumed at the lateral and bottom boundaries eq 6 under these assumptions the mathematical statement for flow is given by 2 k h 0

boundary where water table is below the land surface ω 2 represents the lateral boundaries ω 3 represents the bottom boundary and n is the outward normal vector at any point on the boundary of ω the property values in this study are k k i with k 0 01 m day and i the identity matrix c d 0 4 day 1 and ϕ 0 03 the conductivity and porosity values are typical for permeable rock systems especially sandstones e g dingman 2015 but to account for other possible values our results are presented dimensionlessly see below the drain conductance is high indicating little surface resistance e g a clogged streambed to discharging groundwater the recharge r r z has rates r 14 8 or 148 0 mm yr for the moderate and mild drought scenarios respectively these rates are typical of relatively dry to somewhat more humid bedrock systems respectively during the drainage the water table is defined as the phreatic surface where the pressure head is zero i e places where the hydraulic head equals elevation head or x h x z and it is described by the non linear kinematic boundary condition in eq 5 which is based on the continuity of water flux across the phreatic surface along the normal vector bear 1972 dagan 1989 modflow nwt treats cells above the water table as dry cells water content θ 0 and cells below the water table as fully saturated θ θ s where θ s is saturated water content and is assumed to be equal to porosity flux out of the model domain across the drain boundary is lumped at each time step for each subwatershed fig 1a and for the entire domain to get the baseflow discharge the initial condition i e initial hydraulic head for the drainage h 0 x is taken as the solution of the steady state fully saturated groundwater flow problem eq 7 with land surface elevation as a specified hydraulic head top boundary condition eq 8 with no flow lateral and bottom boundary conditions eq 9 as represented by the following mathematical statement 7 k h 0 0 x ω 8 h 0 x y z z s x y z s x y x y ω 1 9 n k h 0 0 x ω 2 ω 3 where ω 1 is the entire top boundary of the model domain the recharge rate r x at the land surface needed to sustain the steady state groundwater flow field is calculated at the constant head boundary ω 1 based on the simulated hydraulic head for the case of a hypothetical long term extreme drought represented by zero recharge top boundary condition r 0 section 2 1 the gwfs asymptotically approaches a static state with the water table as a flat surface on the same level of the lowest drainage point of the domain i e h x z s x 0 z 0 fig 1 eq 1 for the case of a less severe drought represented by a reduced non zero recharge top boundary condition the gwfs asymptotically approaches a steady state with water table as a subdued imitation of the land surface the mathematical statement for this final steady state groundwater flow field can be derived from the mathematical statement of the transient drainage problem eqs 2 6 by removing the initial condition eq 3 from the original mathematical statement and letting h t 0 in eq 5 thus the groundwater flow field during drainage under a non zero reduced recharge approaches the solution of the following mathematical statement 10 k h 0 x ω 11 n k h c d h z s r n h z s x ω 1 out 12 1 ϕ k h r h z 0 h z s x ω 1 wtb 13 n k h 0 x ω 2 ω 3 during the drainage under the extreme and moderate drought scenarios the water table disconnects sequentially from the subwatersheds we define a drainage stage as the drainage time period between two consecutive disconnections of water table from the land surface of subwatersheds critical differences of drainage behavior occur when the water table is connected to a different number of subwatersheds our three drought scenarios are essentially designed to have different numbers of subwatersheds attached to the water table as the system approaches a final steady state our extreme moderate and mild drought scenarios lead to water table disconnection from all two and no subwatersheds respectively as the system approaches final steady state section 3 1 1 2 4 spatial and temporal discretization the domain fig 1a is discretized into cuboid cells with dimensions in the horizontal i e x and y directions δ x δ y 10 m this results in 676 columns of cells in the x direction and one row of cells in the y direction the vertical i e z direction is discretized into 500 layers which are indexed by integers k 0 to 499 from the top to the bottom the thickness of the first layer k 0 is set to be 0 5 m uniformly over the entire domain the rest of the layers are grouped into shallow layers k 1 to 200 intermediate layers k 201 to 300 and deep layers k 301 to 499 zones for each location x y layer thickness is constant within each of the shallow intermediate and deep zones and the ratio of layer thicknesses of the three zones is 1 2 4 because the total thickness of the domain varies at different x y locations the layer thickness within each zone also varies at different x y locations the layer thicknesses within the three zones are in the ranges 0 84 1 05 m 1 67 2 10 m and 3 34 4 20 m we drain the domain for 1 million days 2 738 years to study the baseflow generation behavior during the full range of watershed storage condition from fully saturated to nearly zero drainable storage for the case of an extreme drought with zero recharge at the end of the simulation the drainable storage reaches 0 04 the initial drainable storage for the case of a reduced non zero recharge running the model 1 million days ensures the final flow field to be very close to the steady state flow field described by eqs 10 13 a total of 1 000 time steps are used and the time step duration changes according to a geometric progression harbaugh 2005 a time step multiplier which is the ratio of the duration of each time step to that of the preceding time step equal to 1 011 is used the size of the time steps ranges from 0 19 day at the beginning of the drainage process to 10 880 days at the end of the simulation 2 5 estimation of groundwater age and residence time distributions groundwater age is the time it takes for a particular water parcel to flow from the water table at its recharge location to the location within the aquifer where it is sampled physically or studied theoretically kazemi et al 2006 groundwater residence time is the time it takes for a water parcel to travel from the recharge area to the discharge area e g streams springs wells groundwater discharge into streams provides stream baseflow baseflow residence time typically called travel or transit time by the surface water hydrology community they often use the term residence time to represent something similar to the groundwater community s age is defined as the time for a water parcel to travel from its entrance into the watershed as recharge to its discharge into the streams as baseflow so by definition groundwater residence time equals baseflow residence time groundwater age of a water parcel in storage is calculated using forward particle tracking the particle tracking is started for the fully saturated steady state groundwater flow eqs 7 9 3 10 6 days 8 214 years before the beginning of the drainage i e a spin up phase to fill up the domain with particles and run afterwards for 1 10 6 days 2 738 years in the transient flow field induced by the drainage eqs 2 6 a tracking time duration of 3 10 6 days in the initial fully saturated steady state groundwater flow is close to the longest residence time of the steady state flow field that can be identified with the largest spatial density of particles that our computational capacity can support support information text s1 and fig s1 in the forward tracking particles are released during the progression of the simulation and each particle is used to represent a volume of about v p 0 2 m3 recharge assuming a 10 m width for the cross section in the y direction this is equivalent to about 1 2 million particles to fill the model domain the choice of v p 0 2 m3 is a trade off between computational capacity and achieving smooth enough baseflow residence time distributions rtds the actual recharge volume represented by each particle is adjusted to ensure that an integer number of particles are released during each modflow time step text s2 presents the details of the particle releasing strategy a total number of 82 004 388 and 92 084 407 particles are used for the simulations under the extreme and mild drought scenarios respectively particle tracking is performed using modpath version 6 pollock 2012 modpath tracks numerical particles in the groundwater flow field using a semi analytical tracking algorithm particle velocities across cell faces are calculated using darcy s law based on hydraulic heads from the solution to the groundwater flow problem section 2 3 and an effective porosity ϕ 0 03 a bilinear interpolation is used to calculate particle velocity within each cell and analytical formulas are derived for the particle travel time and exit location in each cell only advective transport is simulated by the particle tracking and dispersion and reaction are ignored the readers are referred to pollock 2012 for more details about the algorithm the pre and post processing for modflow and modpath modeling are assisted by the python package flopy bakker et al 2016 the groundwater age distribution and groundwater residence time distribution rtd are calculated for any time of interest as the probability distribution of groundwater age and groundwater residence time associated with particles with the probability of particle age proportional to the volume of recharge represented by the particle then we can get 14 s pt τ t t pid ω s τ t t pt v pid 15 s pt t pid ω s t pt v pid and 16 q pt τ t t pid ω q τ t t pt v pid 17 q pt t pid ω q t pt v pid where v pid is the water volume associated with the particle numbered pid s pt τ t t is the total volume l3 of water parcels associated with particles in storage with age less than t at time t s pt t is the total volume l3 of water parcels associated with all particles in storage at time t q pt τ t t is the total volume of water parcels associated with particles with residence time less than t and exiting some discharge region of interest per unit time l3 t 1 at time t q pt t is the total volume of water parcels associated with all particles exiting the discharge region of interest per unit time l3 t 1 at time t ω s τ t t pt is the index set of particles in storage and with age less than t at time t ω s t pt is the index set of all particles in storage at time t ω q τ t t pt is the index set of particles with residence time less than t and exiting some discharge region of interest in ω 1 out ω q t pt is the index set of all particles exiting the discharge region of interest in ω 1 out then the groundwater age distribution and groundwater rtd in the form of cumulative distribution function at any time t can be estimated as 18 p s t t s pt τ t t s pt t 19 p q t t q pt τ t t q pt t theoretically eqs 16 17 and 19 can be used to calculate baseflow rtd at any time instant t practically due to the discrete nature of the solution technique and the limit on the number of particles set by the computational capacity the number of particles exiting the domain at any time instant t can be small and the calculated baseflow rtd can be coarse so the baseflow rtds presented later in figs 5 7 are calculated in time intervals selected using the strategy documented in text s3 2 6 storage selection function storage selection sas function relates the age distribution of storage within and the rtd of flux out of a watershed it s used as a closure relationship in lumped watershed scale modeling of conservative solute transport and can be interpreted in terms of a watershed s preference for discharging water of different ages three slightly different but closely related formulations of sas function exist in the literature botter et al 2011 van der velde et al 2012 harman 2015 in this paper we use the concept of absolute storage selection asas function botter et al 2011 in our description of the solute retention mixing and releasing behavior of the multiscale gwfs in the context of our paper the asas function at any time t can be calculated as the quotient between the probability density functions of the residence time of baseflow and the age of groundwater in storage 20 ω q t t p q t t p s t t dp q t t dt dp s t t dt where p q t t and p s t t are the probability density functions of baseflow residence time and groundwater age respectively 2 7 flushing intensity flushing intensity zlotnik et al 2011 gomez velez et al 2014 is an integrated measure of the capacity of the groundwater flow field to transport water mass by advection at different depths and is defined by 21 f z 1 s s q x 2 x q y 2 x q z 2 x ds where z is depth below land surface l q x q y q z are components of the darcy flux l t s is the area of the layer over which the magnitude of flux is integrated l2 flushing intensity provides a quantitative measure of the groundwater flow field strength at different depths we compare flushing intensity at different time instants of the drainage to indicate the change of the relative strength of the groundwater flow cells of different scales at different depths fig s4 2 8 discharge sensitivity analysis assuming no water flow across the lateral boundaries of a watershed water balance of the watershed can be described as 22 ds dt p et q where s is storage l3 t is time t p is precipitation l3 t et is evapotranspiration l3 t and q is discharge l3 t from the watershed outlet the discharge sensitivity 23 g q dq ds is a lumped measure of the relationship between s within and q out of a watershed which are two fundamental and interactively related components of water balance of a watershed g q is controlled by watershed landscape conditions such as topography and hydrogeology e g brutsaert and nieber 1977 zecharias and brutsaert 1988 zecharias and brutsaert 1988 biswal and marani 2010 mutzner et al 2013 berghuijs et al 2016 it is a characteristic function of watersheds and can serve as a closure relationship to solve a watershed scale water balance equation for lumped rainfall runoff modeling e g kirchner 2009 a conceptual explanation of discharge sensitivity can be found in text s4 for readers who are not familiar with this concept while calculating g q eq 22 from model output at discrete time steps the change of discharge and storage between two consecutive time steps can be approximated as dq q t δ t q t and ds s t δ t s t respectively since the 2 d cross sectional domain ω used in this study fig 1a can be viewed as half of a transverse cross section of a 3 d basin fig 1 cardenas 2007 then subwatershed 5 only captures half of the groundwater flow draining into the main stream for this reason the discharge from subwatershed 5 q 5 and the drainable storage of the model domain s are both doubled before discharge sensitivity analysis so the discharge sensitivity for subwatersheds and the entire domain as a function of twice the total discharge from the entire domain ω are calculated in this study as 24 g i q t dq i d 2 s 1 2 dq i ds i 1 2 3 4 25 g 5 q t d 2 q 5 d 2 s dq 5 ds 26 g q t d 2 i 1 5 q i d 2 s i 1 5 dq i ds where q i i 1 2 3 4 5 represent baseflow discharge from different subwatershed areas shown in fig 1a q t 2 i 1 5 q i denotes twice the discharge from the entire model domain ω s denotes the drainable storage within ω fig 1a 2 9 nondimensionalization and scaling the dimensionless results presented in section 3 are obtained by dividing variables by their corresponding characteristic values the total discharge q 0 54 7 m3 day and the total drainable storage s 0 2 6 10 5 m3 i e the total pore volume in the domain above the lowest drainage point for the entire domain ω of the fully saturated steady state model eqs 7 9 are used to calculate the characteristic values for discharge q c storage s c and time t c following the consideration of domain symmetry in the last paragraph of section 2 8 we use q c 2 q 0 and s c 2 s 0 the fully saturated steady state turnover time of the total drainable storage s 0 q 0 is used as the characteristic time scale t c 4 782 days this time scale is used to non dimensionalize drainage time baseflow residence time and groundwater age the dimensionless discharge storage and time are then calculated as q q q c s s s c and t t t c respectively dimensionless discharge sensitivity is calculated as g i q t dq i d 2 s d q i q c d 2 s s c t c dq i d 2 s t c g i q t for i 1 2 3 4 and g 5 q t d 2 q 5 d 2 s d 2 q 5 q c d 2 s s c t c dq 5 ds t c g 5 q t we choose the wavelength λ and half the amplitude a 0 2 of the local topographic relief as characteristic values for the length scale and hydraulic head respectively the value of hydraulic conductivity k is selected to be the characteristic value for specific discharge darcy velocity k λ is used as the characteristic value for the stream function the dimensionless results presented below apply to other property values and recharge rates in addition to those given above to do so the spatial geometry must remain the same the values of k r c d and ϕ can change but they must change together so that their relative ratios remain the same 3 results and discussion 3 1 baseflow from multiscale groundwater flow system in this subsection we analyze the baseflow recession characterized by discharge and discharge sensitivity and the evolution of the groundwater flow field including the changing shape and position of the water table and the reorganization of the gwfs characterized by hydraulic head and streamlines for the three drought scenarios we show that the changes in the baseflow recession behavior is closely related to the evolution of the gwfs and that the flow paths of different scales play different roles in baseflow generation 3 1 1 evolution of multiscale groundwater flow system the evolution of the gwfs is characterized by the changing shape of the water table the disconnections of the water table from subwatersheds i e when the water table beneath a subwatershed completely drops below the land surface and the reorganization of the flow field an animation of the drainage process is provided in the supporting information movie s1 illustrating the sequential disconnection of the water table from subwatersheds 1 to 4 under the extreme drought scenario at the beginning of the drainage the water table closely follows the topography and has local and watershed scale relief mimicing that of the land surface topography fig 2 a the gwfs can be subdivided into different flow cells first the local scale flow cells are delineated by streamlines connecting hills and neighbouring valleys second the intermediate scale flow cells are delineated by streamlines connecting upstream hills and downstream valleys third the watershed scale flow cell carries flow from the highest hill to the mainstream as the drainage progresses the water table drops and flattens and the penetration depth of the local scale flow cells decreases figs 2 s2 and s3 respectively for the extreme moderate and mild droughts note that to make it easier to read the paper when figs s2 and s3 are cross referenced in company with fig 2 it s not mandatory for the readers to look at figs s2 and s3 in these cases fig 2 is sufficient to support our discussion with figs s2 and s3 providing additional examples and evidence the flushing intensity of the shallow groundwater flow field decreases faster than does the deeper intensity fig s4b indicating that the flow field becomes more controlled by the deep watershed scale flow component which is driven by the watershed scale water table slope also notice that the groundwater subwatershed divides are biased towards the upstream right side of the hills due to the influence of the watershed scale water table slope figs 2 s2 and s3 the groundwater watershed divides also migrate further to the upstream right side of the hills as the drainage progresses this means that groundwater contributing to baseflow can cross surface drainage divides and the sources can evolve during a baseflow recession event this challenges the single hillslope conceptualization widely used to study baseflow recession behavior e g troch et al 2013 the evolution of the groundwater flow field is also characterized by the disappearance of the local flow cells and the merging of the local groundwater flow field into the deeper watershed scale groundwater flow field e g notice the change of the local groundwater flow field near the drainage area of subwatershed 1 shown in figs 2c and 2d s2c and s2d as is discussed in the following subsections these features of the gwfs evolution explain features in baseflow recession behavior and the evolution of its rtd 3 1 2 similar dissimilar baseflow recession behavior from different subwatersheds the decreasing pattern of subwatershed discharge q i t and the magnitude of discharge sensitivity g i q t i 1 2 5 for subwatersheds 1 5 are very similar for different subwatersheds during drainage stage i which takes place before subwatershed 1 dries up figs 3 s5 and s6 despite differences in the rate of recharge during the drought the similarity of g i q t is a result of the similar hydraulic response of local subwatershed scale flow cells to the drought during this early stage of the drainage this is revealed by the similar spatial patterns of hydraulic head contours and instantaneous streamlines near the discharge regions of subwatersheds 1 5 figs 2a and 2b s2a and s2b s3 at any time instant the discharge discharge sensitivity and the change of water table shape are determined by the instantaneous shape of the water table and the topography where the water table remains attached to the land surface eqs 4 and 5 the similar patterns of the local scale flow cells can be attributed to the similar undulations of the local water table which is a subdued imitation of the local topographic relief figs 2a and 2b s2a and s2b s3 this indicates the dominant control of local landscape and groundwater flow field on baseflow discharge dynamics during the early stage of recession for drainage under the extreme drought scenario after the disconnection of water table from subwatershed 2 at the end of drainage stage ii the discharge sensitivity g i q t i 3 4 5 for the subwatersheds start to deviate more from each other fig 3d complex shapes for g 4 q t and g 5 q t emerge after subwatershed 3 dries up at the end of drainage stage iii similar evolution patterns of g i q t occur during drainage stages ii and iii under the moderate drought figs 3e and s6 additionally the deviation of g i q t i 1 2 3 4 5 from each other becomes more dramatic as the watershed scale topographic slope m 1 increases not shown in a domain with relatively gentle watershed scale topographic slope the local scale flow cells during the early stage of the drainage are driven more by local water table undulations which mimic local topographic relief figs 2a and 2b s2a and s2b s3 and are less influenced by the watershed scale water table slope this leads to similar discharge processes from different subwatersheds as discussed in the paragraph above however at later stages of the drainage figs 2c 2o s2c s2i or for watersheds with relatively large watershed scale topographic slope not shown the gwfs is influenced more by the watershed scale water table slope fig s4b in this situation baseflow generation becomes scale dependent and distinct recession behaviors occur for upstream and downstream subwatersheds this is because despite the potentially similar local water table undulations and local flow cells drainage locations of upstream and downstream subwatersheds tap different positions e g downwelling and upwelling flow regions of the deeper watershed scale groundwater flow field and thus have different discharge patterns after the disconnection of water table from subwatershed 4 under the extreme drought the discharge sensitivity of subwatershed 5 stays nearly constant as discharge further decreases and mimics the discharge recession behavior of a linear reservoir stage v in fig 3d in fact during this period of the drainage the water table has little local undulation and the groundwater flow is primarily driven by the essentially horizontal hydraulic head gradient induced by the large scale remnant watershed scale water table slope figs 2m 2o s4 the groundwater flow during this period can be approximately described by a linearized dupuit boussinesq equation brutsaert and nieber 1977 troch et al 2013 the above analysis indicates that in watersheds with a multiscale gwfs baseflow generation cannot be viewed as simply occurring within hillslopes or conceptualized as drainage from hillslopes overlying horizontal or inclined impermeable bedrocks deep groundwater circulation through the large watershed scale flow system can lead to different baseflow generation behaviors e g baseflow discharge rate or solute concentration for upstream and downstream subwatersheds as is supported by evidence from natural watersheds e g frisbee et al 2011 frisbee et al 2017 peralta tapia et al 2015 ameli et al 2018 asano et al 2020 furthermore the importance of the large scale groundwater flow paths increases as the watersheds become drier such as in late recession stages or in arid regions existing observation based baseflow recession studies focus mostly on relatively short recession time scales and narrow discharge ranges e g recession between rainfall events or seasons kirchner 2009 teuling et al 2010 ajami et al 2011 so oftentimes only a relatively simple segment of g q is observed but we need to be cautious if we attempt to use the observed simple g q segment beyond the q observation ranges since as shown by our results dramatic changes of the functional form of g q can exist due to the evolving relative importance of flow paths of different scales 3 1 3 effect of water table disconnection and gwfs reorganization on baseflow recession disconnections of water table from the land surface in lower order subwatersheds are accompanied by abrupt changes of the discharge sensitivity g i q t of the higher order subwatersheds fig 3d and 3e specifically before drainage stage iv under the extreme drought fig 3d and and drainage stage iii under the moderate drought fig 3e the slopes of discharge sensitivity of downstream subwatersheds increase when water table disconnects from upstream subwatersheds the disconnection of water table from subwatersheds does not occur for the mild drought these phenomena happen because the water table disconnections from subwatersheds cause abrupt changes in the pattern of water table evolution and the reorganization of the gwfs we use disconnections of the water table from subwatershed 1 under the extreme and moderate droughts to elaborate this point figs 2a 2d s2a s2d before the disconnection of water table from subwatershed 1 the drainage is accompanied by the lowering and flattening of the local water table mounds between drainage regions of neighbouring subwatersheds the local water table mounds induce separate local flow cells transporting water toward drainage regions on the two sides of each water table mound figs 2a 2c s2a s2c the larger watershed scale shape of the water table is barely influenced because the water table is pinned at the drainage regions in each subwatershed i e a topographic constraint on the water table the drainage and baseflow recession behavior as reflected by the discharge sensitivity function evolve gradually and smoothly during the time period before the first disconnection at the end of drainage stage i figs 3d and 3e when the water table disconnects from subwatershed 1 the two local scale components of the gwfs on the two sides of outlet 1 disappear and the local flow field near outlet 1 becomes part of the larger watershed scale flow component figs 2c and 2d s2c and s2d the water table between outlets 1 and 2 and the water table upstream of outlet 1 now evolve together water table disconnections from subwatersheds change the shape of the larger watershed scale water table and reorganize the gwfs thus perturbing baseflow recession behavior in downstream subwatersheds these phenomena indicate that in watersheds where multiscale gwfss exist e g mountainous watersheds with deep and permeable bedrock flow cells of the gwfs supplying baseflow to individual subwatersheds interact with one another baseflow generation in different subwatersheds should not be treated as being independent 3 2 baseflow residence time and groundwater age under the extreme drought scenario joint analysis of baseflow recession from both a groundwater hydraulic perspective by analyzing the groundwater flow field baseflow discharge and storage discharge relationship and a solute transport perspective by analyzing groundwater age baseflow residence time and selective drainage of water of different ages provides a more holistic view of the watershed s functioning in storing and releasing water and solutes mcdonnell and beven 2014 discharge is driven by the instantaneous hydraulic head potential energy gradient of water stored in the watershed discharge sensitivity tells us the relative magnitude of discharge change caused by the change of storage and potential energy gradient which are a result of the net flux in out of the watershed discharge and discharge sensitivity provide measures of the hydraulic response of the watershed but contain no information about the evolving baseflow source and water quality baseflow residence time distribution rtd measures the age composition of water parcels in the baseflow and indicates whether baseflow comes from nearby riparian zones hillslopes arriving through short flow paths or from faraway mountains arriving through long and deep flow paths or both baseflow rtd together with the age distribution of groundwater in storage indicate how watersheds selectively drain groundwater of different ages from flow paths of different scales baseflow rtd and groundwater age distribution analyses provide an explicit view of how the multiscale gwfs influences baseflow generation and elucidates the important role of deep groundwater circulation here we examine these issues in detail for the case of an extreme drought with no recharge 3 2 1 spatiotemporal evolution of groundwater age the spatial distribution of groundwater age at the beginning of the drainage shows distinct age zones associated with the local and watershed scale flow paths induced by the local relief amplitudes and the watershed scale topographic slope fig 4 a the local scale gwfs components are mainly composed of relatively young water and have similar spatial patterns of groundwater age in different subwatersheds this is a result of the similar steady state groundwater flow patterns in the local flow cells at the beginning of the drainage due to the same climate condition local relief and homogeneous hydraulic conductivity fig 2a however due to the downwelling of the deep watershed scale flow field near the headwater and upwelling near the main stream the young age zone of local scale flow cells near the headwater extends deeper into the modeling domain than those near the main stream e g fig 4a the water flowing through the deep watershed scale flow field ages from the headwater to the main stream fig 4 this is trivially true but has significant implications for understanding baseflow generation and source at the watershed scale the portion of baseflow contributed by the local scale flow cells may have similar rtd at different subwatersheds however the portion of baseflow contributed by the deep watershed scale flow field can have very different rtd for upstream and downstream subwatersheds e g increasingly heavier tail at large residence time from upstream to downstream as is discussed in the following section the deep watershed scale flow cell has been hypothesized as a direct contribution to the observed water aging and increasing baseflow mineral solute concentration from upstream to downstream in natural watersheds with deep and permeable bedrock indicating the importance of deep groundwater circulation in streamflow generation and conceptualization e g frisbee et al 2011 frisbee et al 2017 peralta tapia et al 2015 during the entire drainage process the gwfs experiences aging and the local scale flow cells are stretched downstream by the deeper watershed scale flow field fig 4 but the main spatial pattern of groundwater age inherited from the initial steady state groundwater flow field is preserved this age pattern as determined by past hydrological conditions before the drainage marks the organization and evolution of the gwfs and explains the evolving baseflow rtd during the drainage section 3 2 2 due to factors such as hydrogeologic heterogeneity topographic complexity spatial variations and intermittency of precipitation events and climatic variations at different spatial temporal scales the spatial pattern of groundwater age at the beginning of baseflow recession in natural watersheds is typically more complex than what is presented in fig 4a however we are not attempting to reproduce the complex groundwater age distribution and baseflow rtd observed in natural watersheds rather we use groundwater age distribution and baseflow rtd as indicators markers for the evolution of the multiscale components of the gwfs in order to reveal their role in baseflow generation we focus on the relationships between the multiscale gwfs and baseflow generation rather than the detailed composition of the water our conclusions don t depend on the specific patterns of groundwater age distribution or baseflow rtd which are manifestations of the accumulated effect of recharge subsurface mixing and discharge that the watershed has experienced in the past even for a system with more complex age patterns and more complex baseflow rtd the timing and proportion of the contribution of the multiscale components of the gwfs to baseflow and baseflow recession behavior are determined by the system hydraulic conditions at the beginning of and during the drainage process rather than by the specific patterns of groundwater age distribution or baseflow rtd which are formed during the history of the watershed before the recession event the fully saturated steady state groundwater flow field used as the initial condition for the drainage in our model can represent a long term average groundwater flow condition this is particularly true in a humid watershed where the groundwater table closely follows land surface topography but it also can apply to semiarid climates with enhanced recharge at higher elevations wilson and guan 2004 stephens and umstot 2019 the initial groundwater age pattern although simple and lacking of the more detailed age patterns induced by complex meteorological perturbations and subsurface mixing represents the overall long term average age pattern the relatively simple age pattern associated with flow cells of different scales clearly marks and delineates these different flow cells and traces the role of the gwfs in baseflow generation which serves to meet our research purpose although adding more complexity might reveal more interesting subsurface mixing phenomena the specificity of the complexity is not relevant to our research purpose and can obscure the generality we want to achieve in this study 3 2 2 evolution of baseflow residence time distribution and sources the temporal evolution and spatial patterns of groundwater age is directly related to the evolution of baseflow rtd figs 5 and s9 during the first stage of the drainage i e from the beginning of the drainage to the disconnection of water table from subwatershed 1 subwatersheds 1 3 have very similar baseflow rtd figs 5 a c i and s9 the similarity in rtd is a result of the similar spatial patterns of the gwfs directly supplying baseflow to subwatersheds 1 3 figs 2a 2c 4a 4c the rtd is characterized by one mode spanning young residence times this is caused by the dominating contribution of local scale flow paths to baseflow figs 4a 4c and 8a as can be seen from the baseflow source areas annotated by i i i 1 2 3 in fig 8a for this first drainage stage baseflow is primarily contributed by young groundwater beneath the drainage area as a result of the downstream aging and increasing contribution to baseflow of water flowing through the regional scale flow paths the rtds from higher order subwatersheds have longer tails at large residence times figs 5d i and 5e i although the overall shape of the rtds is similar to that for subwatersheds 1 3 however a gap i e a horizontal segment in the rtds and a jump following the gap can be found around a residence time of 100 t c this is because subwatersheds 4 and 5 directly tap the upwelling region of the deep watershed scale flow field and gain a larger proportion of baseflow from the old water in that flow field figs 4a 4c and 8a the temporal change of rtds is small during the first stage of the drainage but with a slight shift of the mode toward younger residence times figs 5 a f i and s9 this indicates an increasing proportion of younger baseflow from local scale flow cells during the second stage of the drainage the shape and the evolution patterns of rtd for subwatersheds 2 4 figs 5 b d ii are similar to that during the first drainage stage however rtd for subwatershed 5 shows an increase in the weight of the mode at a residence time of about 300 t c fig 5e ii indicating an increasing proportion to baseflow from regional scale flow paths fig 8a during stages iii v of the drainage the temporal evolution of rtd for subwatersheds 4 and 5 is dominated by the natural aging of groundwater as indicated by the shift of the rtd toward large residence times figs 5d iii 5d iv 5e iii 5e iv and 5e v the relative probability mass covered by the two modes at relatively young and old residence times changes little as shown by the unchanging vertical rises of the rtd curves preceding and following the horizontal gap at around 100 t c e g fig 5e iv this indicates that the relative contribution to baseflow by local and regional scale flow paths is stable probably due to the stable relative magnitude of the flushing intensity of the local and regional scale flow cells at this late stage of the drainage fig s4a the evolution of baseflow rtd figs 5 and s9 reveals the changing proportions of young old groundwater in supplying baseflow caused by the reorganization and changing relative strengths of flow cells of different scales in the gwfs figs 2 and s4 unlike the discharge sensitivity no abrupt changes of rtd occur when the water table disconnects from the various subwatersheds fig 5 a hydraulic perturbation is revealed immediately in water discharge and solute export rate mcdonnell and beven 2014 but the solute composition of discharge as indicated by rtd is determined by both the composition of water available to be discharged and the proportion of discharge from water of different compositions in storage one way to describe the selective discharge of groundwater of different compositions is the storage selection sas function eq 20 e g harman 2015 contrasting fig 4c with 4d 4f with 4g 4i with 4j and 4l with 4m shows that there are no immediate or dramatic changes of groundwater age or its spatial pattern when the water table disconnections occur so the relatively stable rtd before and after a water table disconnection indicates that the sas function is not dramatically perturbed at the time of a water table disconnection although water table disconnections do not cause sudden changes of sas functions and flow paths the water table disconnection and the accompanied gwfs reorganization cause the evolution of flow paths to be different from that before the disconnection which is reflected in the different evolution schemes of rtd before and after water table disconnections e g compare fig 5d ii with 5d iii 5e i with 5e ii and 5e ii with 5e iii this is especially true for high order subwatersheds the different rtd evolution schemes are related to the changes in baseflow sources due to the evolution of the multiscale gwfs baseflow during different stages of the drainage is mainly from groundwater storage close to the drainage areas fig 8a rather than entirely from hillslope storage that assumes an impermeable bedrock underlying hillslopes e g fig 2 in pauritsch et al 2015 during the first stage of the drainage baseflow is mainly from storage below the drainage areas of each subwatershed zones labeled i i in fig 8a for i 1 2 3 4 5 a large proportion of the drained storage is from the local flow cells and a small proportion is from the upwelling of the larger watershed scale flow cell into subwatershed 5 fig 8a the evolving proportions and timing of water drained from local and watershed scale flow cells contribute to the evolution scheme of baseflow rtd figs 5 a e i as the drainage progresses the source regions for baseflow expand radially outward from each of the drainage areas fig 8a for subwatersheds 1 4 the storage near and below the peaks of the hills never drains out as local baseflow from these subwatersheds but instead as the water table drops flows deeper into the domain and becomes part of the deep watershed scale component of the gwfs fig 2 this portion of water storage eventually subsidizes the main stream as is also indicated by observations and modeling in natural watersheds manning and solomon 2005 manning 2011 rumsey et al 2015 ameli et al 2018 also notice that due to the bias of the groundwater watershed divides toward the upstream direction under the influence of the watershed scale water table slope fig 2 hillslopes of the same shape on the two sides of the stream don t contribute equally to baseflow fig 8a 3 3 baseflow residence time and groundwater age under the moderate and mild drought scenarios the shape and evolution patterns of rtd under the moderate and mild drought scenarios differ from that under the extreme drought mainly in the late drainage period as the flow fields under different drought scenarios asymptotically approach different steady state flow fields figs 5 7 for these two less severe drought scenarios the complexity of the final steady state baseflow rtd increases from upstream to downstream figs 6 and 7 moreover both the moderate and mild droughts produce more complex final steady state rtds than does the extreme drought as is reflected by the number of modes in the rtd s approaching final steady states figs 5 7 under the moderate and mild droughts flow paths of a wide range of scales all play important roles in contributing to baseflow especially at the late period of the drought and or in higher order subwatersheds while during the early period of a drought or for lower order subwatersheds local scale flow cells dominate the contribution to baseflow and thus produce less complex rtds during the first drainage stage under the moderate drought the spatial distribution of baseflow sources is similar to that under the extreme drought figs 8a and 8 b baseflow is entirely contributed by water in storage that is recharged before the start of the drought for both the moderate and extreme droughts the second drainage stage under the drought is defined as the time interval between the disconnections of water table from subwatershed 1 and 2 however compared to the extreme drought more young water in storage contributes to baseflow during the second drainage stage under the moderate drought figs 8a and 8b this is because the second drainage stage under the moderate drought t 1 5 4 1 see plot label in fig s2 persists for a much longer time than does the second drainage stage under the extreme drought t 1 2 2 1 see plot label in fig 2 the slower declining water table sustained by the recharge drives more young water out of the domain as baseflow for higher order subwatersheds during the third drainage stage under the moderate drought fig 8b and during the entire drainage stage under the mild drought fig 8c a significant amount of groundwater contributing to baseflow to individual subwatersheds is from inter subwatershed upstream regions this explains the complex baseflow rtd during these drainage stages figs 6 and 7 during the second and third drainage stages under the moderate drought and during the entire drainage stage under the mild drought baseflow is contributed by both water in storage at the beginning of the drought and new recharge occuring after the beginning of the drought bottom and top parts respectively of the panels shown in figs 8b and 8c for any one specific subwatershed new recharge from both within and without the subwatershed contributes to baseflow the multiscale gwfs breaks the barriers of the topographic divide between subwatersheds and makes baseflow source identification discharge and water quality prediction much more complex 3 4 implications for the conceptualization of baseflow generation the conceptualization of baseflow generation is widely used to interpret baseflow recession behavior and identify controlling factors infer watershed hydrogeologic and geomorphic parameters based on discharge observations and parameterize the baseflow component in conceptual hydrological models when using hydraulic groundwater theory see e g troch et al 2013 for a review to interpret baseflow recession behavior and infer watershed scale equivalent hydrogeologic parameters it is traditionally assumed that discharge from the entire watershed is a simple aggregation of simultaneous discharging processes from identical hillslopes arranged in parallel along the stream network brutsaert and nieber 1977 rupp and selker 2006 harman et al 2009 relax the identical hillslope assumption and show that the heterogeneity of recession time scales of individual hillslopes can generate the range of recession slope curves observed in nature however harman et al 2009 still conceptually assume that individual hillslopes are arranged in parallel and have no interactions with each other our results from physically based modeling clearly demonstrate that baseflow discharge processes from different hillslopes or different subwatersheds are not independent if they are supplied by a multiscale gwfs where flow paths of multiple scales can interact with each other biswal and marani 2010 relate watershed stream network structure to baseflow recession characteristics moving one step forward beyond the traditional focus on hillslope scale dynamics while studying baseflow generation they show the relation between the contraction of an active drainage stream network and watershed scale baseflow recession characteristics under the following assumptions 1 baseflow during recession varies slowly in time and can be described by a succession of steady states 2 discharge processes from hillslopes along unit width stream segments are identical in their words spatially constant 3 active stream heads recede at constant speed a close examination of the second and third assumptions reveals some contradiction if discharge processes from hillslopes are spatially constant i e identical and synchronized then how can the stream network dry up gradually from upstream to downstream different segments of the entire stream network should dry up at the same pace when the discharge into all stream segments approaches zero synchronically based on our results and some additional thought experiments the most questionable assumption which leads to the contradiction is the second one that assumes that discharge into per unit length stream segment is spatially constant this assumption of being spatially constant prohibits the study of the impact of any spatial structure on baseflow recession their first assumption remedies the contradiction all three assumptions together actually conceptualize watershed scale baseflow recession as the successive and sudden shutting down of discharge from unit width stream segments along the stream network from upstream to downstream if we conceptualize the water table in a watershed as a connected entirety with the stream water stage being the groundwater water table in the stream e g winter et al 1998 then the receding of active stream heads during the dry season is a manifestation of the lowering of water table at the watershed scale which is likely to occur in sloping basins as stated by biswal and marani 2010 thus recognizing the importance of the dynamics of the multiscale gwfs in addition to the dynamics of baseflow from individual hillslopes is essential for understanding the control of watershed scale geomorphological structure on baseflow generation and recession behavior e g wang et al 2018 the assumptions used in the above cited studies are more appropriate for watersheds with shallow impermeable bedrock and gentle watershed scale topographic slope the role of nested multiscale gwfs is rarely considered in baseflow generation studies our modeling suggests that assuming discharge processes from hillslopes to be identical and independent is likely inappropriate for watersheds with deep and permeable bedrock and multiscale topographic relief e g frisbee et al 2017 ameli et al 2018 these types of watersheds are often found in mountainous headwater regions with fractured bedrock wilson and guan 2004 gleeson and manning 2008 welch and allen 2014 the interactions of multiscale components of the gwfs and their evolving role in baseflow generation can make the baseflow generation behavior significantly different from that of individual hillslopes or aggregations of hillslopes in a 3 d watershed topography is hierarchically organized with lower order subwatersheds overlying and embedded in higher order subwatersheds the hillslopes of subwatersheds of different orders usually have different wavelengths amplitudes and orientations rodríguez iturbe and rinaldo 1997 perron et al 2008 under ideal climatic and hydrogeologic conditions the water table can be a subdued imitation of the land surface topography e g tóth 1963 freeze and witherspoon 1966 the water table relief thus shares the multiscale nature of the land surface topography and can be viewed as a linear combination of undulations at different spatial scales with different amplitudes and orientations e g wörman et al 2006 wörman et al 2007 the water table gradient beneath the hillslopes and the underlying 3 d groundwater flow directions do not have to be along the sloping directions of the lowest order hillslopes the influence of the evolving watershed scale water table relief must be taken into account when interpreting baseflow recession at the watershed scale and building conceptual baseflow models in many rainfall runoff models baseflow generation is conceptualized as discharge processes from single or multiple reservoirs arranged sequentially or in parallel and is parameterized as linear or nonlinear storage discharge relationships e g gelhar and wilson 1974 clark et al 2008 luo et al 2012 stoelzle et al 2015 our results show that baseflow generation behavior as characterized by the storage discharge relationship is not static but changes as the watershed wetness condition changes moreover even with the same local hydrogeologic and geomorphic conditions subwatersheds with different deep watershed scale or even inter watershed scale groundwater flow conditions can have significantly different baseflow generation behavior in other words the baseflow generation behavior of individual watersheds is determined not only by their within watershed landscape and climate conditions but also influenced by the landscape and climate conditions of the higher order watersheds encompassing them this calls for caution in the regionalization of rainfall runoff model structures to ungauged basins based only on physiographic and or meteorological attributes e g yadav et al 2007 santhi et al 2008 3 5 simplifications limitations and future study a 2 d sinusoidal topography with a linear regional slope is used for our model domain this topographic configuration although simple incorporates the general undulating and multiscale features of natural topography and drives the formation of a multiscale gwfs with nested flow paths adding complexity to the topography can correspondingly increase the complexity of the groundwater flow field but will also make the topography and thus the topography driven groundwater flow field more unique and specific to a certain type of landscape and make the conclusions less universal and harder to transcend place compared to 2 d cross sectional models 3 d watershed models can incorporate the 3 d features of landscapes such as the stream network and diverse hillslope plain view shapes and can simulate more complex 3 d groundwater flow fields baseflow recession behavior influenced by stream network patterns and the interaction between groundwater table and 3 d topography e g the drying up of the stream network godsey and kirchner 2014 should be studied in the future the homogeneous hydraulic conductivity field used in our simulations does not incorporate geological features such as a shallow highly permeable soil and weathered bedrock a change of bedrock permeability with depth e g due to compression hydrostratigraphic layering or structural features such as faults we choose to use a single homogeneous hydraulic conductivity scenario for three reasons first a shallow highly permeable zone is important to baseflow generation in some but not all natural watersheds there are also many places where shallow soil and highly weathered bedrock is uncommon or do not exist for example bedrock watersheds with no unconsolidated soils are common in the western us such as the sierra nevadas and the coastal ranges of california e g the sandstones of the santa ynez mountains watersheds with little weathered bedrock at the top are also common in the carbonates of florida and door county wisconsin in any event the conditions simulated here are also equivalent to hilly terrain with silty sands silt loess or glacial till aquifers even without rescaling second our focus is on the contributions of deeper components of the gwfs to baseflow including the flow paths at the scales of hillslopes and deeper flow paths at larger inter subwatershed and watershed scales although we simplify the shallow soil and weathered bedrock zone we do consider a wide spectrum of flow paths from hillslope scale to watershed scale third using a single hydraulic conductivity scenario also helps us to better focus on demonstrating and improving our mechanistic understanding of the role of multiscale groundwater flow paths in watershed scale baseflow generation a shallow highly permeable zone could allow preferential groundwater flow at the early stage of the drainage and potentially further distinguish the contributions of shallow and deep flow paths to baseflow our modeling and analysis framework can be extended in the future to implement a depth decaying permeability profile that potentially addresses some of these issues 4 summary conclusions and implications in this paper we study baseflow generation and recession behavior in watersheds with deep and permeable bedrock this special landscape setting favors the development of a groundwater flow system gwfs with deep as well as shallow flow components which can play an important role in stream baseflow generation we analyze numerically simulated baseflow generation and the gwfs in a 2 d cross section of an idealized watershed for three different prolonged droughts leading to three different examples of water table disconnections from subwatersheds baseflow discharge and residence time distribution rtd as well as the groundwater flow field and groundwater age distribution are analyzed to understand the dynamics of baseflow and the multiscale gwfs during prolonged droughts fig 9 the changes of baseflow discharge sensitivity and rtd as indicators of watershed scale baseflow generation and solute export characteristics are explained by the evolution of the groundwater flow field the interactions among flow components of different scales in the gwfs and the evolving shape and position of water table and its disconnections from subwatersheds fig 9 based on our analysis we conclude that flow paths of different spatial and temporal scales of the gwfs interactively influence baseflow generation but with distinct and evolving roles during the sequential stages of the drainage and for each subwatershed depending on the relative strength of the flow paths and the relative positions of the subwatersheds to the recharge discharge zones of the watershed scale flow paths during the early stage of the drainage baseflow recession in all subwatersheds is primarily influenced by the local subwatershed scale flow paths which contribute young water originating from recharge in the nearby hillslope areas to the baseflow the baseflow discharge sensitivity function has a power law form which matches the behavior recorded by field observations as the drainage progresses the lowering of the water table the flattening of local water table undulations and the disconnection of water table from subwatersheds diminish local subwatershed scale flow paths and their relative importance in shaping baseflow recession behavior during this period of the drainage the watershed scale deep component of the gwfs takes more and more control of baseflow generation contributing a larger proportion of older water to baseflow and leading to more complex baseflow recession behavior as the drainage progresses the evolving multiscale components of the gwfs and their changing relative strength and contribution to baseflow generation lead to increasingly dissimilar baseflow discharge sensitivity and rtd from different subwatersheds despite their similar landscape and climate conditions and produce spatial scale dependent baseflow generation behavior during the early stage of the drainage the local subwatershed scale components of the gwfs have similar hydraulic head and age patterns due to the same local topographic relief climate and geology this similarity in early stage subwatershed scale flow component contributes to similar discharge recession behavior and rtd of baseflow from lower order subwatersheds the highest order subwatershed is strongly influenced by the deep watershed scale component of the gwfs and has the most distinct rtd patterns during the early stage of the drainage the different positions of subwatersheds relative to watershed scale downwelling and upwelling flow zones strengthens the dissimilarity in baseflow recession behavior and rtd among different subwatersheds especially during the later stages of the drainage the influence of the deep watershed scale component of the gwfs on baseflow generation is most significant in the highest order subwatershed and is evident even in the early stages of drainage when the watershed topographic slope increases this scale dependent influence of the watershed scale flow component becomes more obvious not shown and can have more significant effect on baseflow generation in all subwatersheds even during the early stage of the drainage we earlier noted section 2 1 that the different drought induced drainage stages modeled in this study can also be used to represent the average drainage conditions and their responses to droughts for otherwise similar watersheds in different climates with similar topography and geology watersheds in drier climates produce older and more chemically evolved baseflow as indicated by the final equilibrium rtd under reduced recharge rates however baseflow from watersheds in temperate climates has much more complex residence time distribution than baseflow from topographically and geologically similar watersheds in both humid and dry climates under a drought discharge sensitivity of watersheds in drier climates is smaller than that of watersheds in more humid climates for watersheds in different climates the sensitivity of baseflow residence time distribution or sensitivity of discharge of different residence times to drought perturbations is worth future study also note that our conceptual model with a homogeneous hydraulic conductivity field corresponds to natural watersheds with deep and permeable bedrock the heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity field such as a depth decaying k ingebritsen and manning 1999 cardenas and jiang 2010 can influence the relative contribution of flow paths of different scales to baseflow generation however our findings are due to the multiscale nature of the gwfs and should persist even in watersheds with heterogeneous geology as long as there is a multiscale gwfs with its various subwatersheds having time varying connections to flow paths of different scales our results call for caution in conceptualizing baseflow generation at the watershed scale as a synchronized or sequential aggregation of baseflow generated independently from individual hillslopes first baseflow may not be entirely contributed by water storage within the hillslopes on the two sides of the streams depending on the depth and complexity of the gwfs second for watersheds with a developed gwfs e g in hilly or mountainous regions with deep and permeable bedrock the watershed scale baseflow generation mechanism cannot be represented by a simple aggregation e g multiplication linear combination or convolution of hillslope or subwatershed scale baseflow generation processes this is indicated by the asynchrony and dissimilarity of baseflow generation from hillslopes under the impact of the watershed scale gwfs and the dynamic interactions among flow components of different scales credit authorship contribution statement chao wang conceptualization methodology software formal analysis

3352,process based models are very efficient in simulating hydrodynamics and water quality in surface water bodies however their complex characteristics in terms of implementation data requirements and simulation time limit their application in regular drinking water source management this study demonstrates the potential of a ml model long short term memory lstm as viable alternatives to process based hydrodynamic and water quality models in water source management using meteorological and hydrological measurements a hydrodynamic and water quality model was first calibrated to predict time series profiles and contours of water variables namely escherichia coli e coli faecal coliforms zinc and lead concentrations in the brusdalsvatnet lake which is the drinking water source for the city of ålesund in norway the results obtained were combined with the input data to train a suite of lstm models to emulate the results achieved with the process based modelling the results indicate that ml models can conveniently reproduce the spatio temporal evolution of water quality in the lake that is achievable with the process based model particularly when specific locations within the lake are of interest compared to r2 ns and mse ranges of 0 72 0 87 0 68 0 85 and 0 21 0 44 achieved with the process based model in the prediction of temperature in the lake 0 78 0 95 0 75 0 89 and 0

concentrations at different depths in the lake while setting up and training the lstm model to emulate the process based model simulations was very time consuming a validated model as developed in

1 introduction the microbiological and chemical safety of drinking water is essential to human health and the use of preventive management actions by water supply managers is pivotal to ensuring the continuous supply of safe water to the public fresh surface waterbodies such as lakes and rivers that are major sources of drinking water across the globe are highly susceptible to contamination from point and non point sources maintaining the quality of water particularly under extreme weather conditions present considerable challenges in the management of drinking water supply systems that rely on surface waterbodies to help address some of these challenges process based hydrological hydrodynamics and water quality are commonly used to model water source reservoirs with the aim of obtaining scientific decision support information necessary for planning and control of pollution these process based models incorporate mathematical descriptions of the physics of surface water hydrodynamics ranging from 1d 2d and 3d formulations several types of software and tools exist with varying complexities and capabilities these mechanistic models have therefore been the state of the practice for regulatory evaluations of anthropogenic and climate effects on waterbodies that serve as drinking water sources and bathing sites gao li 2015 process based hydrodynamic and water quality models have been widely applied for simulating and predicting temperature dynamics and constituent transport in surface water bodies such as lakes rivers and estuaries weinberger vetter 2012 zhao et al 2012 bayer et al 2013 wahl peeters 2014 soulignac et al 2017 mohammed et al 2019 ziemińska stolarska kempa 2021 as a result of complexities in model structures and extensive computational requirements process based hydrodynamic and water quality simulations are difficult to calibrate and often require high levels of expertise to implement rode et al 2010 afshar et al 2013 chen et al 2016 yaseen et al 2019 baracchini et al 2020 thus limiting their application in the management of water resources chen et al 2016 imani et al 2021 wang et al 2021 yaseen et al 2019 moreover typical applications of process based models for close to real time simulations in water source reservoirs are limited there is no doubt about the relevance of process based hydrodynamics and water quality models in understanding the physical processes and factors that influence the thermal dynamics and water quality characteristics of surface waterbodies however recent developments in data driven ml models ml are making them indispensable tools in digitally transforming systems across different fields similarly ml models have been demonstrated to be highly efficient and swift in mapping relations between predictors and response in watershed systems adnan et al 2019 garcía alba et al 2019 haghiabi 2017 kratzert et al 2019 sahoo et al 2017 at the same time advances in sensor technologies have made it possible to collect tremendous amounts of high quality hydrological and meteorological data in watersheds these offer immense opportunities to advance modeling and simulation capabilities through data driven ml for effective watershed management in recent years the possibility of combining data driven models with process based water quality models is increasingly being investigated for instance ml methods have been applied to reduce calibration times quantify parameter uncertainties and improve the overall quality of predictions in process based models afshar et al 2013 mardani et al 2020 moreover other researchers have compared the efficiencies of different process based hydrodynamic and water quality models with conventional ml methods such as the artificial neural network ann in predicting water quality in lakes garcía alba et al 2019 a recent study applied a 3d process based hydrodynamic model and a data driven model that incorporates wavelet transform and artificial neural network ann to water quality prediction in lakes and reservoirs although the study did not directly compare these modelling approaches the results indicated that while mean prediction errors of 6 1 and 4 2 were achieved by the process based model for water temperature and salinity respectively in one lake errors of 0 5 0 62 and 0 22 were achieved with the data driven models in predicting profiles of temperature dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity in another lake saber sichani 2019 similarly chen et al 2012 compared the application of 2d and 3d hydrodynamics with artificial neural network ann models for simulating water levels in an estuary in taiwan results of their study indicated that although the accuracy achieved in testing the ann models was lower in comparison with the hydrodynamic models the ann model was more efficient in capturing observed variations in the water level measurements in addition the periods of high discharge into the estuarine was captured by the ann model with higher accuracy than the hydrodynamic model these highlight the potential for advanced ml models in water quality modelling owing to their relatively high efficiencies in modelling time series data from complex nonlinear systems the long short term memory lstm model is increasingly being applied in water quality modeling in surface waterbodies liu et al 2019 liang et al 2020 qi et al 2020 and other components of water supply systems mohammed et al 2021 using a unique structure designed to enable filtering and conversion of information the lstm is capable of exploiting temporal dependencies in data more exhaustively than classical ml models such as the ann hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 reichstein et al 2019 this makes it more superior in handling time series data thus usually outperforming those classical ml models it must however be noted that just as many other ml models the lstm does not provide any form of interpretations which is a common limitation of most ml algorithms despite the proven efficiency of the lstm technique in modelling time series data in water systems the possibility of integrating the method in process based hydrodynamic and water quality modelling has not been investigated with sufficient data the model can be trained to reproduce typical hydrodynamic and water quality simulations that are achievable with process based models once efficiently trained and validated the model can be integrated with cloud based data transmission from field sensors such that close to real time simulation of water quality in surface water bodies can be achieved in this perspective the primary objective of this study is to investigate the potential for the lstm model to simulate the spatio temporal evolution of thermal dynamics and associated constituent transport in water source reservoirs a process based hydrodynamic and water quality model was calibrated to predict time series and profiles of water temperature escherichia coli e coli faecal coliforms and the concentrations of two heavy metals zinc and lead in a lake the hydrodynamic and water quality model was calibrated for the brusdalsvatnet lake in ålesund norway using the generalized environmental modelling system for surface water gemss outputs of the process based model for selected locations in the lake were used as targets to train and test lstm models with the same input variables as the process based model finally the performances of the models were compared with time series and profiles of water quality parameters measured in the lake 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location and dataset the brusdalsvatnet lake fig 1 which is the drinking water source for the city of ålesund in norway is a deep lake approximately 100 m at the deepest section with a surface area of 7 3 km2 the lake is in a mountainous area with a forested catchment size of approximately 30 km2 the catchment is also composed of scattered settlement and a highway at the northern and northwestern sections several streams discharge into the lake however majority of the streams flow mainly during snow melt in the spring as well as periods of heavy rainfall among the major streams are vasstrandelva average flow 0 17 m3 s årsetelva average flow 0 15 m3 s slettebakk average flow 0 08 m3 s and brusdalsbekken average flow 0 06 m3 s the lake has only one outlet located at the western end during high precipitation periods loads of decayed organic matter and faecal matter from wild animals and birds from the surrounding forest are washed into the lake discharge of faecal matter from these animals in the catchment potentially contribute to the contamination of the water source with faecal indicator microbial organisms such as e coli and faecal coliforms in addition leakages from septic tanks and sewer pipes at the northwestern section of the lake could be potential sources of faecal contamination to the lake due to the occurrence of regular rainfall in the catchment and the topography contaminants including heavy metals from other non point sources can be transported into the lake through runoff moreover the proximity of the lake to a major highway at the northern section makes the lake susceptible to heavy metal contamination especially during snowmelt and rainfall periods currently changes in weather variables in the catchment of the lake is being monitored with a newly installed weather station this station which has been operating since june 2020 measures air temperature precipitation cloud cover solar radiation wind speed wind direction barometric pressure and relative humidity the weather station is also equipped with cloud data transmission technology that enable the managers of the raw water source to receive the measurements in real time in addition a flow radar has been installed in the outlet stream of the lake and efforts are being made to install similar sensors in the major inflow streams mentioned above further a water quality profiling system has been installed on the lake as illustrated in fig 1 the equipment performs measurements of water temperature ph turbidity electrical conductivity dissolved oxygen do and fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom in the lake at depth intervals of 1 m from the surface the system also transmits these daily measurements in real time to support catchment management decisions the data used to calibrate and validate the models applied in this study were therefore retrieved from these suits of sensors illustration of the meteorological and hydrological data used in this study are presented in the supplementary materials figs s1 and s2 2 2 model calibration 2 2 1 process based hydrodynamic and water quality model a hydrodynamic and water quality model was implemented using the generalized environmental modeling system for surface waters gemss software gemss which is embedded in a geographical information and environmental data system provides 3d flow fields from which the distribution of constituents is computed the hydrodynamic and constituent transport relationships in gemss are based on the generalized longitudinal lateral vertical hydrodynamic and transport gllvht model edinger buchak 1980 1985 the hydrodynamic computations velocity components and water surface elevations as well as the water quality transport are performed simultaneously in rectangular grids that are generated using the shoreline and bathymetry data that bound the waterbody the computations also include formulations of boundary conditions for surface heat exchange friction wind shear inflow outflow and the kinetics of water quality variables constituent transport in gemss is composed of a variety of modules for this study the gemss hdm was coupled with the generalized bacterial module to simulate the transport of e coli and faecal coliforms in the lake in the bacteria module mortality is formulated using temperature dependent first order decay kinetics which also for the effects of salinity and ultraviolet uv radiation growth and resuspension from sediments are not included in addition the toxic module was used to simulate the concentrations of heavy metals zinc and lead in the lake the software has been widely applied to model the hydrodynamics of surface water bodies as well as the fate and transport of water quality parameters including faecal coliforms and e coli dargahi and setegn 2011 kolluru et al 2014 eregno et al 2018 mohammed et al 2019 ziemińska stolarska kempa 2021 the software has also been previously used for modelling other processes including mixing patterns in lakes park et al 2013 phytoplankton growth na park 2006 as well as currents temperature and nutrients in estuarine and coastal water bodies albertson et al 2009 kolluru et al 2003 2012 yousif 2018 implementation of the hydrodynamics and water quality model in gemss primarily requires two types of data 1 spatial data composed of shoreline and bathymetry together with the locations of inflow and outflow streams and 2 time varying data that define the forcing functions of inflow rate and temperature outflow rates and meteorological data in addition concentrations of constituents in the inflow streams can either be entered as time varying or constant data in this study the gemss hdm module was applied to derive the hydrodynamics in the lake using hourly meteorological and hydrological forcing data taken between from june to december 2020 7 months the meteorological variables were air temperature dew point temperature net solar radiation cloud cover barometric pressure wind direction wind speed and relative humidity the hydrological data was composed of flow measurements in streams that discharge into the lake monthly concentrations of e coli coliform bacteria and the heavy metals zinc and lead were measured for the same period and average concentrations were entered into the model as constant values the computational grids used in the model is shown in fig 1 this is composed of rectangular grids of and y dimensions 10 m and 20 m respectively the bathymetry of the lake was divided into layers of 1 m from the surface to the bottom of the lake to verify the accuracy of the calibrated process based model the time series of water temperature predicted by the model at the various depths considered 1 m 10 m 20 m 30 m 40 m and 50 m were compared with the water temperature measurements taken at these depths the water temperature was calibrated by changing relevant parameters in the model setup including wind sheltering coefficient 0 1 sechi depth 1 20 vegetative and topographic cover 0 1 and wind speed functions model parameters associated with decay and growth rates of the water quality variables were set at default values in the gemss model for each simulation a single parameter was varied within its appropriate range and the results compared with the measurements this procedure was repeated and in each case the following performance indices were evaluated until a satisfactory agreement with the measured data was achieved 1 coefficient of determination r 2 r 2 i 1 n s i r i 2 i 1 n r i r i 2 1 2 nash and sutcliffe model efficiency ns ns 1 i 1 n r i s i 2 i 1 n r i r 2 2 3 mean square error mse m s e 1 n i 1 n r i s i 2 3 where r i the ith field data measured s i the ith data predicted by the model and r is the average of the measured values the value of ns ranges between and 1 with a value of 1 indicating optimal performance of the model in addition to the temperature measurements monthly water samples were taken at the six depths at the same location and analyzed for e coli coliform bacteria and the two heavy metals the analysis results were also used to validate the process based model predictions from the results of the process based model time series and profiles of the predicted concentrations of each of the four water quality variables at the location described above were extracted in addition predicted time series for a defined cross section of the lake were extracted for use in training and testing the ml model to predict similar cross section for two different dates 30th august and 30th november within the simulation period 2 2 2 ml model calibration and validation 2 2 2 1 long short term memory lstm the lstm model proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 is a special kind of recurrent neural network rnn that can preserve long term dependencies among variables lstm overcomes some of the challenges associated with classical rnn such as the inability to capture long term dependencies of input series gradient disappearance compared to the rnn the principal innovation in lstm networks is their memory blocks or memory cells which act as accumulators of the state information each memory cell unit in lstm is composed of three logic gates through which data can be selectively processed the three gates namely input gate output gate and forgetting gate are based on sigmoid neural network layer the lstm network is formulated as follows chen et al 2017 1 f t δ w f â x t r f â h t 1 b f 2 i t δ w i â x t r i â h t 1 b i 3 o t δ w o â x t r o â h t 1 b o 4 c t φ w c â x t r c â h t 1 b c 5 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 6 h t o t ø c t in which equations 1 3 are respectively the forget f t input i t and output o t gates c is the cell state w r and b are the input weights recurrent weights and bias for each gate respectively h is the output of the hidden layer δ is a sigmoid function while φ and ø are hyperbolic tangent activation functions in the equations and are respectively used to denote matrix and vector multiplications in the training of the lstm network the input gate decides which part of the cell state is outputted the forget gate decides which historical information is discarded from the cell state while the output gate decides the part of the cell states to be outputted subsequently the candidate values to be added to the new state c t in equation 5 at time t is determined using equation 4 which also accounts for values of previous state at time t 1 that were adjusted by the forget gate finally the final output of the model unit is determined by equation 6 the structural overview of the lstm network is presented in fig 2 2 2 2 2 lstm model training and validation after the calibration and validation of the hydrodynamic and water quality model the input data meteorological and hydrological and the predictions of the process model were used to train and test the lstm models the lstm models were trained and tested in python using the tensorflow and keras libraries in this study the lstm model was setup to predict multiple variables using the same set of inputs thus the model predicts the four water quality variables concurrently similar to the process based model the meteorological and hydrological input data were entered as time series whereas the concentrations of the water quality variables in the inflow streams were entered as constant values the lstm model was setup in two stages 1 to predict the time series of the water quality variables at six depths within one location in the lake that is at a single and y location but six different depths from the time series predictions at each of the depths considered profiles of the water quality variables were extracted on different two dates to compare with the results of the process based model 2 the second stage of the lstm modelling was setup to regenerate cross sections of the various water quality variables as predicted by the process based model to implement this in the model daily time series of water temperature and the four water quality variables predicted by the process based model for the surface grid cells that define the lake cross section were extracted thus the lstm was trained to predict those values using the same set of inputs as in the first stage using the values predicted by the model in each grid cell at the surface corresponding values in lower grid cells were estimated using curve fitting with the results of the process based model subsequently the results were compared with those obtained from the process based model in each of the lstm models created the datasets were split into two parts 60 for training and 40 for testing the accuracy of the lstm models was evaluated using values of r 2 ns and mse as defined in section 2 2 1 2 2 3 comparison of model predictions an overview of the methodological approach used in this study is illustrated in fig 3 the approach attempts to transform a calibrated hydrodynamic and water quality model process based into a set of lstm models trained using the outputs of the process based model as targets the resulting set of models could subsequently be applied for real time prediction of relevant water quality parameters at desired locations using data from the field sensors described in section 2 1 of this study to achieve robust sets of lstm models that can efficiently emulate the performance of the process based model the architecture and hyperparameters of the lstm models were repeatedly varied and each time the outputs were compared with the results of the hydrodynamics model until acceptable accuracies were obtained subsequently the results for the two modelling approaches were compared with the measured time series and profiles of the water quality parameters and the performance indices for each evaluated 3 results and discussions 3 1 evaluation of the process based hydrodynamic and water quality model in the final process based model the water temperature calibration parameters that resulted in the best performance were wind sheltering coefficient 0 6 sechi depth 16 vegetative and topographic cover 0 41 similarly the brady graves geyer evaporation model bggm brady et al 1969 was used as the wind speed function fig 4 shows comparisons of the process based model predictions of water temperature with the measurements at the six different depths in the lake for the seven month period simulated the calibrated model predicted the water temperature with r2 and ns values ranging from 0 68 to 0 88 and 0 64 to 0 84 respectively a previous study by the same authors that calibrated a hydrodynamic and water quality model for the same lake using meteorological and hydrological data for 2017 achieved a lower average r2 value of 0 65 mohammed et al 2019 therefore the results achieved in this study shows a significant improvement over the previous model calibrated for the lake further compared to the performance of the process based model achieved in this study higher accuracy levels have been reported in the prediction of water temperature in other studies for instance in the work of bayer et al 2013 an r2 value of 0 93 was achieved for water temperature in lakes using the hydrodynamic and water quality modelling approach further a study that applied a hydrodynamic model to simulate thermal stratifications in a deep alpine lake reported a similarly high agreement of model predictions of water temperature in comparison with measured values with r2 values ranging from 0 71 to 0 96 weinberger vetter 2012 while the process based model predictions of water temperature in this study generally achieved good agreements with the measured values at the various depths the time series predictions were more accurate at depths of 10 m 20 m and 50 m compared to the other depths the temporal variation of water temperature at the surface 1 m depth was marginally underestimated by the model with the least performance indices of r2 0 68 ns 0 64 and mse 1 24 evaluated for this layer this was evident across the entire period simulated which constituted summer months june to august autumn september to november and early winter december 3 2 evaluation of lstm models table 1 presents the performance indices for the training and testing of the lstm model in the prediction of time series of water temperature e coli faecal coliforms and the two heavy metals zinc and lead the model performance for both training and testing were evaluated by comparing the lstm model predictions with the targets outputs of the hydrodynamic model using the time series of weather variables and discharges into the lake as inputs the lstm was able to predict the time series of water temperature at different depths in the lake with accuracies close to the process based model in the training set from june to october r2 and ns values ranging from 0 75 to 0 92 and 0 72 0 88 were achieved by the lstm model in the prediction of water temperature at the various depths targeted when tested with the remaining data late september to early december the corresponding r2 and ns ranges for temperature were of 0 72 0 87 and 0 68 0 84 respectively in the testing set for temperature since the lstm model was trained with the results of the process based model the accuracy of the lstm model could only be as good as the process based model therefore the performance indices of the lstm models at the various depths in the lake considered should be interpreted with respect to the results of the process based model fig 5 presents plots of the time series of the four water quality parameters predicted by the lstm model compared to their targets outputs of the process based model the ability of the lstm model to mimic the temporal evolution of the faecal indicator organisms and the heavy metals in the lake is distinctly demonstrated in this figure the performance indices presented in table 1 also confirmed the efficiency of the lstm models compared to water temperature the lstm models predicted the changes in faecal indicator organisms in the water column with higher accuracy for instance compared to r2 ns and mse ranges of 0 72 0 87 0 68 0 85 and 0 21 0 44 in the testing set for temperature 0 78 0 95 0 75 0 89 and 0 011 0 028 were obtained in the prediction of e coli and faecal coliforms similar accuracy levels were achieved in the prediction of zinc and lead concentrations as show in table 1 at the onset of the winter season early november the occurrence of stratification in the lake at depths of 10 20 m appear to affect the concentrations of the heavy metals more than the faecal indicator organisms this potentially resulted in sharp decreases in the heavy metal concentrations as shown in fig 4 c2 c3 d2 and d3 3 3 comparison of water quality profiles from the two modelling approaches further from the time series predictions from both the process based hydrodynamic and water quality model and the lstm profiles of each of the water quality variables were extracted for simulation dates for which measured profiles of the variables were available figs 6 and 7 respectively compare the profiles from the two modelling approaches with measured profiles of water temperature and e coli at the same location similar comparisons for faecal coliforms zinc and lead concentrations can be found in the supplementary materials as shown in fig 6 both the process based model and the lstm generally predicted the temperature profiles for the selected dates with very good accuracy as indicated in section 3 1 of this study the temperature at the water surface 1 m depth was not satisfactorily predicted by the process based model thus similar results were achieved from the lstm models nonetheless the predictions made by the process based model at the surface was slightly better than the lstm for instance while a temperature value of 17 6 c was measured at the 1 m depth in june the process based model predicted 16 2 c difference 1 4 c similar cases of underestimation of the water temperature at the surface by the process based model can be seen in the other subfigures in fig 5 the prediction accuracy of the process based model was however better at the deeper layers in many of the dates the process based model also satisfactorily simulated the thermal stratifications in the lake which occurs in the summer months fig 6a and c and partly in the autumn fig 6b d e and g whereas the measured temperature profiles indicated complete circulation in the lake in late november fig 6f the process based model predicted the occurrence of circulation only up to a depth of approximately 35 m during this period it can be seen in this figure that from the same sets of inputs the lstm models achieved accuracies that were very close to those achieved by the process based model while significant accuracy was achieved by the process based model in the prediction of the temperature profiles in the lake the water quality profiles were not sufficiently predicted by the model as shown in fig 7 although the model simulates the patterns of the e coli profiles in the selected dates the model predictions were generally lower than the observed concentrations in the first 6 dates fig 7a e and g water samples were not taken from the surface of the lake 1 m depth for analysis thus the e coli concentrations and the other water quality parameters were assumed to be zero on those dates in the dates for which the top 1 m depth was sampled the model clearly underestimated the e coli concentrations fig 7 f and h once again as shown in this figure the lstm model was able to reproduce the targets as predicted by the process based model this suggests that with sufficient training and testing datasets measured at smaller depth intervals the lstm model could be trained to reliably simulate the variations in water quality in the lake with accuracy levels close to a process based model 3 4 comparison of water quality cross sections from the two modelling approaches as indicated in section 2 2 1 of this study the results of the process based model for a selected cross section in the lake were extracted and used as targets to train the lstm models while the process based model predicted the values of each water quality parameter in all the model grid cells that define the cross section for each simulation time step the lstm model was set up to predict only the values at the surface grid cells those predictions were used to estimate corresponding values in the lower grid cells fig 8 shows comparison of the 2d cross section contours of water temperature e coli faecal coliform zinc and lead concentrations in the lake on 30th november a similar plot generated for august is included in the supplementary materials clearly the lstm model emulates the results of the process based model with very good accuracy it must however be noted that setting up the lstm model to predict such cross sections with the time series data is extremely time consuming thus apart from the ability of the process based model to provide fundamental understanding of the hydrodynamics in the lake and the associated constituent transport in the lake it is much easier to simulate the temporal and spatial evolution of water quality parameters in the lake with this method while it may be possible to achieve this with the lstm model the time needed to set this up as well as the time required for simulations could be disadvantageous a major advantage of process based models is that they incorporate the physics principles that describe the surface water bodies therefore enable the relationships between model inputs and outputs to be explicitly understood in contrast data driven ml models determine complex patterns from data without providing interpretations which is a key drawback the need to incorporate first principles into ml algorithms has been emphasized in recent studies qin chiang 2019 bikmukhametov and jäschke 2020 this could improve their interpretability and help account for uncertainties in their predictions clearly the superiority of process based models cannot be overemphasized and they remain highly essential in the management of water quality however recent advances in sensor technologies have made it possible to collect significant amount of valuable data in environmental systems such as watersheds thus in the same way as artificial intelligence ai internet of things iot and other digital technologies are transforming different systems today data driven modeling approaches as presented in this study could immensely advance the transformation of watersheds into smart systems despite their drawbacks the results achieved with the lstm in this study imply that the approach can be very efficient when simulations at selected locations within a lake such as raw water intake points are of interest in this case the simulation time is more likely to be significantly reduced in a way that close to real time predictions of water quality can be achieved by linking the trained lstm model to meteorological and hydrological measurements from field sensors additionally ml model algorithms such as the lstm are highly efficient in modelling time series data and can perform long term forecasting when necessary thus both modelling approaches have their specific advantages depending on the modelling objectives for instance process based models can be more useful for investigating and understanding the processes that govern the dynamics and transport of constituents in the lake however an efficiently trained and validated ml model such as the lstm used in this study could enable more rapid prediction of water quality at relevant locations to support proactive decision making in raw water source management 4 conclusions the potential for the application of ml models in simulating hydrodynamics and constituent transport in water source reservoirs is demonstrated in this study the proposed methodology was applied to predict temporal and spatial variations of water temperature e coli faecal coliforms and the concentrations of two heavy metals zinc and lead in the brusdalsvatnet lake which is the drinking water source for the city of ålesund in norway this study demonstrated that not only can the use of deep learning algorithms such as the lstm enable the temporal evolution of faecal indicator bacteria fib such as e coli and other important water quality variables in surface water bodies to be calculated but also their spatial distributions at a given time this can be achieved by exploiting the advantages of non linear process based and data driven models although this study focusses on predicting fib and heavy metal in a lake the methodology could be adapted to model the concentrations of several other water constituents of concern such as suspended sediments phosphorus dissolved oxygen and micropollutants in addition the implementation of such a ml models for a drinking water source or any other surface waterbody can be considerably easier and at a lower cost compared to typical process based models it is however worth mentioning that whiles a process based model can predict the temporal variations in the quality of water at all location in the lake this can be extremely difficult to achieve with ml models the lstm modelling approach as applied in this study generally has a high predictive ability for time series data generated from different nonlinear systems despite the relatively longer time needed in setting up training and validating the ml model in this study the results suggest that the proposed approach could make it easier to perform continuous hydrodynamic and water quality simulations in drinking water source reservoirs this can be achieved through integrated online measurements of input variables from field sensors with the aim of managing the health risks associated with water consumption in a timely manner the lstm models applied in this study can be used by managers of drinking water supply systems to support decision making tasks that promote preventive management actions in addition the advantage of forecasting capabilities of ml models makes them suitable for developing early warning systems the work performed in this study was supported by the water and

3352,process based models are very efficient in simulating hydrodynamics and water quality in surface water bodies however their complex characteristics in terms of implementation data requirements and simulation time limit their application in regular drinking water source management this study demonstrates the potential of a ml model long short term memory lstm as viable alternatives to process based hydrodynamic and water quality models in water source management using meteorological and hydrological measurements a hydrodynamic and water quality model was first calibrated to predict time series profiles and contours of water variables namely escherichia coli e coli faecal coliforms zinc and lead concentrations in the brusdalsvatnet lake which is the drinking water source for the city of ålesund in norway the results obtained were combined with the input data to train a suite of lstm models to emulate the results achieved with the process based modelling the results indicate that ml models can conveniently reproduce the spatio temporal evolution of water quality in the lake that is achievable with the process based model particularly when specific locations within the lake are of interest compared to r2 ns and mse ranges of 0 72 0 87 0 68 0 85 and 0 21 0 44 achieved with the process based model in the prediction of temperature in the lake 0 78 0 95 0 75 0 89 and 0 011 0 028 were respectively achieved in testing the lstm models similar performance levels were achieved with the lstm model in the prediction of escherichia coli e coli faecal coliforms zinc and lead concentrations at different depths in the lake while setting up and training the lstm model to emulate the process based model simulations was very time consuming a validated model as developed in

1 introduction the microbiological and chemical safety of drinking water is essential to human health and the use of preventive management actions by water supply managers is pivotal to ensuring the continuous supply of safe water to the public fresh surface waterbodies such as lakes and rivers that are major sources of drinking water across the globe are highly susceptible to contamination from point and non point sources maintaining the quality of water particularly under extreme weather conditions present considerable challenges in the management of drinking water supply systems that rely on surface waterbodies to help address some of these challenges process based hydrological hydrodynamics and water quality are commonly used to model water source reservoirs with the aim of obtaining scientific decision support information necessary for planning and control of pollution these process based models incorporate mathematical descriptions of the physics of surface water hydrodynamics ranging from 1d 2d and 3d formulations several types of software and tools exist with varying complexities and capabilities these mechanistic models have therefore been the state of the practice for regulatory evaluations of anthropogenic and climate effects on waterbodies that serve as drinking water sources and bathing sites gao li 2015 process based hydrodynamic and water quality models have been widely applied for simulating and predicting temperature dynamics and constituent transport in surface water bodies such as lakes rivers and estuaries weinberger vetter 2012 zhao et al 2012 bayer et al 2013 wahl peeters 2014 soulignac et al 2017 mohammed et al 2019 ziemińska stolarska kempa 2021 as a result of complexities in model structures and extensive computational requirements process based hydrodynamic and water quality simulations are difficult to calibrate and often require high levels of expertise to implement rode et al 2010 afshar et al 2013 chen et al 2016 yaseen et al 2019 baracchini et al 2020 thus limiting their application in the management of water resources chen et al 2016 imani et al 2021 wang et al 2021 yaseen et al 2019 moreover typical applications of process based models for close to real time simulations in water source reservoirs are limited there is no doubt about the relevance of process based hydrodynamics and water quality models in understanding the physical processes and factors that influence the thermal dynamics and water quality characteristics of surface waterbodies however recent developments in data driven ml models ml are making them indispensable tools in digitally transforming systems across different fields similarly ml models have been demonstrated to be highly efficient and swift in mapping relations between predictors and response in watershed systems adnan et al 2019 garcía alba et al 2019 haghiabi 2017 kratzert et al 2019 sahoo et al 2017 at the same time advances in sensor technologies have made it possible to collect tremendous amounts of high quality hydrological and meteorological data in watersheds these offer immense opportunities to advance modeling and simulation capabilities through data driven ml for effective watershed management in recent years the possibility of combining data driven models with process based water quality models is increasingly being investigated for instance ml methods have been applied to reduce calibration times quantify parameter uncertainties and improve the overall quality of predictions in process based models afshar et al 2013 mardani et al 2020 moreover other researchers have compared the efficiencies of different process based hydrodynamic and water quality models with conventional ml methods such as the artificial neural network ann in predicting water quality in lakes garcía alba et al 2019 a recent study applied a 3d process based hydrodynamic model and a data driven model that incorporates wavelet transform and artificial neural network ann to water quality prediction in lakes and reservoirs although the study did not directly compare these modelling approaches the results indicated that while mean prediction errors of 6 1 and 4 2 were achieved by the process based model for water temperature and salinity respectively in one lake errors of 0 5 0 62 and 0 22 were achieved with the data driven models in predicting profiles of temperature dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity in another lake saber sichani 2019 similarly chen et al 2012 compared the application of 2d and 3d hydrodynamics with artificial neural network ann models for simulating water levels in an estuary in taiwan results of their study indicated that although the accuracy achieved in testing the ann models was lower in comparison with the hydrodynamic models the ann model was more efficient in capturing observed variations in the water level measurements in addition the periods of high discharge into the estuarine was captured by the ann model with higher accuracy than the hydrodynamic model these highlight the potential for advanced ml models in water quality modelling owing to their relatively high efficiencies in modelling time series data from complex nonlinear systems the long short term memory lstm model is increasingly being applied in water quality modeling in surface waterbodies liu et al 2019 liang et al 2020 qi et al 2020 and other components of water supply systems mohammed et al 2021 using a unique structure designed to enable filtering and conversion of information the lstm is capable of exploiting temporal dependencies in data more exhaustively than classical ml models such as the ann hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 reichstein et al 2019 this makes it more superior in handling time series data thus usually

be achieved in this perspective the primary objective of this study is to investigate the potential for the lstm model to simulate the spatio temporal evolution of thermal dynamics and associated constituent transport in water source reservoirs a process based hydrodynamic and water quality model was calibrated to predict time series and profiles of water temperature escherichia coli e coli faecal coliforms and the concentrations of two heavy metals zinc and lead in a lake the hydrodynamic and water quality model was calibrated for the brusdalsvatnet lake in ålesund norway using the generalized environmental modelling system for surface water gemss outputs of the process based model for selected locations in the lake were used as targets to train and test lstm models with the same input variables as the process based model finally the performances of the models were compared with time series and profiles of water quality parameters measured in the lake 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location and dataset the brusdalsvatnet lake fig 1 which is the drinking water source for the city of ålesund in norway is a deep lake approximately 100 m at the deepest section with a surface area of 7 3 km2 the lake is in a mountainous area with a forested catchment size of approximately 30 km2 the catchment is also composed of scattered settlement and a highway at the northern and northwestern sections several streams discharge into the lake however majority of the streams flow mainly during snow melt in the spring as well as periods of heavy rainfall among the major streams are vasstrandelva average flow 0 17 m3 s årsetelva average flow 0 15 m3 s slettebakk average flow 0 08 m3 s and brusdalsbekken average flow 0 06 m3 s the lake has only one outlet located at the western end during high precipitation periods loads of decayed organic matter and faecal matter from wild animals and birds from the surrounding forest are washed into the lake discharge of faecal matter from these animals in the catchment potentially contribute to the contamination of the water source with faecal indicator microbial organisms such as e coli and faecal coliforms in addition leakages from septic tanks and sewer pipes at the northwestern section of the lake could be potential sources of faecal contamination to the lake due to the occurrence of regular rainfall in the catchment and the topography contaminants including heavy metals from other non point sources can be transported into the lake through runoff moreover the proximity of the lake to a major highway at the northern section makes the lake susceptible to heavy metal contamination especially during snowmelt and rainfall periods currently changes in weather variables in the catchment of the lake is being monitored with a newly installed weather station this station which has been operating since june 2020 measures air temperature precipitation cloud cover solar radiation wind speed wind direction barometric pressure and relative humidity the weather station is also equipped with cloud data transmission technology that enable the managers of the raw water source to receive the measurements in real time in addition a flow radar has been installed in the outlet stream of the lake and efforts are being made to install similar sensors in the major inflow streams mentioned above further a water quality profiling system has been installed on the lake as illustrated in fig 1 the equipment performs measurements of water temperature ph turbidity electrical conductivity dissolved oxygen do and fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom in the lake at depth intervals of 1 m from the surface the system also transmits these daily measurements in real time to support catchment management decisions the data used to calibrate and validate the models applied in this study were therefore retrieved from these suits of sensors illustration of the meteorological and hydrological data used in this study are presented in the supplementary materials figs s1 and s2 2 2 model calibration 2 2 1 process based hydrodynamic and water quality model a hydrodynamic and water quality model was implemented using the generalized environmental modeling system for surface waters gemss software gemss which is embedded in a geographical information and environmental data system provides 3d flow fields from which the distribution of constituents is computed the hydrodynamic and constituent transport relationships in gemss are based on the generalized longitudinal lateral vertical hydrodynamic and transport gllvht model edinger buchak 1980 1985 the hydrodynamic computations velocity components and water surface elevations as well as the water quality transport are performed simultaneously in rectangular grids that are generated using the shoreline and bathymetry data that bound the waterbody the computations also include formulations of boundary conditions for surface heat exchange friction wind shear inflow outflow and the kinetics of water quality variables constituent transport in gemss is composed of a variety of modules for this study the gemss hdm was coupled with the generalized bacterial module to simulate the transport of e coli and faecal coliforms in the lake in the bacteria module mortality is formulated using temperature dependent first order decay kinetics which also for the effects of salinity and ultraviolet uv radiation growth and resuspension from sediments are not included in addition the toxic module was used to simulate the concentrations of heavy metals zinc and lead in the lake the software has been widely applied to model the hydrodynamics of surface water bodies as well as the fate and transport of water quality parameters including faecal coliforms and e coli dargahi and setegn 2011 kolluru et al 2014 eregno et al 2018 mohammed et al 2019 ziemińska stolarska kempa 2021 the software has also been previously used for modelling other processes including mixing patterns in lakes park et al 2013 phytoplankton growth na park 2006 as well as currents temperature and nutrients in estuarine and coastal water bodies albertson et al 2009 kolluru et al 2003 2012 yousif 2018 implementation of the hydrodynamics and water quality model in gemss primarily requires two types of data 1 spatial data composed of shoreline and bathymetry together with the locations of inflow and outflow streams and 2 time varying data that define the forcing functions of inflow rate and temperature outflow rates and meteorological data in addition concentrations of constituents in the inflow streams can either be entered as time varying or constant data in this study the gemss hdm module was applied to derive the hydrodynamics in the lake using hourly meteorological and hydrological forcing data taken between from june to december 2020 7 months the meteorological variables were air temperature dew point temperature net solar radiation cloud cover barometric pressure wind direction wind speed and relative humidity the hydrological data was composed of flow measurements in streams that discharge into the lake monthly concentrations of e coli coliform bacteria and the heavy metals zinc and lead were measured for the same period and average concentrations were entered into the model as constant values the computational grids used in the model is shown in fig 1 this is composed of rectangular grids of and y dimensions 10 m and 20 m respectively the bathymetry of the lake was divided into layers of 1 m from the surface to the bottom of the lake to verify the accuracy of the calibrated process based model the time series of water temperature predicted by the model at the various depths considered 1 m 10 m 20 m 30 m 40 m and 50 m were compared with the water temperature measurements taken at these depths the water temperature was calibrated by changing relevant parameters in the model setup including wind sheltering coefficient 0 1 sechi depth 1 20 vegetative and topographic cover 0 1 and wind speed functions model parameters associated with decay and growth rates of the water quality variables were set at default values in the gemss model for each simulation a single parameter was varied within its appropriate range and the results compared with the measurements this procedure was repeated and in each case the following performance indices were evaluated until a satisfactory agreement with the measured data was achieved 1 coefficient of determination r 2 r 2 i 1 n

the ith data predicted by the model and r is the average of the measured values the value of ns ranges between and 1 with a value of 1 indicating optimal performance of the model in addition to the temperature measurements monthly water samples were taken at the six depths at the same location and analyzed for e coli coliform bacteria and the two heavy metals the analysis results were also used to validate the process based model predictions from the results of the process based model time series and profiles of the predicted concentrations of each of the four water quality variables at the location described above were extracted in addition predicted time series for a defined cross section of the lake were extracted for use in training and testing the ml model to predict similar cross section for two different dates 30th august and 30th november within the simulation period 2 2 2 ml model calibration and validation 2 2 2 1 long short term memory lstm the lstm model proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 is a special kind of recurrent neural network rnn that can preserve long term dependencies among variables lstm overcomes some of the challenges associated with classical rnn such as the inability to capture long term dependencies of input series gradient disappearance compared to the rnn the principal innovation in lstm networks is their memory blocks or memory cells which act as accumulators of the state information each memory cell unit in lstm is composed of three logic gates through which data can be selectively processed the three gates namely input gate output gate and forgetting gate are based on sigmoid neural network layer the lstm network is formulated as follows chen et al 2017 1 f t δ w f â x t r f â h t 1 b f 2 i t δ w i â x t r i â h t 1 b i 3 o t δ w o â x t r o â h t 1 b o 4 c t φ w c â x t r c â h t 1 b c 5 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 6 h t o t ø c t in which equations 1 3 are respectively the forget f t input i t and output o t gates c is the cell state w r and b are the input weights recurrent weights and bias for each gate respectively h is the output of the hidden layer δ is a sigmoid function while φ and ø are hyperbolic tangent activation functions in the equations and are respectively used to denote matrix and vector multiplications in the training of the lstm network the input gate decides which part of the cell state is outputted the forget gate decides which historical information is discarded from the cell state while the output gate decides the part of the cell states to be outputted subsequently the candidate values to be added to the new state c t in equation 5 at time t is determined using equation 4 which also accounts for values of previous state at time t 1 that were adjusted by the forget gate finally the final output of the model unit is determined by equation 6 the structural overview of the lstm network is presented in fig 2 2 2 2 2 lstm model training and validation after the calibration and validation of the hydrodynamic and water quality model the input data meteorological and hydrological and the predictions of the process model were used to train and test the lstm models the lstm models were trained and tested in python using the tensorflow and keras libraries in this study the lstm model was setup to predict multiple variables using the same set of inputs thus the model predicts the four water quality variables concurrently similar to the process based model the meteorological and hydrological input data were entered as time series whereas the concentrations of the water quality variables in the inflow streams were entered as constant values the lstm model was setup in two stages 1 to predict the time series of the water quality variables at six depths within one location in the lake that is at a single and y location but six different depths from the time series predictions at each of the depths considered profiles of the water quality variables were extracted on different two dates to compare with the results of the process based model 2 the second stage of the lstm modelling was setup to regenerate cross sections of the various water quality variables as predicted by the process based model to implement this in the model daily time series of water temperature and the four water quality variables predicted by the process based model for the surface grid cells that define the lake cross section were extracted thus the lstm was trained to predict those values using the same set of inputs as in the first stage using the values predicted by the model in each grid cell at the surface corresponding values in lower grid cells were estimated using curve fitting with the results of the process based model subsequently the results were compared with those obtained from the process based model in each of the lstm models created the datasets were split into two parts 60 for training and 40 for testing the accuracy of the lstm models was evaluated using values of r 2 ns and mse as defined in section 2 2 1 2 2 3 comparison of model predictions an overview of the methodological approach used in this study is illustrated in fig 3 the approach attempts to transform a calibrated hydrodynamic and water quality model process based into a set of lstm models trained using the outputs of the process based model as targets the resulting set of models could subsequently be applied for real time prediction of relevant water quality parameters at desired locations using data from the field sensors described in section 2 1 of this study to achieve robust sets of lstm models that can efficiently emulate the performance of the process based model the architecture and hyperparameters of the lstm models were repeatedly varied and each time the outputs were compared with the results of the hydrodynamics model until acceptable accuracies were obtained subsequently the results for the two modelling approaches were compared with the measured time series and profiles of the water quality parameters and the performance indices for each evaluated 3 results and discussions 3 1 evaluation of the process based hydrodynamic and water quality model in the final process based model the water temperature calibration parameters that resulted in the best performance were wind sheltering coefficient 0 6 sechi depth 16 vegetative and topographic cover 0 41 similarly the brady graves geyer evaporation model bggm brady et al 1969 was used as the wind speed function fig 4 shows comparisons of the process based model predictions of water temperature with the measurements at the six different depths in the lake for the seven month period simulated the calibrated model predicted the water temperature with r2 and ns values ranging from 0 68 to 0 88 and 0 64 to 0 84 respectively a previous study by the same authors that calibrated a hydrodynamic and water quality model for the same lake using meteorological and hydrological data for 2017 achieved a lower average r2 value of 0 65 mohammed et al 2019 therefore the results achieved in this study shows a significant improvement over the previous model calibrated for the lake further compared to the performance of the process based model achieved in this study higher accuracy levels have been reported in the prediction of water temperature in other studies for instance in the work of bayer et al 2013 an r2 value of 0 93 was achieved for water temperature in lakes using the hydrodynamic and water quality modelling approach further a study that applied a hydrodynamic model to simulate thermal stratifications in a deep alpine lake reported a similarly high agreement of model predictions of water temperature in comparison with measured values with r2 values ranging from 0 71 to 0 96 weinberger vetter 2012 while the process based model predictions of water temperature in this study generally achieved good agreements with the measured values at the various depths the time series predictions were more accurate at depths of 10 m 20 m and 50 m compared to the other depths the temporal variation of water temperature at the surface 1 m depth was marginally underestimated by the model with the least performance indices of r2 0 68 ns 0 64 and mse 1 24 evaluated for this layer this was evident across the entire period simulated which constituted summer months june to august autumn september to november and early winter december 3 2 evaluation of lstm models table 1 presents the performance indices for the training and testing of the lstm model in the prediction of time series of water temperature e coli faecal coliforms and the two heavy metals zinc and lead the model performance for both training and testing were evaluated by comparing the lstm model predictions with the targets outputs of the hydrodynamic model using the time series of weather variables and discharges into the lake as inputs the lstm was able to predict the time series of water temperature at different depths in the lake with accuracies close to the process based model in the training set from june to october r2 and ns values ranging from 0 75 to 0 92 and 0 72 0 88 were achieved by the lstm model in the prediction of water temperature at the various depths targeted when tested with the remaining data late september to early december the corresponding r2 and ns ranges for temperature were of 0 72 0 87 and 0 68 0 84 respectively in the testing set for temperature since the lstm model was trained with the results of the process based model the accuracy of the lstm model could only be as good as the process based model therefore the performance indices of the lstm models at the various depths in the lake considered should be interpreted with respect to the results of the process based model fig 5 presents plots of the time series of the four water quality parameters predicted by the lstm model compared to their targets outputs of the process based model the ability of the lstm model to mimic the temporal evolution of the faecal indicator organisms and the heavy metals in the lake is distinctly demonstrated in this figure the performance indices presented in table 1 also confirmed the efficiency of the lstm models compared to water temperature the lstm models predicted the changes in faecal indicator organisms in the water column with higher accuracy for instance compared to r2 ns and mse ranges of 0 72 0 87 0 68 0 85 and 0 21 0 44 in the testing set for temperature 0 78 0 95 0 75 0 89 and 0 011 0 028 were obtained in the prediction of e coli and faecal coliforms similar accuracy levels were achieved in the prediction of zinc and lead concentrations as show in table 1 at the onset of the winter season early november the occurrence of stratification in the lake at depths of 10 20 m appear to affect the concentrations of the heavy metals more than the faecal indicator organisms this potentially resulted in sharp decreases in the heavy metal concentrations as shown in fig 4 c2 c3 d2 and d3 3 3 comparison of water quality profiles from the two modelling approaches further from the time series predictions from both the process based hydrodynamic and water quality model and the lstm profiles of each of the water quality variables were extracted for simulation dates for which measured profiles of the variables were available figs 6 and 7 respectively compare the profiles from the two modelling approaches with measured profiles of water temperature and e coli at the same location similar comparisons for faecal coliforms zinc and lead concentrations can be found in the supplementary materials as shown in fig 6 both the process based model and the lstm generally predicted the temperature profiles for the selected dates with very good accuracy as indicated in section 3 1 of this study the temperature at the water surface 1 m depth was not satisfactorily predicted by the process based model thus similar results were achieved from the lstm models nonetheless the predictions made by the process based model at the surface was slightly better than the lstm for instance while a temperature value of 17 6 c was measured at the 1 m depth in june the process based model predicted 16 2 c difference 1 4 c similar cases of underestimation of the water temperature at the surface by the process based model can be seen in the other subfigures in fig 5 the prediction accuracy of the process based model was however better at the deeper layers in many of the dates the process based model also satisfactorily simulated the thermal stratifications in the lake which occurs in the summer months fig 6a and c and partly in the autumn fig 6b d e and g whereas the measured temperature profiles indicated complete circulation in the lake in late november fig 6f the process based model predicted the occurrence of circulation only up to a depth of approximately 35 m during this period it can be seen in this figure that from the same sets of inputs the lstm models achieved accuracies that were very close to those achieved by the process based model while significant accuracy was achieved by the process based model in the prediction of the temperature profiles in the lake the water quality profiles were not sufficiently predicted by the model as shown in fig 7 although the model simulates the patterns of the e coli profiles in the selected dates the model predictions were generally lower than the observed concentrations in the first 6 dates fig 7a e and g water samples were not taken from the surface of the lake 1 m depth for analysis thus the e coli concentrations and the other water quality parameters were assumed to be zero on those dates in the dates for which the top 1 m depth was sampled the model clearly underestimated the e coli concentrations fig 7 f and h once again as shown in this figure the lstm model was able to reproduce the targets as predicted by the process based model this suggests that with sufficient training and testing datasets measured at smaller depth intervals the lstm model could be trained to reliably simulate the variations in water quality in the lake with accuracy levels close to a process based model 3 4 comparison of water quality cross sections from the two modelling approaches as indicated in section 2 2 1 of this study the results of the process based model for a selected cross section in the lake were extracted and used as targets to train the lstm models while the process based model predicted the values of each water quality parameter in all the model grid cells that define the cross section for each simulation time step the lstm model was set up to predict only the values at the surface grid cells those predictions were used to estimate corresponding values in the lower grid cells fig 8 shows comparison of the 2d cross section contours of water temperature e coli faecal coliform zinc and lead concentrations in the lake on 30th november a similar plot generated for august is included in the supplementary materials clearly the lstm model emulates the results of the process based model with very good accuracy it must however be noted that setting up the lstm model to predict such cross sections with the time series data is extremely time consuming thus apart from the ability of the process based model to provide fundamental understanding of the hydrodynamics in the lake and the associated constituent transport in the lake it is much easier to simulate the temporal and spatial evolution of water quality parameters in the lake with this method while it may be possible to achieve this with the lstm model the time needed to set this up as well as the time required for simulations could be disadvantageous a major advantage of process based models is that they incorporate the physics principles that describe the surface water bodies therefore enable the relationships between model inputs and outputs to be explicitly understood in contrast data driven ml models determine complex patterns from data without providing interpretations which is a key drawback the need to incorporate first principles into ml algorithms has been emphasized in recent studies qin chiang 2019 bikmukhametov and jäschke 2020 this could improve their interpretability and help account for uncertainties in their predictions clearly the superiority of process based models cannot be overemphasized and they remain highly essential in the management of water quality however recent advances in sensor technologies have made it possible to collect significant amount of valuable data in environmental systems such as watersheds thus in the same way as artificial intelligence ai internet of things iot and other digital technologies are transforming different systems today data driven modeling approaches as presented in this study could immensely advance the transformation of watersheds into smart systems despite their drawbacks the results achieved with the lstm in this study imply that the approach can be very efficient when simulations at selected locations within a lake such as raw water intake points are of interest in this case the simulation time is more likely to be significantly reduced in a way that close to real time predictions of water quality can be achieved by linking the trained lstm model to meteorological and hydrological measurements from field sensors additionally ml model algorithms such as the lstm are highly efficient in modelling time series data and can perform long term forecasting when necessary thus both modelling approaches have their specific advantages depending on the modelling objectives for instance process based models can be more useful for investigating and understanding the processes that govern the dynamics and transport of constituents in the lake however an efficiently trained and validated ml model such as the lstm used in this study could enable more rapid prediction of water quality at relevant locations to support proactive decision making in raw water source management 4 conclusions the potential for the application of ml models in simulating hydrodynamics and constituent transport in water source reservoirs is demonstrated in this study the proposed methodology was applied to predict temporal and spatial variations of water temperature e coli faecal coliforms and the concentrations of two heavy metals zinc and lead in the brusdalsvatnet lake which is the drinking water source for the city of ålesund in norway this study demonstrated that not only can the use of deep learning algorithms such as the lstm enable the temporal evolution of faecal indicator bacteria fib such as e coli and other important water quality variables in surface water bodies to be calculated but also their spatial distributions at a given time this can be achieved by exploiting the advantages of non linear process based and data driven models although this study focusses on predicting fib and heavy metal in a lake the methodology could be adapted to model the concentrations of several other water constituents of concern such as suspended sediments phosphorus dissolved oxygen and micropollutants in addition the implementation of such a ml models for a drinking water source or any other surface waterbody can be considerably easier and at a lower cost compared to typical process based models it is however worth mentioning that whiles a process based model can predict the temporal variations in the quality of water at all location in the lake this can be extremely difficult to achieve with ml models the lstm modelling approach as applied in this study generally has a high predictive ability for time series data generated from different nonlinear systems despite the relatively longer time needed in setting up training and validating the ml model in this study the results suggest that the proposed approach could make it easier to perform continuous hydrodynamic and water quality simulations in drinking water source reservoirs this can be achieved through integrated online measurements of input variables from field sensors with the aim of managing the health risks associated with water consumption in a timely manner the lstm models applied in this study can be used by managers of drinking water supply systems to support decision making tasks that promote preventive management actions in addition the advantage of forecasting capabilities of ml models makes them suitable for developing early warning systems the work performed in this study was supported by the water and

3353,upland blanket peat is widespread in the headwaters of uk catchments but much of it has been degraded through atmospheric pollution vegetation change and erosion runoff generation in these headwaters is an important element of downstream flood risk and these areas are increasingly the focus of interventions to restore the peat ecosystem and to potentially mitigate downstream flooding here we use a series of multivariate analysis techniques to examine controls on storm runoff behavior within and between ten blanket peat catchments all within 5 km of one another and ranging in size from 0 2 to 3 9 ha we find that 1 for all 10 catchments rainfall intensity is the dominant driver for both magnitude and timing of peak discharge and that total and antecedent rainfall is important for peak discharge only in small storms 2 there is considerable inter catchment variability in runoff coefficient lag time peak runoff and their predictability from rainfall however 3 a significant fraction of the inter catchment variability can be explained by catchment characteristics particularly catchment area and 4 catchment controls on peak discharge and runoff coefficient for small storms highlight the importance of storage and connectivity while those for large events suggest that surface flow attenuation dominates together these results suggest a switching rainfall runoff behavior where catchment storage connectivity and antecedent conditions control small discharge peaks but become increasingly irrelevant for larger storms our results suggest that in the context of natural flood management potential expanding depression storage e g distributed shallow water pools in addition to existing restoration methods could increase the range of storms within which connectivity and storage remain important and that for larger storms measures which target surface runoff velocities are likely to be important keywords blanket peat discharge rainfall runoff upland scale storm 1

suggests that such restoration activities also have the potential to reduce flood peak discharge from headwater catchments goudarzi et al 2021 shuttleworth et al 2019 the growing interest in runoff generation processes in upland peat systems has been motivated in part by a desire to harness natural hydrological and morphological processes to mitigate downstream flood risk wingfield et al 2019

hydrological behavior of the catchments 2 2 hydro meteorological monitoring the monitoring period spans april 2019 to march 2020 similar to the field monitoring of hydrograph behavior described in shuttleworth et al 2019 stream water level was monitored using pressure transducers hobo u20 series in stilling wells installed at 90 v notch weirs located at the outlet of the respective micro catchments table 1 pressure transducers continuously recorded the depth of water d flowing over the v notch at 5 min intervals the recorded water depth was subsequently converted to discharge and normalized to the catchment area to allow for comparative analysis to check for logger performance a calibrated measuring board was attached to the stilling wells and manually read off during monthly logger downloads four rain gauges logging at 5 min intervals were installed in catchments b e g and i their locations were chosen to represent the nearest catchment or approximate geometric centre of catchment clusters specifically rainfall data from the rain gauge at catchment b was used for catchments a b and c rain gauge at e was used for catchments d e and f rain gauge at g for catchments g and h and rain gauge at i for catchments i and j examination of the residuals between the rain gauges reveals no significant spatial bias however there was less error observed between rain gauges closer to each other and on relatively similar catchment elevation than between more distant gauges figure si 1 and table 1 2 3 storm hydrograph extraction hydrographs were extracted for each of the catchments for all storm events that met the following criteria 1 a discrete event without ice snowmelt 2 having a total rainfall of at least 4 mm and 3 resulting in discernible changes in streamflow characteristics storms were identified as potentially at risk of meltwater influence if temperatures fell below 0 c within 2 days of the discharge response and or if there was no rainfall within 2 hrs of a discharge response these storms were not included in the storm set the start of an event was determined as the timestep after which discharge consistently increased for 4 timesteps 20 min the end of an event flow was determined as the point of inflection on the recession limb of the hydrograph beighley et al 2002 bedient and huber 1992 singh 1992 there were a total of 900 extracted hydrographs covering 102 storm events the number of extracted event hydrographs differed between catchments ranging from 68 to 102 due to gaps in discharge data resulting from occasional logger failure for each of the extracted hydrographs five hydrological response metrics were calculated total storm discharge qtot peak storm discharge qpeak runoff coefficient the ratio of area normalised total storm discharge to total storm rainfall lag time the time between peak rainfall and peak discharge following a storm event and time to peak q the time from the start of the hydrograph rising limb to peak discharge the qtot qpeak and runoff coefficients were used to represent the magnitude of stormflow to the streams while lag time and time to peak q were taken as indicators of catchment runoff timings 2 4 potential predictor variables the potential predictor variables consisted of catchment characteristics and hydro meteorological variables table 2 the catchment characteristics variables included several physical characteristics hypothesized to affect processes of hydrological response to rainfall input holden et al 2006 holden and burt 2003c these characteristics include catchment area relief slope flow path length topographic depressions and gully area extent the catchments were delineated using bluesky lidar dsms with 0 25 m resolution catchment relief was calculated as change in elevation between the highest and lowest elevation in the catchment scaled by the square root of the catchment area ali et al 2015 the average slope for each catchment was computed as the difference between the maximum elevation and outlet elevation over the distance of the longest drainage path length maximum flow path length lmax was identified using d8 single direction flow algorithm hogg et al 1997 after filling the dsm depressions topographic depression storage sd for each catchment was derived as the residual of depression filled dsm and the original dsm converted to storage volume and normalised to catchment area estimates of gully extent for the catchments were derived following methods described in evans and lindsay 2010b flowpath length distributions or width functions express the area of the catchment within a particular flow length band from the outlet i e area length width and have been widely used in unit hydrograph rainfall runoff models diaz granados et al 1984 runoff generated at a given location has a particular flow path length and thus travel time to reach the catchment outlet by expressing the spatially variable flow path lengths as a probability distribution and assuming spatially uniform runoff amount and velocity we can hypothesise that peak discharge should have a positive linear correlation with peak probability density i e maximum width wmax and lag time should be positively correlated with modal flow path length we used kernel density estimation to calculate flowpath length distributions avoiding the problem of sensitivity to binning but introducing a weaker sensitivity to kernel bandwidth we chose an epanechnikov kernel epanechnikov 1969 because we did not expect the distributions to have a particular form a priori and accounted for bandwidth sensitivity by taking median values of our metrics from a range of kernel bandwidths range 0 05 0 5 m n 10 chosen to capture a reasonable range of smoothing for the hydro meteorological variables table 2 total event rainfall totppn the sum of rainfall for the duration of a storm hydrograph and event averaged rainfall intensity pptint the ratio of total event rainfall to event duration were used to represent the storm characteristics while the sum of the 5 day antecedent rainfall api5 was used as a surrogate for the antecedent moisture condition of the catchments we did not examine higher order measures of hyetograph shape for example the degree or orientation of asymmetry in rainfall intensity within a storm 3 data analyses 3 1 classification and regression trees the non parametric classification and regression trees cart modelling approach was used to assess the relative influence of the hydro meteorological predictors table 2 on the hydrological behavior of each catchment the model allows for detection of thresholds in hydro meteorological variables associated with each hydrological response metric this technique has been widely used to analyze complex hydro ecological datasets composed of a response variable and any number of explanatory variables ali et al 2010 rothwell et al 2008 lawler et al 2006 spruill et al 2002 death and fabricius 2000 rejwan et al 1999 breiman et al 1984 the cart analysis was performed in jmp statistical software package e g rothwell et al 2008 lougheed and chow fraser 2002 the model predicts a single response variable by building a nested sequence of reasonably homogenous groups defined by a simple rule applied to predictor variables that can be scanned more than once in a stochastic recursive search of dissimilar subsets it begins from a root node containing all observations in the dataset the algorithm then partitions the root node by applying a logical operator to predictor variables to split the data into two mutually exclusive and reasonably internally homogeneous child nodes rothwell et al 2008 yohannes and hoddinott 1999 both the predictor variable and the logical operation are optimised to minimise the sums of squares within each child node these child nodes become the new parent nodes for the next partitioning the splitting process can be stopped using a range of rules we chose to minimise the sum of squares errors in cross validation a five fold cross validation procedure was used to assess how the results of our model will generalize to an independent dataset this technique randomly partitions the dataset intofive equally sized subsample groups with a single group retained as the validation data for testing the model each group of the subsamples is sequentially used as a test set for the model derived from the combined set of the remaining groups five times this procedure was used to obtain estimates of the true prediction errors for trees of a given size to avoid over sized or over fitted trees with few data in the terminal nodes breiman et al 1984 given the stochastic path dependent nature of our cart analysis we performed multiple runs for each analysis using the akaike information criteria aicc akaike 1974 to quantify model goodness of fit we chose the model that minimised aicc and stopped our analysis when subsequent runs resulted in no significant improvement in aicc p 0 05 3 2 catchment characteristics and hydrological response due to the multi variate character of the dataset principal component analysis pca was used to identify combinations of response variables table 2 that best explain the within catchment variability in their hydrological response pca is a data reduction method that simplifies high dimensional data by transforming the original data into fewer dimensions principal component pcs enabling the identification of gradients trends and influential variables in the summarized dataset lever et al 2017 legendre and legendre 1983 in this study only the first two pc axes are retained so that events are classified into four hydrological response quadrants based on their main characteristics and location in reduced space e g ali et al 2010 for each of the identified hydrological response types or quadrants spearman rank correlation coefficient was subsequently used to measure the strength and direction of the relationships between the metrics of hydrograph response and a suite of catchment and hydro meteorological predictor variables table 2 4 results 4 1 thresholds in hydro meteorological variables figure 2 shows the structure of an optimally pruned cart model for qpeak for catchment c the largest catchment 3 93 ha in the dataset each split in the cart structure is labeled with the threshold value responsible for the split the distribution and the decision variable the structure of all other cart models for each hydrological response variable and catchment are available as supplementary information figure si 2 6 the summary statistics of the cart analysis for all catchments are shown in table 3 the cart models explain 77 90 variance in qpeak across the catchments with pptint identified as the most significant hydro meteorological control contributing 86 98 of the variation explained by the models totppn played only a minor role and antecedent precipitation was less significant still in its control on qpeak in the catchments both were important only in small low intensity storms 14 mm at pptint 3 mm h 1 the cart models explain 50 variance in the runoff coefficient dataset for all but catchments h i and j where it explains 51 63 variance in the dataset unlike qpeak identifying the main hydro meteorological driver of runoff coefficient was more complicated and varied across the catchments with the exception of catchments h and j totppn was the dominant control on runoff coefficients whilst api5 was only important when totppn was below 12 mm in catchments h and j api5 was identified as the most important control on runoff coefficient contributing 40 45 of the variance explained by the models api5 was also identified as the second most important control on runoff coefficient in catchments a d e f g and i totppn was identified as the most significant control on qtot contributing 97 100 of the 59 82 variance explained by the cart models the influence of pptint on qtot is only important when totppn is 22 mm while api5 as a control is only relevant in small rainfall events of low average intensity 1 4 mm h 1 this suggests that in large storms qtot is dominated by totppn while intensity and api only become important for smaller storms for lag time the cart models explain 49 65 variance in the dataset with pptint identified as the most important explanatory variable of lag in the catchments contributing 49 73 of the variance explained by the models totppn was the second most important control and contributed 15 50 of the explained variance the influence of api5 on lag is important when totppn is 20 mm and event averaged rainfall intensity is in the range of 1 4 mm h 1 the cart models for time to peak q in the catchments explain 57 75 variance in the dataset and totppn was identified as the most important control contributing 51 77 of the explained variance in all but catchment a where pptint was slightly more important the influence of api5 on time to peak q is important when totppn is 24 mm and pptint is in the range of 1 4 mm h 1 in general the hydro meteorological variables that best predict a given discharge response e g qpeak are consistent in terms of the share of the variance that they explain across the catchments for qpeak qtot and lag the same predictor pptint is best for all catchments and for qpeak and qtot the other predictors have only a small share of the variance 10 across all catchments for lag across all catchments totppn is always as important as or more important than api but all three predictors explain a non trivial share 11 of the variance in half the catchments for time to peak the behaviour is broadly consistent across catchments pptint and totppn are both important predictors at all catchments totppn is best in 9 10 catchments but the variance share in these nine varies widely 51 77 in the one catchment where pptint is best its variance share is only 2 higher than that of totppn for runoff coefficient all three predictors have a non trivial share of the variance in most catchments 8 10 the order of the predictors in terms of their variance share varies across catchments totppn is best in 8 10 and api in the other two however api is second best in 6 10 and pptint in the other four the cart models using hydro meteorological variables are consistently good predictors of qpeak across all catchments and are good predictors of qtot but with more inter catchment variability timing is less well predicted both lag and time to peak but performance is relatively consistent across catchments runoff coefficients are generally not well predicted by the cart models but there is considerable variability between catchments such that they can explain 43 of the variance in the two best performing catchments but 15 in the worst two there do not appear to be consistent outlier catchments that always differ from the majority whether in terms of the roles of the predictor variables or the models performances instead different catchments appear as outliers for the different discharge properties that are being predicted 4 2 characterization of hydrological response figure 3 shows the pca correlation biplot for catchment c the pca biplots for all other catchments are available as supplementary information figure si 7 across all catchments pca revealed two dominant axes which together explained 73 80 of the variance in the hydrological dataset table 4 thus subsequent pca axes were not considered further the first component pc 1 is associated with qtot qpeak and runoff coefficient while the second pc2 is associated with lag and time to peak q table 4 suggesting that pc 1 is a gradient of runoff magnitude and pc 2 is a gradient of runoff timing based on the positioning of individual events in the reduced pca space and the correlation between descriptor and pc axes the hydrological response types in the four pca quadrants can be partitioned into high low magnitude and quick i e short lag time and time to peak slow i e long lag time and time to peak response types fig 3 the medians and interquartile ranges of response and hydro meteorological variables in each pca segmentation quadrant are shown in table 5 across the range of catchment scales storm events associated with the high magnitude quick timing hq high magnitude slow timing hs low magnitude quick timing lq and low magnitude slow timing ls quadrants of the pca space have median qpeak of 5 6 15 6 l s 1 ha 1 2 9 9 1 l s 1 ha 1 1 9 6 2 l s 1 ha 1 and 1 0 2 9 l s 1 ha 1 respectively median qtot ranges between 18 170 m3 in high magnitude event type and 6 64 m3 in low magnitude events runoff coefficients range between 27 and 73 for high magnitude events and 14 48 for low magnitude events the example storm hydrographs for different pca quadrants in fig 3 demonstrate that rainfall in slow timing events can occur over an extended period but still produce peak q similar in magnitude to quick timing events storm 50 for quick timing events median lag and time to peak q ranged from 23 to 82 min and 40 125 min respectively with median pptint in the range of 2 6 mm h 1 for slow timing events the median lag and time to peak q ranged from 80 to 175 min and 115 273 min respectively with median pptint of 1 3 mm h 1 median time to peak q is consistently longer than lag across catchments and storm types reflecting the near instantaneous response times of these small catchments time to peak primarily reflects the duration of the storm while lag time reflects the response time over which a rainfall signal propagates through the catchment there was high variability in totppn producing high magnitude response with medians of 10 20 mm and interquartile ranges iqr of 6 43 mm compared to totppn medians of 5 7 mm and iqrs of 2 7 mm for low magnitude events table 5 there is appreciable inter catchment variability in peak discharge normalized by area despite the close proximity of the catchments 3 km span and similar conditions all gullied blanket peat for all storm types the cross catchment iqr in qpeak is close to half the cross catchment median table 5 this also suggests that inter catchment variability in peak discharge is retained across storm types rather than emerging only for quick slow large or small storms high flow events have consistently higher runoff coefficients than low flow events with median values across the catchments of 54 56 for large and 28 30 for small events there is considerable variability in runoff coefficient for all catchments and storm types but variability is most extreme for small events where the median iqr across catchments is 20 compared with 14 15 for large events large events have higher and less variable runoff coefficients while small events have lower more variable runoff coefficients the iqr in median runoff coefficient across the 10 catchments is a little less than half the median for qh storm types and this pattern is repeated across the other storm types for large events this between catchment variability iqr of medians 17 22 is larger than the average between storm variability median of the iqrs 14 15 while the opposite is true for small events large events have runoff coefficients that are more consistent across catchments than they are between storms i e the storm drives the response small events are more consistent between storms than they are across catchments i e the catchment drives the response for hq events median lag times vary by a factor of three between catchments from 23 to 60 min but half the catchments have median lags in the range 30 35 min median time to peak is less variable in relative terms a factor of two but more variable in absolute terms with half the medians in the range 73 83 min there is limited inter catchment agreement between the two metrics i e the catchment with the longest or shortest lag is not also the catchment with longest or shortest time to peak across all storm types there is more variability in lag within catchments on average than the variability in average behaviour between catchments this is true for all storm types and is reflected in lower median iqr 28 39 for quick and 55 71 min for slow than iqr of the medians 15 17 for quick and 38 58 min for slow inter catchment variability in median lag is considerable relative to the lag times themselves but is less remarkable relative to lag variability within a given catchment over time time to peak q follows a similar pattern with median iqr always greater than iqr of the medians both metrics highlight considerable variability in discharge timing both within and between catchments 4 3 controls on hydrological response types the spearman rank correlation coefficients between the hydrological response types and hydro meteorological variables are shown in table 6 there were strong positive relationships p 0 01 between qpeak and the hydro meteorological variables pptint and totppn in the majority of catchments in all but ls events qpeak is significantly related to totppn in the majority of the catchments where it is related to intensity but it is rare for totppn to be related in a catchment where intensity is not related 3 21 cases and almost as rare for totppn to be a stronger predictor than intensity in cases where both are significant 5 18 cases with the exception of low magnitude events in catchment i there was no statistically significant p 0 01 relationship between qpeak and api5 for all hydrological response types strong positive relationships were observed between qtot and totppn in the catchments however the strength and significance of these relationships varied with storm type for high magnitude events the relationship was significant for 9 10 catchments with r2 always 0 66 for low magnitude events there were fewer significant relationships 8 10 catchments for lq but only 2 10 for ls and where significant relationships did exist these were weaker with r2 0 69 in all but one case qtot was positively correlated p 0 01 with pptint in high magnitude events no correlation was found between qtot and api5 except for lq events in catchment i runoff coefficient was not well predicted by precipitation properties for high magnitude events other than for c where hq runoff coefficient was positively correlated with pptint and totppn for low magnitude events runoff coefficients were strongly influenced by precipitation properties with negative correlations with pptint for lq events in d e and j with totppn for lq in a and with api5 for both lq and ls in catchment i the discharge timing i e lag and time to peak for quick timing events was more predictable from rainfall properties than slow timing events lag was generally well predicted by ppint in hq events 7 10 events but rarely in lq events 2 10 and almost never in those with slow timing 1 20 for hq events where significant relationships exist they were always negative and were not only more common but also stronger for hq events than for any other event type correlation of lag with totppn was rarer but stronger than with ppint while api5 was rarely 3 40 and inconsistently correlated with lag positive in one case negative in two others ppint is consistently the best predictor of timing metrics 10 40 for lag 10 40 for ttp but the metric that it predicts changes depending on the magnitude of the discharge lag for high magnitude 7 10 but time to peak for low magnitude 7 10 none of the predictors are well correlated with either of the timing metrics for slow timing storms significant correlations in only 8 40 events slow storm timings were more predictable for time to peak than for lag for hs than ls and from totppn ahead of any other predictor the correlation between totppn and time to peak q is positive indicating that larger storms result in longer time to peak there was only one statistically significant relationship between time to peak q and api5 lq events in catchment b correlation shown at p 0 01 and at p 0 05 note that exactly equal correlation coefficients are relatively common in rank based correlation when the sample size is small bold entries indicate the most skillful predictor for each response variable in spite of the small sample size 10 catchments some strong statistically significant relationships p 0 05 were observed between the response and catchment predictor variables table 7 shows the significant spearman rank correlation coefficients between the hydrological variables and catchment characteristics variables catchment area is strongly and positively related to qtot explaining 90 of its variance for all storm types this is consistent with our expectation from mass conservation slope flowpath length metrics and gully area are also well correlated with qtot but these relationships are always weaker than that with area and are likely the result of covariance in predictor variables to account for the influence of precipitation amount and catchment area on total discharge we examine runoff coefficients which normalise for both catchment area and input rainfall catchment area is the best predictor of runoff coefficient for hq storms and second best for small storms it is always negatively correlated maximum catchment width is the best predictor of runoff coefficient for small storms and is always positively correlated runoff coefficient is also significantly negatively correlated with both maximum and modal flowpath length for hq and lq and depression storage for hq storms and positively correlated with gully extent for hq and lq the relationship between peak discharge and catchment characteristics differs between storm types inter catchment differences in quick timing storms are generally more predictable from catchment characteristics with up to 79 and 93 of the variance explained for hq and lq storms respectively peak discharge for quick timing storms whether high or low magnitude are well correlated negatively with modal flow path length and positively with maximum width and gully extent peak discharge for small storms lq and ls is well correlated with catchment area and maximum flow path length negatively and maximum width positively inter catchment differences in high magnitude storms are generally more difficult to predict from catchment characteristics with at most 79 of the variance explained for hq storms and no significant relationships for hs storms maximum width is the most consistent predictor of peak discharge across all storm types with significant relationships for three of the four types though the best predictor differs for each storm type lag and time to peak q were negatively correlated with catchment relief and slope in quick timing events in all cases the relationships are negative such that steeper slope or relief results in faster response times lag is correlated only with relief but for both high and low magnitude events time to peak is correlated with slope and relief but only for low magnitude events i e lq and with modal flow path length but only for high magnitude events i e hq inter catchment variability in lag and time to peak are not predicted by any catchment characteristics for slow timing events 5 discussion 5 1 hydro meteorological controls on hydrological behavior both spearman s rank and cart analyses indicate that total storm discharge for upland blanket peat catchments is primarily predicted by total rainfall tables 3 and 6 the storm type analysis shows strong positive relationships between qtot and totppn in general with strongest relationships for high magnitude events weaker for low magnitude events and particularly weak for low magnitude slow timing events table 6 in large storms total discharge is dominated by totppn while intensity and api only become important for smaller storms table 3 and figure si 2 some storm rainfall is stored within the catchment but the amount does not scale with rainfall amount it is a function of intensity and api in large storms the fraction lost to storage is smaller and total rainfall can explain most of the variance in smaller storms storage becomes increasingly important in these storms storage losses are driven by intensity because shorter more intense storms offer less time for losses e g through evapotranspiration deep groundwater infiltration and api because a wetter catchment has less available storage to fill peak storm discharge is predicted by rainfall intensity for the majority of catchments in all but the low magnitude slow timing storms tables 3 and 6 an intensity control on runoff response has been identified by daniels et al 2008 and evans et al 1999 and is likely due to rapid saturation of the peat leading to saturation excess overland flow which may have a strong component of fresh rainfall within it combined with return flow in these circumstances the hydrograph becomes a transformed function of the hyetograph e g kirchner 2009 nash 1960 thus more kurtotic hyetographs characteristic of more intense storms will generate more kurtotic hydrographs more intense rain implies shorter duration of runoff for the same total precipitation and thus more water to exit the catchment in a given timestep even if water velocity or flood wave celerity is independent of flow depth this effect will be increasingly dominant as catchment size decreases because smaller catchments translate the rainfall signals more directly into discharge e g post and jakeman 1996 heerdegen and reich 1974 for our storm dataset there is evidence of weak positive correlation between totppn and pptint albeit with considerable scatter this correlation implies that more intense storms are also more likely to deliver more rainfall in total so that intensity and amount compound one another however 1 intensity has been identified as the dominant predictor relative to total precipitation by two separate statistical approaches tables 3 and 6 and 2 the mechanism described above suggests that for two storms with the same total rainfall the more intense storm where the rain is delivered over a shorter period will generate a larger peak flow gao et al 2018 suggested from their modelling of a uk blanket peatland that the shape of the hyetograph altered the discharge response even for the same total rainfall though in their case they altered the skew of the hyetograph rather than its average intensity both of the statistical methods applied here indicate that antecedent conditions continue to play a role for less intense or smaller lq ls storms though small storms are less productive of catchment runoff they may have the effect of wetting up the catchments and filling up subsurface stores and topographic depressions enabling the next storm to quickly connect to the catchment outlet even if it is of only low intensity however our results show that while the same may be true in more intense storms this antecedent rainfall and associated storm sequencing has little impact on peak discharge it is possible that the relative roles of total precipitation antecedent precipitation and intensity might change for larger catchments with longer response times however there is little evidence of this for the range of small catchment areas examined here these results together suggest that rainfall intensity is the dominant driver of peak discharge perhaps due to storage dynamics in the upper peat and vegetation but likely also due to simple mass accounting where in the absence of significant or variable storage losses the same volumetric input over a shorter time drives a larger output discharge runoff coefficients vary considerably between storms for any given catchment table 5 but are not well predicted by the hydro meteorological properties examined here whether in cart table 3 figure si 4 or in spearman s rank correlation table 6 this differs from the inter catchment analysis where runoff coefficient is relatively well predicted by catchment characteristics perhaps reflecting a stronger dependence on catchment properties than rainfall properties table 5 shows that high magnitude storms consistently have higher median runoff coefficients than low magnitude storms this is true both on average cross catchment median runoff coefficient 54 56 for high and 28 30 for low magnitude storms and for individual catchments where catchment median runoff coefficient is never higher for a low magnitude storm set i e ql sl than a high magnitude storm set qh sh unlike other metrics examined here runoff coefficients are sensitive to rain gauge uncertainty particularly undercatch since these are aboveground mounted rain gauges on exposed upland sites where wind speeds can be high pollock et al 2018 however given the similarity in elevation and surface roughness at gauging sites we expect undercatch errors to primarily affect absolute values of runoff coefficient rather than relative differences between catchments or storms our results suggest that storm rainfall characteristics intensity and amount are the primary driver of discharge timing with antecedent rainfall having little effect in these peatland systems for lag rainfall intensity is the primary driver with more intense storms resulting in shorter lag times tables 3 and 6 lag times for large storms with quick response times are most predictable table 6 and antecedent conditions are only relevant in small storms figure si 5 for time to peak total rainfall rather than intensity is almost always the most important predictor though both play a significant and sometimes comparable role in all catchments table 3 figure si 6 spearman s rank suggests that rainfall intensity is only a consistently significant predictor of time to peak for low magnitude but quick timing storms table 6 the different controls on lag and time to peak are initially surprising however they reflect the different reference frames within which hydrograph response is being examined for lag which frames timing with respect to peak rainfall rainfall intensity dominates over the amount of rain or the antecedent conditions the shape of the hyetograph i e its peakiness is the primary control on lag the influence of rainfall amount before or during the event on the transmission of flood waves through the catchment is of secondary importance for time to peak which captures the length of the rising limb larger storms in terms of total rainfall result in longer time to peak particularly for high magnitude slow timing storms and this storm size control can be as strong or stronger than that of rainfall intensity this suggests that rainfall duration has a stronger influence on time to peak than it does on lag and is particularly detectable for slow timing events if larger storms are also longer duration i e hs type we expect longer time to peak q but where larger storms are also more intense storms the primary driver is rainfall intensity and lag times are reduced in both cases our results suggest that storm to storm variation in timing of peak discharge whether measured with respect to rainfall or with respect to discharge itself is primarily influenced by the shape of the hyetograph and is dominated by the input signal rather than changes to the system that propagates that signal into discharge as with peak discharge this is consistent with the idea introduced above that small catchments result in only modest transformation from hyetograph to hydrograph 5 2 catchment controls on hydrological behaviour despite the prevalence of detailed experimental and field investigations of rainfall induced runoff production in blanket peat systems of the uk shuttleworth et al 2019 daniels et al 2008 holden and burt 2003a b c evans et al 1999 studies exploring the relationships between hydrological behavior and physical catchment morphometry or characteristics are scarce because these studies tend either to focus on a single catchment or to examine multiple catchments but with varying land cover or drainage conditions howson et al 2021 holden et al 2015 holden et al 2006 findings in this study based on the ten study catchments with the same land cover and drainage regime show that runoff production and transmission across a range of scales 0 2 4 ha in peatland catchments is influenced by a combination of rainfall and catchment characteristics tables 6 and 7 runoff coefficient was strongly negatively correlated with catchment area table 7 negative scaling between catchment area and runoff coefficient has been widely reported e g joel et al 2002 cerdan et al 2004 but to our knowledge only in contexts where runoff is generated by infiltration excess overland flow our result suggests that the same is true for our peat systems where runoff is dominated by saturation excess overland flow runoff transmission is less efficient in these peat systems as catchment area increases with more water lost either to storage groundwater or evaporation logically flow path length scales to catchment area and for our catchments they are related with correlation coefficients of 0 58 for modal flow path length and 0 90 for maximum length this implies that larger catchments that necessitate flow over longer distances and durations will be less hydrologically connected because they contain more opportunities for disconnection and reinforces the importance of thinking spatially outside of the 1d diplotelmic model of peatlands holden and burt 2003a as a result the magnitude of runoff coefficient is reduced with increasing catchment area table 7 the significant positive relationship between runoff coefficient and gully area for quick timing events suggests that gully systems transmit water more efficiently to the catchment outlet during flood relevant events the significant negative relationship between runoff coefficient and topographic depression storage per unit area table 7 suggests that one mechanism for disconnection may be ponding of surface water in micro topographic depressions within these catchments a process which favours storage evaporation and losses to groundwater although this relationship is significant only at 95 confidence and only in hq storms it does suggest that depression storage can influence runoff coefficients depression storage within the catchments 11 42 m3 ha can make up a considerable fraction of their median total discharge even for the hq events considered here 16 90 this storage estimate is derived from analysis of the dsm which includes the low 0 5 m vegetation canopy in the catchments and thus is an upper bound on macro scale depression storage however its resolution 0 25 m likely also leads to an underestimation of surface water storage behind micro scale i e mm cm roughness elements and temporary storage cavities formed by pipe networks smart et al 2013 regensburg et al 2021 subsurface piping may form important temporary storage areas in blanket peatlands but the volume and proportion of pipe networks that remain full or drain between events remains largely unknown given these uncertainties our depression storage estimates are best interpreted as an indicator of relative differences in macroscale storage between catchments depression storage is well correlated with catchment slope which is expected from the geometry of variably tilted roughness elements however catchment slope is never a good predictor of runoff coefficients the role of catchment width in predicting runoff coefficients best for lq and ls second best for hq suggests that the flowpath network structure plays an important role not only in defining the opportunities for disconnection but also in concentrating storm discharge with tighter more peaky flowpath length distributions resulting in higher runoff coefficients this in turn suggests that our runoff coefficients reflect in storm conditions rather than those of the full multi storm hydrograph strong relationships between network structure and runoff coefficient would be expected if runoff routing plays an important role in defining the volume of runoff leaving the catchment over the study period i e the time window over which the coefficient is calculated instead coefficients calculated over longer periods e g encompassing long periods of hydrograph recession and even multiple storms should not display this relationship because routing delays become negligible relative to the duration of the study period since our coefficients reflect in storm rather than full hydrograph conditions they should be interpreted as a metric for rapid storm discharge response rather than for the relative role of streamflow vs non streamflow losses from the catchment these results suggest that catchment area controls runoff coefficient by increasing opportunities for water to be disconnected i e stored within the catchment for the duration of the storm or lost from the system this disconnection is more likely where topographic depression storage is larger or more extensive and less likely where gullies are more extensive both are correlated with catchment area 0 76 and 0 38 respectively in directions that would amplify their effect perhaps explaining the stronger correlation with area than maximum or modal flow path length the negative correlation between runoff coefficient and topographic depression storage table 7 suggests in line with the idea presented by holden et al 2018 that the deliberate artificial creation of storage through distributed shallow water pools targeted in the extreme peatland headwaters sub hectare scale could increase the range of storms within which connectivity and storage remain important and provide additional natural flood management benefits when combined with the current standard restoration measures e g goudarzi et al 2021 shuttleworth et al 2019 however peak discharge appears to be primarily controlled by attenuation particularly in the largest storms this is consistent with the findings of goudarzi et al 2021 and shuttleworth et al 2019 and suggests that restoration interventions on hillslopes will be particularly effective in reducing peak discharge where they increase surface roughness and therefore mobile storage in the sense of goudarzi et al 2021 the considerable overlap between significant predictors of runoff coefficient and peak discharge suggest similar underlying hydrological processes 1 reduced connectivity and increased storage in larger catchments with longer associated flow path lengths but also 2 increased floodwave attenuation for wider flow path length distributions since surface flows typically attenuate as they propagate in addition maximum width is the most consistent predictor of peak discharge suggesting that network structure plays an important role through its control on flood wave arrival times peak discharge for low magnitude storms lq and ls is well correlated negatively with catchment area flowpath length and maximum width consistent with both connectivity and attenuation explanations inter catchment differences in high magnitude storms are generally more difficult to predict from catchment characteristics good predictors for runoff coefficient are no longer significant with respect to peak discharge area maximum flowpath length depression storage instead only gully extent modal flow path length and maximum width are significant predictors and only for quick travel time events these metrics all point towards an increased role of attenuation and topographic concentration due to network structure of surface flow for the high magnitude storms in addition runoff coefficients for high magnitude events are consistently higher than for low magnitude events table 5 indicating a more efficient runoff response taken together these results suggest a minor role for connectivity and a dominant role for attenuation in these high magnitude events high magnitude slow timing events are not well predicted by any catchment variables this suggests that peak discharge in longer more complex storms may reflect the finer detail of the flow path length and thus travel time distribution and its interaction with a particular rainfall time series rather than being a simple function of maximum or modal flow path length inter catchment variability in peak discharge timing i e lag and time to peak is only predictable from catchment characteristics for quick timing events and is best predicted by catchment relief and or slope the relationships are always negative with quicker response times in more steeply sloping catchments table 7 this is consistent with a strong surface gradient control on water velocity celerity e g mcdonnell and beven 2014 manning 1891 though the strength of the influence is somewhat surprising given the modest range of slopes across our study catchments modal flow path length which might be expected to correlate well with timing variables is a significant predictor but only for time to peak and only for hq storms this likely reflects spatially complex floodwave propagation speeds in smaller storms perhaps related to disconnection storage and the time delays associated with filling that storage for slow timing events lag and time to peak are not significantly related to any of the catchment characteristics examined here as with peak discharge this may reflect the more complex rainfall time series associated with slower events and the importance of the detail of each catchment s travel time distribution in these storms this inter catchment comparison highlights the importance of catchment scale not only for total discharge which scales with area as expected but also for both peak discharge and runoff coefficient this is important for our understanding of how catchments function because it suggests that runoff processes even in saturation excess overland flow landscapes and over a relatively small range of catchment areas are very sensitive to scale particularly in small storms and for the partitioning between discharge storage and other losses it has important implications for our research methods because it implies that the scale of catchment under consideration has a first order effect on the measurements themselves even for catchments that vary by less than two orders of magnitude in area this scale dependence could perhaps be mitigated through statistical or process modelling but with considerable care alternatively while process understanding gained at a particular scale is likely to be more easily transferable absolute values e g runoff coefficients lag times or peak discharges should be handled with care and linear upscaling is likely impossible camerat 2002 hydro meteorological thresholds as controls on peak discharge there is a switch in the drivers of peak discharge for storms above a threshold intensity with rainfall intensity the dominant control on discharge in intense storms 5 mm h 1 on average figure si 3 but total and antecedent precipitation becoming important for low magnitude and less intense events the peak discharge response to low intensity storms is consistent with runoff production dominated by saturation excess overland flow since it suggests runoff generation even at very low intensities as long as there is sufficient water input to the system holden and burt 2002 evans et al 1999 burt 1996 the dominant control of rainfall intensity and apparent irrelevance of api on peak discharge for high intensity storms implies that the catchment plays only a very minor role in filtering the rainfall signal in these storms this is surprising for a saturation excess overland flow dominated system because it implies that catchment storage either does not change or that the change does not affect the extent of the critical runoff generating source area we propose the latter in the gullied peat catchments examined here the gullies are relatively linear in a downslope direction and closely spaced the gully sides are steep and the interfluves small ridges between gullies have 0 5 1 m relief over a distance of 5 10 m gully edges have relatively deep water tables and steep hydraulic gradients and are relatively difficult to saturate daniels et al 2008 allott et al 2009 the gully floors and gully heads which are extensive and low gradient with large upslope areas are almost permanently saturated the interfluves between gullies are low gradient with water tables close to the surface and low specific yield such that they saturate after only small amounts of rainfall we suggest that there are two zones 1 gully floors and interfluves and 2 gully edges which define the extent of the critical source areas that expand only by a small amount in response to antecedent rainfall or storm rainfall rainfall amount remains important for example in filling depression storage along flowpaths in order for the floodwave to propagate but the total rainfall necessary to achieve this connectivity is small and delivered early on in intense storms we define this hydrological connectivity as the ability of flood waves to move from one location to another typically the outlet within the catchment and to do so within the timescale of a single storm i e minutes to hours inter catchment comparison also suggests that the controls on peak discharge change with storm size and that connectivity is particularly important for small storms the strong relationship between catchment area and runoff coefficient is difficult to explain without connectivity disconnectivity and an increased likelihood of catchment quickflow losses in larger catchments the same is true for peak discharge in small magnitude events lq and ls but is not the case for high magnitude events which are well predicted only by gully area and modal flowpath length and maximum catchment width for hq all variables that we interpret as indicators that concentration and attenuation of surface flow is the key control both spatial inter catchment and time varying within catchment results point to a switching in rainfall runoff behavior as storm size increases we suggest that this is related to storage within the catchment and the intensity storm size at which this storage is overwhelmed low magnitude events are small enough that disconnection and losses strongly influence peak discharge the system must use a significant fraction of the total rainfall inputs to fill stores and generate connectivity high magnitude events are large enough that they can fill stores and generate connectivity with relatively little impact on peak discharge as a result antecedent conditions are of little importance for these events catchment characteristics that capture connectivity become less skillful predictors of discharge and the catchment begins to function as a relatively simple system delivering runoff with limited thresholds or feedbacks the identification of this threshold behavior has implications for stormflow response to predicted climate change warmer summers are likely to trigger greater convective instability and so there is a risk of increasing frequency of destructive storms associated with high intensity rainfall met office 2019 committee on climate change 2017 since large storm character is influenced primarily by rainfall type catchment based interventions need to be at landscape scale 6 conclusions our examination of rainfall runoff response in ten comparable upland peat micro catchments show that hydrological responses to rainfall vary across small spatial scales the findings reveal that optimal runoff production and transmission in these peat catchments is influenced by a combination of rainfall and catchment characteristics the catchments are heterogeneous and scale dependent in their runoff responses even across the relatively small catchment scale gradient examined here 0 24 3 93 ha rainfall intensity is the dominant hydro meteorological driver for the runoff response of large magnitude storms and antecedent conditions are only relevant for small storms storm to storm variation in timing of peak discharge whether measured with respect to rainfall or with respect to discharge itself is primarily influenced by the shape of the hyetograph and is dominated by the input signal rather than changes to the system that propagates that signal into discharge for peak discharge in high magnitude storms there is a dominant role for attenuation processes in terms of travel times which are controlled by flow path structure and catchment size hydrograph responses in smaller storms are also related to catchment size and we interpret this as a function of decreasing hydrological connectivity as scale increases i e above hectare scale from our data we hypothesise that depression storage is the most likely process control on this dis connectivity our results suggest that the creation of storage through distributed shallow water pools in small scale 0 24 3 93 ha peatland headwater catchments may provide additional natural flood management benefits beyond existing restoration methods further work is however needed to quantify the impact of micro topographic depression storage on runoff delivery in these upland peat catchments peak discharge in longer more complex storms is less predictable from catchment variables and may reflect the finer detail of the travel time distribution and its interaction with a particular rainfall time series both spatial inter catchment and time varying within catchment results point to a switching in rainfall runoff behavior within these catchments where catchment storage connectivity and antecedent conditions are relevant to peak discharge in small storms but become increasingly irrelevant as rainfall intensity increases runoff processes even in saturation excess overland flow landscapes and over a relatively small range of catchment areas are very sensitive to scale particularly in small storms and for the partitioning between discharge storage and other losses the role of scale and heterogeneity has implications for the interpretation of catchment process response from micro catchment data responses inferred from single scale studies do not fully represent those at cognate scales even within what seems a relatively homogenous peatland the dominant role of attenuation in the scaling of runoff generation suggests that efforts to manipulate peatland runoff as a flood risk control measure should pay attention to the potential to manipulate surface roughness and runoff velocities credit authorship contribution statement donald edokpa conceptualization data curation formal analysis

3353,upland blanket peat is widespread in the headwaters of uk catchments but much of it has been degraded through atmospheric pollution vegetation change and erosion runoff generation in these headwaters is an important element of downstream flood risk and these areas are increasingly the focus of interventions to restore the peat ecosystem and to potentially mitigate downstream flooding here we use a series of multivariate analysis techniques to examine controls on storm runoff behavior within and between ten blanket peat catchments all within 5 km of one another and ranging in size from 0 2 to 3 9 ha we find that 1 for all 10 catchments rainfall intensity is the dominant driver for both magnitude and timing of peak discharge and that total and antecedent rainfall is important for peak discharge only in small storms 2 there is considerable inter catchment variability in runoff coefficient lag time peak runoff and their predictability from rainfall however 3 a significant fraction of the inter catchment variability can be explained by catchment characteristics particularly catchment area and 4 catchment controls on peak discharge and runoff coefficient for small storms highlight the importance of storage and connectivity while those for large events suggest that surface flow attenuation dominates together these results suggest a switching rainfall runoff behavior where catchment storage connectivity and antecedent conditions control small discharge peaks but become increasingly irrelevant for larger storms our results suggest that in the context of natural flood management potential expanding depression storage e g distributed shallow water pools in addition to existing restoration methods could increase the range of storms within which connectivity and storage remain important and that for larger storms measures which target surface runoff velocities are likely to be important keywords blanket peat discharge rainfall runoff upland scale storm 1

the uk to regain some of the multiple benefits lost through degradation including biodiversity carbon sequestration climate and water regulation pilkington et al 2015 bonn et al 2014 2009 recent work suggests that such restoration activities also have the potential to reduce flood peak discharge from headwater catchments goudarzi et al 2021 shuttleworth et al 2019 the growing interest in runoff generation processes in upland peat systems has been motivated in part by a desire to harness natural hydrological and morphological processes to mitigate downstream flood risk wingfield et al 2019 dadson et al 2017 however attributing changes in hydrological function to restoration activities requires a good understanding of the hydrological processes at work in degraded peatlands prior to

small headwater catchments of varying sizes ranging between 0 24 and 3 93 ha at a mean elevation of 480 m in the western pennines draining towards greater manchester uk fig 1 table 1 the catchments have a blanket peat cover underlain by sandstones and millstones grit interspersed by shale the landscape is dissected by erosion gullies that are variable in form either branching or running parallel to each other bower 1961 the mean annual rainfall was 2071 mm and mean temperature was 8 98 c with a maximum of 24 3 c and a minimum of 0 87 c recorded in july and december respectively april 2019 march 2020 data obtained from 4 hobo rg3 data logging rain gauges 0 2 mm resolution installed at the monitoring sites although high summer rainfalls are associated with convective storms long winter frontal events also generate flood relevant discharges in the catchments the vegetation of the area consists of a mix of eriophorum vaginatum eriophorum angustifolium and calluna vulgaris with empetrum nigrum ssp hermaphroditum rubus chamaemorus and vaccinium ssp elkington et al 2001 the catchments are labelled a j from west to east fig 1 but do not systematically vary in their characteristics along this transect the study area was impacted by a moorland wildfire in 2018 a burn severity analysis key and benson 2006 using sentinel 2a satellite imagery acquired on 24 june 2018 pre fire and 04 july 2018 post fire showed that our study catchments fall within the unburned and low moderately low burn severity classes millin chalabi unpublished data the vegetation cover of the low severity burn areas had mostly recovered prior to the start of hydrological monitoring in april 2019 comparative within catchment analysis of the hydrological data show no fire impact on the hydrological behavior of the catchments 2 2 hydro meteorological monitoring the monitoring period spans april 2019 to march 2020 similar to the field monitoring of hydrograph behavior described in shuttleworth et al 2019 stream water level was monitored using pressure transducers hobo u20 series in stilling wells installed at 90 v notch weirs located at the outlet of the respective micro catchments table 1 pressure transducers continuously recorded the depth of water d flowing over the v notch at 5 min intervals the recorded water depth was subsequently converted to discharge and normalized to the catchment area to allow for comparative analysis to check for logger performance a calibrated measuring board was attached to the stilling wells and manually read off during monthly logger downloads four rain gauges logging at 5 min intervals were installed in catchments b e g and i their locations were chosen to represent the nearest catchment or approximate geometric centre of catchment clusters specifically rainfall data from the rain gauge at catchment b was used for catchments a b and c rain gauge at e was used for catchments d e and f rain gauge at g for catchments g and h and rain gauge at i for catchments i and j examination of the residuals between the rain gauges reveals no significant spatial bias however there was less error observed between rain gauges closer to each other and on relatively similar catchment elevation than between more distant gauges figure si 1 and table 1 2 3 storm hydrograph extraction hydrographs were extracted for each of the catchments for all storm events that met the following criteria 1 a discrete event without ice snowmelt 2 having a total rainfall of at least 4 mm and 3 resulting in discernible changes in streamflow characteristics storms were identified as potentially at risk of meltwater influence if temperatures fell below 0 c within 2 days of the discharge response and or if there was no rainfall within 2 hrs of a discharge response these storms were not included in the storm set the start of an event was determined as the timestep after which discharge consistently increased for 4 timesteps 20 min the end of an event flow was determined as the point of inflection on the recession limb of the hydrograph beighley et al 2002 bedient and huber 1992 singh 1992 there were a total of 900 extracted hydrographs covering 102 storm events the number of extracted event hydrographs differed between catchments ranging from 68 to 102 due to gaps in discharge data resulting from occasional logger failure for each of the extracted hydrographs five hydrological response metrics were calculated total storm discharge qtot peak storm discharge qpeak runoff coefficient the ratio of area normalised total storm discharge to total storm rainfall lag time the time between peak rainfall and peak discharge following a storm event and time to peak q the time from the start of the hydrograph rising limb to peak discharge the qtot qpeak and runoff coefficients were used to represent the magnitude of stormflow to the streams while lag time and time to peak q were taken as indicators of catchment runoff timings 2 4 potential predictor variables the potential predictor variables consisted of catchment characteristics and hydro meteorological variables table 2 the catchment characteristics variables included several physical characteristics hypothesized to affect processes of hydrological response to rainfall input holden et al 2006 holden and burt 2003c these characteristics include catchment area relief slope flow path length topographic depressions and gully area extent the catchments were delineated using bluesky lidar dsms with 0 25 m resolution catchment relief was calculated as change in elevation between the highest and lowest elevation in the catchment scaled by the square root of the catchment area ali et al 2015 the average slope for each catchment was computed as the difference between the maximum elevation and outlet elevation over the distance of the longest drainage path length maximum flow path length lmax was identified using d8 single direction flow algorithm hogg et al 1997 after filling the dsm depressions topographic depression storage sd for each catchment was derived as the residual of depression filled dsm and the original dsm converted to storage volume and normalised to catchment area estimates of gully extent for the catchments were derived following methods described in evans and lindsay 2010b flowpath length distributions or width functions express the area of the catchment within a particular flow length band from the outlet i e area length width and have been widely used in unit hydrograph rainfall runoff models diaz granados et al 1984 runoff generated at a given location has a particular flow path length and thus travel time to reach the catchment outlet by expressing the spatially variable flow path lengths as a probability distribution and assuming spatially uniform runoff amount and velocity we can hypothesise that peak discharge should have a positive linear correlation with peak probability density i e maximum width wmax and lag time should be positively correlated with modal flow path length we used kernel density estimation to calculate flowpath length distributions avoiding the problem of sensitivity to binning but introducing a weaker sensitivity to kernel bandwidth we chose an epanechnikov kernel epanechnikov 1969 because we did not expect the distributions to have a particular form a priori and accounted for bandwidth sensitivity by taking median values of our metrics from a range of kernel bandwidths range 0 05 0 5 m n 10 chosen to capture a reasonable range of smoothing for the hydro meteorological variables table 2 total event rainfall totppn the sum of rainfall for the duration of a storm hydrograph and event averaged rainfall intensity pptint the ratio of total event rainfall to event duration were used to represent the storm characteristics while the sum of the 5 day antecedent rainfall api5 was used as a surrogate for the antecedent moisture condition of the catchments we did not examine higher order measures of hyetograph shape for example the degree or orientation of asymmetry in rainfall intensity within a storm 3 data analyses 3 1 classification and regression trees the non parametric classification and regression trees cart modelling approach was used to assess the relative influence of the hydro meteorological predictors table 2 on the hydrological behavior of each catchment the model allows for detection of thresholds in hydro meteorological variables associated with each hydrological response metric this technique has been widely used to analyze complex hydro ecological datasets composed of a response variable and any number of explanatory variables ali et al 2010 rothwell et al 2008 lawler et al 2006 spruill et al 2002 death and fabricius 2000 rejwan et al 1999 breiman et al 1984 the cart analysis was performed in jmp statistical software package e g rothwell et al 2008 lougheed and chow fraser 2002 the model predicts a single response variable by building a nested sequence of reasonably homogenous groups defined by a simple rule applied to predictor variables that can be scanned more than once in a stochastic recursive search of dissimilar subsets it begins from a root node containing all observations in the dataset the algorithm then partitions the root node by applying a logical operator to predictor variables to split the data into two mutually exclusive and reasonably internally homogeneous child nodes rothwell et al 2008 yohannes and hoddinott 1999 both the predictor variable and the logical operation are optimised to minimise the sums of squares within each child node these child nodes become the new parent nodes for the next partitioning the splitting process can be stopped using a range of rules we chose to minimise the sum of squares errors in cross validation a five fold cross validation procedure was used to assess how the results of our model will generalize to an independent dataset this technique randomly partitions the dataset intofive equally sized subsample groups with a single group retained as the validation data for testing the model each group of the subsamples is sequentially used as a test set for the model derived from the combined set of the remaining groups five times this procedure was used to obtain estimates of the true prediction errors for trees of a given size to avoid over sized or over fitted trees with few data in the terminal nodes breiman et al 1984 given the stochastic path dependent nature of our cart analysis we performed multiple runs for each analysis using the akaike information criteria aicc akaike 1974 to quantify model goodness of fit we chose the model that minimised aicc and stopped our analysis when subsequent runs resulted in no significant improvement in aicc p 0 05 3 2 catchment characteristics and hydrological response due to the multi variate character of the dataset principal component analysis pca was used to identify combinations of response variables table 2 that best explain the within catchment variability in their hydrological response pca is a data reduction method that simplifies high dimensional data by transforming the original data into fewer dimensions principal component pcs enabling the identification of gradients trends and influential variables in the summarized dataset lever et al 2017 legendre and legendre 1983 in this study only the first two pc axes are retained so that events are classified into four hydrological response quadrants based on their main characteristics and location in reduced space e g ali et al 2010 for each of the identified hydrological response types or quadrants spearman rank correlation coefficient was subsequently used to measure the strength and direction of the relationships between the metrics of hydrograph response and a suite of catchment and hydro meteorological predictor variables table 2 4 results 4 1 thresholds in hydro meteorological variables figure 2 shows the structure of an optimally pruned cart model for qpeak for catchment c the largest catchment 3 93 ha in the dataset each split in the cart structure is labeled with the threshold value responsible for the split the distribution and the decision variable the structure of all other cart models for each hydrological response variable and catchment are available as supplementary information figure si 2 6 the summary statistics of the cart analysis for all catchments are shown in table 3 the cart models explain 77 90 variance in qpeak across the catchments with pptint identified as the most significant hydro meteorological control contributing 86 98 of the variation explained by the models totppn played only a minor role and antecedent precipitation was less significant still in its control on qpeak in the catchments both were important only in small low intensity storms 14 mm at pptint 3 mm h 1 the cart models explain 50 variance in the runoff coefficient dataset for all but catchments h i and j where it explains 51 63 variance in the dataset unlike qpeak identifying the main hydro meteorological driver of runoff coefficient was more complicated and varied across the catchments with the exception of catchments h and j totppn was the dominant control on runoff coefficients whilst api5 was only important when totppn was below 12 mm in catchments h and j api5 was identified as the most important control on runoff coefficient contributing 40 45 of the variance explained by the models api5 was also identified as the second most important control on runoff coefficient in catchments a d e f g and i totppn was identified as the most significant control on qtot contributing 97 100 of the 59 82 variance explained by the cart models the influence of pptint on qtot is only important when totppn is 22 mm while api5 as a control is only relevant in small rainfall events of low average intensity 1 4 mm h 1 this suggests that in large storms qtot is dominated by totppn while intensity and api only become important for smaller storms for lag time the cart models explain 49 65 variance in the dataset with pptint identified as the most important explanatory variable of lag in the catchments contributing 49 73 of the variance explained by the models totppn was the second most important control and contributed 15 50 of the explained variance the influence of api5 on lag is important when totppn is 20 mm and event averaged rainfall intensity is in the range of 1 4 mm h 1 the cart models for time to peak q in the catchments explain 57 75 variance in the dataset and totppn was identified as the most important control contributing 51 77 of the explained variance in all but catchment a where pptint was slightly more important the influence of api5 on time to peak q is important when totppn is 24 mm and pptint is in the range of 1 4 mm h 1 in general the hydro meteorological variables that best predict a given discharge response e g qpeak are consistent in terms of the share of the variance that they explain across the catchments for qpeak qtot and lag the same predictor pptint is best for all catchments and for qpeak and qtot the other predictors have only a small share of the variance 10 across all catchments for lag across all catchments totppn is always as important as or more important than api but all three predictors explain a non trivial share 11 of the variance in half the catchments for time to peak the behaviour is broadly consistent across catchments pptint and totppn are both important predictors at all catchments totppn is best in 9 10 catchments but the variance share in these nine varies widely 51 77 in the one catchment where pptint is best its variance share is only 2 higher than that of totppn for runoff coefficient all three predictors have a non trivial share of the variance in most catchments 8 10 the order of the predictors in terms of their variance share varies across catchments totppn is best in 8 10 and api in the other two however api is second best in 6 10 and pptint in the other four the cart models using hydro meteorological variables are consistently good predictors of qpeak across all catchments and are good predictors of qtot but with more inter catchment variability timing is less well predicted both lag and time to peak but performance is relatively consistent across catchments runoff coefficients are generally not well predicted by the cart models but there is considerable variability between catchments such that they can explain 43 of the variance in the two best performing catchments but 15 in the worst two there do not appear to be consistent outlier catchments that always differ from the majority whether in terms of the roles of the predictor variables or the models performances instead different catchments appear as outliers for the different discharge properties that are being predicted 4 2 characterization of hydrological response figure 3 shows the pca correlation biplot for catchment c the pca biplots for all other catchments are available as supplementary information figure si 7 across all catchments pca revealed two dominant axes which together explained 73 80 of the variance in the hydrological dataset table 4 thus subsequent pca axes were not considered further the first component pc 1 is associated with qtot qpeak and runoff coefficient while the second pc2 is associated with lag and time to peak q table 4 suggesting that pc 1 is a gradient of runoff magnitude and pc 2 is a gradient of runoff timing based on the positioning of individual events in the reduced pca space and the correlation between descriptor and pc axes the hydrological response types in the four pca quadrants can be partitioned into high low magnitude and quick i e short lag time and time to peak slow i e long lag time and time to peak response types fig 3 the medians and interquartile ranges of response and hydro meteorological variables in each pca segmentation quadrant are shown in table 5 across the range of catchment scales storm events associated with the high magnitude quick timing hq high magnitude slow timing hs low magnitude quick timing lq and low magnitude slow timing ls quadrants of the pca space have median qpeak of 5 6 15 6 l s 1 ha 1 2 9 9 1 l s 1 ha 1 1 9 6 2 l s 1 ha 1 and 1 0 2 9 l s 1 ha 1 respectively median qtot ranges between 18 170 m3 in high magnitude event type and 6 64 m3 in low magnitude events runoff coefficients range between 27 and 73 for high magnitude events and 14 48 for low magnitude events the example storm hydrographs for different pca quadrants in fig 3 demonstrate that rainfall in slow timing events can occur over an extended period but still produce peak q similar in magnitude to quick timing events storm 50 for quick timing events median lag and time to peak q ranged from 23 to 82 min and 40 125 min respectively with median pptint in the range of 2 6 mm h 1 for slow timing events the median lag and time to peak q ranged from 80 to 175 min and 115 273 min respectively with median pptint of 1 3 mm h 1 median time to peak q is consistently longer than lag across catchments and storm types reflecting the near instantaneous response times of these small catchments time to peak primarily reflects the duration of the storm while lag time reflects the response time over which a rainfall signal propagates through the catchment there was high variability in totppn producing high magnitude response with medians of 10 20 mm and interquartile ranges iqr of 6 43 mm compared to totppn medians of 5 7 mm and iqrs of 2 7 mm for low magnitude events table 5 there is appreciable inter catchment variability in peak discharge normalized by area despite the close proximity of the catchments 3 km span and similar conditions all gullied blanket peat for all storm types the cross catchment iqr in qpeak is close to half the cross catchment median table 5 this also suggests that inter catchment variability in peak discharge is retained across storm types rather than emerging only for quick slow large or small storms high flow events have consistently higher runoff coefficients than low flow events with median values across the catchments of 54 56 for large and 28 30 for small events there is considerable variability in runoff coefficient for all catchments and storm types but variability is most extreme for small events where the median iqr across catchments is 20 compared with 14 15 for large events large events have higher and less variable runoff coefficients while small events have lower more variable runoff coefficients the iqr in median runoff coefficient across the 10 catchments is a little less than half the median for qh storm types and this pattern is repeated across the other storm types for large events this between catchment variability iqr of medians 17 22 is larger than the average between storm variability median of the iqrs 14 15 while the opposite is true for small events large events have runoff coefficients that are more consistent across catchments than they are between storms i e the storm drives the response small events are more consistent between storms than they are across catchments i e the catchment drives the response for hq events median lag times vary by a factor of three between catchments from 23 to 60 min but half the catchments have median lags in the range 30 35 min median time to peak is less variable in relative terms a factor of two but more variable in absolute terms with half the medians in the range 73 83 min there is limited inter catchment agreement between the two metrics i e the catchment with the longest or shortest lag is not also the catchment with longest or shortest time to peak across all storm types there is more variability in lag within catchments on average than the variability in average behaviour between catchments this is true for all storm types and is reflected in lower median iqr 28 39 for quick and 55 71 min for slow than iqr of the medians 15 17 for quick and 38 58 min for slow inter catchment variability in median lag is considerable relative to the lag times themselves but is less remarkable relative to lag variability within a given catchment over time time to peak q follows a similar pattern with median iqr always greater than iqr of the medians both metrics highlight considerable variability in discharge timing both within and between catchments 4 3 controls on hydrological response types the spearman rank correlation coefficients between the hydrological response types and hydro meteorological variables are shown in table 6 there were strong positive relationships p 0 01 between qpeak and the hydro meteorological variables pptint and totppn in the majority of catchments in all but ls events qpeak is significantly related to totppn in the majority of the catchments where it is related to intensity but it is rare for totppn to be related in a catchment where intensity is not related 3 21 cases and almost as rare for totppn to be a stronger predictor than intensity in cases where both are significant 5 18 cases with the exception of low magnitude events in catchment i there was no statistically significant p 0 01 relationship between qpeak and api5 for all hydrological response types strong positive relationships were observed between qtot and totppn in the catchments however the strength and significance of these relationships varied with storm type for high magnitude events the relationship was significant for 9 10 catchments with r2 always 0 66 for low magnitude events there were fewer significant relationships 8 10 catchments for lq but only 2 10 for ls and where significant relationships did exist these were weaker with r2 0 69 in all but one case qtot was positively correlated p 0 01 with pptint in high magnitude events no correlation was found between qtot and api5 except for lq events in catchment i runoff coefficient was not well predicted by precipitation properties for high magnitude events other than for c where hq runoff coefficient was positively correlated with pptint and totppn for low magnitude events runoff coefficients were strongly influenced by precipitation properties with negative correlations with pptint for lq events in d e and j with totppn for lq in a and with api5 for both lq and ls in catchment i the discharge timing i e lag and time to peak for quick timing events was more predictable from rainfall properties than slow timing events lag was generally well predicted by ppint in hq events 7 10 events but rarely in lq events 2 10 and almost never in those with slow timing 1 20 for hq events where significant relationships exist they were always negative and were not only more common but also stronger for hq events than for any other event type correlation of lag with totppn was rarer but stronger than with ppint while api5 was rarely 3 40 and inconsistently correlated with lag positive in one case negative in two others ppint is consistently the best predictor of timing metrics 10 40 for lag 10 40 for ttp but the metric that it predicts changes depending on the magnitude of the discharge lag for high magnitude 7 10 but time to peak for low magnitude 7 10 none of the predictors are well correlated with either of the timing metrics for slow timing storms significant correlations in only 8 40 events slow storm timings were more predictable for time to peak than for lag for hs than ls and from totppn ahead of any other predictor the correlation between totppn and time to peak q is positive indicating that larger storms result in longer time to peak there was only one statistically significant relationship between time to peak q and api5 lq events in catchment b correlation shown at p 0 01 and at p 0 05 note that exactly equal correlation coefficients are relatively common in rank based correlation when the sample size is small bold entries indicate the most skillful predictor for each response variable in spite of the small sample size 10 catchments some strong statistically significant relationships p 0 05 were observed between the response and catchment predictor variables table 7 shows the significant spearman rank correlation coefficients between the hydrological variables and catchment characteristics variables catchment area is strongly and positively related to qtot explaining 90 of its variance for all storm types this is consistent with our expectation from mass conservation slope flowpath length metrics and gully area are also well correlated with qtot but these relationships are always weaker than that with area and are likely the result of covariance in predictor variables to account for the influence of precipitation amount and catchment area on total discharge we examine runoff coefficients which normalise for both catchment area and input rainfall catchment area is the best predictor of runoff coefficient for hq storms and second best for small storms it is always negatively correlated maximum catchment width is the best predictor of runoff coefficient for small storms and is always positively correlated runoff coefficient is also significantly negatively correlated with both maximum and modal flowpath length for hq and lq and depression storage for hq storms and positively correlated with gully extent for hq and lq the relationship between peak discharge and catchment characteristics differs between storm types inter catchment differences in quick timing storms are generally more predictable from catchment characteristics with up to 79 and 93 of the variance explained for hq and lq storms respectively peak discharge for quick timing storms whether high or low magnitude are well correlated negatively with modal flow path length and positively with maximum width and gully extent peak discharge for small storms lq and ls is well correlated with catchment area and maximum flow path length negatively and maximum width positively inter catchment differences in high magnitude storms are generally more difficult to predict from catchment characteristics with at most 79 of the variance explained for hq storms and no significant relationships for hs storms maximum width is the most consistent predictor of peak discharge across all storm types with significant relationships for three of the four types though the best predictor differs for each storm type lag and time to peak q were negatively correlated with catchment relief and slope in quick timing events in all cases the relationships are negative such that steeper slope or relief results in faster response times lag is correlated only with relief but for both high and low magnitude events time to peak is correlated with slope and relief but only for low magnitude events i e lq and with modal flow path length but only for high magnitude events i e hq inter catchment variability in lag and time to peak are not predicted by any catchment characteristics for slow timing events 5 discussion 5 1 hydro meteorological controls on hydrological behavior both spearman s rank and cart analyses indicate that total storm discharge for upland blanket peat catchments is primarily predicted by total rainfall tables 3 and 6 the storm type analysis shows strong positive relationships between qtot and totppn in general with strongest relationships for high magnitude events weaker for low magnitude events and particularly weak for low magnitude slow timing events table 6 in large storms total discharge is dominated by totppn while intensity and api only become important for smaller storms table 3 and figure si 2 some storm rainfall is stored within the catchment but the amount does not scale with rainfall amount it is a function of intensity and api in large storms the fraction lost to storage is smaller and total rainfall can explain most of the variance in smaller storms storage becomes increasingly important in these storms storage losses are driven by intensity because shorter more intense storms offer less time for losses e g through evapotranspiration deep groundwater infiltration and api because a wetter catchment has less available storage to fill peak storm discharge is predicted by rainfall intensity for the majority of catchments in all but the low magnitude slow timing storms tables 3 and 6 an intensity control on runoff response has been identified by daniels et al 2008 and evans et al 1999 and is likely due to rapid saturation of the peat leading to saturation excess overland flow which may have a strong component of fresh rainfall within it combined with return flow in these circumstances the hydrograph becomes a transformed function of the hyetograph e g kirchner 2009 nash 1960 thus more kurtotic hyetographs characteristic of more intense storms will generate more kurtotic hydrographs more intense rain implies shorter duration of runoff for the same total precipitation and thus more water to exit the catchment in a given timestep even if water velocity or flood wave celerity is independent of flow depth this effect will be increasingly dominant as catchment size decreases because smaller catchments translate the rainfall signals more directly into discharge e g post and jakeman 1996 heerdegen and reich 1974 for our storm dataset there is evidence of weak positive correlation between totppn and pptint albeit with considerable scatter this correlation implies that more intense storms are also more likely to deliver more rainfall in total so that intensity and amount compound one another however 1 intensity has been identified as the dominant predictor relative to total precipitation by two separate statistical approaches tables 3 and 6 and 2 the mechanism described above suggests that for two storms with the same total rainfall the more intense storm where the rain is delivered over a shorter period will generate a larger peak flow gao et al 2018 suggested from their modelling of a uk blanket peatland that the shape of the hyetograph altered the discharge response even for the same total rainfall though in their case they altered the skew of the hyetograph rather than its average intensity both of the statistical methods applied here indicate that antecedent conditions continue to play a role for less intense or smaller lq ls storms though small storms are less productive of catchment runoff they may have the effect of wetting up the catchments and filling up subsurface stores and topographic depressions enabling the next storm to quickly connect to the catchment outlet even if it is of only low intensity however our results show that while the same may be true in more intense storms this antecedent rainfall and associated storm sequencing has little impact on peak discharge it is possible that the relative roles of total precipitation antecedent precipitation and intensity might change for larger catchments with longer response times however there is little evidence of this for the range of small catchment areas examined here these results together suggest that rainfall intensity is the dominant driver of peak discharge perhaps due to storage dynamics in the upper peat and vegetation but likely also due to simple mass accounting where in the absence of significant or variable storage losses the same volumetric input over a shorter time drives a larger output discharge runoff coefficients vary considerably between storms for any given catchment table 5 but are not well predicted by the hydro meteorological properties examined here whether in cart table 3 figure si 4 or in spearman s rank correlation table 6 this differs from the inter catchment analysis where runoff coefficient is relatively well predicted by catchment characteristics perhaps reflecting a stronger dependence on catchment properties than rainfall properties table 5 shows that high magnitude storms consistently have higher median runoff coefficients than low magnitude storms this is true both on average cross catchment median runoff coefficient 54 56 for high and 28 30 for low magnitude storms and for individual catchments where catchment median runoff coefficient is never higher for a low magnitude storm set i e ql sl than a high magnitude storm set qh sh unlike other metrics examined here runoff coefficients are sensitive to rain gauge uncertainty particularly undercatch since these are aboveground mounted rain gauges on exposed upland sites where wind speeds can be high pollock et al 2018 however given the similarity in elevation and surface roughness at gauging sites we expect undercatch errors to primarily affect absolute values of runoff coefficient rather than relative differences between catchments or storms our results suggest that storm rainfall characteristics intensity and amount are the primary driver of discharge timing with antecedent rainfall having little effect in these peatland systems for lag rainfall intensity is the primary driver with more intense storms resulting in shorter lag times tables 3 and 6 lag times for large storms with quick response times are most predictable table 6 and antecedent conditions are only relevant in small storms figure si 5 for time to peak total rainfall rather than intensity is almost always the most important predictor though both play a significant and sometimes comparable role in all catchments table 3 figure si 6 spearman s rank suggests that rainfall intensity is only a consistently significant predictor of time to peak for low magnitude but quick timing storms table 6 the different controls on lag and time to peak are initially surprising however they reflect the different reference frames within which hydrograph response is being examined for lag which frames timing with respect to peak rainfall rainfall intensity dominates over the amount of rain or the antecedent conditions the shape of the hyetograph i e its peakiness is the primary control on lag the influence of rainfall amount before or during the event on the transmission of flood waves through the catchment is of secondary importance for time to peak which captures the length of the rising limb larger storms in terms of total rainfall result in longer time to peak particularly for high magnitude slow timing storms and this storm size control can be as strong or stronger than that of rainfall intensity this suggests that rainfall duration has a stronger influence on time to peak than it does on lag and is particularly detectable for slow timing events if larger storms are also longer duration i e hs type we expect longer time to peak q but where larger storms are also more intense storms the primary driver is rainfall intensity and lag times are reduced in both cases our results suggest that storm to storm variation in timing of peak discharge whether measured with respect to rainfall or with respect to discharge itself is primarily influenced by the shape of the hyetograph and is dominated by the input signal rather than changes to the system that propagates that signal into discharge as with peak discharge this is consistent with the idea introduced above that small catchments result in only modest transformation from hyetograph to hydrograph 5 2 catchment controls on hydrological behaviour despite the prevalence of detailed experimental and field investigations of rainfall induced runoff production in blanket peat systems of the uk shuttleworth et al 2019 daniels et al 2008 holden and burt 2003a b c evans et al 1999 studies exploring the relationships between hydrological behavior and physical catchment morphometry or characteristics are scarce because these studies tend either to focus on a single catchment or to examine multiple catchments but with varying land cover or drainage conditions howson et al 2021 holden et al 2015 holden et al 2006 findings in this study based on the ten study catchments with the same land cover and drainage regime show that runoff production and transmission across a range of scales 0 2 4 ha in peatland catchments is influenced by a combination of rainfall and catchment characteristics tables 6 and 7 runoff coefficient was strongly negatively correlated with catchment area table 7 negative scaling between catchment area and runoff coefficient has been widely reported e g joel et al 2002 cerdan et al 2004 but to our knowledge only in contexts where runoff is generated by infiltration excess overland flow our result suggests that the same is true for our peat systems where runoff is dominated by saturation excess overland flow runoff transmission is less efficient in these peat systems as catchment area increases with more water lost either to storage groundwater or evaporation logically flow path length scales to catchment area and for our catchments they are related with correlation coefficients of 0 58 for modal flow path length and 0 90 for maximum length this implies that larger catchments that necessitate flow over longer distances and durations will be less hydrologically connected because they contain more opportunities for disconnection and reinforces the importance of thinking spatially outside of the 1d diplotelmic model of peatlands holden and burt 2003a as a result the magnitude of runoff coefficient is reduced with increasing catchment area table 7 the significant positive relationship between runoff coefficient and gully area for quick timing events suggests that gully systems transmit water more efficiently to the catchment outlet during flood relevant events the significant negative relationship between runoff coefficient and topographic depression storage per unit area table 7 suggests that one mechanism for disconnection may be ponding of surface water in micro topographic depressions within these catchments a process which favours storage evaporation and losses to groundwater although this relationship is significant only at 95 confidence and only in hq storms it does suggest that depression storage can influence runoff coefficients depression storage within the catchments 11 42 m3 ha can make up a considerable fraction of their median total discharge even for the hq events considered here 16 90 this storage estimate is derived from analysis of the dsm which includes the low 0 5 m vegetation canopy in the catchments and thus is an upper bound on macro scale depression storage however its resolution 0 25 m likely also leads to an underestimation of surface water storage behind micro scale i e mm cm roughness elements and temporary storage cavities formed by pipe networks smart et al 2013 regensburg et al 2021 subsurface piping may form important temporary storage areas in blanket peatlands but the volume and proportion of pipe networks that remain full or drain between events remains largely unknown given these uncertainties our depression storage estimates are best interpreted as an indicator of relative differences in macroscale storage between catchments depression storage is well correlated with catchment slope which is expected from the geometry of variably tilted roughness elements however catchment slope is never a good predictor of runoff coefficients the role of catchment width in predicting runoff coefficients best for lq and ls second best for hq suggests that the flowpath network structure plays an important role not only in defining the opportunities for disconnection but also in concentrating storm discharge with tighter more peaky flowpath length distributions resulting in higher runoff coefficients this in turn suggests that our runoff coefficients reflect in storm conditions rather than those of the full multi storm hydrograph strong relationships between network structure and runoff coefficient would be expected if runoff routing plays an important role in defining the volume of runoff leaving the catchment over the study period i e the time window over which the coefficient is calculated instead coefficients calculated over longer periods e g encompassing long periods of hydrograph recession and even multiple storms should not display this relationship because routing delays become negligible relative to the duration of the study period since our coefficients reflect in storm rather than full hydrograph conditions they should be interpreted as a metric for rapid storm discharge response rather than for the relative role of streamflow vs non streamflow losses from the catchment these results suggest that catchment area controls runoff coefficient by increasing opportunities for water to be disconnected i e stored within the catchment for the duration of the storm or lost from the system this disconnection is more likely where topographic depression storage is larger or more extensive and less likely where gullies are more extensive both are correlated with catchment area 0 76 and 0 38 respectively in directions that would amplify their effect perhaps explaining the stronger correlation with area than maximum or modal flow path length the negative correlation between runoff coefficient and topographic depression storage table 7 suggests in line with the idea presented by holden et al 2018 that the deliberate artificial creation of storage through distributed shallow water pools targeted in the extreme peatland headwaters sub hectare scale could increase the range of storms within which connectivity and storage remain important and provide additional natural flood management benefits when combined with the current standard restoration measures e g goudarzi et al 2021 shuttleworth et al 2019 however peak discharge appears to be primarily controlled by attenuation particularly in the largest storms this is consistent with the findings of goudarzi et al 2021 and shuttleworth et al 2019 and suggests that restoration interventions on hillslopes will be particularly effective in reducing peak discharge where they increase surface roughness and therefore mobile storage in the sense of goudarzi et al 2021 the considerable overlap between significant predictors of runoff coefficient and peak discharge suggest similar underlying hydrological processes 1 reduced connectivity and increased storage in larger catchments with longer associated flow path lengths but also 2 increased floodwave attenuation for wider flow path length distributions since surface flows typically attenuate as they propagate in addition maximum width is the most consistent predictor of peak discharge suggesting that network structure plays an important role through its control on flood wave arrival times peak discharge for low magnitude storms lq and ls is well correlated negatively with catchment area flowpath length and maximum width consistent with both connectivity and attenuation explanations inter catchment differences in high magnitude storms are generally more difficult to predict from catchment characteristics good predictors for runoff coefficient are no longer significant with respect to peak discharge area maximum flowpath length depression storage instead only gully extent modal flow path length and maximum width are significant predictors and only for quick travel time events these metrics all point towards an increased role of attenuation and topographic concentration due to network structure of surface flow for the high magnitude storms in addition runoff coefficients for high magnitude events are consistently higher than for low magnitude events table 5 indicating a more efficient runoff response taken together these results suggest a minor role for connectivity and a dominant role for attenuation in these high magnitude events high magnitude slow timing events are not well predicted by any catchment variables this suggests that peak discharge in longer more complex storms may reflect the finer detail of the flow path length and thus travel time distribution and its interaction with a particular rainfall time series rather than being a simple function of maximum or modal flow path length inter catchment variability in peak discharge timing i e lag and time to peak is only predictable from catchment characteristics for quick timing events and is best predicted by catchment relief and or slope the relationships are always negative with quicker response times in more steeply sloping catchments table 7 this is consistent with a strong surface gradient control on water velocity celerity e g mcdonnell and beven 2014 manning 1891 though the strength of the influence is somewhat surprising given the modest range of slopes across our study catchments modal flow path length which might be expected to correlate well with timing variables is a significant predictor but only for time to peak and only for hq storms this likely reflects spatially complex floodwave propagation speeds in smaller storms perhaps related to disconnection storage and the time delays associated with filling that storage for slow timing events lag and time to peak are not significantly related to any of the catchment characteristics examined here as with peak discharge this may reflect the more complex rainfall time series associated with slower events and the importance of the detail of each catchment s travel time distribution in these storms this inter catchment comparison highlights the importance of catchment scale not only for total discharge which scales with area as expected but also for both peak discharge and runoff coefficient this is important for our understanding of how catchments function because it suggests that runoff processes even in saturation excess overland flow landscapes and over a relatively small range of catchment areas are very sensitive to scale particularly in small storms and for the partitioning between discharge storage and other losses it has important implications for our research methods because it implies that the scale of catchment under consideration has a first order effect on the measurements themselves even for catchments that vary by less than two orders of magnitude in area this scale dependence could perhaps be mitigated through statistical or process modelling but with considerable care alternatively while process understanding gained at a particular scale is likely to be more easily transferable absolute values e g runoff coefficients lag times or peak discharges should be handled with care and linear upscaling is likely impossible camerat 2002 hydro meteorological thresholds as controls on peak discharge there is a switch in the drivers of peak discharge for storms above a threshold intensity with rainfall intensity the dominant control on discharge in intense storms 5 mm h 1 on average figure si 3 but total and antecedent precipitation becoming important for low magnitude and less intense events the peak discharge response to low intensity storms is consistent with runoff production dominated by saturation excess overland flow since it suggests runoff generation even at very low intensities as long as there is sufficient water input to the system holden and burt 2002 evans et al 1999 burt 1996 the dominant control of rainfall intensity and apparent irrelevance of api on peak discharge for high intensity storms implies that the catchment plays only a very minor role in filtering the rainfall signal in these storms this is surprising for a saturation excess overland flow dominated system because it implies that catchment storage either does not change or that the change does not affect the extent of the critical runoff generating source area we propose the latter in the gullied peat catchments examined here the gullies are relatively linear in a downslope direction and closely spaced the gully sides are steep and the interfluves small ridges between gullies have 0 5 1 m relief over a distance of 5 10 m gully edges have relatively deep water tables and steep hydraulic gradients and are relatively difficult to saturate daniels et al 2008 allott et al 2009 the gully floors and gully heads which are extensive and low gradient with large upslope areas are almost permanently saturated the interfluves between gullies are low gradient with water tables close to the surface and low specific yield such that they saturate after only small amounts of rainfall we suggest that there are two zones 1 gully floors and interfluves and 2 gully edges which define the extent of the critical source areas that expand only by a small amount in response to antecedent rainfall or storm rainfall rainfall amount remains important for example in filling depression storage along flowpaths in order for the floodwave to propagate but the total rainfall necessary to achieve this connectivity is small and delivered early on in intense storms we define this hydrological connectivity as the ability of flood waves to move from one location to another typically the outlet within the catchment and to do so within the timescale of a single storm i e minutes to hours inter catchment comparison also suggests that the controls on peak discharge change with storm size and that connectivity is particularly important for small storms the strong relationship between catchment area and runoff coefficient is difficult to explain without connectivity disconnectivity and an increased likelihood of catchment quickflow losses in larger catchments the same is true for peak discharge in small magnitude events lq and ls but is not the case for high magnitude events which are well predicted only by gully area and modal flowpath length and maximum catchment width for hq all variables that we interpret as indicators that concentration and attenuation of surface flow is the key control both spatial inter catchment and time varying within catchment results point to a switching in rainfall runoff behavior as storm size increases we suggest that this is related to storage within the catchment and the intensity storm size at which this storage is overwhelmed low magnitude events are small enough that disconnection and losses strongly influence peak discharge the system must use a significant fraction of the total rainfall inputs to fill stores and generate connectivity high magnitude events are large enough that they can fill stores and generate connectivity with relatively little impact on peak discharge as a result antecedent conditions are of little importance for these events catchment characteristics that capture connectivity become less skillful predictors of discharge and the catchment begins to function as a relatively simple system delivering runoff with limited thresholds or feedbacks the identification of this threshold behavior has implications for stormflow response to predicted climate change warmer summers are likely to trigger greater convective instability and so there is a risk of increasing frequency of destructive storms associated with high intensity rainfall met office 2019 committee on climate change 2017 since large storm character is influenced primarily by rainfall type catchment based interventions need to be at landscape scale 6 conclusions our examination of rainfall runoff response in ten comparable upland peat micro catchments show that hydrological responses to rainfall vary across small spatial scales the findings reveal that optimal runoff production and transmission in these peat catchments is influenced by a combination of rainfall and catchment characteristics the catchments are heterogeneous and scale dependent in their runoff responses even across the relatively small catchment scale gradient examined here 0 24 3 93 ha rainfall intensity is the dominant hydro meteorological driver for the runoff response of large magnitude storms and antecedent conditions are only relevant for small storms storm to storm variation in timing of peak discharge whether measured with respect to rainfall or with respect to discharge itself is primarily influenced by the shape of the hyetograph and is dominated by the input signal rather than changes to the system that propagates that signal into discharge for peak discharge in high magnitude storms there is a dominant role for attenuation processes in terms of travel times which are controlled by flow path structure and catchment size hydrograph responses in smaller storms are also related to catchment size and we interpret this as a function of decreasing hydrological connectivity as scale increases i e above hectare scale from our data we hypothesise that depression storage is the most likely process control on this dis connectivity our results suggest that the creation of storage through distributed shallow water pools in small scale 0 24 3 93 ha peatland headwater catchments may provide additional natural flood management benefits beyond existing restoration methods further work is however needed to quantify the impact of micro topographic depression storage on runoff delivery in these upland peat catchments peak discharge in longer more complex storms is less predictable from catchment variables and may reflect the finer detail of the travel time distribution and its interaction with a particular rainfall time series both spatial inter catchment and time varying within catchment results point to a switching in rainfall runoff behavior within these catchments where catchment storage connectivity and antecedent conditions are relevant to peak discharge in small storms but become increasingly irrelevant as rainfall intensity increases runoff processes even in saturation excess overland flow landscapes and over a relatively small range of catchment areas are very sensitive to scale particularly in small storms and for the partitioning between discharge storage and other losses the role of scale and heterogeneity has implications for the interpretation of catchment process response from micro catchment data responses inferred from single scale studies do not fully represent those at cognate scales even within what seems a relatively homogenous peatland the dominant role of attenuation in the scaling of runoff generation suggests that efforts to manipulate peatland runoff as a flood risk control measure should pay attention to the potential to manipulate surface roughness and runoff velocities credit authorship contribution statement donald edokpa conceptualization data curation formal analysis

3354,the ranwu and rekeng geothermal fields are non magmatic convective geothermal systems located in the western part of the sichuan province the ranwu field is a mid low temperature system with relatively weak geothermal manifestations whiles the rekeng system is the high temperature type with strong manifestations in this study we first investigate the flow processes of the thermal fluids in ranwu by analyzing the hydrogeochemistry of different thermal springs next we ascertain the existence of shallow or deep reservoirs in the two thermal fields and estimate the reservoir temperatures by analyzing the water rock interactions our findings confirm that the ranwu geothermal field is a mid low temperature convective system without magma degassing effects only a reservoir with a temperature of 116 formed beneath ranwu without any relatively shallow reservoirs furthermore we discourage using na k geothermometer for non magmatic convective geothermal systems because it is difficult to achieve na k equilibrium between the fluids and the reservoirs rocks at such relatively low temperatures also the na k ca geothermometer with β 1 3 fails because of the na k imbalance in the two geothermal fields however mg correction improves its accuracy for mg rich thermal waters in ranwu and rekeng probably because the mg k ca system correlates better with the reservoir temperatures than the na k ca system additionally chalcedony and k mg geothermometers are valid for estimating the reservoir temperatures of such geothermal systems comparable estimates of the two geothermometers could be used to establish the existence of shallow or deep reservoirs keywords ranwu geothermal field convective geothermal systems geothermometers water rock reaction reservoirs 1 introduction hydrothermal systems which are a renewable energy source are widely found throughout the world estimating reservoir temperature is crucial in assessing the geothermal energy potential of hydrothermal systems convective geothermal systems without magmatic influence are common and typically have lower reservoir temperatures 150 compared to volcanogenic geothermal systems some may have relatively high reservoir temperatures in tectonically active areas but such systems are rare hydrochemical methods are still predominantly used to evaluate reservoir temperatures rezaei et al 2019 aydin et al 2020 li et al 2021 several geothermometers have been proposed based on the mineral aqueous chemical equilibria over the years they include the cation solute silica isotope and gas geothermometers nicholson 1993 however the validity and accuracy of the various geothermometer types vary depending on the application conditions limiting their applicability to all reservoirs empirical conclusions indicate that the cation solute geothermometers show apparent relationships with the reservoir temperatures and many researchers have verified this observation for example different na k geothermometers always show the close calculating results when the reservoir temperature is higher than about 200 yet have the relatively large deviation as the temperature decreases li et al 2017 so this seems to agree well with the empirical studies that the na k geothermometer is valid for reservoirs with temperatures ranging from 180 to 350 but fails at the lower temperatures ellis 1979 nicholson 1993 also the na li geothermometers work well for the fully equilibrated waters originating from the high temperature parent geothermal water in rehai volcanogenic geothermal system li et al 2021 in addition the na k ca geothermometer is one of the widely used solute geothermometers yet there are still challenges with its application at relatively low temperatures below 200 giggenbach 1988 fournier 1989 chatterjee et al 2019 abdelali et al 2020 besides cation geothermometers the chalcedony and quartz geothermometers also have effective temperature ranges arnórsson 1983 li et al 2020 in recent years the multicomponent geothermometry approach has been developing and has been widely used pang and reed 1998 palandri and reed 2001 spycher et al 2014 spycher et al 2016 xu et al 2016 hou et al 2019 chatterjee et al 2019 however because mg and al input concentrations have a tremendous influence on multicomponent geothermometry this method better complements and verifies classical geothermometers estimates peiffer et al 2014 additionally this approach s estimates for the reservoir temperature are always largely influenced by the mixing and degassing processes pang and reed 1998 currently even for the same water sample different hydrochemical methods obtain different estimates of reservoir temperatures yet the most suitable one is always be chosen by researchers subjectively without adequate reliable reasons harvey et al 2016 nitschke et al 2018 therefore despite the plethora of hydrochemical studies for estimating reservoir temperatures as accurately as possible challenges exist especially for relatively low reservoir temperatures the ranwu geothermal field located in the xiangcheng area has relatively weak geothermal manifestations compared to the high temperature geothermal systems suggesting that it may be a mid low temperature reservoir in this thermal field the geothermal manifestation is mainly non boiling hot springs tong and zhang 1994 first reported the hydrochemical data of the geothermal springs distributed in the ranwu geothermal area however scant or no further studies have investigated the origins of the springs feng et al 2014 also focused on the sinters study from the geothermal waters by analyzing the rare earth elements in ranwu ma 2016 utilized the temperature changes of two hot springs in the same field to survey the earthquakes in the xiangcheng area tang et al 2017 also concluded that magma melting is the main heat source for the batang xiangcheng geothermal field by geophysical methods despite these studies hydrogeochemical methods application in the ranwu area have been dearth and the origins of the springs in the ranwu area are still unclear nonetheless it is more likely that the ranwu geothermal system is a convective geothermal system with a relatively low reservoir temperature based on its characteristics of geothermal manifestation instead of a conductive geothermal system on the other hand the geothermal manifestations in the rekeng geothermal field are strong e g boiling springs geysers and steaming ground yet this field is also a non magmatic convective system with 150 reservoir temperature tian et al 2018 the rekeng and ranwu geothermal fields represent high temperature and low temperature convective geothermal systems respectively with no magmatic degassing processes influencing their hydrochemical compositions therefore firstly we studied the hydrochemical constitutions of the thermal fluids in the ranwu geothermal field to ascertain the geothermal type and heat source then we investigated the mineral aqueous chemical equilibria in the deep and shallow reservoirs of the convective geothermal systems when lacking the magmatic influence for both thermal fields further we applied the appropriate hydrochemical methods to ascertain the existence of reservoirs and obtain relatively accurate temperature estimates 2 geological and geothermal characteristics the ranwu and rekeng geothermal fields are located in western sichuan province belonging to the himalayan geothermal zone many deep fault belts distribute in the western sichuan geothermal area and several active curved inverse faults cut deep into the crust forming geothermal anomaly areas in the region zhou et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 the geothermal springs exposed in the western sichuan geothermal area are mainly distributed along these tectonic fault zones and valleys ageodynamic study of the western sichuan geothermal zone showed that there are two n w and n e trending high anomaly belts with a depth of 24 km beneath xiangcheng geothermal area at about 15 km an n w tensile stress belt or uplifting tectonic zone may cause the regional geothermal anomaly zhang et al 2017 also at 15 30 km deep in the subsurface is a low velocity area possibly implying that a partial melting zone or plastic flow exists in the middle crust that extends 200 km long and this may act as the heat source for the whole western sichuan geothermal area zhang et al 2017 the ranwu geothermal field is the main geothermal manifestation zone in xiangcheng and the hot springs distribute along the trans tensional faults luo 1994 triassic strata are developed in the xiangcheng geothermal area as shown in fig 1 the crystalline limestone is widely exposed on the west side of the ranwu area while the triassic metamorphic sandstone is largely exposed on the east side there are mainly two periods of granites intruding the ranwu area forming the n s granite bodies also the geothermal springs are exposed in the clasolite stratum of the triassic system within a range lower than 1 km they are distributed along the n s direction which is consistent with a nearby fault as illustrated in fig 1 the rekeng geothermal area is located northwest of the ranwu geothermal area and its prominent outcrops are triassic strata primarily composed of clasolite sandstone and carbonate rocks besides the yanshanian igneous rock is another outcrop constituted by monzonite granite and the sampling locations are mainly in the contact zone between sandstone and the igneous rock no underlying magma is found in the rekeng geothermal field and it has been proven that the hot springs in this area mainly originate from the granitic rock reservoirs without any chemical influence by magma degassing processes tang et al 2017 shi et al 2017 li et al 2019 3 sample collection and analysis in the ranwu geothermal field ten 10 samples were collected including nine hot springs and one local cold spring xc5 and the sampling locations are as shown in fig 1 all the water samples were collected directly from the outlets and were filtered on site after cooling naturally before measuring the cation concentrations concentrated hno3 up to 14 m was used to acidify the water samples until the ph values fell below 1 no chemical reagents were added to the samples used for the stable water isotopes δd and δ18o and anions analyses the alkalinity was determined based on the gran titration method proposed by appelo and postma 1996 within 24 h the ph values were measured directly by the hand held meters after calibrating all the cation concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry whiles anion concentrations were analyzed by ion chromatography the hco3 and co2 concentrations were calculated based on alkalinity and ph values in the laboratory using phreeqc software the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes were measured by off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy and a liquid water isotope analyzer iwa 35 ep and the ratios of d h and 18o 16o were expressed with respect to the vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water international standard with d h and 18o 16o measurement precisions of 0 6 and 0 2 respectively the hydrochemical constituents of all water samples and their charge imbalances were calculated by phreeqc are shown in the appendix the sampling locations in the rekeng area were distributed at both sides of river maqu besides bt17 all the geothermal water samples were collected from the boiling or near boiling springs the sampling and analysis processes in the rekeng and ranwu geothermal fields were similar and the hydrochemical data of the neutral geothermal springs in the rekeng were obtained from li et al 2019 4 results 4 1 the origin of geothermal springs in the ranwu geothermal field 4 1 1 hydrochemical characteristics of geothermal springs the hydrochemical type of all the geothermal springs from the ranwu geothermal field was na hco3 with the main anion and cation being hco3 and na respectively the highest concentrations of na and hco3 were 591 9 mg l and 1304 49 mg l respectively however other main cations in the water samples were relatively low such as k 48 51 108 93 mg l ca2 71 58 119 61 mg l and mg2 13 33 21 82 mg l the waters at the thermal springs outlets in ranwu were slightly acid ph ranged from 6 51 to 6 93 indicating probably high contents of co2 based on the alkalinity and ph lab values the concentrations of co2 calculated by phreeqc ranged from 79 71 to 343 01 mg l additionally the relatively low sio2 concentrations 71 7 118 1 mg l for the geothermal water samples compared to the rekeng geothermal area may infer that the ranwu geothermal area has lower reservoir temperatures in the thermal waters from ranwu the chloride cl and boron b concentrations were relatively low cl 115 mg l b 5 5 mg l compared to those in the magmatic geothermal systems in china e g rehai geothermal field western yunnan province for example the reported cl and b concentration for the dagunguo spring in the rehai geothermal field is 539 1 mg l and 17 0 mg l respectively guo and wang 2012 similarly the thermal waters had relatively low so4 2 concentrations ranging from 6 72 to 16 02 mg l 4 1 2 hydrochemical processes of geothermal waters in ranwu geothermal field because cl and b are always considered the conservative components in geothermal fluids they could be used to study the secondary processes that occur after the thermal waters have left the reservoirs truesdell et al 1977 arnórsson and andrésdóttir 1995 a good linear relationship between cl and b often indicates a common reservoir for different thermal waters nicholson 1993 to further study the hydrochemical processes of the geothermal waters in ranwu we used the two species to investigate the influence of secondary processes on na k ca mg and sio2 in the thermal waters during ascent to the earth s surface fig 2 shows plots of b na k ca mg and sio2 against cl for all the water samples in the study areas especially for the samples with relatively high cl concentrations the plots show a good linear relationship between cl and the other species the strong b and cl correlation confirms that the thermal waters originate from the same reservoir but only mix with different amounts of infiltrating groundwater before reaching the earth s surface moreover we can infer that dilution is the primary process that influences the concentrations of the species e g na k ca mg and sio2 in the geothermal springs four of the water samples from ranwu xc1 xc2 xc7 and xc10 had similar cl concentrations pointing that they may be from the same reservoir with little or no direct mixing of infiltrating groundwaters 4 2 extents of water rock interactions in ranwu and rekeng geothermal fields first we used the na k mg triangular diagram to assess the water rock reaction extents of the geothermal springs as shown in fig 3 all the water samples from the ranwu and rekeng failed to achieve the full equilibrium of water rock interactions because none fell on or close to the fully equilibrated line yet the sample points showed a linear relationship indicating their na k concentration ratios were almost constant thus it could be inferred that during the ascent of the thermal waters of rekeng and ranwu mixing with the infiltrating groundwater was a dilutions process and no further water mineral reactions influenced the na and k concentrations additionally most of the water sample points in rekeng fell in the partially equilibrated waters zone while all the ranwu samples were in the immature waters zone hence the extents of water rock interactions in rekeng were relatively large compared to ranwu additionally the large deviation from the fully equilibrated line for the samples in both geothermal fields infer that the estimates of the na k and k mg geothermometers proposed by giggenbach 1988 will differ largely further giggenbach 1988 s co2 fugacities f co2 evaluation diagram was used to study calcium s hydrochemical behavior in the thermal waters of ranwu and rekeng as shown in fig 4 the majority of the sample points of ranwu and rekeng distributed near the rock dissolution line of granite and showed obvious linear relationships however the linear distribution may be related to the mixing processes instead of the isochemical dissolution of rocks as found earlier also the sample points with relatively high k mg ratios were close to the upper f co2 limit equilibrium line probably suggesting a k ca equilibrium for these thermal waters in the reservoirs but without calcite formation therefore this may infer that in the reservoirs of the rekeng and ranwu geothermal areas it is relatively easy to attain k mg ca equilibrium compared to na k mg equilibrium yet similar to na k mg hydrochemical behavior mixing with the infiltrating groundwater instead of secondary water mineral reactions during the ascent of the geothermal water will influence the k mg and ca concentrations for the different water samples the equilibrium lines fig 5 were plotted assuming that the thermal waters reach the k mg sio2 equilibrium based on chalcedony geothermometer maximum steam loss at 100 arnórsson 1983 no steam loss fournier 1977 and k mg geothermometer although the geothermal waters in the reservoirs of ranwu and rekeng have relatively low water rock interaction extents most of the samples in ranwu and rekeng located on the equilibrium lines and were very close to each other fig 5 so tentatively it could be concluded that these samples especially from the ranwu geothermal area originated in the same reservoirs in which k mg and sio2 were in equilibrium for almost all the thermal water samples from rekeng except bt17 the thermal springs are boiling springs or near boiling springs this explains why most of the samples in rekeng were located on the adiabatic cooling line 4 3 the hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of geothermal waters to determine the origin of geothermal waters in ranwu we used the hydrogen δd and oxygen δ18o stable isotopes plot according to the earlier k mg sio2 equilibrium analysis section 4 2 the chalcedony temperatures were used to correct the δd and δ18o for the three boiling springs xc01 xc02 and xc07 tentatively the sample points distributed near the global meteoric water line and showed a linear relationship as expected as shown in fig 6 we infer that rock water reactions cause the 18o enrichment in the geothermal fluids relative to local meteoric water the oxygen isotope shift although the change in the thermal waters from ranwu was marginal 18o 1 additionally because hydrous minerals levels are very minimal compared to geothermal fluids in hydrogeothermal systems truesdell et al 1977 deuterium d could be treated as a conservative constituent to investigate the cooling processes of geothermal fluids during the ascent processes truesdell et al 1977 correction of the δd values and cl concentrations also revealed a linear relationship between δd and cl for the water samples of ranwu fig 7 these observations further confirm that the estimates of chalcedony geothermometer may be close to the reservoir temperature and that the geothermal springs in ranwu are from the same reservoir but later mix with infiltrating groundwater 4 4 estimates of different geothermometers for ranwu and rekeng geothermal waters from the hydrochemical analysis of the extents of water rock interaction the geothermal fluids in ranwu and rekeng did not fully equilibrate presenting a challenge in choosing suitable geothermometers for estimating the reservoir temperatures accurately based on the study above we can conclude that it is relatively easy for the water samples directly originating from the reservoirs to achieve k mg ca and k mg sio2 water mineral reaction equilibrium in both thermal fields in contrast na k mg equilibrium system is absent for these water samples however the main hydrochemical compositions e g na k ca mg and sio2 in the majority of water samples will decrease linearly due to mixing with the infiltrating groundwater without evident changes caused by further water mineral reactions similarly the correction of δd δ18o and cl for the water samples in ranwu indicated that the chalcedony temperature might represent the reservoir temperature therefore k mg na k ca and sio2 chalcedony geothermometers were chosen to estimate the reservoir temperature in ranwu and rekeng geothermal fields table 1 presents the estimates of chalcedony k mg and na k ca geothermometers a relatively small difference was observed between the chalcedony and k mg geothermometers estimates for most samples from ranwu and rekeng as expected because of their close k mg sio2 equilibrium system fig 5 fig 8 graphically illustrates the na k ca geothermometer estimates versus the chalcedony temperatures in the two study fields the estimates of the na k ca geothermometer deviated largely from the chalcedony temperatures in the ranwu area than in rekeng only two of the samples bt26 and bt27 from rekeng with the reservoir temperatures lower than 80 had valid estimates hence at this point we could infer that generally the na k ca geothermometer is not suitable for estimating the reservoir temperatures for the bicarbonate thermal waters however quite interestingly when the mg correction method fournier and potter 1979 was applied fig 8b the majority of the samples from ranwu plotted on the line of equality whiles the results of the samples from the rekeng area remained somewhat the same 5 discussion 5 1 hydrochemical characteristics of non magmatic convective geothermal systems generally the non magmatic convective geothermal systems are always mid low temperature geothermal systems 150 with relatively weak geothermal manifestations like the ranwu geothermal field a few of them like the rekeng geothermal field are the high temperature type 150 with strong manifestations due to their active geological tectonism tian et al 2018 li et al 2019 typically ca concentrations lower than 50 mg l and mg concentrations ranging from 0 01 to 0 1 mg l characterized deep geothermal fluids heated by magmatic degassing because of the relatively high degree of water mineral equilibrium although mixing with infiltrating groundwater may cause ca and mg contents of some geothermal springs to increase giggenbach 1988 nicholson 1993 however all the geothermal springs in ranwu had ca concentrations above 25 mg l with some 50 mg l and mg concentrations higher than 5 mg l the high ca and mg levels indicate that no deep high temperature reservoirs influenced by magma exist rather this thermal field is a mid low temperature geothermal system without any direct magmatic influence additionally b concentration higher than 10 ppm for geothermal waters is always attributed to magma degassing arnórsson and andrésdóttir 1995 dotsika et al 2006 but the b concentrations for all the samples in the ranwu geothermal field were lower than 6 ppm moreover the cl concentrations were much lower than those of typical hydrothermal systems fed by a magmatic degassing process e g rehai and yangbajing geothermal fields in china therefore it is reasonable to conclude from the hydrochemical analysis that the ranwu geothermal field lacks an underlying magma chamber influencing the hydrochemical compositions from the analysis above we can conclude that all the water samples in the ranwu geothermal field originate in the same reservoir the cl enthalpy plot for the water samples of ranwu fig 9 a confirms there exists a reservoir with the temperature of about 116 based on the comparable chalcedony and k mg geothermometers estimates however large deviations were observed for the water samples with the relatively low cl concentrations due to the mixing process therefore we may conclude that no relatively shallow reservoirs form after the mixture of the deep thermal fluid and infiltrating cold water also for all the ranwu water samples the chalcedony temperature and cl concentration showed a better linear relationship thus compared to the k mg system in the geothermal fluid sio2 equilibrates with chalcedony relatively easily at the mixing temperature even though no steady shallow reservoirs form however the dilution processes may also enable the k mg temperature to show a better correlation with the reference temperature once the geothermal fluid leaves the reservoir as illustrated in fig 9 a the reservoir temperature in rekeng about 180 is relatively high compared to ranwu li et al 2019 and the cl enthalpy plot for the geothermal waters of rekeng is shown in fig 9 b like ranwu a deep reservoir exits beneath the rekeng geothermal field the chalcedony temperature had a better linear relationship with the cl concentrations while the k mg temperature only related linearly after the thermal fluid had left the deeper reservoir however in rekeng a shallow reservoir may form after mixing with infiltrating groundwater in summary the origin of geothermal fluids in non magmatic convective geothermal systems can generally be described as follows first surface or meteoric waters circulate to a reservoir heated by the deep heat resource the high temperatures cause the ascent of the thermal waters through faults driven by the increased co2 partial pressures and vapor pressures concurrently surface waters circulating at a shallow depth are heated to a temperature lower than the deep reservoir temperature finally the deep high temperature water will mix with the infiltrating waters before ascending to the earth s surface shallow reservoirs may also form after the mixing 5 2 applicability of geothermometers in non magmatic convective geothermal systems compared to magmatic geothermal systems non magmatic high temperature systems with tectonic heat source have lower reservoir temperatures 200 limiting the applicability of the geothermometers to such systems for convective geothermal systems the thermal springs mainly originate from a relatively deep reservoir yet the deep geothermal waters can mix with infiltrating groundwater during the ascending process resulting in the varying hydrochemical compositions of the geothermal springs nevertheless for a relatively low temperature reservoir 200 it is still difficult to achieve the full equilibrium hence the estimates of some geothermometers deviate from the reservoir temperature considerably so for non magmatic convective geothermal systems the chalcedony and k mg geothermometers can provide valid estimates therefore in the ranwu and rekeng geothermal fields estimates by both geothermometers for the water samples with similar cl concentrations were comparable implying that these water samples possibly are from the same reservoir directly mixing with no or little amounts of infiltrating groundwater as the geothermal fluids ascend via different flowing paths they meet and mix with colder infiltrating groundwater and the extent of dilution determines the fluids surface temperatures sio2 in the mixed geothermal fluids equilibrates with chalcedony rapidly in a new temperature environment thus the enthalpy obtained by the chalcedony geothermometer shows a linear relationship during the mixing processes however the k mg geothermometer estimates deviate from those of the chalcedony geothermometer due to the relatively high mg concentrations in the infiltrating groundwater unless there is enough time to reach the k mg equilibrium in a shallow reservoir from the discussion above we discourage using na k geothermometers to estimate the temperatures of shallow or deep reservoirs in non magmatic convective geothermal systems because it seems difficult to reach the na k equilibrium at relatively low reservoir temperatures 200 however the chalcedony and k mg geothermometers could be employed to ascertain a existence of shallow or deep reservoirs and calculate the reservoir temperature we also observed that the na k ca geothermometer gave considerably high reservoir temperature estimates for the water samples in ranwu yet its estimates improved with no changes for the rekeng system for the ranwu system after mg correction hence the application of na k ca geothermometer in ranwu and rekeng was studied further the na k ca equilibrium systems are controlled by a temperature dependent reaction of silicate minerals and geothermal fluids fournier and truesdell 1973 in this study the estimates of na k ca and chalcedony geothermometers have tremendous variations for the water samples from both geothermal fields however after applying mg correction to the water samples in ranwu which had abnormally high mg concentrations the accuracy of the na k ca geothermometer improved conversely almost no changes were observed for the estimates for the water samples in rekeng after the correction the na k ratios in geothermal fluids are temperature dependent and are linked to the ion exchange reaction between albite and k feldspar giggenbach 1988 the study results indicate that it was difficult for the na k system to reach equilibrium in the non magmatic convective geothermal systems which may be attributed to the relatively low reservoir temperatures 200 based on the discussions above the k mg system equilibrated with sio2 in the geothermal springs originating from the reservoirs of ranwu and rekeng directly moreover from fig 3 for these thermal springs the na k ion exchange reaction between albite and k feldspar failed to reach equilibrium because the sample points deviated from the na k mg equilibrium line at varying degrees therefore although the geothermal fluids in the reservoirs beneath ranwu and rekeng had almost attained the k ca equilibrium as shown in fig 4 they would not reach the aqueous na k ca equilibrium probably due to the na k imbalance because the na k geothermometer always overestimates reservoir temperatures for ca rich geothermal springs the na k ca geothermometer derived by fournier and truesdell 1973 was used to minimize the deviation of na k geothermometers nonetheless the na k ca geothermometer was not valid for the ca rich thermal waters in ranwu for the thermal springs in rekeng with relatively low ca concentrations the estimates of the na k ca geothermometer also showed apparent deviations from the chalcedony temperatures thus we could infer that the poor performance of na k ca geothermometer for estimating the reservoir temperature in the ranwu and rekeng geothermal fields is primarily because the geothermal fluids cannot reach the na k equilibrium in the reservoirs at reservoir temperatures higher than about 200 c k ca and na k systems can easily reach equilibrium synchronously so that the na k ca equilibrium system can establish the relationship with the temperature to verify this conclusion we further studied the relative contents of na k and ca in the thermal waters from both fields as shown in fig 10 interestingly the estimates of the na k ca geothermometer red temperature values in fig 10 were comparable to the equilibrium temperatures black temperature values in fig 10 determined by the k ca and na k full equilibria this verifies the deduction that only na k ca equilibrium system was achieved fully explaining why the na k ca geothermometer performed well hydrogeothermal systems without a magmatic influence such as those in ranwu and rekeng mostly have relatively low reservoir temperatures 200 compared to the volcanogenic systems although there may be exceptional cases the degassing materials of the magma do not influence the hydrochemical constituents of geothermal fluids from these kinds of geothermal systems yet large amounts of gases generated by metamorphic processes may enter the deep reservoirs in rekeng the metamorphic gases including co2 and h2s dissolve in the geothermal waters resulting in some bicarbonate sulfate waters li et al 2019 however due to the low fluid so4 2 concentrations we infer that only co2 mainly influences the thermal waters compositions the metamorphic rocks supply sufficient co2 into the thermal waters which further dissolves the surrounding rocks until a co2 water equilibrium is attained at the reservoir temperature as shown in fig 4 that notwithstanding if the co2 could reach the upper f co2 limit equilibrium instead of the full equilibrium in the thermal waters the na k ca geothermometer estimates will still be valid at the range of 50 300 with 30 deviation as long as the na k reaches the ion exchange equilibrium as shown in fig 10 also we observed reasonable estimates of the na k ca geothermometer with β 4 3 for two samples bt26 and bt27 from rekeng although these samples do not reach the na k and k ca equilibria without the na k ca system equilibria the na k ca geothermometer with β 4 3 may be just an empirical mathematical equation furthermore in fig 10 some of the water samples from the rekeng were close to the full equilibrium line suggesting that the estimates of the na k geothermometer giggenbach 1988 and the na k ca geothermometer were similar by coincidence however the estimates of the two geothermometers for these samples cannot represent the reservoir temperatures unless other geothermometers e g sio2 geothermometers k mg geothermometers give comparable results additionally this study has concluded that the k mg temperature could be much closer to the chalcedony temperatures of most geothermal springs in ranwu and rekeng so the mg k ca system correlates better with the reservoir temperatures compared to the na k ca system before correcting na k ca geothermometer estimates with the mg concentrations the r value r mg mg ca k 100 which is independent of na is calculated hence it could be said that the availability of the na k ca geothermometer relies heavily on the k mg equilibrium in the geothermal fluids this possibly explains why mg correction improved the estimates of the na k ca geothermometer for the mg rich geothermal springs in ranwu to near excellent results relative to the chalcedony temperatures but not for the fluids from rekeng with low mg concentrations the present study has extensively discussed the selection of relatively appropriate geothermometers for more accurate reservoir temperature estimates in the ranwu and the rekeng geothermal fields however although the findings were quite revealing the study s conclusions may be limited and not generally applicable to all non magmatic convective geothermal systems because they were mainly deduced from the rekeng and ranwu hot spring groups therefore further studies involving more thermal spring groups are needed to increase the confidence in this work s conclusions 6 conclusion the ranwu geothermal field has a reservoir about 116 beneath it with no relatively shallow reservoirs also hco3 is the principal anion with low amounts of so4 2 in the thermal fluids generally non magmatic convective geothermal systems have relatively low reservoir temperatures than volcanogenic high temperature geothermal systems although exceptional cases may exist therefore since the na k equilibrium hardly occurs in low temperature reservoirs we discourage applying the na k geothermometer to such low temperature systems 200 the establishment of the na k ca geothermometer with β 1 3 relies on both the na k and k ca systems simultaneously reaching full equilibrium in the reservoirs higher than about 200 in contrast the na k ca geothermometer with β 4 3 may be just an empirical mathematical equation thus na k ca geothermometer seems unsuitable for estimating the reservoir temperatures of low temperature geothermal systems like ranwu and rekeng geothermal fields primarily because the na k imbalance in the thermal waters negatively affects its validity in the two thermal fields the present study has concluded that mg correction to the na k ca geothermometer might be valid for the high mg thermal waters from ranwu and rekeng probably because the mg k ca system correlates better with the reservoir temperatures as compared to the na k ca system hence we can infer that increasing the mg weight may improve the accuracy of the na k ca geothermometer s reservoir temperature estimates although further studies involving more thermal spring groups are needed to confirm this conclusion furthermore the chalcedony and k mg geothermometers could be applied to relatively low temperature geothermal systems and similar results of both geothermometers may be used to establish the presence of shallow or deep reservoirs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

3354,the ranwu and rekeng geothermal fields are non magmatic convective geothermal systems located in the western part of the sichuan province the ranwu field is a mid low temperature system with relatively weak geothermal manifestations whiles the rekeng system is the high temperature type with strong manifestations in this study we first investigate the flow processes of the thermal fluids in ranwu by analyzing the hydrogeochemistry of different thermal springs next we ascertain the existence of shallow or deep reservoirs in the two thermal fields and estimate the reservoir temperatures by analyzing the water rock interactions our findings confirm that the ranwu geothermal field is a mid low temperature convective system without magma degassing effects only a reservoir with a temperature of 116 formed beneath ranwu without any relatively shallow reservoirs furthermore we discourage using na k geothermometer for non magmatic convective geothermal systems because it is difficult to achieve na k equilibrium between the fluids and the reservoirs rocks at such relatively low temperatures also the na k ca geothermometer with β 1 3 fails because of the na k imbalance in the two geothermal fields however mg correction improves its accuracy for mg rich thermal waters in ranwu and rekeng probably because the mg k ca system correlates better with the reservoir

geothermometers could be used to establish the existence of shallow or deep reservoirs keywords ranwu geothermal field convective geothermal systems geothermometers water rock reaction reservoirs 1 introduction hydrothermal systems which are a renewable energy source are widely found throughout the world estimating reservoir temperature is crucial in assessing the geothermal energy potential of hydrothermal systems convective geothermal systems without magmatic influence are common and typically have lower reservoir temperatures 150 compared to volcanogenic geothermal systems some may have relatively high reservoir temperatures in tectonically active areas but such systems are rare hydrochemical methods are still predominantly used to evaluate reservoir temperatures rezaei et al 2019 aydin et al 2020 li et al 2021 several geothermometers have been proposed based on the mineral aqueous chemical equilibria over the years they include the cation solute silica isotope and gas geothermometers nicholson 1993 however the validity and accuracy of the various geothermometer types vary depending on the application conditions limiting their applicability to all reservoirs empirical conclusions indicate that the cation solute geothermometers show apparent relationships with the reservoir temperatures and many researchers have verified this observation for example different na k geothermometers always show the close calculating results when the reservoir temperature is higher than about 200 yet have the relatively large deviation as the temperature decreases li et al 2017 so this seems to agree well with the empirical studies that the na k geothermometer is valid for reservoirs with temperatures ranging from 180 to 350 but fails at the lower temperatures ellis 1979 nicholson 1993 also the na li geothermometers work well for the fully equilibrated waters originating from the high temperature parent geothermal water in rehai volcanogenic geothermal system li et al 2021 in addition the na k ca geothermometer is one of the widely used solute geothermometers yet there are still challenges with its application at relatively low temperatures below 200 giggenbach 1988 fournier 1989 chatterjee et al 2019 abdelali et al 2020 besides cation geothermometers the chalcedony and quartz geothermometers also have effective temperature ranges arnórsson 1983 li et al 2020 in recent years the multicomponent geothermometry approach has been developing and has been widely used pang and reed 1998 palandri and reed 2001 spycher et al 2014 spycher et al 2016 xu et al 2016 hou et al 2019 chatterjee et al 2019 however because mg and al input concentrations have a tremendous influence on multicomponent geothermometry this method better complements and verifies classical geothermometers estimates peiffer et al 2014 additionally this approach s estimates for the reservoir temperature are always largely influenced by the mixing and degassing processes pang and reed 1998 currently even for the same water sample different hydrochemical methods obtain different estimates of reservoir temperatures yet the most suitable one is always be chosen by researchers subjectively without adequate reliable reasons harvey et al 2016 nitschke et al 2018 therefore despite the plethora of hydrochemical studies for estimating reservoir temperatures as accurately as possible challenges exist especially for relatively low reservoir temperatures the ranwu geothermal field located in the xiangcheng area has relatively weak geothermal manifestations compared to the high temperature geothermal systems suggesting that it may be a mid low temperature reservoir in this thermal field the geothermal manifestation is mainly non boiling hot springs tong and zhang 1994 first reported the hydrochemical data of the geothermal springs distributed in the ranwu geothermal area however scant or no further studies have investigated the origins of the springs feng et al 2014 also focused on the sinters study from the geothermal waters by analyzing the rare earth elements in ranwu ma 2016 utilized the temperature changes of two hot springs in the same field to survey the earthquakes in the xiangcheng area tang et al 2017 also concluded that magma melting is the main heat source for the batang xiangcheng geothermal field by geophysical methods despite these studies hydrogeochemical methods application in the ranwu area have been dearth and the origins of the springs in the ranwu area are still unclear nonetheless it is more likely that the ranwu geothermal system is a convective geothermal system with a relatively low reservoir temperature based on its characteristics of geothermal manifestation instead of a conductive geothermal system on the other hand the geothermal manifestations in the rekeng geothermal field are strong e g boiling springs geysers and steaming ground yet this field is also a non magmatic convective system with 150 reservoir temperature tian et al 2018 the rekeng and ranwu geothermal fields represent high temperature and low temperature convective geothermal systems respectively with no magmatic degassing processes influencing their hydrochemical compositions therefore firstly we studied the hydrochemical constitutions of the thermal fluids in the ranwu geothermal field to ascertain the geothermal type and heat source then we investigated the mineral aqueous chemical equilibria in the deep and shallow reservoirs of the convective geothermal systems when lacking the magmatic influence for both thermal fields further we applied the appropriate hydrochemical methods to ascertain the existence of reservoirs and obtain relatively accurate temperature estimates 2 geological and geothermal characteristics the ranwu and rekeng geothermal fields are located in western sichuan province belonging to the himalayan geothermal zone many deep fault belts distribute in the western sichuan geothermal area and several active curved inverse faults cut deep into the crust forming geothermal anomaly areas in the region zhou et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 the geothermal springs exposed in the western sichuan geothermal area are mainly distributed along these tectonic fault zones and valleys ageodynamic study of the western sichuan geothermal zone showed that there are two n w and n e trending high anomaly belts with a depth of 24 km beneath xiangcheng geothermal area at about 15 km an n w tensile stress belt or uplifting tectonic zone may cause the regional geothermal anomaly zhang et al 2017 also at 15 30 km deep in the subsurface is a low velocity area possibly implying that a partial melting zone or plastic flow exists in the middle crust that extends 200 km long and this may act as the heat source for the whole western sichuan geothermal area zhang et al 2017 the ranwu geothermal field is the main geothermal manifestation zone in xiangcheng and the hot springs distribute along the trans tensional faults luo 1994 triassic strata are developed in the xiangcheng geothermal area as shown in fig 1 the crystalline limestone is widely exposed on the west side of the ranwu area while the triassic metamorphic sandstone is largely exposed on the east side there are mainly two periods of granites intruding the ranwu area forming the n s granite bodies also the geothermal springs are exposed in the clasolite stratum of the triassic system within a range lower than 1 km they are distributed along the n s direction which is consistent with a nearby fault as illustrated in fig 1 the rekeng geothermal area is located northwest of the ranwu geothermal area and its prominent outcrops are triassic strata primarily composed of clasolite sandstone and carbonate rocks besides the yanshanian igneous rock is another outcrop constituted by monzonite granite and the sampling locations are mainly in the contact zone between sandstone and the igneous rock no underlying magma is found in the rekeng geothermal field and it has been proven that the hot springs in this area mainly originate from the granitic rock reservoirs without any chemical influence by magma degassing processes tang et al 2017 shi et al 2017 li et al 2019 3 sample collection and analysis in the ranwu geothermal field ten 10 samples were collected including nine hot springs and one local cold spring xc5 and the sampling locations are as shown in fig 1 all the water samples were collected directly from the outlets and were filtered on site after cooling naturally before measuring the cation concentrations concentrated hno3 up to 14 m was used to acidify the water samples until the ph values fell below 1 no chemical reagents were added to the samples used for the stable water isotopes δd and δ18o and anions analyses the alkalinity was determined based on the gran titration method proposed by appelo and postma 1996 within 24 h the ph values were measured directly by the hand held meters after calibrating all the cation concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry whiles anion concentrations were analyzed by ion chromatography the hco3 and co2 concentrations were calculated based on alkalinity and ph values in the laboratory using phreeqc software the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes were measured by off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy and a liquid water isotope analyzer iwa 35 ep and the ratios of d h and 18o 16o were expressed with respect to the vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water international standard with d h and 18o 16o measurement precisions of 0 6 and 0 2 respectively the hydrochemical constituents of all water samples and their charge imbalances were calculated by phreeqc are shown in the appendix the sampling locations in the rekeng area were distributed at both sides of river maqu besides bt17 all the geothermal water samples were collected from the boiling or near boiling springs the sampling and analysis processes in the rekeng and ranwu geothermal fields were similar and the hydrochemical data of the neutral geothermal springs in the rekeng were obtained from li et al 2019 4 results 4 1 the origin of geothermal springs in the ranwu geothermal field 4 1 1 hydrochemical characteristics of geothermal springs the hydrochemical type of all the geothermal springs from the ranwu geothermal field was na hco3 with the main anion and cation being hco3 and na respectively the highest concentrations of na and hco3 were 591 9 mg l and 1304 49 mg l respectively however other main cations in the water samples were relatively low such as k 48 51 108 93 mg l ca2 71 58 119 61 mg l and mg2 13 33 21 82 mg l the waters at the thermal springs outlets in ranwu were slightly acid ph ranged from 6 51 to 6 93 indicating probably high contents of co2 based on the alkalinity and ph lab values the concentrations of co2 calculated by phreeqc ranged from 79 71 to 343 01 mg l additionally the relatively low sio2 concentrations 71 7 118 1 mg l for the geothermal water samples compared to the rekeng geothermal area may infer that the ranwu geothermal area has lower reservoir temperatures in the thermal waters from ranwu the chloride cl and boron b concentrations were relatively low cl 115 mg l b 5 5 mg l compared to those in the magmatic geothermal systems in china e g rehai geothermal field western yunnan province for example the reported cl and b concentration for the dagunguo spring in the rehai geothermal field is 539 1 mg l and 17 0 mg l respectively guo and wang 2012 similarly the thermal waters had relatively low so4 2 concentrations ranging from 6 72 to 16 02 mg l 4 1 2 hydrochemical processes of geothermal waters in ranwu geothermal field because cl and b are always considered the conservative components in geothermal fluids they could be used to study the secondary processes that occur after the thermal waters have left the reservoirs truesdell et al 1977 arnórsson and andrésdóttir 1995 a good linear relationship between cl and b often indicates a common reservoir for different thermal waters nicholson 1993 to further study the hydrochemical processes of the geothermal waters in ranwu we used the two species to investigate the influence of secondary processes on na k ca mg and sio2 in the thermal waters during ascent to the earth s surface fig 2 shows plots of b na k ca mg and sio2 against cl for all the water samples in the study areas especially for the samples with relatively high cl concentrations the plots show a good linear relationship between cl and the other species the strong b and cl correlation confirms that the thermal waters originate from the same reservoir but only mix with different amounts of infiltrating groundwater before reaching the earth s surface moreover we can infer that dilution is the primary process that influences the concentrations of the species e g na k ca mg and sio2 in the geothermal springs four of the water samples from ranwu xc1 xc2 xc7 and xc10 had similar cl concentrations pointing that they may be from the same reservoir with little or no direct mixing of infiltrating groundwaters 4 2 extents of water rock interactions in ranwu and rekeng geothermal fields first we used the na k mg triangular diagram to assess the water rock reaction extents of the geothermal springs as shown in fig 3 all the water samples from the ranwu and rekeng failed to achieve the full equilibrium of water rock interactions because none fell on or close to the fully equilibrated line yet the sample points showed a linear relationship indicating their na k concentration ratios were almost constant thus it could be inferred that during the ascent of the thermal waters of rekeng and ranwu mixing with the infiltrating groundwater was a dilutions process and no further water mineral reactions influenced the na and k concentrations additionally most of the water sample points in rekeng fell in the partially equilibrated waters zone while all the ranwu samples were in the immature waters zone hence the extents of water rock interactions in rekeng were relatively large compared to ranwu additionally the large deviation from the fully equilibrated line for the samples in both geothermal fields infer that the estimates of the na k and k mg geothermometers proposed by giggenbach 1988 will differ largely further giggenbach 1988 s co2 fugacities f co2 evaluation diagram was used to study calcium s hydrochemical behavior in the thermal waters of ranwu and rekeng as shown in fig 4 the majority of the sample points of ranwu and rekeng distributed near the rock dissolution line of granite and showed obvious linear relationships however the linear distribution may be related to the mixing processes instead of the isochemical dissolution of rocks as found earlier also the sample points with relatively high k mg ratios were close to the upper f co2 limit equilibrium line probably suggesting a k ca equilibrium for these thermal waters in the reservoirs but without calcite formation therefore this may infer that in the reservoirs of the rekeng and ranwu geothermal areas it is relatively easy to attain k mg ca equilibrium compared to na k mg equilibrium yet similar to na k mg hydrochemical behavior mixing with the infiltrating groundwater instead of secondary water mineral reactions during the ascent of the geothermal water will influence the k mg and ca concentrations for the different water samples the equilibrium lines fig 5 were plotted assuming that the thermal waters reach the k mg sio2 equilibrium based on chalcedony geothermometer maximum steam loss at 100 arnórsson 1983 no steam loss fournier 1977 and k mg geothermometer although the geothermal waters in the reservoirs of ranwu and rekeng have relatively low water rock interaction extents most of the samples in ranwu and rekeng located on the equilibrium lines and were very close to each other fig 5 so tentatively it could be concluded that these samples especially from the ranwu geothermal area originated in the same reservoirs in which k mg and sio2 were in equilibrium for almost all the thermal water samples from rekeng except bt17 the thermal springs are boiling springs or near boiling springs this explains why most of the samples in rekeng were located on the adiabatic cooling line 4 3 the hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of geothermal waters to determine the origin of geothermal waters in ranwu we used the hydrogen δd and oxygen δ18o stable isotopes plot according to the earlier k mg sio2 equilibrium analysis section 4 2 the chalcedony temperatures were used to correct the δd and δ18o for the three boiling springs xc01 xc02 and xc07 tentatively the sample points distributed near the global meteoric water line and showed a linear relationship as expected as shown in fig 6 we infer that rock water reactions cause the 18o enrichment in the geothermal fluids relative to local meteoric water the oxygen isotope shift although the change in the thermal waters from ranwu was marginal 18o 1 additionally because hydrous minerals levels are very minimal compared to geothermal fluids in hydrogeothermal systems truesdell et al 1977 deuterium d could be treated as a conservative constituent to investigate the cooling processes of geothermal fluids during the ascent processes truesdell et al 1977 correction of the δd values and cl concentrations also revealed a linear relationship between δd and cl for the water samples of ranwu fig 7 these observations further confirm that the estimates of chalcedony geothermometer may be close to the reservoir temperature and that the geothermal springs in ranwu are from the same reservoir but later mix with infiltrating groundwater 4 4 estimates of different geothermometers for ranwu and rekeng geothermal waters from the hydrochemical analysis of the extents of water rock interaction the geothermal fluids in ranwu and rekeng did not fully equilibrate presenting a challenge in choosing suitable geothermometers for estimating the reservoir temperatures accurately based on the study above we can conclude that it is relatively easy for the water samples directly originating from the reservoirs to achieve k mg ca and k mg sio2 water mineral reaction equilibrium in both thermal fields in contrast na k mg equilibrium system is absent for these water samples however the main hydrochemical compositions e g na k ca mg and sio2 in the majority of water samples will decrease linearly due to mixing with the infiltrating groundwater without evident changes caused by further water mineral reactions similarly the correction of δd δ18o and cl for the water samples in ranwu indicated that the chalcedony temperature might represent the reservoir temperature therefore k mg na k ca and sio2 chalcedony geothermometers were chosen to estimate the reservoir temperature in ranwu and rekeng geothermal fields table 1 presents the estimates of chalcedony k mg and na k ca geothermometers a relatively small difference was observed between the chalcedony and k mg geothermometers estimates for most samples from ranwu and rekeng as expected because of their close k mg sio2 equilibrium system fig 5 fig 8 graphically illustrates the na k ca geothermometer estimates versus the chalcedony temperatures in the two study fields the estimates of the na k ca geothermometer deviated largely from the chalcedony temperatures in the ranwu area than in rekeng only two of the samples bt26 and bt27 from rekeng with the reservoir temperatures lower than 80 had valid estimates hence at this point we could infer that generally the na k ca geothermometer is not suitable for estimating the reservoir temperatures for the bicarbonate thermal waters however quite interestingly when the mg correction method fournier and potter 1979 was applied fig 8b the majority of the samples from ranwu plotted on the line of equality whiles the results of the samples from the rekeng area remained somewhat the same 5 discussion 5 1 hydrochemical characteristics of non magmatic convective geothermal systems generally the non magmatic convective geothermal systems are always mid low temperature geothermal systems 150 with relatively weak geothermal manifestations like the ranwu geothermal field a few of them like the rekeng geothermal field are the high temperature type 150 with strong manifestations due to their active geological tectonism tian et al 2018 li et al 2019 typically ca concentrations lower than 50 mg l and mg concentrations ranging from 0 01 to 0 1 mg l characterized deep geothermal fluids heated by magmatic degassing because of the relatively high degree of water mineral equilibrium although mixing with infiltrating groundwater may cause ca and mg contents of some geothermal springs to increase giggenbach 1988 nicholson 1993 however all the geothermal springs in ranwu had ca concentrations above 25 mg l with some 50 mg l and mg concentrations higher than 5 mg l the high ca and mg levels indicate that no deep high temperature reservoirs influenced by magma exist rather this thermal field is a mid low temperature geothermal system without any direct magmatic influence additionally b concentration higher than 10 ppm for geothermal waters is always attributed to magma degassing arnórsson and andrésdóttir 1995 dotsika et al 2006 but the b concentrations for all the samples in the ranwu geothermal field were lower than 6 ppm moreover the cl concentrations were much lower than those of typical hydrothermal systems fed by a magmatic degassing process e g rehai and yangbajing geothermal fields in china therefore it is reasonable to conclude from the hydrochemical analysis that the ranwu geothermal field lacks an underlying magma chamber influencing the hydrochemical compositions from the analysis above we can conclude that all the water samples in the ranwu geothermal field originate in the same reservoir the cl enthalpy plot for the water samples of ranwu fig 9 a confirms there exists a reservoir with the temperature of about 116 based on the comparable chalcedony and k mg geothermometers estimates however large deviations were observed for the water samples with the relatively low cl concentrations due to the mixing process therefore we may conclude that no relatively shallow reservoirs form after the mixture of the deep thermal fluid and infiltrating cold water also for all the ranwu water samples the chalcedony temperature and cl concentration showed a better linear relationship thus compared to the k mg system in the geothermal fluid sio2 equilibrates with chalcedony relatively easily at the mixing temperature even though no steady shallow reservoirs form however the dilution processes may also enable the k mg temperature to show a better correlation with the reference temperature once the geothermal fluid leaves the reservoir as illustrated in fig 9 a the reservoir temperature in rekeng about 180 is relatively high compared to ranwu li et al 2019 and the cl enthalpy plot for the geothermal waters of rekeng is shown in fig 9 b like ranwu a deep reservoir exits beneath the rekeng geothermal field the chalcedony temperature had a better linear relationship with the cl concentrations while the k mg temperature only related linearly after the thermal fluid had left the deeper reservoir however in rekeng a shallow reservoir may form after mixing with infiltrating groundwater in summary the origin of geothermal fluids in non magmatic convective geothermal systems can generally be described as follows first surface or meteoric waters circulate to a reservoir heated by the deep heat resource the high temperatures cause the ascent of the thermal waters through faults driven by the increased co2 partial pressures and vapor pressures concurrently surface waters circulating at a shallow depth are heated to a temperature lower than the deep reservoir temperature finally the deep high temperature water will mix with the infiltrating waters before ascending to the earth s surface shallow reservoirs may also form after the mixing 5 2 applicability of geothermometers in non magmatic convective geothermal systems compared to magmatic geothermal systems non magmatic high temperature systems with tectonic heat source have lower reservoir temperatures 200 limiting the applicability of the geothermometers to such systems for convective geothermal systems the thermal springs mainly originate from a relatively deep reservoir yet the deep geothermal waters can mix with infiltrating groundwater during the ascending process resulting in the varying hydrochemical compositions of the geothermal springs nevertheless for a relatively low temperature reservoir 200 it is still difficult to achieve the full equilibrium hence the estimates of some geothermometers deviate from the reservoir temperature considerably so for non magmatic convective geothermal systems the chalcedony and k mg geothermometers can provide valid estimates therefore in the ranwu and rekeng geothermal fields estimates by both geothermometers for the water samples with similar cl concentrations were comparable implying that these water samples possibly are from the same reservoir directly mixing with no or little amounts of infiltrating groundwater as the geothermal fluids ascend via different flowing paths they meet and mix with colder infiltrating groundwater and the extent of dilution determines the fluids surface temperatures sio2 in the mixed geothermal fluids equilibrates with chalcedony rapidly in a new temperature environment thus the enthalpy obtained by the chalcedony geothermometer shows a linear relationship during the mixing processes however the k mg geothermometer estimates deviate from those of the chalcedony geothermometer due to the relatively high mg concentrations in the infiltrating groundwater unless there is enough time to reach the k mg equilibrium in a shallow reservoir from the discussion above we discourage using na k geothermometers to estimate the temperatures of shallow or deep reservoirs in non magmatic convective geothermal systems because it seems difficult to reach the na k equilibrium at relatively low reservoir temperatures 200 however the chalcedony and k mg geothermometers could be employed to ascertain a existence of shallow or deep reservoirs and calculate the reservoir temperature we also observed that the na k ca geothermometer gave considerably high reservoir temperature estimates for the water samples in ranwu yet its estimates improved with no changes for the rekeng system for the ranwu system after mg correction hence the application of na k ca geothermometer in ranwu and rekeng was studied further the na k ca equilibrium systems are controlled by a temperature dependent reaction of silicate minerals and geothermal fluids fournier and truesdell 1973 in this study the estimates of na k ca and chalcedony geothermometers have tremendous variations for the water samples from both geothermal fields however after applying mg correction to the water samples in ranwu which had abnormally high mg concentrations the accuracy of the na k ca geothermometer improved conversely almost no changes were observed for the estimates for the water samples in rekeng after the correction the na k ratios in geothermal fluids are temperature dependent and are linked to the ion exchange reaction between albite and k feldspar giggenbach 1988 the study results indicate that it was difficult for the na k system to reach equilibrium in the non magmatic convective geothermal systems which may be attributed to the relatively low reservoir temperatures 200 based on the discussions above the k mg system equilibrated with sio2 in the geothermal springs originating from the reservoirs of ranwu and rekeng directly moreover from fig 3 for these thermal springs the na k ion exchange reaction between albite and k feldspar failed to reach equilibrium because the sample points deviated from the na k mg equilibrium line at varying degrees therefore although the geothermal fluids in the reservoirs beneath ranwu and rekeng had almost attained the k ca equilibrium as shown in fig 4 they would not reach the aqueous na k ca equilibrium probably due to the na k imbalance because the na k geothermometer always overestimates reservoir temperatures for ca rich geothermal springs the na k ca geothermometer derived by fournier and truesdell 1973 was used to minimize the deviation of na k geothermometers nonetheless the na k ca geothermometer was not valid for the ca rich thermal waters in ranwu for the thermal springs in rekeng with relatively low ca concentrations the estimates of the na k ca geothermometer also showed apparent deviations from the chalcedony temperatures thus we could infer that the poor performance of na k ca geothermometer for estimating the reservoir temperature in the ranwu and rekeng geothermal fields is primarily because the geothermal fluids cannot reach the na k equilibrium in the reservoirs at reservoir temperatures higher than about 200 c k ca and na k systems can easily reach equilibrium synchronously so that the na k ca equilibrium system can establish the relationship with the temperature to verify this conclusion we further studied the relative contents of na k and ca in the thermal waters from both fields as shown in fig 10 interestingly the estimates of the na k ca geothermometer red temperature values in fig 10 were comparable to the equilibrium temperatures black temperature values in fig 10 determined by the k ca and na k full equilibria this verifies the deduction that only na k ca equilibrium system was achieved fully explaining why the na k ca geothermometer performed well hydrogeothermal systems without a magmatic influence such as those in ranwu and rekeng mostly have relatively low reservoir temperatures 200 compared to the volcanogenic systems although there may be exceptional cases the degassing materials of the magma do not influence the hydrochemical constituents of geothermal fluids from these kinds of geothermal systems yet large amounts of gases generated by metamorphic processes may enter the deep reservoirs in rekeng the metamorphic gases including co2 and h2s dissolve in the geothermal waters resulting in some bicarbonate sulfate waters li et al 2019 however due to the low fluid so4 2 concentrations we infer that only co2 mainly influences the thermal waters compositions the metamorphic rocks supply sufficient co2 into the thermal waters which further dissolves the surrounding rocks until a co2 water equilibrium is attained at the reservoir temperature as shown in fig 4 that notwithstanding if the co2 could reach the upper f co2 limit equilibrium instead of the full equilibrium in the thermal waters the na k ca geothermometer estimates will still be valid at the range of 50 300 with 30 deviation as long as the na k reaches the ion exchange equilibrium as shown in fig 10 also we observed reasonable estimates of the na k ca geothermometer with β 4 3 for two samples bt26 and bt27 from rekeng although these samples do not reach the na k and k ca equilibria without the na k ca system equilibria the na k ca geothermometer with β 4 3 may be just an empirical mathematical equation furthermore in fig 10 some of the water samples from the rekeng were close to the full equilibrium line suggesting that the estimates of the na k geothermometer giggenbach 1988 and the na k ca geothermometer were similar by coincidence however the estimates of the two geothermometers for these samples cannot represent the reservoir temperatures unless other geothermometers e g sio2 geothermometers k mg geothermometers give comparable results additionally this study has concluded that the k mg temperature could be much closer to the chalcedony temperatures of most geothermal springs in ranwu and rekeng so the mg k ca system correlates better with the reservoir temperatures compared to the na k ca system before correcting na k ca geothermometer estimates with the mg concentrations the r value r mg mg ca k 100 which is independent of na is calculated hence it could be said that the availability of the na k ca geothermometer relies heavily on the k mg equilibrium in the geothermal fluids this possibly explains why mg correction improved the estimates of the na k ca geothermometer for the mg rich geothermal springs in ranwu to near excellent results relative to the chalcedony temperatures but not for the fluids from rekeng with low mg concentrations the present study has extensively discussed the selection of relatively appropriate geothermometers for more accurate reservoir temperature estimates in the ranwu and the rekeng geothermal fields however although the findings were quite revealing the study s conclusions may be limited and not generally applicable to all non magmatic convective geothermal systems because they were mainly deduced from the rekeng and ranwu hot spring groups therefore further studies involving more thermal spring groups are needed to increase the confidence in this work s conclusions 6 conclusion the ranwu geothermal field has a reservoir about 116 beneath it with no relatively shallow reservoirs also hco3 is the principal anion with low amounts of so4 2 in the thermal fluids generally non magmatic convective geothermal systems have relatively low reservoir temperatures than volcanogenic high temperature geothermal systems although exceptional cases may exist therefore since the na k equilibrium hardly occurs in low temperature reservoirs we discourage applying the na k geothermometer to such low temperature systems 200 the establishment of the na k ca geothermometer with β 1 3 relies on both the na k and k ca systems simultaneously reaching full equilibrium in the reservoirs higher than about 200 in contrast the na k ca geothermometer with β 4 3 may be just an empirical mathematical equation thus na k ca geothermometer seems unsuitable for estimating the reservoir temperatures of low temperature geothermal systems like ranwu and rekeng geothermal fields primarily because the na k imbalance in the thermal waters negatively affects its validity in the two thermal fields the present study has concluded that mg correction to the na k ca geothermometer might be valid for the high mg thermal waters from ranwu and rekeng probably because the mg k ca system correlates better with the reservoir temperatures as compared to the na k ca system hence we can infer that increasing the mg weight may improve the accuracy of the na k ca geothermometer s reservoir temperature estimates although further studies involving more thermal spring groups are needed to confirm this conclusion furthermore the chalcedony and k mg geothermometers could be applied to relatively low temperature geothermal systems and similar results of both geothermometers may be used to establish the presence of shallow or deep reservoirs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have
