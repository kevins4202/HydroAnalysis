19965,anaerobic membrane bioreactors reduce the energy cost of wastewater treatment and meet filtration requirements for non potable reuse however sulfides h2s hs formed during anaerobic treatment exert a high chlorine demand and inhibit uv disinfection by photon shielding at 254 nm this study evaluated the feasibility of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 for sulfide oxidation uv disinfection for inactivation of ms2 bacteriophage and chlorine to provide a residual for distribution h2o2 treatment at ph 8 favored sulfide oxidation to sulfate in 30 min at a 4 1 h2o2 sulfide stoichiometry compared to a 6 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio treatment of anaerobic effluent with 0 5 mm sulfides with a 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio would increase the applied uv fluence needed for 5 log ms2 inactivation from 180 mj cm 2 to 225 mj cm 2 however the lower h2o2 dose reduced the dose of chlorine needed to quench residual h2o2 and provide a residual for distribution treatment at the 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio was favored because the cost savings in h2o2 and chlorine reagents outweighed the energy savings associated with uv treatment however h2o2 uv chlorine treatment of anaerobic effluent was cost

foregoing aeration and generating methane that can be harvested for energy mccarty et al 2011 however until this decade anaerobic treatment of municipal wastewater was considered impractical anaerobic bacteria are less efficient than aerobic bacteria at metabolizing organics such that anaerobic reactors would require large area footprints or long hydraulic retention times hrts to meet discharge goals mccarty et al 2011 anaerobic membrane bioreactors developed over the past decade have overcome this challenge an example is the staged anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor saf mbr which integrates granular activated carbon gac and ultrafiltration membranes to increase microbial density and solids retention time to overcome anaerobic microbe inefficiency bae et al 2014 yoo et al 2014 at temperatures as low as 8 c a pilot scale saf mbr was able to treat primary effluent to discharge quality at hrts 8 h and area footprints typical of aerobic secondary treatment shin et al 2014

oxidized filtered wastewaters title 22 requires that processes provide a ct product of total chlorine residual and contact time value of 450 mg min l with a contact time of at least 90 min alternatively systems must use spiking tests to demonstrate that the system can achieve 5 log inactivation of the virus surrogate bacteriophage ms2 cdph 2014 bae and shin 2016 showing that anaerobic membrane bioreactor effluent can be treated for unrestricted non potable use is key for the adoption of anaerobic technologies anaerobic membrane bioreactors feature built in membranes smith et al 2012 thereby producing effluent that meets title 22 filtration requirements however since anaerobic effluents are not oxidized it is important to demonstrate that the disinfection system can achieve 5 log inactivation of spiked ms2 bacteriophage and maintain a total chlorine residual for distribution the high concentrations of sulfides and ammonia in anaerobic effluents render this difficult anaerobic biological sulfate reduction converts sulfate so4 2 to sulfides h2s hs lens et al 1998 sarti et al 2010 sulfides are strong odorants hindering public acceptance of non potable reuse waters sulfides also rapidly quench both chlorine and chloramines preventing the use of these disinfectants for pathogen inactivation and maintenance of a residual oxidation of sulfides requires four molar equivalents of total chlorine eq 1 cadena and peters 1988 for an anaerobically treated water containing 30 mg s l of sulfides lens et al 1998 280 mg cl2 l of total chlorine would be required even

disinfectants than free chlorine nrc 2012 furst et al 2018 rendering it difficult to achieve pathogen inactivation goals a 50 mg n l ammonia concentration would require impractically high free chlorine doses 400 mg cl2 l to exceed the breakpoint and achieve a free chlorine residual pressley et al 1972 these chlorine doses are far in excess of the 10 mg cl2 l typically employed to achieve

using a train based on 1 h2o2 for sulfide oxidation 2 uv disinfection to inactivate ms2 bacteriophage and 3 chlorine addition to provide a chloramine residual for distribution in this study we dosed h2o2 to authentic pilot scale saf mbr effluent spiked with sulfides we evaluated reaction kinetics and oxidation products e g sulfate in this matrix as a function of ph sulfides and their oxidation products absorb light at 254 nm the emission wavelength of the low pressure mercury lamps typically used for uv disinfection this study further characterized the effects of sulfides and their oxidation products on inactivation of ms2 coliphage during subsequent uv disinfection finally this study evaluated the chlorine dose required to achieve a chloramine residual for distribution after h2o2 and uv treatment these results were used to develop a preliminary cost comparison between the h2o2 uv chlorine treatment scheme for anaerobic effluents and the conventional application of chloramine disinfection of aerobic effluents materials and methods materials stock solutions of 30 h2o2 and 5 6 6 5 sodium hypochlorite naocl were diluted with deionized water and standardized

using e coli atcc 700891 as the host organism and purified using methods previously described king et al 2020 szczuka et al 2020 and stored at 80 c prior to use water sample and buffer preparation anaerobically treated secondary effluent samples were collected from a pilot scale saf mbr system treating micro screened sewage from the stanford university campus the pilot reactor and operation

collected from the reactor filtered through 0 7 μm glass fiber filters whatman and stored at 4 c before use at the time of use concentrations of all sulfur species of interest were below detection alternatively phosphate buffer was prepared in deionized water and deoxygenated by boiling and sparging with nitrogen gas kinetics experiments samples 250 ml of saf mbr effluent were spiked with sulfides hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide was used to adjust sample ph ph was measured using a ph probe fisher accumet once the target ph was reached the 250 ml samples were aliquoted into 25 ml vials and capped headspace free control experiments indicated that sulfide concentrations in each vial were within 5 of each other and sulfide concentrations did not decrease over the 2 h time frame of the kinetics experiments to initiate the reaction h2o2 was injected into samples using a syringe at each timepoint 25 ml vials were sacrificed for immediate absorbance and total sulfide analysis the remainder of each 25 ml vial was treated with 5 mm zncl2 to precipitate zns for low ph samples naoh was added to promote zns precipitation h2o2 and sulfate concentrations were measured by colorimetric methods immediately after zncl2 treatment samples were then treated with 2 mg l catalase 250 units mg to degrade residual h2o2 and were saved for sulfite and thiosulfate analysis by ion chromatography control experiments showed that zncl2 did not affect h2o2 sulfate sulfite and thiosulfate concentrations and that quenching of h2o2 by catalase did not affect the analysis of sulfate sulfite and thiosulfate by ion chromatography experiments were conducted in duplicate uv experiments saf mbr or phosphate buffered deionized water samples were placed in 5 cm depth open top cylindrical dishes and spiked with sulfides sulfate sulfite or thiosulfate under different conditions hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide was used to adjust sample ph ms2 was spiked into the samples targeting an initial concentration of 106 pfu ml h2o2 was spiked into some samples quartz lids were placed on each jar and the samples were placed on a stir plate and exposed to 254 nm light under a semi collimated beam apparatus consisting of three 15 w philips low pressure mercury lamps shining down onto the jars through a shutter the saf mbr effluent samples had been filtered after collection to control turbidity the incident uv fluence mj cm 2 associated with specific illumination times was measured using iodide iodate actinometry rahn et al 2003 one objective of the study was to evaluate the extent to which sulfides and their oxidation products absorb uv light thereby requiring higher incident uv fluence and thus higher costs to achieve the same level of disinfection therefore we report the incident uv fluence rather than correcting the incident fluence for solution absorbance i e the average uv fluence experienced by the solution for perspective the uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 for the anaerobic effluent was 0 044 cm 1 uv transmittance uvt 90 4 in the absence of sulfides for a 5 cm depth of solution the average uv fluence within the solution would be 80 of the incident uv fluence jin et al 2006 at desired intervals subsamples for ms2 analysis were taken from the jars stored on ice and plated within two hours of collection control experiments showed that 1 sulfide concentrations at the end of experiments remained within 5 of the initial concentrations in dark controls in the absence of h2o2 and 2 ms2 concentrations were not affected by h2o2 sulfides thiosulfate sulfite or sulfate in dark controls experiments were conducted in duplicate or triplicate except where noted as an indication of the error associated with these experiments the relative standard deviation of the pseudo first order ms2 inactivation rate constants fit to triplicate experiments involving ms2 spiked into saf mbr effluent at ph 9 2 without sulfides fig 3b was 10 7 analyses uv254

quality general water quality parameters for the pilot scale saf mbr unit effluent are listed in table s1 the chemical oxygen demand cod superset of bod5 of the effluent 25 mg l was 30 mg l meeting discharge criteria ammonia 62 6 mg n l was the only inorganic nitrogen species present in the effluent inorganic nitrogen oxidation is not expected during anaerobic treatment at the 62 6 mg n l ammonia concentration a 571 mg cl2 l chlorine dose would be needed to achieve a free chlorine residual 1 8 1 chlorine ammonia molar ratio the effluent ph 7 2 and uv254 absorbance 0 044 cm 1 were similar to values previously reported for this pilot unit szczuka et al 2019 the chloride concentration 51 5 mg l was 70 mg l the most restrictive recommendation for non potable water reuse us epa 2012 and 250 mg l the u s epa s secondary maximum contaminant level mcl established to avoid salt associated taste issues in potable water us epa 2016 since sulfate reduction to sulfides precedes methanogenesis lens et al 1998 we expect nearly quantitative conversion of sulfate to sulfides in saf mbr effluent thus sulfide concentrations ultimately depend on sulfate concentrations in the sewage influent the drinking water supply serving the area contributing sewage to the saf mbr pilot facility is the hetch hetchy reservoir a low sulfate surface water overlaying granite bedrock sulfide concentrations in the saf mbr pilot effluent typically are 2 mg s l szczuka et al 2019 but total sulfides sulfate sulfite and thiosulfate were below detection limits for the effluent employed for this study this low sulfate sewage enabled the isolation of the effect of sulfides by spiking sulfides into the saf mbr effluent sewage at other facilities can feature higher sulfate concentrations resulting from minerals e g gypsum in groundwater derived municipal drinking water supplies e g 84 mg l sulfate 880 μm in well water from dayton ohio snoeyink and jenkins 1980 the sulfate levels within municipal drinking water are supplemented by 20 50 mg l sulfate 200 500 μm from household and industrial discharges metcalf and eddy 1991 lastly saltwater infiltration into sewers can increase sulfate loads in coastal areas for example sulfate concentrations in sewage increase from 600 μm in the summer to 1000 μm in the winter at silicon valley clean water redwood city ca when the winter rainy season promotes saltwater infiltration from san francisco bay hansen 2021 previous pilot scale research on anaerobic membrane bioreactors has treated sewage with up to 3 mm sulfate gimenez et al 2011 while removal of sulfate prior to anaerobic treatment would avoid sulfide formation and enhance methane production techniques such as ion exchange are challenging within a primary effluent matrix timescale and products of sulfide oxidation by h2o2 previous research conducted in deionized water demonstrated that the stoichiometry products and kinetics of sulfide oxidation by h2o2 are ph dependent eqs 3 and 4 hoffmann 1977 millero et al 1989 at ph below the 7 1 pka of h2s h2o2 oxidation of h2s favors elemental sulfur formation over timescales of hours k 0 48 m 1 min 1 hoffmann 1977 consuming one molar equivalent of h2o2 at ph 7 1 h2o2 oxidation of hs favors sulfate formation over timescales of minutes k 29 m 1 min 1 hoffmann 1977 consuming four molar equivalents of h2o2 however this previous research employed h2o2 at high molar excess 10 20 fold and focused on low ph conditions 7 with limited experiments at ph 8 we evaluated h2o2 oxidation of 500 μm sulfides spiked into saf mbr effluent to mimic sulfide concentrations expected in saf mbr effluents at typical water reuse facilities i e sewage sulfate concentrations 50 mg l the first objective of these experiments was to evaluate the kinetics of sulfide oxidation focusing on higher ph conditions within the range 5 6 9 2 feasible for ph adjustment during wastewater treatment and on h2o2 sulfide molar ratios 1 10 closer to the expected stoichiometric requirements in order to limit reagent supply costs conducting these experiments within saf mbr effluent was important to incorporate the h2o2 demand of the saf mbr effluent matrix the second objective was to evaluate product formation with a particular focus on the extent to which h2o2 oxidation mitigates the negative impacts on uv disinfection associated with the absorption of germicidal uv light at 254 nm uv254 by sulfides fig 1 provides the loss of sulfides and h2o2 formation of sulfate and change in uv254 for application of 2 mm h2o2 i e the 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio that is stoichiometric for oxidation to sulfate at ph 5 6 3 hs ph 7 2 50 hs ph 8 0 89 hs and ph 9 2 99 hs figure s1 provides the concentrations of sulfite and thiosulfate sulfide oxidation by h2o2 was slowest at ph 5 6 fig 1a accompanied by consumption of only 360 µm h2o2 after 30 min fig 1b at ph 5 6 the dominance of h2s 97 would favor slow kinetics and the consumption of 360 μm h2o2 is close to the 500 μm expected for consumption of 1 molar equivalent of h2o2 to form elemental sulfur no sulfate thiosulfate or sulfite were observed figs 1c and s1 attempts to measure elemental sulfur by hplc with uv detection were not successful due to the low concentration 500 μm involved however when the experiment was conducted in deionized water buffered at ph 5 6 with 2 mm phosphate buffer the solution turned faintly cloudy indicative of the formation of colloidal elemental sulfur figure s2 provides uv spectra for sulfides spiked into saf mbr effluent at each of the four ph values demonstrating that sulfides absorb uv light at 254 nm for reaction at ph 5 6 the uv254 increased significantly leveling out after 30 min in either saf mbr effluent fig 1d or deionized water figure s3 we measured molar absorption coefficients at 254 nm of 85 m 1 cm 1 for h2s and of 830 m 1 cm 1 for elemental sulfur on a molar s basis text s1 indicating that the conversion of h2s to elemental sulfur would increase uv254 as observed the molar absorption coefficient of elemental sulfur was determined in 90 methanol and 10 deionized water due to the low solubility of elemental sulfur thus a portion of elemental sulfur would form a separate colloidal phase in aqueous media as observed in the deionized water experiment if sulfide oxidation were followed by membrane based treatment processes e g microfiltration or reverse osmosis within a potable reuse train colloidal sulfur would contribute to membrane clogging regardless the slow h2s oxidation kinetics and increase in uv254 at ph 5 6 are problematic for non potable reuse treatment sulfide oxidation by h2o2 was significantly faster at ph 7 2 fig 1a accompanied by h2o2 consumption after 30 min of 1330 µm 1550 µm and 1720 µm at ph 7 2 8 0 and 9 6 respectively fig 1b these findings align with expectations of a shift in reaction mechanism with the change in sulfide speciation the predominance of hs above ph 7 1 favors faster kinetics and the consumption of 1330 1720 μm h2o2 approaches the 2000 μm expected for consumption of 4 molar equivalents of h2o2 to form sulfate for the 2 mm h2o2 dose in these experiments the characteristic time for hs oxidation would be 17 min based on the 29 m 1 min 1 rate constant provided by hoffmann 1977 comparable to the timescale for sulfide degradation observed for ph 7 2 where hs predominates thus interference with h2o2 oxidation of sulfides by the saf mbr matrix was not important the lower h2o2 consumption at ph 7 than at ph 8 0 and 9 2 reflects the co occurrence of h2s and hs at this ph support for the change in reaction mechanism with sulfide speciation is provided by the measured concentrations of sulfate thiosulfate and sulfite figs 1c and s1 sulfate formation was significant for ph 7 2 reaching 200 µm at ph 7 2 220 µm at ph 8 0 and 290 µm at ph 9 2 after 30 min fig 1c however complete oxidation to sulfate s 6 did not occur concentrations of thiosulfate s2o3 2 s 2 reached 50 μm at ph 7 2 and 80 μm at ph 9 2 after 30 min figure s1a sulfite so3 2 s 4 was also observed at ph 7 2 but at lower concentrations maximum 10 μm and declined to negligible levels after 30 min figure s1b the detection of thiosulfate and sulfite demonstrate incomplete oxidation of sulfides and concur with previous reports of thiosulfate formation during h2o2 oxidation of sulfides in deoxygenated deionized water at ph 9 0 takenaka et al 2003 figure s2 provides uv spectra 200 400 nm for 500 μm of sulfides sulfate thiosulfate or sulfite spiked into saf mbr effluent at each of the four ph values sulfides feature absorbance peaks with maxima near 230 nm but extending to 254 nm figure s2a we calculated molar absorption coefficients at 230 nm and 254 nm for hs text s1 the 7570 m 1 cm 1 value for the hs molar absorption coefficient at 230 nm agrees with the 8000 m 1 cm 1 value determined previously by zuman and szafranski 1976 since the uv absorbance at 254 nm by hs ε254 950 m 1 cm 1 is stronger than by h2s ε254 85 m 1 cm 1 text s1 the uv254 increases strongly as ph increases from 5 6 to 7 2 and then moderately for further ph increases reaching 2 5 cm 1 at ph 9 2 figure s2a while sulfate does not absorb uv light figure s2b thiosulfate and sulfite both absorb uv at 200 250 nm without ph dependence although to a lesser degree than hs figures s2c and s2d the molar absorption coefficients at 254 nm we calculated for thiosulfate and sulfite were 200 m 1 cm 1 and 20 m 1 cm 1 respectively table s2 the saf mbr effluent exhibited 0 044 cm 1 uvt 90 4 uv254 background absorbance i e without sulfides table s1 for the treatment of 500 μm sulfides in saf mbr effluent with 2000 μm h2o2 the initial uv254 was highest 0 8 cm 1 uvt 16 at ph 9 2 fig 1d reflecting the predominance of hs at ph 8 0 and 9 2 the uv254 declined to 0 25 cm 1 uvt 56 after 30 min this decline reflects the conversion of hs to sulfate and thiosulfate the latter contributing to the residual absorbance above the saf mbr background at ph 7 2 where h2s and hs co occur the uv254 decreased from 0 65 cm 1 to 0 5 cm 1 reflecting the oxidation of h2s to elemental sulfur and hs to sulfate and thiosulfate overall the results indicate that ph adjustment to 8 0 would facilitate sulfide oxidation within 30 min while minimizing uv254 for subsequent uv disinfection effect of h2o2 dose for 500 μm sulfides spiked into saf mbr effluent we tested the effect of h2o2 sulfide molar ratio 1 10 on the concentrations of reactants products and uv254 after 30 min fig 2 the time at which reactant degradation and product formation leveled out for ph 7 2 fig 1 at ph 5 6 125 μm sulfides were consumed at a 1 1 molar ratio leaving a low h2o2 residual fig 2 at a 4 1 molar ratio sulfide consumption increased to 200 μm while consuming 360 μm h2o2 however at higher molar ratios each additional molar equivalent of h2o2 removed 12 μm sulfides while leaving an additional 480 μm h2o2 no sulfate thiosulfate or sulfite was observed figs 2 and s3 these results reflect the slow oxidation of h2s to elemental sulfur by h2o2 oxidation with no further significant oxidation of the elemental sulfur accordingly additional h2o2 accumulates with some modest consumption by reaction with the saf mbr effluent matrix constituents the increase in the uv254 from 0 15 cm 1 at a 1 1 molar ratio to 0 45 cm 1 at a 4 1 molar ratio is associated with absorbance by elemental sulfur with only modest further increases in uv254 at higher molar ratios fig 2d at ph 7 2 8 0 and 9 2 sulfides were reduced to 150 μm at a 1 1 molar ratio leaving negligible h2o2 residuals at a 4 1 molar ratio sulfides declined to 30 μm with residual h2o2 concentrations ranging from 200 μm at ph 9 2 to 800 μm at ph 7 2 fig 2b further increases in the molar ratio produced only modest further reductions in residual sulfide concentrations down to 11 μm at a 10 1 molar ratio but at a cost of 460 μm increase in residual h2o2 for each additional 500 μm h2o2 i e each unit increase in the molar ratio the 40 µm consumption of the additional h2o2 indicates reactions of h2o2 with other constituents of saf mbr effluent h2o2 has been shown to readily react with organic matter in aerobically treated wastewater ksibi 2006 both sulfate fig 2c and thiosulfate figure s4 were observed complete oxidation of hs should form 500 µm sulfate the detection of thiosulfate and the formation of sulfate at concentrations 500 μm even at a 10 1 molar ratio and ph 9 2 indicates that complete oxidation did not occur sulfate concentrations increased between molar ratios of 1 and 4 leveling out at higher molar ratios with the highest concentrations 300 μm observed for ph 8 0 and 9 2 but 200 μm at ph 7 2 thiosulfate concentrations declined with increasing molar ratio from 120 150 μm at a 1 1 molar ratio to 40 μm at a 10 1 molar ratio thiosulfate is expected to form under alkaline conditions but to decline when h2o2 is in stoichiometric excess takenaka et al 2003 at the lowest molar ratios the highest thiosulfate concentrations were observed at ph 7 2 concurring with expectations that the lower molar ratios and the slower kinetics associated with the mixture of h2s and hs at this ph would favor the formation of this intermediate given that elemental sulfur thiosulfate and sulfides absorb uv light at 254 nm figure s2 uv254 was minimized 0 2 cm 1 uvt 63 at h2o2 sulfide molar ratios 6 at ph 8 0 fig 2d the higher uv254 observed at ph 7 2 0 45 cm 1 uvt 36 similar to ph 5 6 despite concentrations of sulfides and thiosulfate comparable to those at ph 8 0 and 9 2 is attributable to elemental sulfur thus a 6 1 molar ratio at ph 8 0 would minimize the reagent costs for ph adjustment and potentially minimize the uv fluence required for pathogen inactivation by minimizing uv254 however the uv254 at ph 8 0 and a 4 1 molar ratio was only 25 higher 0 25 cm 1 uvt 56 than at the 6 1 molar ratio thus at ph 8 0 the lower cost of the h2o2 reagent at the 4 1 molar ratio must be weighed against the lower cost associated with uv fluence to achieve pathogen inactivation at the 6 1 molar ratio effect of sulfides on log inactivation of ms2 fig 3 a shows that uv inactivation of bacteriophage ms2 in phosphate buffer in the presence of 500 μm sulfides is ph dependent in the absence of sulfides a uv fluence of 175 mj cm 2 achieved a 4 5 log removal value lrv of bacteriophage ms2 regardless of ph data for ph 7 2 shown in the presence of sulfides at ph 5 6 ms2 inactivation was similar to the no sulfide control however 175 mj cm 2 uv fluence achieved only 1 5 and 1 3 ms2 lrvs at ph 7 2 and 9 2 respectively approximating ms2 inactivation by first order kinetics uv fluence based first order inactivation rate constants would be 0 055 0 022 and 0 017 cm2 mj 1 at ph 5 6 7 2 and 9 2 respectively the 0 06 cm2 mj 1 values measured in the absence of sulfides concurs with previous determinations for treatment of groundwater among other water types templeton et al 2006 hinjen et al 2006 extrapolating from this data uv doses of 530 and 670 mj cm 2 would be required to achieve a 5 log inactivation for bacteriophage ms2 at ph 7 2 and 9 2 respectively for comparison the national water research institute nwri recommends that uv systems deliver a 90 mj cm 2 uv fluence for non potable reuse of membrane filtered municipal effluents treated by conventional aerobic secondary biological treatment processes nwri 2012 fig 3b shows the effect of sulfides and sulfide oxidation products on uv inactivation of bacteriophage ms2 in phosphate buffer at ph 9 2 ms2 inactivation rates were within 18 for 1 mm sulfite 0 061 cm2 mj 1 1 mm sulfate 0 067 cm2 mj 1 and the no addition control 0 057 cm2 mj 1 however the inactivation rate decreased to 0 035 cm2 mj 1 for 1 mm thiosulfate such that a 330 mj cm 2 uv fluence would be required to achieve 5 log inactivation of ms2 uv inactivation of ms2 occurs predominantly by photo oxidation of the genome which absorbs uv light at 254 nm ye et al 2018 the inhibition of bacteriophage ms2 inactivation by uv in the presence of hs i e sulfides at ph 7 2 and thiosulfate may relate to shielding of ms2 by absorption of 254 nm light by hs and s2o3 2 or to reversal of the photo oxidation reactions by these potent reductants to test the importance of photon shielding we supplemented samples with n acetyl tyrosine which absorbs uv light at 254 nm but is not a potent reductant fig 4 shows uv inactivation of ms2 in phosphate buffer at ph 9 2 in the presence and absence of 0 5 mm sulfides predominantly hs at ph 9 2 2 9 mm n acetyl tyrosine and 1 mm thiosulfate with 2 0 mm n acetyl tyrosine these solutions of n acetyl tyrosine sulfides and thiosulfate mixed with n acetyl tyrosine exhibited a common uv absorbance uv254 0 8 cm 1 the ms2 inactivation rates in the presence of sulfides 0 017 cm2 mj 1 n acetyl tyrosine 0 019 cm2 mj 1 and the n acetyl tyrosine and thiosulfate mixture 0 015 cm2 mj 1 were comparable and 4 fold lower than for the no addition control these results indicate that photon shielding is predominantly responsible for the reduction in uv inactivation rates by hs and thiosulfate overall the results suggest the need to achieve complete oxidation of sulfides to sulfate to minimize the uv fluence needed to achieve 5 log inactivation of ms2 effect of h2o2 pre treatment on ms2 inactivation as can be seen in fig 2 uv254 of the saf mbr effluent spiked with 500 μm sulfides is minimized when the sample ph is adjusted to 8 0 and 3 mm h2o2 is added to achieve a 6 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio at ph 8 0 the rate of ms2 inactivation by uv k 0 057 cm2 mj 1 fig 5 in saf mbr effluent uv254 0 044 cm 1 table s1 was within the range of ms2 inactivation in phosphate buffer k 0 064 cm2 mj 1 data not shown in the absence of sulfides or h2o2 for addition of 3 mm h2o2 to the saf mbr effluent without sulfides the rate of ms2 inactivation 0 062 cm2 mj 1 was similar to that in the absence of h2o2 these results indicate that neither direct reaction with h2o2 nor reactions with hydroxyl radical formed by uv photolysis of h2o2 are important for ms2 inactivation although previous research has indicated that hydroxyl radical production by uv photolysis of h2o2 can increase the rate of ms2 inactivation during uv treatment the importance of hydroxyl radical mediated inactivation depends on the matrix for example sun et al 2016 showed that the addition of 0 3 mm h2o2 increased ms2 inactivation by 15 fold in phosphate buffer but did not increase inactivation appreciably in wastewater likely due to hydroxyl radical scavenging by dissolved organic matter we added 3 mm h2o2 to saf mbr effluent spiked with 0 5 mm sulfides and irradiated the sample with uv light either immediately after h2o2 addition or after a 30 min reaction time to permit maximum oxidation of sulfides to products figs 1 and 2 when irradiated after a 30 min reaction time the ms2 inactivation rate k 0 065 cm2 mj 1 slightly exceeded the inactivation rate of the saf mbr effluent control containing neither sulfides nor h2o2 k 0 057 cm2 mj 1 when irradiated immediately after h2o2 addition to the sulfide containing effluent the ms2 inactivation rate was lower k 0 037 cm2 mj 1 yet h2o2 addition nearly doubled the rate of ms2 inactivation relative to the sulfides containing effluent without h2o2 addition k 0 018 cm2 mj 1 ms2 concentrations did not change over the 30 min reaction period prior to irradiation indicating that direct reaction with h2o2 did not contribute to ms2 inactivation rather the increase in inactivation ms2 rate can be attributed to h2o2 oxidizing sulfide to products with lower uv absorbance in fact the sulfide concentration after uv irradiation was lowest in the sample that was spiked with h2o2 and irradiated after a 30 min reaction time in the sulfide only control 420 µm sulfides were present after uv irradiation compared to 180 µm and 5 µm when the samples were treated with h2o2 and irradiated with uv light immediately or after 30 min respectively for saf mbr effluent containing 0 5 mm sulfides adjustment of the ph to 8 0 and pre treatment with 3 mm sulfides for 30 min would reduce the uv fluence needed to achieve 5 log inactivation of ms2 from 640 mj cm 2 to 180 mj cm 2 a reduction of 460 mj cm 2 when the saf mbr effluent containing 0 5 mm sulfides was treated with 2 mm sulfides i e a 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio for 30 min at ph 8 0 the uv254 was 0 25 cm 1 fig 2d such that 5 log inactivation would require an applied uv fluence of 225 mj cm 2 free chlorine doses to achieve total chlorine residuals for distribution lastly we evaluated the free chlorine doses needed to attain 5 mg cl2 l 70 μm total chlorine residuals after 24 h to provide residuals for distribution given the 62 6 mg n l 4 5 mm ammonia concentration the total chlorine residual consisted of chloramines the saf mbr sample spiked with 0 5 mm sulfides was treated at ph 8 0 with 2 mm h2o2 i e a 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio for 30 min and then with 225 mj cm 2 uv fluence the applied fluence needed to achieve 5 log ms2 inactivation the residual h2o2 concentration was 0 4 mm the total chlorine residuals measured 24 h after application of 25 and 50 mg cl2 l were 0 3 and 29 mg cl2 l respectively suggesting that an 30 mg cl2 l applied free chlorine dose 0 42 mm would leave an 5 mg cl2 l residual table s7 similarly the sulfide spiked sample was treated with 3 mm h2o2 i e a 6 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio for 30 min and then with the 180 mj cm 2 applied uv fluence needed to achieve 5 log ms2 inactivation the residual h2o2 was 1 2 mm and the free chlorine needed to achieve a 5 mg cl2 l total chlorine residual was 80 mg cl2 l 1 1 mm table s7 for both h2o2 sulfide molar ratios the applied chlorine dose needed to achieve the residual was lower than expected based upon the 1 1 stoichiometry eq 5 just to quench the residual h2o2 additional experiments conducted in deionized water demonstrated that a portion of the free chlorine reacts with ammonia to form chloramines prior to being quenched by reaction with h2o2 text s2 chloramines are degraded by reaction with h2o2 more slowly than is free chlorine zhang et al 2019 such that chloramine formation reduces consumption of the total chlorine residual via reactions with h2o2 5 hocl h 2 o 2 o 2 h c l h 2 o comparison of treatment costs the experimental results indicate that operating at a h2o2 sulfide molar ratio closer to 4 rather than 6 would reduce the cost of h2o2 supply and by reducing the h2o2 residual the cost of chlorine supply however these savings in reagent costs must be weighed against the increased energy cost associated with the higher uv fluence needed to achieve pathogen inactivation since the uv254 was higher at the 4 1 molar ratio 0 25 cm 1 than at the 6 1 molar ratio 0 20 cm 1 fig 2 we conducted an initial comparison of the energy and chemical costs associated with h2o2 uv chlorine treatment of saf mbr effluent for both 4 1 and 6 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratios against the conventional treatment of aerobically treated effluent by filtration here microfiltration and chlorine disinfection figure s6 table 1 summarizes the results while text s3 details the cost estimates for the conventional treatment of aerobic effluents the estimate considered the energy costs associated with 1 activated sludge secondary treatment 0 039 m3 and 2 microfiltration 0 052 m3 and 3 the cost for addition of chlorine for disinfection 0 017 m3 for a total cost of 0 11 m3 for h2o2 uv chlorine treatment of saf mbr effluent the estimates considered 1 the energy cost associated with saf mbr treatment energy neutral or 0 00 m3 2 the cost of naoh for adjusting the effluent to ph 8 0 016 m3 3 the cost for h2o2 addition at 4 1 0 122 m3 and 6 1 0 168 m3 h2o2 sulfide molar ratios 4 the energy cost for an incident uv fluence of 225 mj cm 2 0 0098 m3 for the 0 25 cm 1 uv254 associated with a 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio and 180 mj cm 2 0 0078 m3 for the 0 20 cm 1 uv254 associated with a 6 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio and 5 the cost to provide 30 mg l as cl2 chlorine for the 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar 0 052 m3 and 80 mg l as cl2 chlorine for the 6 1 h2o2 sulfide molar 0 138 m3 as an emerging technology saf mbr treatment has not been fully optimized with respect to energy consumption the assumption that saf mbr treatment would be energy neutral incorporates the potential to harvest methane for energy production reflects expectations of improved energy efficiency going from laboratory to full scale and aligns with recent evaluations indicating that six of eleven pilot scale anaerobic membrane bioreactors treating domestic sewage were net energy positive shin and bae 2018 regardless the energy costs were modest relative to the chemical costs table 1 the overall energy and chemical cost to treat saf mbr effluent would be 0 19 m3 for the 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio and 0 33 m3 for the 6 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio the reduction in chemical costs for h2o2 and chlorine associated with the 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio outweighed the higher energy cost for uv treatment needed to overcome the higher uv254 for this molar ratio however for treatment of wastewater featuring 0 5 mm sulfate 48 mg l which could form 0 5 mm sulfides in the anaerobic reactor h2o2 uv chlorine treatment of saf mbr effluent at either h2o2 sulfide molar ratio would not be cost competitive with the conventional approach of treating wastewater by activated sludge followed by filtration and chlorine disinfection however the chemical and energy costs for h2o2 uv chlorine treatment of saf mbr effluent decrease with decreasing sulfide and thus sewage sulfate concentration further calculations text s3 indicate that the sulfide concentration at which h2o2 uv chlorine treatment of saf mbr effluent becomes cost competitive with the conventional aerobic treatment train for non potable reuse would be 285 μm 27 mg l sewage sulfate for the 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio and 150 μm 14 mg l sewage sulfate for the 6 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio conclusion we evaluated treatment of secondary anaerobic biological treatment effluent using h2o2 to oxidize sulfides uv disinfection and chlorine addition to provide a residual for distribution treatment of anaerobic effluent containing 0 5 mm sulfides at a 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio for 30 min at ph 8 achieved significant sulfide oxidation to sulfate bisulfide hs shields uv light at 254 nm but a 225 mj cm 2 applied uv fluence could achieve 5 log ms2 inactivation after sulfide oxidation at a 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio addition of 30 mg cl2 l chlorine could provide a 5 mg cl2 l total

inactivation of ms2 bacteriophage and chlorine to provide a residual for distribution h2o2 treatment at ph 8 favored sulfide oxidation to sulfate in 30 min at a 4 1 h2o2 sulfide stoichiometry compared to a 6 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio treatment of anaerobic effluent with 0 5 mm sulfides with a 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio would increase the applied uv fluence needed for 5 log ms2 inactivation from 180 mj cm 2 to 225 mj cm 2 however the lower h2o2 dose reduced the dose of chlorine needed to quench residual h2o2 and provide a residual for distribution treatment at the 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio was favored because the cost savings in h2o2 and chlorine reagents outweighed the energy savings associated with uv treatment however h2o2 uv chlorine treatment of anaerobic effluent was cost

alternatively phosphate buffer was prepared in deionized water and deoxygenated by boiling and sparging with nitrogen gas kinetics experiments samples 250 ml of saf mbr effluent were spiked with sulfides hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide was used to adjust sample ph ph was measured using a ph probe fisher accumet once the target ph was reached the 250 ml samples were aliquoted into 25 ml vials and capped headspace free control experiments indicated that sulfide concentrations in each vial were within 5 of each other and sulfide concentrations did not decrease over the 2 h time frame

to control turbidity the incident uv fluence mj cm 2 associated with specific illumination times was measured using iodide iodate actinometry rahn et al 2003 one objective of the study was to evaluate the extent to which sulfides and their oxidation products absorb uv light thereby requiring higher incident uv fluence and thus higher costs to achieve the same level of disinfection therefore we

methanogenesis lens et al 1998 we expect nearly quantitative conversion of sulfate to sulfides in saf mbr effluent thus sulfide concentrations ultimately depend on sulfate concentrations in the sewage

concentrations in the saf mbr pilot effluent typically are 2 mg s l szczuka et al 2019 but total sulfides sulfate sulfite and thiosulfate were below detection limits for the effluent employed for this

2011 while removal of sulfate prior to anaerobic treatment would avoid sulfide formation and enhance methane production techniques such as ion exchange are challenging within a primary effluent matrix timescale and products of sulfide oxidation by h2o2 previous research conducted in deionized water demonstrated that the stoichiometry products and kinetics of sulfide oxidation by h2o2 are ph dependent eqs 3 and 4 hoffmann 1977 millero et al 1989 at ph below the 7 1 pka of h2s h2o2 oxidation of h2s favors elemental sulfur formation over timescales of hours k 0 48 m 1 min 1 hoffmann 1977 consuming one molar equivalent of h2o2 at ph 7 1 h2o2 oxidation of hs favors sulfate formation over timescales of minutes k 29 m 1 min 1 hoffmann 1977 consuming four molar equivalents of h2o2 however this previous research employed h2o2 at high molar excess 10 20 fold and focused on low ph conditions 7 with limited experiments at ph 8 we evaluated h2o2 oxidation of 500 μm sulfides spiked into saf mbr effluent to mimic sulfide concentrations expected in saf mbr effluents at typical water reuse facilities i e sewage sulfate concentrations 50 mg l the first objective of these experiments was to evaluate the kinetics of sulfide oxidation focusing on higher ph conditions within the range 5 6 9 2 feasible for ph adjustment during wastewater treatment and on h2o2 sulfide molar ratios 1 10 closer to the expected stoichiometric requirements in order to limit reagent supply costs conducting these experiments within saf mbr effluent was important to incorporate the h2o2 demand of the saf mbr effluent matrix the second objective was to evaluate product formation with a particular focus on the extent to which h2o2 oxidation mitigates the negative impacts on uv disinfection associated with the absorption of germicidal uv light at 254 nm uv254 by sulfides fig 1 provides the loss of sulfides and h2o2 formation of sulfate and change in uv254 for application of 2 mm h2o2 i e the 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio that is stoichiometric for oxidation to sulfate at ph 5 6 3 hs ph 7 2 50 hs ph 8 0 89 hs and ph 9 2 99 hs figure s1 provides the concentrations of sulfite and thiosulfate sulfide oxidation by h2o2 was slowest at ph 5 6 fig 1a accompanied by consumption of only 360 µm h2o2 after 30 min fig 1b at ph 5 6 the dominance of h2s 97 would favor slow kinetics and the consumption of 360 μm h2o2 is close to the 500 μm expected for consumption of 1 molar equivalent of h2o2 to form elemental sulfur no sulfate thiosulfate or sulfite were observed figs 1c and s1 attempts to measure elemental sulfur by hplc with uv detection were not successful due to the low concentration 500 μm involved however when the experiment was conducted in deionized water buffered at ph 5 6 with 2 mm phosphate buffer the solution turned faintly cloudy indicative of the formation of colloidal elemental sulfur figure s2 provides uv spectra for sulfides spiked into saf mbr effluent at each of the four ph values demonstrating that sulfides absorb uv light at 254 nm for reaction at ph 5 6 the uv254 increased significantly leveling out after 30 min in either saf mbr effluent fig 1d or deionized water figure s3 we measured molar absorption coefficients at 254 nm of 85 m 1 cm 1 for h2s and of 830 m 1 cm 1 for elemental sulfur on a molar s basis text s1 indicating that the conversion of h2s to elemental sulfur would increase uv254 as observed the molar absorption coefficient of elemental sulfur was determined in 90 methanol and 10 deionized water due to the low solubility of elemental sulfur thus a portion of elemental sulfur would form a separate colloidal phase in aqueous media as observed in the deionized water experiment if sulfide oxidation were followed by membrane based treatment processes e g microfiltration or reverse osmosis within a potable reuse train colloidal sulfur would contribute to membrane clogging regardless the slow h2s oxidation kinetics and increase in uv254 at ph 5 6 are problematic for non potable reuse treatment sulfide oxidation by h2o2 was significantly faster at ph 7 2 fig 1a accompanied by h2o2 consumption after 30 min of 1330 µm 1550 µm and 1720 µm at ph 7 2 8 0 and 9 6 respectively fig 1b these findings align with expectations of a shift in reaction mechanism with the change in sulfide speciation the predominance of hs above ph 7 1 favors faster kinetics and the consumption of 1330 1720 μm h2o2 approaches the 2000 μm expected for consumption of 4 molar equivalents of h2o2 to form sulfate for the 2 mm h2o2 dose in these experiments the characteristic time for hs oxidation would be 17 min based on the 29 m 1 min 1 rate constant provided by hoffmann 1977 comparable to the timescale for sulfide degradation observed for ph 7 2 where hs predominates thus interference with h2o2 oxidation of sulfides by the saf mbr matrix was not important the lower h2o2 consumption at ph 7 than at ph 8 0 and 9 2 reflects the co occurrence of h2s and hs at this ph support for the change in reaction mechanism with sulfide speciation is provided by the measured concentrations of sulfate thiosulfate and sulfite figs 1c and s1 sulfate formation was significant for ph 7 2 reaching 200 µm at ph 7 2 220 µm at ph 8 0 and 290 µm at ph 9 2 after 30 min fig 1c however complete oxidation to sulfate s 6 did not occur concentrations of thiosulfate s2o3 2 s 2 reached 50 μm at ph 7 2 and 80 μm at ph 9 2 after 30 min figure s1a sulfite so3 2 s 4 was also observed at ph 7 2 but at lower concentrations maximum 10 μm and declined to negligible levels after 30 min figure s1b the detection of thiosulfate and sulfite demonstrate incomplete oxidation of sulfides and concur with previous reports of thiosulfate formation during h2o2 oxidation of sulfides in deoxygenated deionized water at ph 9 0 takenaka et al 2003 figure s2 provides uv spectra 200 400 nm for 500 μm of sulfides sulfate thiosulfate or sulfite spiked into saf mbr effluent at each of the four ph values sulfides feature absorbance peaks with maxima near 230 nm but extending to 254 nm figure s2a we calculated molar absorption coefficients at 230 nm and 254 nm for hs text s1 the 7570 m 1 cm 1 value for the hs molar absorption coefficient at 230 nm agrees with the 8000 m 1 cm 1 value determined previously by zuman and szafranski 1976 since the uv absorbance at 254 nm by hs ε254 950 m 1 cm 1 is stronger than by h2s ε254 85 m 1 cm 1 text s1 the uv254 increases strongly as ph increases from 5 6 to 7 2 and then moderately for further ph increases reaching 2 5 cm 1 at ph 9 2 figure s2a while sulfate does not absorb uv light figure s2b thiosulfate and sulfite both absorb uv at 200 250 nm without ph dependence although to a lesser degree than hs figures s2c and s2d the molar absorption coefficients at 254 nm we calculated for thiosulfate and sulfite were 200 m 1 cm 1 and 20 m 1 cm 1 respectively table s2 the saf mbr effluent exhibited 0 044 cm 1 uvt 90 4 uv254 background absorbance i e without sulfides table s1 for the treatment of 500 μm sulfides in saf mbr effluent with 2000 μm h2o2 the initial uv254 was highest 0 8 cm 1 uvt 16 at ph 9 2 fig 1d reflecting the predominance of hs at ph 8 0 and 9 2 the uv254 declined to 0 25 cm 1 uvt 56 after 30 min this decline reflects the conversion of hs to sulfate and thiosulfate the latter contributing to the residual absorbance above the saf mbr background at ph 7 2 where h2s and hs co occur the uv254 decreased from 0 65 cm 1 to 0 5 cm 1 reflecting the oxidation of h2s to elemental sulfur and hs to sulfate and thiosulfate overall the results indicate that ph adjustment to 8 0 would facilitate sulfide oxidation within 30 min while minimizing uv254 for subsequent uv disinfection effect of h2o2 dose for 500 μm sulfides spiked into saf mbr effluent we tested the effect of h2o2 sulfide molar ratio 1 10 on the concentrations of reactants products and uv254 after 30 min fig 2 the time at which reactant degradation and product formation leveled out for ph 7 2 fig 1 at ph 5 6 125 μm sulfides were consumed at a 1 1 molar ratio leaving a low h2o2 residual fig 2 at a 4 1 molar ratio sulfide consumption increased to 200 μm while consuming 360 μm h2o2 however at higher molar ratios each additional molar equivalent of h2o2 removed 12 μm sulfides while leaving an additional 480 μm h2o2 no sulfate thiosulfate or sulfite was observed figs 2 and s3 these results reflect the slow oxidation of h2s to elemental sulfur by h2o2 oxidation with no further significant oxidation of the elemental sulfur accordingly additional h2o2 accumulates with some modest consumption by reaction with the saf mbr effluent matrix constituents the increase in the uv254 from 0 15 cm 1 at a 1 1 molar ratio to 0 45 cm 1 at a 4 1 molar ratio is associated with absorbance by elemental sulfur with only modest further increases in uv254 at higher molar ratios fig 2d at ph 7 2 8 0 and 9 2 sulfides were reduced to 150 μm at a 1 1 molar ratio leaving negligible h2o2 residuals at a 4 1 molar ratio sulfides declined to 30 μm with residual h2o2 concentrations ranging from 200 μm at ph 9 2 to 800 μm at ph 7 2 fig 2b further increases in the molar ratio produced only modest further reductions in residual sulfide concentrations down to 11 μm at a 10 1 molar ratio but at a cost of 460 μm increase in residual h2o2 for each additional 500 μm h2o2 i e each unit increase in the molar ratio the 40 µm consumption of the additional h2o2 indicates reactions of h2o2 with other constituents of saf mbr effluent h2o2 has been shown to readily react with organic matter in aerobically treated wastewater ksibi 2006 both sulfate fig 2c and thiosulfate figure s4 were observed complete oxidation of hs should form 500 µm sulfate the detection of thiosulfate and the formation of sulfate at concentrations 500 μm even at a 10 1 molar ratio and ph 9 2 indicates that complete oxidation did not occur sulfate concentrations increased between molar ratios of 1 and 4 leveling out at higher molar ratios with the highest concentrations 300 μm observed for ph 8 0 and 9 2 but 200 μm at ph 7 2 thiosulfate concentrations declined with increasing molar ratio from 120 150 μm at a 1 1 molar ratio to 40 μm at a 10 1 molar ratio thiosulfate is expected to form under alkaline conditions but to decline when h2o2 is in stoichiometric excess takenaka et al 2003 at the lowest molar ratios the highest thiosulfate concentrations were observed at ph 7 2 concurring with expectations that the lower molar ratios and the slower kinetics associated with the mixture of h2s and hs at this ph would favor the formation of this intermediate given that elemental sulfur thiosulfate and sulfides absorb uv light at 254 nm figure s2 uv254 was minimized 0 2 cm 1 uvt 63 at h2o2 sulfide molar ratios 6 at ph 8 0 fig 2d the higher uv254 observed at ph 7 2 0 45 cm 1 uvt 36 similar to ph 5 6 despite concentrations of sulfides and thiosulfate comparable to those at ph 8 0 and 9 2 is attributable to elemental sulfur thus a 6 1 molar ratio at ph 8 0 would minimize the reagent costs for ph adjustment and potentially minimize the uv fluence required for pathogen inactivation by minimizing uv254 however the uv254 at ph 8 0 and a 4 1 molar ratio was only 25 higher 0 25 cm 1 uvt 56 than at the 6 1 molar ratio thus at ph 8 0 the lower cost of the h2o2 reagent at the 4 1 molar ratio must be weighed against the lower cost associated with uv fluence to achieve pathogen inactivation at the 6 1 molar ratio effect of sulfides on log inactivation of ms2 fig 3 a shows that uv inactivation of bacteriophage ms2 in phosphate buffer in the presence of 500 μm sulfides is ph dependent in the absence of sulfides a uv fluence of 175 mj cm 2 achieved a 4 5 log removal value lrv of bacteriophage ms2 regardless of ph data for ph 7 2 shown in the presence of sulfides at ph 5 6 ms2 inactivation was similar to the no sulfide control however 175 mj cm 2 uv fluence achieved only 1 5 and 1 3 ms2 lrvs at ph 7 2 and 9 2 respectively approximating ms2 inactivation by first order kinetics uv fluence based first order inactivation rate constants would be 0 055 0 022 and 0 017 cm2 mj 1 at ph 5 6 7 2 and 9 2 respectively the 0 06 cm2 mj 1 values measured in the absence of sulfides concurs with previous determinations for treatment of groundwater among other water types templeton et al 2006 hinjen et al 2006 extrapolating from this data uv doses of 530 and 670 mj cm 2 would be required to achieve a 5 log inactivation for bacteriophage ms2 at ph 7 2 and 9 2 respectively for comparison the national water research institute nwri recommends that uv systems deliver a 90 mj cm 2 uv fluence for non potable reuse of membrane filtered municipal effluents treated by conventional aerobic secondary biological treatment processes nwri 2012 fig 3b shows the effect of sulfides and sulfide oxidation products on uv inactivation of bacteriophage ms2 in phosphate buffer at ph 9 2 ms2 inactivation rates were within 18 for 1 mm sulfite 0 061 cm2 mj 1 1 mm sulfate 0 067 cm2 mj 1 and the no addition control 0 057 cm2 mj 1 however the inactivation rate decreased to 0 035 cm2 mj 1 for 1 mm thiosulfate such that a 330 mj cm 2 uv fluence would be required to achieve 5 log inactivation of ms2 uv inactivation of ms2 occurs predominantly by photo oxidation of the genome which absorbs uv light at 254 nm ye et al 2018 the inhibition of bacteriophage ms2 inactivation by uv in the presence of hs i e sulfides at ph 7 2 and thiosulfate may relate to shielding of ms2 by absorption of 254 nm light by hs and s2o3 2 or to reversal of the photo oxidation reactions by these potent reductants to test the importance of photon shielding we supplemented samples with n acetyl tyrosine which absorbs uv light at 254 nm but is not a potent reductant fig 4 shows uv inactivation of ms2 in phosphate buffer at ph 9 2 in the presence and absence of 0 5 mm sulfides predominantly hs at ph 9 2 2 9 mm n acetyl tyrosine and 1 mm thiosulfate with 2 0 mm n acetyl tyrosine these solutions of n acetyl tyrosine sulfides and thiosulfate mixed with n acetyl tyrosine exhibited a common uv absorbance uv254 0 8 cm 1 the ms2 inactivation rates in the presence of sulfides 0 017 cm2 mj 1 n acetyl tyrosine 0 019 cm2 mj 1 and the n acetyl tyrosine and thiosulfate mixture 0 015 cm2 mj 1 were comparable and 4 fold lower than for the no addition control these results indicate that photon shielding is predominantly responsible for the reduction in uv inactivation rates by hs and thiosulfate overall the results suggest the need to achieve complete oxidation of sulfides to sulfate to minimize the uv fluence needed to achieve 5 log inactivation of ms2 effect of h2o2 pre treatment on ms2 inactivation as can be seen in fig 2 uv254 of the saf mbr effluent spiked with 500 μm sulfides is minimized when the sample ph is adjusted to 8 0 and 3 mm h2o2 is added to achieve a 6 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio at ph 8 0 the rate of ms2 inactivation by uv k 0 057 cm2 mj 1 fig 5 in saf mbr effluent uv254 0 044 cm 1 table s1 was within the range of ms2 inactivation in phosphate buffer k 0 064 cm2 mj 1 data not shown in the absence of sulfides or h2o2 for addition of 3 mm h2o2 to the saf mbr effluent without sulfides the rate of ms2 inactivation 0 062 cm2 mj 1 was similar to that in the absence of h2o2 these results indicate that neither direct reaction with h2o2 nor reactions with hydroxyl radical formed by uv photolysis of h2o2 are important for ms2 inactivation although previous research has indicated that hydroxyl radical production by uv photolysis of h2o2 can increase the rate of ms2 inactivation during uv treatment the importance of hydroxyl radical mediated inactivation depends on the matrix for example sun et al 2016 showed that the addition of 0 3 mm h2o2 increased ms2 inactivation by 15 fold in phosphate buffer but did not increase inactivation appreciably in wastewater likely due to hydroxyl radical scavenging by dissolved organic matter we added 3 mm h2o2 to saf mbr effluent spiked with 0 5 mm sulfides and irradiated the sample with uv light either immediately after h2o2 addition or after a 30 min reaction time to permit maximum oxidation of sulfides to products figs 1 and 2 when irradiated after a 30 min reaction time the ms2 inactivation rate k 0 065 cm2 mj 1 slightly exceeded the inactivation rate of the saf mbr effluent control containing neither sulfides nor h2o2 k 0 057 cm2 mj 1 when irradiated immediately after h2o2 addition to the sulfide containing effluent the ms2 inactivation rate was lower k 0 037 cm2 mj 1 yet h2o2 addition nearly doubled the rate of ms2 inactivation relative to the sulfides containing effluent without h2o2 addition k 0 018 cm2 mj 1 ms2 concentrations did not change over the 30 min reaction period prior to irradiation indicating that direct reaction with h2o2 did not contribute to ms2 inactivation rather the increase in inactivation ms2 rate can be attributed to h2o2 oxidizing sulfide to products with lower uv absorbance in fact the sulfide concentration after uv irradiation was lowest in the sample that was spiked with h2o2 and irradiated after a 30 min reaction time in the sulfide only control 420 µm sulfides were present after uv irradiation compared to 180 µm and 5 µm when the samples were treated with h2o2 and irradiated with uv light immediately or after 30 min respectively for saf mbr effluent containing 0 5 mm sulfides adjustment of the ph to 8 0 and pre treatment with 3 mm sulfides for 30 min would reduce the uv fluence needed to achieve 5 log inactivation of ms2 from 640 mj cm 2 to 180 mj cm 2 a reduction of 460 mj cm 2 when the saf mbr effluent containing 0 5 mm sulfides was treated with 2 mm sulfides i e a 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio for 30 min at ph 8 0 the uv254 was 0 25 cm 1 fig 2d such that 5 log inactivation would require an applied uv fluence of 225 mj cm 2 free chlorine doses to achieve total chlorine residuals for distribution lastly we evaluated the free chlorine doses needed to attain 5 mg cl2 l 70 μm total chlorine residuals after 24 h to provide residuals for distribution given the 62 6 mg n l 4 5 mm ammonia concentration the total chlorine residual consisted of chloramines the saf mbr sample spiked with 0 5 mm sulfides was treated at ph 8 0 with 2 mm h2o2 i e a 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio for 30 min and then with 225 mj cm 2 uv fluence the applied fluence needed to achieve 5 log ms2 inactivation the residual h2o2 concentration was 0 4 mm the total chlorine residuals measured 24 h after application of 25 and 50 mg cl2 l were 0 3 and 29 mg cl2 l respectively suggesting that an 30 mg cl2 l applied free chlorine dose 0 42 mm would leave an 5 mg cl2 l residual table s7 similarly the sulfide spiked sample was treated with 3 mm h2o2 i e a 6 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio for 30 min and then with the 180 mj cm 2 applied uv fluence needed to achieve 5 log ms2 inactivation the residual h2o2 was 1 2 mm and the free chlorine needed to achieve a 5 mg cl2 l total chlorine residual was 80 mg cl2 l 1 1 mm table s7 for both h2o2 sulfide molar ratios the applied chlorine dose needed to achieve the residual was lower than expected based upon the 1 1 stoichiometry eq 5 just to quench the residual h2o2 additional experiments conducted in deionized water demonstrated that a portion of the free chlorine reacts with ammonia to form chloramines prior to being quenched by reaction with h2o2 text s2 chloramines are degraded by reaction with h2o2 more slowly than is free chlorine zhang et al 2019 such that chloramine formation reduces consumption of the total chlorine residual via reactions with h2o2 5 hocl h 2 o 2 o 2 h c l h 2 o comparison of treatment costs the experimental results indicate that operating at a h2o2 sulfide molar ratio closer to 4 rather than 6 would reduce the cost of h2o2 supply and by reducing the h2o2 residual the cost of chlorine supply however these savings in reagent costs must be weighed against the increased energy cost associated with the higher uv fluence needed to achieve pathogen inactivation since the uv254 was higher at the 4 1 molar ratio 0 25 cm 1 than at the 6 1 molar ratio 0 20 cm 1 fig 2 we conducted an initial comparison of the energy and chemical costs associated with h2o2 uv chlorine treatment of saf mbr effluent for both 4 1 and 6 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratios against the conventional treatment of aerobically treated effluent by filtration here microfiltration and chlorine disinfection figure s6 table 1 summarizes the results while text s3 details the cost estimates for the conventional treatment of aerobic effluents the estimate considered the energy costs associated with 1 activated sludge secondary treatment 0 039 m3 and 2 microfiltration 0 052 m3 and 3 the cost for addition of chlorine for disinfection 0 017 m3 for a total cost of 0 11 m3 for h2o2 uv chlorine treatment of saf mbr effluent the estimates considered 1 the energy cost associated with saf mbr treatment energy neutral or 0 00 m3 2 the cost of naoh for adjusting the effluent to ph 8 0 016 m3 3 the cost for h2o2 addition at 4 1 0 122 m3 and 6 1 0 168 m3 h2o2 sulfide molar ratios 4 the energy cost for an incident uv fluence of 225 mj cm 2 0 0098 m3 for the 0 25 cm 1 uv254 associated with a 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio and 180 mj cm 2 0 0078 m3 for the 0 20 cm 1 uv254 associated with a 6 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio and 5 the cost to provide 30 mg l as cl2 chlorine for the 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar 0 052 m3 and 80 mg l as cl2 chlorine for the 6 1 h2o2 sulfide molar 0 138 m3 as an emerging technology saf mbr treatment has not been fully optimized with respect to energy consumption the assumption that saf mbr treatment would be energy neutral incorporates the potential to harvest methane for energy production reflects expectations of improved energy efficiency going from laboratory to full scale and aligns with recent evaluations indicating that six of eleven pilot scale anaerobic membrane bioreactors treating domestic sewage were net energy positive shin and bae 2018 regardless the energy costs were modest relative to the chemical costs table 1 the overall energy and chemical cost to treat saf mbr effluent would be 0 19 m3 for the 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio and 0 33 m3 for the 6 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio the reduction in chemical costs for h2o2 and chlorine associated with the 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio outweighed the higher energy cost for uv treatment needed to overcome the higher uv254 for this molar ratio however for treatment of wastewater featuring 0 5 mm sulfate 48 mg l which could form 0 5 mm sulfides in the anaerobic reactor h2o2 uv chlorine treatment of saf mbr effluent at either h2o2 sulfide molar ratio would not be cost competitive with the conventional approach of treating wastewater by activated sludge followed by filtration and chlorine disinfection however the chemical and energy costs for h2o2 uv chlorine treatment of saf mbr effluent decrease with decreasing sulfide and thus sewage sulfate concentration further calculations text s3 indicate that the sulfide concentration at which h2o2 uv chlorine treatment of saf mbr effluent becomes cost competitive with the conventional aerobic treatment train for non potable reuse would be 285 μm 27 mg l sewage sulfate for the 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio and 150 μm 14 mg l sewage sulfate for the 6 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio conclusion we evaluated treatment of secondary anaerobic biological treatment effluent using h2o2 to oxidize sulfides uv disinfection and chlorine addition to provide a residual for distribution treatment of anaerobic effluent containing 0 5 mm sulfides at a 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio for 30 min at ph 8 achieved significant sulfide oxidation to sulfate bisulfide hs shields uv light at 254 nm but a 225 mj cm 2 applied uv fluence could achieve 5 log ms2 inactivation after sulfide oxidation at a 4 1 h2o2 sulfide molar ratio addition of 30 mg cl2 l chlorine could provide a 5 mg cl2 l total chlorine residual for distribution for non potable reuse h2o2 uv chlorine treatment of anaerobic effluent for non potable reuse would be cost competitive with conventional treatment of aerobic

19966,nitrous oxide n2o is a strong greenhouse gas and causal for stratospheric ozone depletion during biological nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment plants wwtp high n2o fluxes to the atmosphere can occur typically exhibiting a seasonal emission pattern attempts to explain the peak emission phases in winter and spring using physico chemical process data from wwtp were so far unsuccessful and new approaches are required the complex and diverse microbial community of activated sludge used in biological treatment systems also exhibit substantial seasonal patterns however a potentially causal link between the seasonal patterns of microbial diversity and n2o emissions has not yet been investigated here we show that in a full scale wwtp nitrification failure and n2o peak emissions bad settleability of the activated sludge and a turbid effluent strongly correlate with a significant reduction in the microbial community diversity and shifts in community composition during episodes of impaired performance we observed a significant reduction in abundance for filamentous and nitrite oxidizing bacteria in all affected reactors in some reactors that did not exhibit nitrification and settling failures we observed a stable microbial community and no drastic loss of species standard engineering approaches to stabilize nitrification such as increasing the aerobic sludge age and oxygen availability failed to improve the plant performance on this particular wwtp and replacing the activated sludge was the only measure applied by the operators to recover treatment performance in affected reactors our results demonstrate that disturbances of the sludge microbiome affect key structural and functional microbial groups which lead to seasonal n2o emission patterns to reduce n2o emissions from wwtp it is therefore crucial to understand the drivers that lead to the microbial population dynamics in the activated sludge graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrification denitrification activated sludge microbiome physico chemical monitoring amplicon sequencing 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o is the third most important greenhouse gas ghg contributing roughly 8 to the globally emitted ghg potential of anthropogenic origin ipcc 2013 additionally it is considered the dominant ozone depleting substance in the stratosphere ravishankara et al 2009 biological nitrogen removal during wastewater treatment can cause high n2o fluxes to the atmosphere with a significant contribution to global n2o emissions vasilaki et al 2019 in wastewater treatment plants wwtp emissions ranging from very low amounts up to a few percent of the total nitrogen load were shown to exhibit a strong seasonal pattern gruber et al 2020 typically emissions exhibited a seasonal emission patter with high emissions between march and june and low emissions between july and november chen et al 2019 n2o in wastewater treatment systems can be produced by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria dnb schreiber et al 2012 aob can produce n2o through hydroxylamine oxidation and nitrifier denitrification caranto and lancaster 2017 wrage mönnig et al 2018 dnb produce n2o as an intermediate during denitrification von schulthess and gujer 1996 chemical oxidation of hydroxylamine to n2o is the only known abiotic source and mostly occurs in systems with high ammonia nh4 concentrations 100 mg nh4 n l 1 and high or low ph 8 5 such as in side stream treatment for reject water from sludge treatment soler jofra et al 2020 in general the abiotic reactions are of minor importance in biological nitrogen removal systems su et al 2019 in activated sludge systems high biological production and emissions of n2o have been linked to several patterns such as i ammonia or toxicity shocks and quickly changing process conditions ii low dissolved oxygen concentrations and increased concentrations of nitrite no2 iii transient zones with alternating aerobic anoxic conditions and iv limitation of organic substrate vasilaki et al 2019 however these factors are not exclusive and could only partly explain emission patterns assessed in long term monitoring campaigns vasilaki et al 2019 statistical regression algorithms and mechanistic process modeling based on the activated sludge modeling framework have been applied with limited success to model n2o emissions from wwtp ni and yuan 2015 song et al 2020 vasilaki et al 2018 thus to better understand the n2o emissions from wwtp and identify relevant mechanisms new aspects may have to be taken into account among other factors microbial community dynamics has been proposed in previous studies as a potential driver of long term n2o dynamics daelman et al 2015 the activated sludge in a wwtp is a unique engineered ecosystem consisting of a complex microbial community that orchestrates the biological removal of pollutants in the wastewater wu et al 2019 however as with all complex ecosystems minor environmental changes may trigger internal dynamics in activated sludge that result in substantial impacts on the microbial community and its performance bürgmann et al 2011 griffin and wells 2017 johnston and behrens 2020 johnston et al 2019 shade et al 2012 previous studies have reported a reproducible seasonally driven pattern for the bacterial alpha diversity at multiple wwtp griffin and wells 2017 johnston et al 2019 microbial diversity in temperate climates dropped dramatically at the beginning of the winter season november and december started to increase at the end of spring april may and peaked at the end of autumn october furthermore these seasonal patterns appear to have a significant impact on the performance of valuable members involved in the nitrification but also other pollutant removal processes de celis et al 2020 ju et al 2014 biological nitrogen removal through nitrification and denitrification in wwtp includes multiple species and can exhibit seasonal variation ju et al 2014 while denitrification can be performed by a large number of organisms and there is therefore a high degree of functional redundancy in most cases lu et al 2014 nitrification activity is linked to only a few specialized organisms siripong and rittmann 2007 in conventional wastewater treatment with activated sludge nitrification is typically a two step process with aob oxidizing ammonium to no2 and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob oxidizing nitrite to nitrate in biofilm systems and activated sludge with high solid retention times srt complete nitrification performed by a single organism comammox can be important cotto et al 2020 but is expected to be a minor contributor to n2o emissions han et al 2021 several factors such as insufficient solids retention times srt low oxygen concentrations low temperatures elevated ph values and increased free ammonia concentrations have been linked to the loss of certain nob species in activated sludge and no2 accumulation huang et al 2010 ren et al 2019 vuono et al 2015 similarly yearlong community assembly studies in wwtp have reported lower abundances for nitrifiers during winter especially for nob from the phylum nitrospira griffin and wells 2017 however functional redundancy and niche differentiation for the no2 oxidation process in the activated sludge microbiome is theoretically possible given different nob species present such as nitrospira nitrobacter and ca nitrotoga huang et al 2010 lucker et al 2015 factors inducing a seasonal change in the nob community of a full scale wwtp and how such changes affect no2 accumulation as well as n2o production have not yet been studied here we test the hypothesis that seasonal no2 accumulation and n2o emission episodes can be linked directly or indirectly to shifts in the activated sludge microbiome of interest for full scale operation are changes in the nitrogen converting populations resulting in reduced nitrification performance and potentially causing increased n2o production to address our research questions we combined an extensive n2o measurement campaign over 1 5 years and 16s rrna sequencing for microbial community analysis during two seasonal n2o emission episodes using the floating flux chamber method as described in gruber et al 2020 n2o emissions were assessed on six parallel sbr reactors in a swiss wwtp using operational data and multivariate and ecological statistics activated sludge composition analysis allowed us to uncover microbial dynamics that followed the trajectory of nitrification failures and n2o emission episodes to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to discuss shifts in microbial community composition as a potential cause for seasonal n2o emission pattern and nitrite accumulation based on long term data of a full scale wwtp 2 material and methods 2 1 field site the study was performed at the municipal wwtp of uster switzerland 47 21 02

the length of each step vary substantially over a year the operation of the reaction and settling phases are adapted seasonally during the warmer months and if sufficient nitrification capacity is available a pre anoxic phase is implemented when nitrification performance is limiting the reaction phase is fully aerated the settling phase is adapted depending on the actual settling velocity

uster wwtp from february 2018 to july 2019 the emissions were assessed using an adapted version of the flux chamber for off gas monitoring on wwtp at least one flux chamber was installed on every reactor fig 1 a detailed description of the monitoring setup can be found in gruber et al 2020 the emissions at uster wwtp exhibited a strong seasonal pattern with two extended emission peaks february 2018 to may 2018 march 2019 to may 2019 and low emissions between the two peaks the study focuses on the processes around the two peaks subsequently called campaign 1 and campaign 2 as stated above the operation of uster wwtp is adapted depending on wastewater flow and plant performance changing significantly over a year during campaign 1 and campaign 2 extended periods of process failure on the majority of reactors were observed with high no2 effluent concentrations and bad settling qualities of the activated sludge an overview of the wwtp operational changes and mitigation strategies is provided in table 1 table 2 gives detailed information on sludge exchange for each event 2 3 activated sludge sampling and dna extraction the activated sludge sampling was performed on a weekly basis for selected reactors during the sampling campaigns to reduce the number of samples r4 was completely excluded from the sampling for the first campaign given the high similar behavior of all reactors during the second campaign samples were collected from all reactors overall we sequenced 53 sludge samples from campaign 1 and 47 samples from campaign 2 for each sample a 50 ml tube of mixed liquor was collected when the reactors were fully mixed during the aeration phase or the anoxic mixing phase and immediately transported to the lab in the lab 2 ml tubes were filled with the mixed liquor and centrifuged at 6000 rcf and 4 c for two minutes the supernatant was withdrawn and the procedure was repeated twice three aliquots of each sample were stored at 20 c for further processing nucleic acids from the 1st campaign were extracted with the mobio power soil kit qiagen germany following the standard operating procedure of the extraction kit nucleic acids from the 2nd campaign were extracted based on a method modified from griffiths et al 2000 activated sludge samples from every time point were transferred to 1 5 ml matrix e lysis tubes mpbio and 0 5 ml of both hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide buffer and phenol chloroform isoamylalcohol 25 24 1 ph 6 8 was added the activated sludge was lysed in a fastprep machine mpbio followed by nucleic acid precipitation with peg 6000 on ice nucleic acids were washed three times with ethanol 70 and dissolved in 50 µl depc treated rnase free water for all samples dna quality and quantity were assessed by using agarose gel electrophoresis and a nanodrop nd 2000c thermo fisher scientific usa 2 4 sequencing 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing from the 1st campaign was performed at the university of basel switzerland on an illumina miseq platform based on the pair end algorithm 300 bp v3 v4 and the primer pair 341f and 806r resulting in an average number of 92 200 34 700 sequences due to the covid 19 outbreak and entailed constraints we were not able to perform sequencing of the samples from the second campaign at the same sequencing service provider samples from the 2nd campaign were sequenced at dnasense aps aalborg denmark www dnasense com using the same algorithm and primers resulting in an average number of 30 800 5600 sequences although using the same pcr chemistry 2 300 bp v3 v4 region and illumina sequencer the outcome from the sequence providers differed significantly in the number and quality of sequences which made it particularly challenging to analyze both sequence sets together therefore and due to the different dna extraction protocols used the microbial data from both campaigns were analyzed as separate datasets although they were observed in the same wwtp 2 5 sequence analysis and microbial community analysis raw sequences from both sequence runs were analyzed within the qiime2 framework caporaso et al 2010 amplicon sequence variants asvs were produced with the dada2 callahan et al 2016 pipeline and taxonomically annotated based on the microbial database for activated sludge midas3 nierychlo et al 2020 all subsequent biostatistics analysis were performed individually on the sequence tables derived from this analysis pipeline a link to the sequence tables are provided at the end of the manuscript after normalization based on the variance stabilization algorithm within deseq2 love et al 2014 we performed a non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis based on the bray curtis dissimilarity using vegan and r software oksanen et al 2007 r core team 2020 a hierarchic clustering approach vegdist function vegan r was applied on the dissimilarities in community composition to statistically divide the samples from all reactors into different clusters within each campaign while community dissimilarities in campaign 1 were statistically most robust when explained by 5 clusters a b c d e campaign 2 could be divided into 4 clusters x yα yβ z we assigned if possible asvs to their putative functional role in the wastewater treatment plant based on the global database of microbes in wastewater treatment systems and anaerobic digesters midas nierychlo et al 2020 more information on sequence analysis and subsequent ecostatistics can be found in in section s2 si 3 results 3 1 n2o emission plant performance and incomplete nitrification during our n2o monitoring campaign at uster wwtp the biological treatment went through two extended periods of severe nitrification and settling failure leading to high no2 concentrations and turbidity in the effluent a detailed overview of the performance and operation of the biological treatment during both periods is shown in fig 2 starting in march 2018 and april 2019 increased n2o emissions very low nitratation performance no2 in effluent bad settleability of the activated sludge svi and a turbid effluent low transparency value were the most important process failure characteristics observed over a period of two to three months fig 2 after an extended transition phase of roughly one month the reactors reverted to a satisfying treatment performance as before the process failure period and emitted very low amounts of n2o during both campaigns interestingly the transition between phases was not synchronized between the different reactors this asynchrony of the recovery is highlighted by the high standard deviations for the n2o emissions estimated nob and aob activity in mid april 2018 to mid may 2018 and may 2019 fig 2a for individual reactor data see si figs s1 3 during both campaigns no2 concentrations in the mixed effluent of all reactors reached very high values of up to 9 3 mgno2 n l during campaign 1 and 4 9 mgno2 n l during campaign 2 as shown in fig 2b while no2 concentrations increased within a month from satisfying to peak concentrations the return to normal concentrations took two to three months although the rapid sand filtration for effluent polishing could reduce some of the produced no2 the effluent concentrations were still dramatically higher than the target value of 0 3 mgno2 n l of the swiss water protection law the no2 concentrations correlated negatively with the observed average nob activity r 0 61 p 0 001 n 81 while the nob activity dropped by up to 100 to levels around 20 mgn l d aob activity decreased only slightly campaign 2 or remained stable and increased later campaign 1 cluster e therefore nh4 effluent concentrations increased slightly but remained clearly below the discharge limits of 2 mgnh4 n l after the filter the transparency of the effluent dropped parallel to the decreasing nob activity fig 2b fig s4 figs s5 and s6 si the sludge settling characteristics changed dramatically leading to high svi values and low sludge settling velocities fig 2 figures s5 and s6 si both properties showed a medium negative correlation r 0 51 p 0 001 n 332 and were heavily affected during both process failure phases the wwtp emitted significant amounts of n2o during both campaigns during peak days up to 30 of the influent nitrogen load was emitted as n2o resulting in a massive impact on the greenhouse gas balance of the wwtp n2o emissions showed a close and highly significant positive correlation with no2 concentrations in the effluent of the biological treatment r 0 81 p 0 001 n 60 generally the emission pattern was highly variable under wet weather conditions e g at the beginning of april 2018 n2o emissions dropped to very low levels and then peaked only a few days later when the influent wastewater amount returned to dry weather conditions effluent no2 concentrations and transparency values from the biological treatment indicate that similar events of incomplete nitrification were observed in the spring seasons of preceding years fig s3 despite the evident periodicity of the nitrification failure episodes the two campaigns indicate a different progression of process performance in different years in campaign 1 no2 rose and peaked rapidly and the estimated nob activity dropped accordingly to levels close to zero at the beginning of march the effluent transparency mirrored the pattern of the no2 concentrations in campaign 2 the decline of nob activity and the increase of no2 effluent concentration happened more gradually with a peak in march while the effluent transparency value reached its minimum one month before the no2 concentrations interestingly the process failure phenomenology was overall less dramatic in campaign 2 compared to campaign 1 fig 2 fig 3 fig s9 while all reactors performed similarly and exhibited a partial failure of nitrification and settling during campaign 1 r1 and r3 did not exhibit episodes of dramatic process instabilities during campaign 2 this fortuitous development allowed a comparative analysis of the characteristics of failing and functioning tanks in campaign 2 elevated no2 concentrations 1 mg no2 n l during aeration can to some extent be observed in all reactors fig s7 si however r1 and r3 during campaign 2 had enough nitrite oxidation and denitrification capacity to avoid a drastic long term no2 accumulation fig s10 si additionally the n2o emissions of r1 and r3 were clearly lower compared to the other reactors fig 3c the estimated aob activity however was comparable in all reactors fig 3a after the transient loss of nitrification and settling performance overall process performance returned to the previous levels after sludge exchange in the low performing reactors settling and nitrite oxidation performance increased significantly 3 2 mitigation measures applied by the operators and correlation analysis in order to reduce the duration of the process failure phases in campaign 1 compared to previous years the operators changed operation parameters according to the following four operational strategies table 1 i increase of aerobic srt to retain more nitrifiers see fig s8 si ii increase the oxygen concentration during aeration to increase aerobic activity see fig 2c iii reduce or skip the anoxic reaction phase to allow lengthening the aeration phase fig 2c and iv replacement of the activated sludge with sludge from a well running system see fig 3 table 2 in the second campaign dissolved oxygen and aerobic srt were only slightly increased since the strategies were not successful during campaign 1 fig 2c aerobic reaction phases were extended by reducing or skipping the anoxic reaction phase in both campaigns fig 2c overall the strategies i ii and iii were found insufficient as they did not accelerate the recovery of nitrification performance fig 2c figure s11 do aerobic srt anoxic time the complete exchange of activated sludge strategy iv appeared to be the only successful strategy to recover treatment performance fig 3 in order to investigate potential causes for the seasonal process failure pearson correlation analysis was performed with standard operational parameters performance indicators and influent indices fig s11 si although correlation analysis has been applied in previous n2o monitoring studies with limited success wwtp operators often rely on strategies based on empirical correlations to address unexpected performance issues like incomplete nitrification no2 r 0 8 p 0 001 n 59 and cod r 0 71 p 0 001 n 59 effluent concentrations showed the highest correlations with n2o emissions n2o emissions showed a moderate negative correlation with temperature r 0 48 p 0 001 and nob activity r 0 5 p 0 001 as well as a weak negative correlation with anoxic cycle time r 0 32 p 0 001 while temperature only correlated on a daily average and is thus assumed to influence the emissions only indirectly the latter two appear to be highly relevant variables for no2 accumulation and n2o emissions no other significant correlations with operational parameters were found overall the correlation analysis does not yield any strategies to optimize plant performance since all process optimization strategies applied were shown to be ineffective and therefore exhibited correlations with n2o contrary to the intended effect 3 3 microbial community dynamics as a driver of n2o emissions and no2 accumulation as we were not able to explain the observed n2o dynamics and concomitant nitrification failures based on wwtp operational parameters we decided to investigate the role of microbial community dynamics as a potential driver we used 16s rrna gene sequencing analyses to obtain time series data of the microbial community composition with the goal of correlating the process performance with changes in the activated sludge microbiome to identify distinct phases in the microbial community composition over time we applied a hierarchical clustering approach to the asv abundance table amplicon sequence variants reflecting microbial species of all samples from the different reactors within the consecutive sampling campaigns dissimilarities of microbial community composition and resulting clusters are visualized in fig 4 the resulting distinct clusters based on the dissimilarities in microbial community composition followed the temporal progression and in campaign 2 additionally reflected the split between reactors with and without process failure we therefore used these clusters to divide the campaigns into a sequence of distinct phases for subsequent analyses of microbial data within the 1st campaign we observed a significant permanova p 0 05 change in the microbial community composition from cluster a to e which was comparable for all reactors in the second campaign a similar temporal dynamic could also be observed for the communities in reactors experiencing process failure r2 r4 r5 and r6 in clusters x yβ z however the microbial community structure in reactor r1 and r3 from campaign 2 remained nearly unchanged after the initial transition from cluster x to y α and did not change thereafter in line with the stable nitrification performance fig 3 interestingly while they displayed lower n2o emissions and no process failures during the second campaign these two reactors were characterized by impaired nitrification and particularly high n2o peaks during the first campaign notably these reactors were operated identically to the others over the period of both campaigns as long as nitrification worked sufficiently the failing reactors r2 r4 r5 and r6 however shared a common clustering pattern as already observed during the first year ending with a significantly distinct community structure in summer cluster z compared to the initial state in late fall cluster x or the stable reactors y α the alpha diversity index shannon average n2o concentrations and the svi all varied considerably between the temporal clusters fig 5 we found that species diversity significantly decreased in all reactors during process failure episodes i e from cluster a to c in campaign 1 and from x to yβ to z fig 5a while diversity was decreasing n2o emissions and svi tended to increase in both campaigns fig 5b c as with diversity we did not observe a substantial change for these parameters between cluster x and cluster y α in campaign 2 the diversity of the activated sludge increased again from cluster d to cluster e campaign 1 accompanied by decreasing n2o emissions and svi the observed increase in diversity at the end of campaign 1 could not be observed in campaign 2 since the recovery phase was not sampled the strong link between microbial diversity and performance indicators for settling and nitrification is confirmed by correlation analysis fig s12 si the shannon diversity and two other indices simpson diversity and species evenness were found to be significantly negatively correlated with n2o emissions svi values and no2 concentrations in effluent of the biological treatment during both campaigns a weak positive correlation was found with effluent transparency during campaign 1 fig s12 si in order to identify which functional groups of the microbial community displayed the significant changes in abundance we assigned all asvs based on their assigned genus and using the global database of microbes in wastewater treatment systems and anaerobic digesters nierychlo et al 2020 either to the morphological group of filamentous bacteria or to a putative functional role in wwtp given the crucial importance of filamentous bacteria in wwtp nierychlo et al 2019 speirs et al 2019 we decided to include this category into our assignment therefore in case filamentous asvs could be assigned in addition to other putative functions aerobic heterotrophs or fermenters we used the morphological feature rather than the putative function to quantify which asvs substantially contributed to observed fluctuations in relative abundance and diversity changes we performed a differential abundance analysis and expressed the magnitude of change between consecutive clusters as log2foldchange fig s13 si a positive log2foldchange indicates a decrease in abundance over time while a negative log2foldchange means increasing counts the assignment to high level functional roles allows for comparison between the two campaigns we found that the transitions from clusters a b c campaign 1 and x yβ z displayed the highest numbers in asvs that significantly p 0 05 wald test decreased in abundance fig s13 si number of bubbles the transitions from d e campaign 1 and x yα campaign 2 were characterized by an increase in abundance of asvs which decreased in the earlier clusters during the early transition from cluster a b and x yβ that corresponds to the initial development toward process failure in both campaigns we observed an increase in abundance of aerobic heterotrophs and fermenting bacteria while filamentous bacteria decreased in abundance fig 6 s13 the declining abundance of filamentous bacteria continued during the transition from cluster yβ to z during campaign 2 fermenting bacteria mostly affiliated to the genera arcobacter and bacteroides tended to increase from a b and x yβ in both campaigns interestingly they decreased during phases with elevated no2 concentrations and n2o emissions i e campaign 1 b c and c d campaign 2 yβ z respectively this dynamic was accompanied by an increase in aerobic heterotrophs and a decrease in denitrifying bacteria dnb we also found that nob were low in abundance during cluster c d campaign 1 and yβ z campaign 2 associated with a recovery of the process performance the transition from cluster d e in campaign 1 was characterized by a re increase in abundance of filamentous bacteria dnbs and nobs while aerobic heterotrophs substantially decreased in abundance fig 6 s13 we also observed a stabilization of the community for all reactors in cluster z of campaign 2 in stark contrast to these dynamic cluster transitions the shift from cluster x to yα stable reactors of campaign 2 entailed merely an increase in abundance for filamentous bacteria and aob focusing on the temporal development of the microbial communities in reactor 1 and 3 cluster yα fig 6 s13 we observed a surprisingly stable community with a significant increase linear regression analyses p 0 05 in abundance of filamentous bacteria in comparison to the starting condition cluster x in contrast to the decreasing trend for this group in the other reactors given the crucial importance of nitrifying bacteria in municipal wastewater treatment we dissected the microbial communities from both campaigns to elucidate the individual dynamics of aob and nob affiliated bacteria fig 7 during both campaigns nitrosomonas was the only detected bacterial genus affiliated with aerobic ammonium oxidation and its abundance did not change dramatically over the course of the sampling campaigns despite process disturbances however bacteria affiliated with no2 oxidation displayed surprising dynamics in abundance during both campaigns the abundance of the dominant nob nitrospira significantly decreased during the periods with a low nitratation performance campaign 1 cluster b c d campaign 2 yβ z during campaign 1 asvs assigned to a different bacterium affiliated with no2 oxidation candidatus nitrotoga started to emerge in cluster d and became the dominant nob fraction of the community in cluster e interestingly candidatus nitrotoga was not present in the prior clusters of campaign 1 nor could it be detected during campaign 2 the recovery phases of r2 r4 r5 and r6 were not sampled during campaign 2 and it is therefore not clear if the species may have emerged later however it is likely that nitrotoga did not appear in the second campaign since the operators started to replace the activated sludge of the unsatisfyingly performing reactor one week after the last sludge samples were taken fig 3 in order to identify potential process parameters or environmental factors which could have initiated these drastic changes in community structure we performed a correlation based analysis here we used all asvs that were present in at least 25 of the samples and sorted them into their putative functional groups we determined the correlation of these groups with the same averaged process parameters as used for the process correlation analysis described above for each sampling point of the treatment plant for each campaign fig s14 si however we were not able to find a large number of significant correlations after the p value adjustment which would allow us to make assumptions on what might have caused the initiation of the community change further diverging results between the two consecutive campaigns which can perhaps be attributed to differences in operation strategy of the reactors and different periods of the clusters fig s14 si ultimately do not allow to identify drivers 4 discussion the yearly n2o emissions at uster wwtp are an example for a broadly observed pattern of seasonally driven n2o emission from wwtp most previous n2o monitoring campaigns at wwtp observed an emission pattern peaking in spring and reaching its minimum in autumn such as the kralingseveer wwtp daelman et al 2015 avedøre wwtp chen et al 2019 lucerne wwtp and altenrhein wwtp gruber et al 2020 hence these monitoring campaigns might represent observations of the same phenomenon given the reported correlation of n2o emissions of no2 concentration in two studies daelman et al 2015 gruber et al 2020 we hypothesize that seasonally increased no2 concentrations in the biological reactors of these treatment plants are directly and functionally linked to the n2o emissions patterns during both campaigns at uster wwtp high n2o emissions were observed after substantially diminished nob activity resulting in no2 accumulation in the effluent which suggests a high contribution of denitrification nitrifier or heterotrophic to n2o production domingo felez et al 2016 wunderlin et al 2013 although the extent of nitrite accumulation in our monitoring campaign is extreme fig 2 seasonal nitrite accumulation has been previously reported for full scale wwtps and shown to be related to n2o emissions castro barros et al 2016 philips et al 2002 randall and buth 1984 at the vikinmäkki wwtp a very similar case with substantial nob failure could be observed in a continuously fed activated sludge process with denitrification and nitrification kuokkanen et al 2020 the uster wwtp is designed following the standard guidelines section s1 si the strategies applied by the operator in campaign 1 to counter incomplete nitrification were shown to be unsuccessful fig 2 i e increasing aerobic srt and oxygen setpoints they target typical key operation parameters aiming to support nitrifying bacteria stenstrom and poduska 1980 other reported causes for nob loss and nitrite accumulation such as high temperatures elevated ph values and increased free ammonia concentrations ren et al 2019 can be clearly excluded for the case reported fig 2 fig s11 hence the yearly recurring episodes fig s4 of substantial nitrite accumulation followed by n2o emissions cannot be solved and explained using standard engineering approaches in strong agreement with the microbial analysis we find that the nob loss correlates with important changes of the entire microbial community and thus the primary cause likely does not reside in the nitrifiers themselves the clustering of the changing microbial community structure correlated surprisingly well with the changing nitrification performance and sludge characteristics in both campaigns figs 2 5 our analysis of the microbial communities clearly revealed a progressive and quite well synchronized change of the community composition in all independent reactors fig 4 and that the respective species diversity negatively correlated with nitrite accumulation changing sludge settleability and n2o emissions fig 5 s5 with the exceptions of r1 and r3 during campaign 2 where the microbial community was very stable fig 4 the six reactors exhibited synchronized microbial communities and reproducible impaired treatment performances the high similarity of the activated sludge microbiome within different independent reactors of the same wwtp or even in the same region has been observed in previous studies griffin and wells 2017 the microbial community analysis of the two campaigns revealed significant differences between the pre and post process failure community compositions fig 4 despite the differences in community structure all reactors re emerged to satisfying performances in n removal fig 2 and displayed comparable diversity measures again at the end of campaign 1 and at the beginning of campaign 2 fig 5 we hypothesize that the destabilization of the activated sludge microbiome was initiated by the loss of certain key functional groups that maintain the sludge structure this in turn triggered a cascading decline of other valuable members including nob of the community van den abbeele et al 2011 our observations on decreasing diversity and evenness fig 5 s13 as well as the pronounced loss of specific microbial consortia during clusters a c and x yβ z support this notion specifically the observed decline in filamentous bacteria mainly chloroflexi after cluster a and x appears likely to have initiated the cascading effect on the community in both campaigns as it provides a credible explanation for the reported changes in sludge settling figs 3 and 5 the visible change in transparency and settling velocity further supports the notion of the lost sludge integrity figs 2 3 s12 filamentous members of the phylum chloroflexi are known to support the structural integrity of activated sludge their ability to degrade complex polymeric organic compounds to low molecular weight substrates is very beneficial for other members of the community kragelund et al 2007 nierychlo et al 2019 speirs et al 2019 burger et al 2017 found a direct correlation between the abundance of filamentous bacteria and the strength of the floc which further supports our findings however the mechanisms that lead to the decline of filamentous bacteria and nob while aob are significantly less affected remain unclear both loss of structural integrity e g pin point floc formation and washout and loss of mutualistic interactions e g substrate transfer could potentially play a role burger et al 2017 lau et al 1984 örmeci and vesilind 2000 sezgin et al 1978 disturbance or changing condition induced species loss can open up new niches within the sludge community that are prone to colonization by other bacterial consortia with ecological advantages under the given conditions vuono et al 2016 we observed this phenomenon during campaign 1 while the nob species nitrospira declined substantially in abundance another nob species nitrotoga emerged and took over as the dominant nob in these reactors fig 7 during the transition phase between these two nob species we observed the highest n2o emissions fig 2 to our surprise no sequences from the 2nd campaign could be annotated to the genus nitrotoga however nitrotoga was also not found during the first three clusters of campaign 1 we believe that as fast as the cold affine nitrotoga lucker et al 2015 wegen et al 2019 was emerging it was soon again replaced by nitrospira as the dominating nob species during the warm summer months preceding campaign 2 in stark contrast to the nob community the aob fraction nitrosomonas remained comparably stable in abundance over the course of both campaigns we speculate that the changing sludge morphology initiated by the loss of filamentous bacteria could also affect the observed abundance dynamics within the nitrifying community given the increased effluent turbidity after biological treatment due to diminished sludge integrity in the affected reactors fig 2 we speculate that the nob fraction could be preferentially washed out in pin point flocs the washout of nobs in turn leads to no2 accumulation as observed during campaigns after cluster a and x respectively as our results indicate the exchange of activated sludge can work as a mitigation strategy but it should be only applied in emergency cases for two reasons firstly the transfer of significant amounts of sludge leads to lower treatment performance in the source reactor secondly the replacement of sludge speeds up the system recovery but does not prevent system failure later during a season or in the following year the results from campaign 2 and the well performing reactors r1 and r3 show that probably only small changes are needed to stabilize the microbiome since the same operational strategies were applied in the disturbed and the satisfying reactors although the initial causes for impaired plant performance remain unknown strategies to reduce process failure should aim for a stabilization of activated sludge microbiome already well before the problem becomes acute as reported in previous studies several strategies could be applied such as i increase of oxygen concentration huang 2010 ii increase srt kim et al 2011 vuono et al 2015 or iii maintaining a stable process operation strategy dytczak et al 2008 since strategies i and ii have been unsuccessfully applied during campaign 1 when the microbiome was already substantially disturbed we hypothesize that the changes in operation should be implemented a few months before the expected phase of nitrification failure integrating a proactive management of the activated sludge microbiome in the operational strategy of a wwtp could be an asset for the mitigation of seasonally occurring nitrification failure and insufficient sludge settleability our study highlights the need for further detailed sampling campaigns and experimental work to uncover the chain of events that leads to community disturbance and ultimately to significant peaks in n2o emissions and no2 accumulation a better understanding of seasonal patterns of microbial population dynamics will be central to this objective to investigate microbial dynamics as a potential cause or mediator of such patterns further studies are required in three directions i e 1 16 s rrna amplicon sequencing with a higher resolution weekly sampling over a whole year 2 seasonal assessment of microbial activity with metagenomics or multi omics approaches and 3 systematic assessment of the microbial community during tests of mitigation strategies and comparison with a reference system in particular multi omics approaches could help to characterize the initial causes for strong dynamics in microbial communities for seasonal studies independent of the methods applied it seems crucial to include not only species involved in the nitrogen cycle but the whole activated sludge microbiome furthermore future studies should always be coupled with spatially and temporally highly resolved long term n2o and no2 monitoring and extended process monitoring as at uster wwtp ultimately suitable targets organisms genes or community traits that can be measured reliably and cost effectively would have to be characterized that are reliably linked to subsequent process failures merely collecting microbial data does not automatically advance the operation of a wwtp our study clearly shows that extended discussions and a close collaboration between operators engineers and microbiologists are required to take advantage of the full potential of microbial assays to analyze the data appropriately and to suggest mitigation strategies 5 conclusions no2 accumulation correlates strongly with and is very likely the cause for the observed seasonal n2o emission peaks on a full scale activated sludge sbr plant while the aob abundance and performance remained relatively stable throughout the campaigns the nob population disappeared and needed to re establish the phases of impaired nitrification and high n2o emissions correlated with the process of a drastic change in the microbial community affecting multiple process relevant species the communities of reactors with high emissions differed significantly before and after the peak emission phases on the contrary reactors with a stable microbial community over the whole period did not exhibit increased n2o emissions the no2 oxidation on the sbr plant repeatedly underperformed even though i the important operating parameters aeration and aerobic srt were set according to standard guidelines and ii common factors known to cause no2 oxidation failure were not present these results counter the notion that the accumulation of no2 and the seasonal n2o emission pattern are issues uniquely related to growth conditions of nitrifiers loss and re establishment of nob activity seems to coincide with loss and re establishment of filamentous bacteria and entailed bad sludge settling properties impaired settleability and a turbid effluent this has considerable practical implications since measures to maintain complete nitrification might need to target floc structure rather than aob and nob growth conditions only regular long term microbial and physico chemical monitoring of the activated sludge and a better understanding of its microbial community likely is important for understanding seasonal n2o emission patterns while current standard engineering approaches could not explain the process failure appropriate operational strategies to avoid

19966,nitrous oxide n2o is a strong greenhouse gas and causal for stratospheric ozone depletion during biological nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment plants wwtp high n2o fluxes to the atmosphere can occur typically exhibiting a seasonal emission pattern attempts to explain the peak emission phases in winter and spring using physico chemical process data from wwtp were so far unsuccessful and new approaches are required the complex and diverse microbial community of activated sludge used in biological treatment systems also exhibit substantial seasonal patterns however a potentially causal link between the seasonal patterns of microbial diversity and n2o emissions has not yet been investigated here we show that in a full scale wwtp nitrification failure and n2o peak emissions bad settleability of the activated sludge and a turbid effluent strongly correlate with a significant reduction in the microbial community diversity and shifts in community composition during episodes of impaired performance we observed a significant reduction in abundance for filamentous and nitrite oxidizing bacteria in all affected reactors in some reactors that did not exhibit nitrification and settling failures we observed a stable microbial community and no drastic loss of species standard engineering approaches to stabilize nitrification such as increasing the aerobic sludge age and oxygen availability failed to improve the plant performance on this particular wwtp and replacing the activated sludge was the only measure applied by the operators to recover treatment performance in affected reactors our results demonstrate that disturbances of the sludge microbiome affect key structural and functional microbial groups which lead to seasonal n2o emission patterns to reduce n2o

plants wwtp emissions ranging from very low amounts up to a few percent of the total nitrogen load were shown to exhibit a strong seasonal pattern gruber et al 2020 typically emissions exhibited a seasonal emission patter with high emissions between march and june and low emissions between july and november chen et al 2019 n2o in wastewater treatment systems can be produced by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria dnb schreiber et al 2012 aob can produce n2o through hydroxylamine oxidation and nitrifier denitrification caranto and lancaster 2017 wrage mönnig et al 2018 dnb produce n2o as an intermediate during denitrification von schulthess and gujer 1996 chemical oxidation of hydroxylamine to n2o is the only known abiotic source and mostly occurs in systems with high ammonia nh4 concentrations 100 mg nh4 n l 1 and high or low ph 8 5 such as in side stream treatment for reject water from sludge treatment soler jofra et al 2020 in general the abiotic reactions are of minor importance in biological nitrogen removal systems su et al 2019 in activated sludge systems high biological production and emissions of n2o have been linked to several patterns such as i ammonia or toxicity shocks and quickly changing process conditions ii low dissolved oxygen concentrations and increased concentrations of nitrite no2 iii transient zones with alternating aerobic anoxic conditions and iv limitation of organic substrate vasilaki et al 2019 however these factors are not exclusive and could only partly explain emission patterns assessed in long term monitoring campaigns vasilaki et al 2019 statistical regression algorithms and mechanistic process modeling based on the activated sludge modeling framework have been applied with limited success to model n2o emissions from wwtp ni and yuan 2015 song et al 2020 vasilaki et al 2018 thus to better understand the n2o emissions from wwtp and identify relevant mechanisms new aspects may have to be taken into account among other factors microbial community dynamics has been proposed in previous studies as a potential driver of long term n2o dynamics daelman et al 2015 the activated sludge in a wwtp is a unique engineered ecosystem consisting of a complex microbial community that orchestrates the biological removal of pollutants in the wastewater wu et al 2019 however as with all complex ecosystems minor environmental changes may trigger internal dynamics in activated sludge that result in substantial impacts on the microbial community and its performance bürgmann et al 2011 griffin and wells 2017 johnston and behrens 2020 johnston et al 2019 shade et al 2012 previous studies have reported a reproducible seasonally driven pattern for the bacterial alpha diversity at multiple wwtp griffin and wells 2017 johnston et al 2019 microbial diversity in temperate climates dropped dramatically at the beginning of the winter season november and december started to increase at the end of spring april may and peaked at the end of autumn october furthermore these seasonal patterns appear to have a significant impact on the performance of valuable members involved in the nitrification but also other pollutant removal processes de celis et al 2020 ju et al 2014 biological nitrogen removal through nitrification and denitrification in wwtp includes multiple species and can exhibit seasonal variation ju et al 2014 while denitrification can be performed by a large number of organisms and there is therefore a high degree of functional redundancy in most cases lu et al 2014 nitrification activity is linked to only a few specialized organisms siripong and rittmann 2007 in conventional wastewater treatment with activated sludge nitrification is typically a two step process with aob oxidizing ammonium to no2 and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob oxidizing nitrite to nitrate in biofilm systems and activated sludge with high solid retention times srt complete nitrification performed by a single organism comammox can be important cotto et al 2020 but is expected to be a minor contributor to n2o emissions han et al 2021 several factors such as insufficient solids retention times srt low oxygen concentrations low temperatures elevated ph values and increased free ammonia concentrations have been linked to the loss of certain nob species in activated sludge and no2 accumulation huang et al 2010 ren et al 2019 vuono et al 2015 similarly yearlong community assembly studies in wwtp have reported lower abundances for nitrifiers during winter especially for nob from the phylum nitrospira griffin and wells 2017 however functional redundancy and niche differentiation for the no2 oxidation process in the activated sludge microbiome is theoretically possible given different nob species present such as nitrospira nitrobacter and ca nitrotoga huang et al 2010 lucker et al 2015 factors inducing a seasonal change in the nob community of a full scale wwtp and how such changes affect no2 accumulation as well as n2o production have not yet been studied here we test the hypothesis that seasonal no2 accumulation and n2o emission episodes can be linked directly or indirectly to shifts in the activated sludge microbiome of interest for full scale operation are changes in the nitrogen converting populations resulting in reduced nitrification performance and potentially causing increased n2o production to address our research questions we combined an extensive n2o measurement campaign over 1 5 years and 16s rrna sequencing for microbial community analysis during two seasonal n2o emission episodes using the floating flux chamber method as described in gruber et al 2020 n2o emissions were assessed on six parallel sbr reactors in a swiss wwtp using operational data and multivariate and ecological statistics activated sludge composition analysis allowed us to uncover microbial dynamics that followed the trajectory of nitrification failures and n2o emission episodes to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to discuss shifts in microbial community composition as a potential cause for seasonal n2o emission pattern and nitrite accumulation based on long term data of a full scale wwtp 2 material and methods 2 1 field site the study was performed at the municipal wwtp of uster switzerland 47 21 02

the influent characteristics can be found in table s1 supplementary information si after mechanical treatment by screening grit chambers sand and fat traps and primary clarification the wastewater enters the biological stage the biological treatment step consists of six sequencing batch reactors sbr with a volume of 3000 m3 each on average total solids retention time srt was 34 days and aerobic srt 10 days operating conditions of the sbrs are described in table s2 si the sbrs were operated with dynamic cycle times depending on the same rules for all reactors table s3 si a yearly average sbr cycle includes a fixed sequence of process steps total time 3 5 h 45 min feeding 90 min reaction phase 30 min anoxic 60 min aerobic and 75 min settling and decanting the total cycle length as well as the length of each step vary substantially over a year the operation of the reaction and settling phases are adapted seasonally during the warmer months and if sufficient nitrification capacity is available a pre anoxic phase is implemented when nitrification performance is limiting the reaction phase is fully aerated the settling phase is adapted depending on the actual settling velocity following the biological treatment the wastewater is polished in a rapid sand filtration and discharged into the environment the sbrs are controlled and monitored with several online sensors and 24 h composite samples taken at multiple treatment steps of the wwtp after primary clarifier after biological treatment and after filter except for the o2 probe the online liquid sensors are situated in the analytics room of the wwtp where mixed liquor from the reactors is pumped to two identical monitoring trains equipped with multiple sensors fig 1 each monitoring train receives mixed liquor from three reactors r1 r3 r5 or r2 r4 r6 each reactor is sampled for 5 min consisting of a flushing period of the monitoring train to remove the mixed liquor from the previous reactor and a measurement

wastewater flow excess sludge flow air flow wastewater temperature dosage of precipitant and sludge settling velocity were used to analyze process performance to compare aob and nob activity among

uster wwtp from february 2018 to july 2019 the emissions were assessed using an adapted version of the flux chamber for off gas monitoring on wwtp at least one flux chamber was installed on every reactor fig 1 a detailed description of the monitoring setup can be found in gruber et al 2020 the emissions at uster wwtp exhibited a strong seasonal pattern with two extended emission peaks february 2018 to may 2018 march 2019 to may 2019 and low emissions between the two peaks the study focuses on the processes around the two peaks subsequently called campaign 1 and campaign 2 as stated above the operation of uster wwtp is adapted depending on wastewater flow and plant performance changing significantly over a year during campaign 1 and campaign 2 extended periods of process failure on the majority of reactors were observed with high no2 effluent concentrations and bad settling qualities of the activated sludge an overview of the wwtp operational changes and mitigation strategies is provided in table 1 table 2 gives detailed information on sludge exchange for each event 2 3 activated sludge sampling and dna extraction the activated sludge sampling was performed on a weekly basis for selected reactors during the sampling campaigns to reduce the number of samples r4 was completely excluded from the sampling for the first campaign given the high similar behavior of all reactors during the second campaign samples were collected from all reactors overall we sequenced 53 sludge samples from campaign 1 and 47 samples from campaign 2 for each sample a 50 ml tube of mixed liquor was collected when the reactors were fully mixed during the aeration phase or the anoxic mixing phase and immediately transported to the lab in the lab 2 ml tubes were filled with the mixed liquor and centrifuged at 6000 rcf and 4 c for two minutes the supernatant was withdrawn and the procedure was repeated twice three aliquots of each sample were stored at 20 c for further processing nucleic acids from the 1st campaign were extracted with the mobio power soil kit qiagen germany following the standard operating procedure of the extraction kit nucleic acids from the 2nd campaign were extracted based on a method modified from griffiths et al 2000 activated sludge samples from every time point were transferred to 1 5 ml matrix e lysis tubes mpbio and 0 5 ml of both hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide buffer and phenol chloroform isoamylalcohol 25 24 1 ph 6 8 was added the activated sludge was lysed in a fastprep machine mpbio followed by nucleic acid precipitation with peg 6000 on ice nucleic acids were washed three times with ethanol 70 and dissolved in 50 µl depc treated rnase free water for all samples dna quality and quantity were assessed by using agarose gel electrophoresis and a nanodrop nd 2000c thermo fisher scientific usa 2 4 sequencing 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing from the 1st campaign was performed at the university of basel switzerland on an illumina miseq platform based on the pair end algorithm 300 bp v3 v4 and the primer pair 341f and 806r resulting in an average number of 92 200 34 700 sequences due to the covid 19 outbreak and entailed constraints we were not able to perform sequencing of the samples from the second campaign at the same sequencing service provider samples from the 2nd campaign were sequenced at dnasense aps aalborg denmark www dnasense com using the same algorithm and primers resulting in an average number of 30 800 5600 sequences although using the same pcr chemistry 2 300 bp v3 v4 region and illumina sequencer the outcome from the sequence providers differed significantly in the number and quality of sequences which made it particularly challenging to analyze both sequence sets together therefore and due to the different dna extraction protocols used the microbial data from both campaigns were analyzed as separate datasets although they were observed in the same wwtp 2 5 sequence analysis and microbial community analysis raw sequences from both sequence runs were analyzed within the qiime2 framework caporaso et al 2010 amplicon sequence variants asvs were produced with the dada2 callahan et al 2016 pipeline and taxonomically annotated based on the microbial database for activated sludge midas3 nierychlo et al 2020 all subsequent biostatistics analysis were performed individually on the sequence tables derived from this analysis pipeline a link to the sequence tables are provided at the end of the manuscript after normalization based on the variance stabilization algorithm within deseq2 love et al 2014 we performed a non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis based on the bray curtis dissimilarity using vegan and r software oksanen et al 2007 r core team 2020 a hierarchic clustering approach vegdist function vegan r was applied on the dissimilarities in community composition to statistically divide the samples from all reactors into different clusters within each campaign while community dissimilarities in campaign 1 were statistically most robust when explained by 5 clusters a b c d e campaign 2 could be divided into 4 clusters x yα yβ z we assigned if possible asvs to their putative functional role in the wastewater treatment plant based on the global database of microbes in wastewater treatment systems and anaerobic digesters midas nierychlo et al 2020 more information on sequence analysis and subsequent ecostatistics can be found in in section s2 si 3 results 3 1 n2o emission plant performance and incomplete nitrification during our n2o monitoring campaign at uster wwtp the biological treatment went through two extended periods of severe nitrification and settling failure leading to high no2 concentrations and turbidity in the effluent a detailed overview of the performance and operation of the biological treatment during both periods is shown in fig 2 starting in march 2018 and april 2019 increased n2o emissions very low nitratation performance no2 in effluent bad settleability of the activated sludge svi and a turbid effluent low transparency value were the most important process failure characteristics observed over a period of two to three months fig 2 after an extended transition phase of roughly one month the reactors reverted to a satisfying treatment performance as before the process failure period and emitted very low amounts of n2o during both campaigns interestingly the transition between phases was not synchronized between the different reactors this asynchrony of the recovery is highlighted by the high standard deviations for the n2o emissions estimated nob and aob activity in mid april 2018 to mid may 2018 and may 2019 fig 2a for individual reactor data see si figs s1 3 during both campaigns no2 concentrations in the mixed effluent of all reactors reached very high values of up to 9 3 mgno2 n l during campaign 1 and 4 9 mgno2 n l during campaign 2 as shown in fig 2b while no2 concentrations increased within a month from satisfying to peak concentrations the return to normal concentrations took two to three months although the rapid sand filtration for effluent polishing could reduce some of the produced no2 the effluent concentrations were still dramatically higher than the target value of 0 3 mgno2 n l of the swiss water protection law the no2 concentrations correlated negatively with the observed average nob activity r 0 61 p 0 001 n 81 while the nob activity dropped by up to 100 to levels around 20 mgn l d aob activity decreased only slightly campaign 2 or remained stable and increased later campaign 1 cluster e therefore nh4 effluent concentrations increased slightly but remained clearly below the discharge limits of 2 mgnh4 n l after the filter the transparency of the effluent dropped parallel to the decreasing nob activity fig 2b fig s4 figs s5 and s6 si the sludge settling characteristics changed dramatically leading to high svi values and low sludge settling velocities fig 2 figures s5 and s6 si both properties showed a medium negative correlation r 0 51 p 0 001 n 332 and were heavily affected during both process failure phases the wwtp emitted significant amounts of n2o during both campaigns during peak days up to 30 of the influent nitrogen load was emitted as n2o resulting in a massive impact on the greenhouse gas balance of the wwtp n2o emissions showed a close and highly significant positive correlation with no2 concentrations in the effluent of the biological treatment r 0 81 p 0 001 n 60 generally the emission pattern was highly variable under wet weather conditions e g at the beginning of april 2018 n2o emissions dropped to very low levels and then peaked only a few days later when the influent wastewater amount returned to dry weather conditions effluent no2 concentrations and transparency values from the biological treatment indicate that similar events of incomplete nitrification were observed in the spring seasons of preceding years fig s3 despite the evident periodicity of the nitrification failure episodes the two campaigns indicate a different progression of process performance in different years in campaign 1 no2 rose and peaked rapidly and the estimated nob activity dropped accordingly to levels close to zero at the beginning of march the effluent transparency mirrored the pattern of the no2 concentrations in campaign 2 the decline of nob activity and the increase of no2 effluent concentration happened more gradually with a peak in march while the effluent transparency value reached its minimum one month before the no2 concentrations interestingly the process failure phenomenology was overall less dramatic in campaign 2 compared to campaign 1 fig 2 fig 3 fig s9 while all reactors performed similarly and exhibited a partial failure of nitrification and settling during campaign 1 r1 and r3 did not exhibit episodes of dramatic process instabilities during campaign 2 this fortuitous development allowed a comparative analysis of the characteristics of failing and functioning tanks in campaign 2 elevated no2 concentrations 1 mg no2 n l during aeration can to some extent be observed in all reactors fig s7 si however r1 and r3 during campaign 2 had enough nitrite oxidation and denitrification capacity to avoid a drastic long term no2 accumulation fig s10 si additionally the n2o emissions of r1 and r3 were clearly lower compared to the other reactors fig 3c the estimated aob activity however was comparable in all reactors fig 3a after the transient loss of nitrification and settling performance overall process performance returned to the previous levels after sludge exchange in the low performing reactors settling and nitrite oxidation performance increased significantly 3 2 mitigation measures applied by the operators and correlation analysis in order to reduce the duration of the process failure phases in campaign 1 compared to previous years the operators changed operation parameters according to the following four operational strategies table 1 i increase of aerobic srt to retain more nitrifiers see fig s8 si ii increase the oxygen concentration during aeration to increase aerobic activity see fig 2c iii reduce or skip the anoxic reaction phase to allow lengthening the aeration phase fig 2c and iv replacement of the activated sludge with sludge from a well running system see fig 3 table 2 in the second campaign dissolved oxygen and aerobic srt were only slightly increased since the strategies were not successful during campaign 1 fig 2c aerobic reaction phases were extended by reducing or skipping the anoxic reaction phase in both campaigns fig 2c overall the strategies i ii and iii were found insufficient as they did not accelerate the recovery of nitrification performance fig 2c figure s11 do aerobic srt anoxic time the complete exchange of activated sludge strategy iv appeared to be the only successful strategy to recover treatment performance fig 3 in order to investigate potential causes for the seasonal process failure pearson correlation analysis was performed with standard operational parameters performance indicators and influent indices fig s11 si although correlation analysis has been applied in previous n2o monitoring studies with limited success wwtp operators often rely on strategies based on empirical correlations to address unexpected performance issues like incomplete nitrification no2 r 0 8 p 0 001 n 59 and cod r 0 71 p 0 001 n 59 effluent concentrations showed the highest correlations with n2o emissions n2o emissions showed a moderate negative correlation with temperature r 0 48 p 0 001 and nob activity r 0 5 p 0 001 as well as a weak negative correlation with anoxic cycle time r 0 32 p 0 001 while temperature only correlated on a daily average and is thus assumed to influence the emissions only indirectly the latter two appear to be highly relevant variables for no2 accumulation and n2o emissions no other significant correlations with operational parameters were found overall the correlation analysis does not yield any strategies to optimize plant performance since all process optimization strategies applied were shown to be ineffective and therefore exhibited correlations with n2o contrary to the intended effect 3 3 microbial community dynamics as a driver of n2o emissions and no2 accumulation as we were not able to explain the observed n2o dynamics and concomitant nitrification failures based on wwtp operational parameters we decided to investigate the role of microbial community dynamics as a potential driver we used 16s rrna gene sequencing analyses to obtain time series data of the microbial community composition with the goal of correlating the process performance with changes in the activated sludge microbiome to identify distinct phases in the microbial community composition over time we applied a hierarchical clustering approach to the asv abundance table amplicon sequence variants reflecting microbial species of all samples from the different reactors within the consecutive sampling campaigns dissimilarities of microbial community composition and resulting clusters are visualized in fig 4 the resulting distinct clusters based on the dissimilarities in microbial community composition followed the temporal progression and in campaign 2 additionally reflected the split between reactors with and without process failure we therefore used these clusters to divide the campaigns into a sequence of distinct phases for subsequent analyses of microbial data within the 1st campaign we observed a significant permanova p 0 05 change in the microbial community composition from cluster a to e which was comparable for all reactors in the second campaign a similar temporal dynamic could also be observed for the communities in reactors experiencing process failure r2 r4 r5 and r6 in clusters x yβ z however the microbial community structure in reactor r1 and r3 from campaign 2 remained nearly unchanged after the initial transition from cluster x to y α and did not change thereafter in line with the stable nitrification performance fig 3 interestingly while they displayed lower n2o emissions and no process failures during the second campaign these two reactors were characterized by impaired nitrification and particularly high n2o peaks during the first campaign notably these reactors were operated identically to the others over the period of both campaigns as long as nitrification worked sufficiently the failing reactors r2 r4 r5 and r6 however shared a common clustering pattern as already observed during the first year ending with a significantly distinct community structure in summer cluster z compared to the initial state in late fall cluster x or the stable reactors y α the alpha diversity index shannon average n2o concentrations and the svi all varied considerably between the temporal clusters fig 5 we found that species diversity significantly decreased in all reactors during process failure episodes i e from cluster a to c in campaign 1 and from x to yβ to z fig 5a while diversity was decreasing n2o emissions and svi tended to increase in both campaigns fig 5b c as with diversity we did not observe a substantial change for these parameters between cluster x and cluster y α in campaign 2 the diversity of the activated sludge increased again from cluster d to cluster e campaign 1 accompanied by decreasing n2o emissions and svi the observed increase in diversity at the end of campaign 1 could not be observed in campaign 2 since the recovery phase was not sampled the strong link between microbial diversity and performance indicators for settling and nitrification is confirmed by correlation analysis fig s12 si the shannon diversity and two other indices simpson diversity and species evenness were found to be significantly negatively correlated with n2o emissions svi values and no2 concentrations in effluent of the biological treatment during both campaigns a weak positive correlation was found with effluent transparency during campaign 1 fig s12 si in order to identify which functional groups of the microbial community displayed the significant changes in abundance we assigned all asvs based on their assigned genus and using the global database of microbes in wastewater treatment systems and anaerobic digesters nierychlo et al 2020 either to the morphological group of filamentous bacteria or to a putative functional role in wwtp given the crucial importance of filamentous bacteria in wwtp nierychlo et al 2019 speirs et al 2019 we decided to include this category into our assignment therefore in case filamentous asvs could be assigned in addition to other putative functions aerobic heterotrophs or fermenters we used the morphological feature rather than the putative function to quantify which asvs substantially contributed to observed fluctuations in relative abundance and diversity changes we performed a differential abundance analysis and expressed the magnitude of change between consecutive clusters as log2foldchange fig s13 si a positive log2foldchange indicates a decrease in abundance over time while a negative log2foldchange means increasing counts the assignment to high level functional roles allows for comparison between the two campaigns we found that the transitions from clusters a b c campaign 1 and x yβ z displayed the highest numbers in asvs that significantly p 0 05 wald test decreased in abundance fig s13 si number of bubbles the transitions from d e campaign 1 and x yα campaign 2 were characterized by an increase in abundance of asvs which decreased in the earlier clusters during the early transition from cluster a b and x yβ that corresponds to the initial development toward process failure in both campaigns we observed an increase in abundance of aerobic heterotrophs and fermenting bacteria while filamentous bacteria decreased in abundance fig 6 s13 the declining abundance of filamentous bacteria continued during the transition from cluster yβ to z during campaign 2 fermenting bacteria mostly affiliated to the genera arcobacter and bacteroides tended to increase from a b and x yβ in both campaigns interestingly they decreased during phases with elevated no2 concentrations and n2o emissions i e campaign 1 b c and c d campaign 2 yβ z respectively this dynamic was accompanied by an increase in aerobic heterotrophs and a decrease in denitrifying bacteria dnb we also found that nob were low in abundance during cluster c d campaign 1 and yβ z campaign 2 associated with a recovery of the process performance the transition from cluster d e in campaign 1 was characterized by a re increase in abundance of filamentous bacteria dnbs and nobs while aerobic heterotrophs substantially decreased in abundance fig 6 s13 we also observed a stabilization of the community for all reactors in cluster z of campaign 2 in stark contrast to these dynamic cluster transitions the shift from cluster x to yα stable reactors of campaign 2 entailed merely an increase in abundance for filamentous bacteria and aob focusing on the temporal development of the microbial communities in reactor 1 and 3 cluster yα fig 6 s13 we observed a surprisingly stable community with a significant increase linear regression analyses p 0 05 in abundance of filamentous bacteria in comparison to the starting condition cluster x in contrast to the decreasing trend for this group in the other reactors given the crucial importance of nitrifying bacteria in municipal wastewater treatment we dissected the microbial communities from both campaigns to elucidate the individual dynamics of aob and nob affiliated bacteria fig 7 during both campaigns nitrosomonas was the only detected bacterial genus affiliated with aerobic ammonium oxidation and its abundance did not change dramatically over the course of the sampling campaigns despite process disturbances however bacteria affiliated with no2 oxidation displayed surprising dynamics in abundance during both campaigns the abundance of the dominant nob nitrospira significantly decreased during the periods with a low nitratation performance campaign 1 cluster b c d campaign 2 yβ z during campaign 1 asvs assigned to a different bacterium affiliated with no2 oxidation candidatus nitrotoga started to emerge in cluster d and became the dominant nob fraction of the community in cluster e interestingly candidatus nitrotoga was not present in the prior clusters of campaign 1 nor could it be detected during campaign 2 the recovery phases of r2 r4 r5 and r6 were not sampled during campaign 2 and it is therefore not clear if the species may have emerged later however it is likely that nitrotoga did not appear in the second campaign since the operators started to replace the activated sludge of the unsatisfyingly performing reactor one week after the last sludge samples were taken fig 3 in order to identify potential process parameters or environmental factors which could have initiated these drastic changes in community structure we performed a correlation based analysis here we used all asvs that were present in at least 25 of the samples and sorted them into their putative functional groups we determined the correlation of these groups with the same averaged process parameters as used for the process correlation analysis described above for each sampling point of the treatment plant for each campaign fig s14 si however we were not able to find a large number of significant correlations after the p value adjustment which would allow us to make assumptions on what might have caused the initiation of the community change further diverging results between the two consecutive campaigns which can perhaps be attributed to differences in operation strategy of the reactors and different periods of the clusters fig s14 si ultimately do not allow to identify drivers 4 discussion the yearly n2o emissions at uster wwtp are an example for a broadly observed pattern of seasonally driven n2o emission from wwtp most previous n2o monitoring campaigns at wwtp observed an emission pattern peaking in spring and reaching its minimum in autumn such as the kralingseveer wwtp daelman et al 2015 avedøre wwtp chen et al 2019 lucerne wwtp and altenrhein wwtp gruber et al 2020 hence these monitoring campaigns might represent observations of the same phenomenon given the reported correlation of n2o emissions of no2 concentration in two studies daelman et al 2015 gruber et al 2020 we hypothesize that seasonally increased no2 concentrations in the biological reactors of these treatment plants are directly and functionally linked to the n2o emissions patterns during both campaigns at uster wwtp high n2o emissions were observed after substantially diminished nob activity resulting in no2 accumulation in the effluent which suggests a high contribution of denitrification nitrifier or heterotrophic to n2o production domingo felez et al 2016 wunderlin et al 2013 although the extent of nitrite accumulation in our monitoring campaign is extreme fig 2 seasonal nitrite accumulation has been previously reported for full scale wwtps and shown to be related to n2o emissions castro barros et al 2016 philips et al 2002 randall and buth 1984 at the vikinmäkki wwtp a very similar case with substantial nob failure could be observed in a continuously fed activated sludge process with denitrification and nitrification kuokkanen et al 2020 the uster wwtp is designed following the standard guidelines section s1 si the strategies applied by the operator in campaign 1 to counter incomplete nitrification were shown to be unsuccessful fig 2 i e increasing aerobic srt and oxygen setpoints they target typical key operation parameters aiming to support nitrifying bacteria stenstrom and poduska 1980 other reported causes for nob loss and nitrite accumulation such as high temperatures elevated ph values and increased free ammonia concentrations ren et al 2019 can be clearly excluded for the case reported fig 2 fig s11 hence the yearly recurring episodes fig s4 of substantial nitrite accumulation followed by n2o emissions cannot be solved and explained using standard engineering approaches in strong agreement with the microbial analysis we find that the nob loss correlates with important changes of the entire microbial community and thus the primary cause likely does not reside in the nitrifiers themselves the clustering of the changing microbial community structure correlated surprisingly well with the changing nitrification performance and sludge characteristics in both campaigns figs 2 5 our analysis of the microbial communities clearly revealed a progressive and quite well synchronized change of the community composition in all independent reactors fig 4 and that the respective species diversity negatively correlated with nitrite accumulation changing sludge settleability and n2o emissions fig 5 s5 with the exceptions of r1 and r3 during campaign 2 where the microbial community was very stable fig 4 the six reactors exhibited synchronized microbial communities and reproducible impaired treatment performances the high similarity of the activated sludge microbiome within different independent reactors of the same wwtp or even in the same region has been observed in previous studies griffin and wells 2017 the microbial community analysis of the two campaigns revealed significant differences between the pre and post process failure community compositions fig 4 despite the differences in community structure all reactors re emerged to satisfying performances in n removal fig 2 and displayed comparable diversity measures again at the end of campaign 1 and at the beginning of campaign 2 fig 5 we hypothesize that the destabilization of the activated sludge microbiome was initiated by the loss of certain key functional groups that maintain the sludge structure this in turn triggered a cascading decline of other valuable members including nob of the community van den abbeele et al 2011 our observations on decreasing diversity and evenness fig 5 s13 as well as the pronounced loss of specific microbial consortia during clusters a c and x yβ z support this notion specifically the observed decline in filamentous bacteria mainly chloroflexi after cluster a and x appears likely to have initiated the cascading effect on the community in both campaigns as it provides a credible explanation for the reported changes in sludge settling figs 3 and 5 the visible change in transparency and settling velocity further supports the notion of the lost sludge integrity figs 2 3 s12 filamentous members of the phylum chloroflexi are known to support the structural integrity of activated sludge their ability to degrade complex polymeric organic compounds to low molecular weight substrates is very beneficial for other members of the community kragelund et al 2007 nierychlo et al 2019 speirs et al 2019 burger et al 2017 found a direct correlation between the abundance of filamentous bacteria and the strength of the floc which further supports our findings however the mechanisms that lead to the decline of filamentous bacteria and nob while aob are significantly less affected remain unclear both loss of structural integrity e g pin point floc formation and washout and loss of mutualistic interactions e g substrate transfer could potentially play a role burger et al 2017 lau et al 1984 örmeci and vesilind 2000 sezgin et al 1978 disturbance or changing condition induced species loss can open up new niches within the sludge community that are prone to colonization by other bacterial consortia with ecological advantages under the given conditions vuono et al 2016 we observed this phenomenon during campaign 1 while the nob species nitrospira declined substantially in abundance another nob species nitrotoga emerged and took over as the dominant nob in these reactors fig 7 during the transition phase between these two nob species we observed the highest n2o emissions fig 2 to our surprise no sequences from the 2nd campaign could be annotated to the genus nitrotoga however nitrotoga was also not found during the first three clusters of campaign 1 we believe that as fast as the cold affine nitrotoga lucker et al 2015 wegen et al 2019 was emerging it was soon again replaced by nitrospira as the dominating nob species during the warm summer months preceding campaign 2 in stark contrast to the nob community the aob fraction nitrosomonas remained comparably stable in abundance over the course of both campaigns we speculate that the changing sludge morphology initiated by the loss of filamentous bacteria could also affect the observed abundance dynamics within the nitrifying community given the increased effluent turbidity after biological treatment due to diminished sludge integrity in the affected reactors fig 2 we speculate that the nob fraction could be preferentially washed out in pin point flocs the washout of nobs in turn leads to no2 accumulation as observed during campaigns after cluster a and x respectively as our results indicate the exchange of activated sludge can work as a mitigation strategy but it should be only applied in emergency cases for two reasons firstly the transfer of significant amounts of sludge leads to lower treatment performance in the source reactor secondly the replacement of sludge speeds up the system recovery but does not prevent system failure later during a season or in the following year the results from campaign 2 and the well performing reactors r1 and r3 show that probably only small changes are needed to stabilize the microbiome since the same operational strategies were applied in the disturbed and the satisfying reactors although the initial causes for impaired plant performance remain unknown strategies to reduce process failure should aim for a stabilization of activated sludge microbiome already well before the problem becomes acute as reported in previous studies several strategies could be applied such as i increase of oxygen concentration huang 2010 ii increase srt kim et al 2011 vuono et al 2015 or iii maintaining a stable process operation strategy dytczak et al 2008 since strategies i and ii have been unsuccessfully applied during campaign 1 when the microbiome was already substantially disturbed we hypothesize that the changes in operation should be implemented a few months before the expected phase of nitrification failure integrating a proactive management of the activated sludge microbiome in the operational strategy of a wwtp could be an asset for the mitigation of seasonally occurring nitrification failure and insufficient sludge settleability our study highlights the need for further detailed sampling campaigns and experimental work to uncover the chain of events that leads to community disturbance and ultimately to significant peaks in n2o emissions and no2 accumulation a better understanding of seasonal patterns of microbial population dynamics will be central to this objective to investigate microbial dynamics as a potential cause or mediator of such patterns further studies are required in three directions i e 1 16 s rrna amplicon sequencing with a higher resolution weekly sampling over a whole year 2 seasonal assessment of microbial activity with metagenomics or multi omics approaches and 3 systematic assessment of the microbial community during tests of mitigation strategies and comparison with a reference system in particular multi omics approaches could help to characterize the initial causes for strong dynamics in microbial communities for seasonal studies independent of the methods applied it seems crucial to include not only species involved in the nitrogen cycle but the whole activated sludge microbiome furthermore future studies should always be coupled with spatially and temporally highly resolved long term n2o and no2 monitoring and extended process monitoring as at uster wwtp ultimately suitable targets organisms genes or community traits that can be measured reliably and cost effectively would have to be characterized that are reliably linked to subsequent process failures merely collecting microbial data does not automatically advance the operation of a wwtp our study clearly shows that extended discussions and a close collaboration between operators engineers and microbiologists are required to take advantage of the full potential of microbial assays to analyze the data appropriately and to suggest mitigation strategies 5 conclusions no2 accumulation correlates strongly with and is very likely the cause for the observed seasonal n2o emission peaks on a full scale activated sludge sbr plant while the aob abundance and performance remained relatively stable throughout the campaigns the nob population disappeared and needed to re establish the phases of impaired nitrification and high n2o emissions correlated with the process of a drastic change in the microbial community affecting multiple process relevant species the communities of reactors with high emissions differed significantly before and after the peak emission phases on the contrary reactors with a stable microbial community over the whole period did not exhibit increased n2o emissions the no2 oxidation on the sbr plant repeatedly underperformed even though i the important operating parameters aeration and aerobic srt were set according to standard guidelines and ii common factors known to cause no2 oxidation failure were not present these results counter the notion that the accumulation of no2 and the seasonal n2o emission pattern are issues uniquely related to growth conditions of nitrifiers loss and re establishment of nob activity seems to coincide with loss and re establishment of filamentous bacteria and entailed bad sludge settling properties impaired settleability and a turbid effluent this has considerable practical implications since measures to maintain complete nitrification might need to target floc structure rather than aob and nob growth conditions only regular long term microbial and physico chemical monitoring of the activated sludge and a better understanding of its microbial community likely is important for understanding seasonal n2o emission patterns while current standard engineering approaches could not explain the process failure appropriate operational strategies to avoid

19967,taste and odor t o issues have been a major concern among drinking water utilities as source waters are becoming increasingly vulnerable to compounds released during algal blooms as well as non algal compounds while most of the literature focuses on the two most common t o compounds 2 mib and geosmin there are other compounds that have the potential to cause t o events the aim of this study was to develop an advanced analytical method using solid phase microextraction spme and gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry gc ms ms to identify 18 t o compounds belonging to various odor classes the developed method was optimized for the 18 analytes and implemented to determine the holding time of the compounds in raw and treated distribution system point of entry or poe drinking water matrices compounds belonging to certain classes such as pyrazines and anisoles were found to be stable 30 loss in all tested waters for up to two weeks while aldehydes ketones esters and alkyl sulfides showed 30 loss within 96 h in raw water preservation of samples at low ph 2 using hydrochloric acid increased the holding times and reduced losses within 96 h for aldehydes ketones and esters the paper also discusses the occurrence of these compounds with water utilities from the midwest and eastern us during the summer months the study detected eight t o compounds 2 mib geosmin β cyclocitral β ionone hexanal indole dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide while five compounds were detected above their threshold concentrations in the raw water two of them 2 mib and geosmin were detected above threshold in the poe samples keywords taste and odor compounds drinking water spme gc ms ms holding time t o occurrence 1 introduction semi volatile and volatile organic compounds are released either naturally e g cyanobacteria algae and bacteria or anthropogenically e g chemical spills into source waters and can cause taste and odor t o issues in drinking water guo et al 2016 lu et al 2012 peter and von gunten 2007 these compounds alter the characteristics of drinking water such as smell and taste making the water unpleasant to drink and are not always effectively removed during conventional treatment this impacts customer confidence in water quality and poses a major problem to the water treatment industry zamyadi et al 2015 most laboratories in the us that conduct chemical analysis for t o compounds rely on the standard method 6040d that has been validated for detecting three t o compounds 2 mib geosmin and isopropyl methoxypyrazine ipmp t o events from algal blooms have been reported for decades but there is an increase in their frequency that could be attributed to changes in climatic conditions and increasing agricultural run offs carrying nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus anderson et al 2002 huang et al 2018 in addition to 2 mib and geosmin several potential t o compounds are released from blooms chemical spills and wastewater effluents bruchet et al 2007 it is important for drinking water utilities to identify and understand the stability and treatability of emerging non mib geosmin compounds so that the utilities are prepared to respond to t o events while a majority of t o events are caused by compounds released from algal blooms and decay of dead matter in aquatic ecosystems events have been reported to occur because of compounds that are formed during treatment such as disinfection byproducts dbps and compounds that are formed within the distribution system watson et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 industrial spills and releases to the environment are another source of synthetic organic compounds that contribute to occasional t o episodes compounds such as dioxanes and dioxolanes have been reported previously to have caused t o events and were associated with effluents from resin manufacturing plants boleda et al 2007 bruchet et al 2007 quintana et al 2016 romero et al 1998 2 mib and geosmin are earthy musty compounds that have very low odor threshold concentrations otc of 2 15 ng l and 4 ng l respectively and are detected in surface waters with algal bacterial and phytoplankton growth table 1 other compounds that cause t o issues have been documented in various case studies where customers have reported swampy septic fishy rancid chlorinous and vegetable odors guo et al 2019 ma et al 2011 2013 zhang et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 fishy rancid odors have been reported to be caused by aldehydes such as 2 4 heptadienal 2 4 hd while cucumber odor is caused by 2 6 nonadienal 2 6 nd and grassy vegetable lettuce odor by hexanal zhao et al 2013 septic and swampy odors have been linked with hydrogen sulfide dimethyl sulfide dms dimethyl disulfide dmds dimethyl trisulfide dmts and indole that are formed primarily because of decaying biomass chen et al 2010 feng et al 2018 guo et al 2019 musty corky flavors were observed during the formation of 2 4 6 trichloroanisole 2 4 6 tca 2 3 6 trichloroanisole 2 3 6 tca and 2 4 6 tribromoanisole 2 4 6 tba in the distribution systems from biomethylation of dbps chlorophenol and bromophenol byrd 2017 lee et al 2017 β cyclocitral and β ionone are algal and cyanobacterial metabolites and have been reported to co occur along with toxins released by cyanobacterial species graham et al 2010 huang et al 2018 jones and korth 1995 pyrazines although less frequently detected than 2 mib and geosmin have been included in various t o studies for their low threshold concentrations in the ng l range chen et al 2010 deng et al 2011 peter and von gunten 2007 isopropyl methoxy pyrazine ipmp is a microbial metabolite released by actinomycetes species while isobutyl methoxy pyrazine ibmp is commonly associated with the degradation of microbial biomass in natural waters khiari et al 1997 peter et al 2009 in addition grassy odors have been identified in water sources caused by compounds such as cis 3 hexenyl acetate c3ha and cis 3 hexen 1 ol c3ho which have otc values that are 3 5 orders of magnitude higher table 1 than pyrazines and anisoles khiari et al 1999 peter and von gunten 2007 suffet et al 2004 as water temperature increases during the summer months the odor threshold values might be lower than the otcs reported in table 1 whelton and dietrich 2004 the most important tool needed for monitoring and preventing t o issues is a robust analytical method for the detection of compounds near or below their otc values table 1 the detection of t o compounds is typically conducted using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms olfactory gc ms and sensory techniques such as flavor profile analysis and threshold odor number bruchet 2019 chen et al 2013 dietrich et al 2003 suffet et al 2004 although gc ms has been widely used for chemical analyses using tandem mass spectrometry ms ms was shown to have greater sensitivity by reducing background noise and improving signal to noise ratios wang et al 2019 for sample preparation several extraction techniques have been used such as solid phase extraction stir bar sorptive adsorption closed loop stripping analysis purge and trap headspace sampling and solid phase microextraction spme studies reported that headspace spme showed minimal interferences compared to other techniques thus resulting in better reproducibility and high sensitivity in the ng l range chen et al 2013 furtula et al 2004 godayol et al 2011 watson et al 2000 ma et al 2011 developed a spme method coupled with gc ms to quantify six t o causing aldehydes released in natural waters by algal cultures lu et al 2012 studied the application of headspace spme and gc with flame photometric detection to analyze hyper eutrophic lake water samples and found five odorous sulfur compounds hydrogen sulfide methanethiol dms dmds and dmts numerous studies optimized spme and gc ms methods to improve the sensitivity and achieve lower detection limits ma et al 2012 and chen et al 2013 developed and optimized a gc ms method using headspace spme to detect 2 mib geosmin haloanisoles pyrazines and aldehydes both studies focused on the optimization of the spme method by studying the effects of different types of spme fibers and determined that the most efficient fiber was divinylbenzene carboxen polydimethylsiloxane dvb car pdms the higher efficiency of this dual coated fiber compared to other commercially available single coated fibers was because of the high affinity of the dvb phase for small alcohols the presence of the non polar pdms stationary phase for highly nonpolar compounds and the increased fiber surface area of highly porous car phase godayol et al 2011 ma et al 2012 watson et al 2000 these results are corroborated by zhang et al 2005 who compared six commercially available spme fibers and reported that the dvb car pdms fiber had the highest extraction efficiency in achieving method detection limits in the pg l range for 10 t o analytes though there have been several studies on identifying non mib geosmin compounds very few of them focused on a wide range of compounds from various odor classes furthermore there is a paucity of mechanistic studies to understand the stability of these compounds or lack thereof in environmental water matrices hence the aim of this study was to i develop and optimize an expanded and semi automated analytical method that can detect t o compounds across various odor classes having different odor thresholds ranging from ng l to µg l ii conduct holding time and preservation studies to understand the stability of these compounds in different water matrices and iii conduct an occurrence study with drinking water utilities across the midwest and eastern us during the summer and fall months 2

inlet liners that are compatible with spme fibers were purchased from agilent technologies santa clara ca usa 20 ml amber headspace screw top vials with ptfe silicone magnetic caps were used for holding 10 ml samples for gc ms ms analysis agilent technologies usa 2 2 solid phase microextraction spme a semi automated method based on headspace spme was developed using ctc pal sample preparation and injection system ctc analytics switzerland with an agitator module for heating and a conditioning station spme extractions were conducted after conditioning the fibers for 6 hours at 270 c the fiber was also conditioned for 1 min before each extraction and 5 min after desorption the sample was first heated at 55 c for 4 min in the agitator module at 500 rpm following this the analytes were extracted from the sample by exposing the fiber in the headspace of the vial for 15 min while the sample was continuously heated and agitated at 55 c and 500 rpm the fiber was then desorbed for 2 min at 250 c in the injection port 2 2 1 spme optimization the optimal spme conditions were determined after studying the effect of various factors on compound extraction such as salt content in the samples extraction time extraction temperature desorption time and desorption gc inlet temperature the conditions were optimized one at a time by testing a range of values for each parameter

samples and calibration curves were prepared by adding 10 ml sample volume to the gc vial with 40 w v nacl and then were spiked with 25 ng l of internal standards istds n d8 and 2 4 6 tca d5 lab control standards were prepared with 25 ng l of istds in 10 ml milli q water and lab fortified matrix spikes were prepared with 25 ng l istds and 25 ng l of t o compounds in 10 ml samples external calibration curves were used for 15 compounds while for 2 4 6 tca 2 3 6 tca and 2 4 6 tba internal calibration curves were used with isotopically labelled 2 4 6 tca d5 all the compounds were calibrated over a range of 0 5 250 ng l except for five compounds with lower sensitivities hexanal c3ho c3ha 2 6 nd and indole that were calibrated over a range of 50 25 000 ng l 2 5 holding time study a preliminary set of experiments were designed and conducted to study the effect of holding time on the stability of the selected 18 t o compounds in three different matrices lab grade water milli q referred to as control surface water from the mississippi river collected at the intake of a local water utility referred to as raw and the treated water collected post disinfection at the entry point into the distribution system referred to as point of entry or poe the utility has a conventional treatment train the raw water has an average ph of 8 3 turbidity average 50 ntu alkalinity 140 180 mg l as caco3 total organic carbon toc 5 6 mg l while poe has an average ph of 7 5 turbidity 0 3 ntu alkalinity 130 160 mg l as caco3 toc 3 4 mg l water samples were collected 1 2 hours prior to the start of the experiments in amber glass bottles sodium thiosulfate was added at a concentration of 75 mg l to quench chlorine disinfectant residual in the water samples compounds with lower sensitivity c3ho c3ha hexanal 2 6 nd and indole were spiked at 2 500 ng l while the others were spiked at 100 ng l after spiking the samples were transferred into 40 ml amber glass vials without headspace 2 5 1 effect of holding time to study the impact of storage on the stability of the compounds a range of holding times were selected that are typical for utilities and laboratories during sampling and storage ranging from short to long periods 0 h 24 h 48 h 72 h 96 h 168 h 1 week and 336 h 2 weeks samples at each time point were analyzed in triplicates 2 5 2 effect of preservatives to study the effect of different preservation techniques pre salting and acid preservation were tested for these experiments raw and poe samples were spiked at concentrations mentioned in section 2 5 and stored in vials with preservatives 16 g of nacl for pre salting to maintain salt concentration at 40 w v and 4 5 drops 1 1 hcl for acid preservation ph 2 per 40 ml vial samples were analyzed in triplicates at set holding times as mentioned in section 2 5 1 acidified samples were neutralized with 3 w v of sodium bicarbonate prior to analysis on the gc ms ms 2 6 occurrence study for the occurrence study raw and poe samples were collected over a period of four months in 2019 from 13 drinking water utilities table 2 samples were collected bi weekly shipped to the laboratory overnight and stored at 4 c until analysis samples were analyzed within 72 h whenever possible to minimize the holding time to determine the effect of water quality on compound recoveries lab fortified matrix spikes were prepared as described in section 2 4 for every raw and poe sample analyzed 3 results and discussion 3 1 method optimization the method precision was determined from triplicate analyses during the holding time study and the average relative standard deviation rsd was between 2 20 method detection limits for most compounds were below their corresponding odor threshold concentrations with the optimized spme and gc ms ms method table 1 the compound peak responses were evaluated for determining optimum values of each of the spme parameters tested salt content extraction time extraction temperature desorption time and desorption temperature the optimum values for individual t o compounds are shown in si table s2 3 1 1 salt content one of the most significant factors for extraction efficiency was the salt content of the sample as demonstrated in this study as well as previous spme studies furtula et al 2004 ma et al 2012 watson et al 2000 peak responses of all the 18 compounds increased proportionally with an increase in the salt concentration from 0 to 40 w v si fig s1 chen et al 2013 and lu et al 2012 reported similar increase in recoveries resulting from the increase in the ionic strength of the sample thus reducing the solubility of the compounds by increasing their partition coefficients however a further increase from 40 w v to 60 w v led to a decrease in the peak responses of six compounds β ionone indole dmds dmts c3ha and emd by 25 62 ma et al 2012 reported a decrease in compound recoveries at salt concentrations higher than 30 w v and hypothesized that the undissolved nacl under saturated conditions might adsorb the compounds hence for the compounds in this study 40 w v nacl was the optimum concentration 3 1 2 extraction time the peak responses for all 18 compounds increased with extraction times up to 15 min and slightly increased at 20 min chen et al 2013 showed that extraction time had a lesser impact on spme efficiency than extraction temperature salt content or agitation rate hence to keep the sample run time as short as possible an extraction time of 15 min was chosen for the rest of the study 3 1 3 extraction temperature the change in peak responses with temperature from 45 75 c varied among the compounds the peak responses decreased rapidly with increasing temperature for volatile compounds such as dimethyl sulfides i e dmds and dmts while semi volatile compounds while compounds such as β cyclocitral β ionone indole geosmin and pyrazines showed an increase in peak responses with temperature up to 65 c table s2 godayol et al 2011 and chen et al 2013 reported that high extraction temperatures might have a negative effect on recovery of highly volatile compounds as the fiber starts desorbing to maximize peak responses and minimize losses of highly volatile and semi volatile compounds the final extraction temperature was set at 55 c 3 1 4 desorption time the effect of desorption time was studied at 1 2 4 and 6 min the peak responses remained consistent with a low variation 15 between 1 and 6 min to keep the sample run time short the desorption time was set at 2 min 3 1 5 desorption temperature the desorption temperature gc inlet temperature is a critical parameter that impacts the partition of compounds from the solid phase fiber coating into the gaseous phase out of the four temperatures tested 225 c 235 c 250 c and 265 c the optimum temperature was found to be 250 c table s2 except for a few compounds such as β ionone c3ho emd hexanal and indole all the other compounds had maximum peak responses at 250 c hence this temperature was used for the rest of the study 3 2 holding time study the optimized method was used to study the stability and holding times of the t o compounds as described in section 2 4 the raw and poe samples spiked with t o compounds showed varying stability over time depending on the physical and chemical properties of the compounds compound recoveries between 70 130 were considered acceptable in accordance with the standard method guidelines for lab fortified sample matrices method 6040d standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater https www nemi gov methods method summary 5720 the holding times for the compounds determined in this study based on acceptable recoveries are summarized in table 3 3 2 1 stability of compounds in raw water the holding time study with raw water resulted in acceptable recoveries 70 for compounds such as geosmin 2 6 nd c3ho indole β cyclocitral and β ionone for the first 96 h but the recoveries decreased later in the 1 week and 2 weeks samples fig 1 compounds such as dmts had acceptable recoveries only at 0 h and decreased below 70 thereafter while hexanal had acceptable recoveries up to 8 h and 2 4 hd and c3ha up to 24 h fig 1 very few studies discuss the behavior of aldehydes esters and dimethyl sulfides in natural water matrices and the possible reasons for their losses some suggest that the reactive carbonyl group c o present in these compounds could participate in nucleophilic addition reactions in the presence of hydroxide oh ions in mildly alkaline waters resulting in the hydrolysis of the compounds chen et al 2013 sugaya et al 2004 sugaya et al 2004 indicated that the reactivity of the carbonyl group increases as the alkyl group size decreases the faster loss of 2 4 hd with time compared to more stable 2 6 nd fig 1 in this study was consistent with the observations by sugaya et al 2004 the reactions involving carbonyl groups in esters and aldehydes are often ph and temperature dependent khiari et al 1999 showed the degradation of c3ha in alkaline surface waters during storage even at 4 c it is hypothesized that hydrolysis in alkaline ph could be the cause for degradation of 2 4 hd and hexanal observed in our study the alkyl sulfide dmts experienced higher losses than the aldehydes and esters with a 50 loss within 24 h han et al 2017 showed that the dimethyl sulfides can undergo hydrolysis in natural water matrices however dmts showed a similar loss in the control sample as well suggesting that the compound is susceptible to loss in water regardless of ph and the presence of natural organic matter nom the haloanisoles 2 4 6 tca 2 3 6 tca and 2 4 6 tba showed consistent recoveries of above 90 for up to two weeks these compounds contain an ether functional group which is not susceptible to hydrolysis like the carbonyl group compounds such as 2 mib ipmp ibmp and dmds were stable for the duration of the study fig 1 geosmin was stable up to one week with a loss of only 12 observed in the 1 week samples which was similar to the losses reported in the studies by korth et al 1992 and zhang et al 2010 on stability of geosmin in water samples both 2 mib and geosmin are tertiary alcohols that are less vulnerable to nucleophilic attacks in alkaline waters compared to compounds such as aldehydes and ketones methoxypyrazines ipmp and ibmp are also very persistent compounds which makes their removal difficult in the wine industry where they are frequently detected reynolds 2010 3 2 1a effect of acid preservation samples preserved with acid 1 1 hcl showed higher stability for esters aldehydes alcohols and ketones such as hexanal c3ho 2 4 hd c3ha β cyclocitral indole geosmin and β ionone fig 2 while the holding time of 2 4 hd was only 24 h in the non preserved raw water it increased up to 1 week in acidified raw water fig 2 similarly there was an increase in holding times of c3ha 2 4 hd and hexanal which had recoveries above 90 up to 1 week the recoveries of compounds c3ho geosmin β cyclocitral and β ionone also increased by 10 50 in the 2 week samples of acidified raw water compared to the non acidified raw water fig 2 the impact of acid preservation on the stability of esters aldehydes and sulfides has been discussed in previous studies such as with c3ha and dmds han et al 2017 khiari et al 1999 as the studies showed faster degradation of the two compounds with increasing ph decreasing the ph thus may hinder the hydrolysis and extend their holding times the only compound out of acceptable recovery range in both non preserved raw and acidified raw water was dmts which showed 50 loss within 24 h in both the cases figs 1 and 2 while acid preservation improved the recoveries of most compounds 2 mib and emd were negatively impacted fig 2 previous studies that reported loss of 2 mib at low ph had attributed it to the dehydration of the tertiary alcohol in acidic environments bu et al 2017 hsieh et al 2012 similarly acid catalyzed hydrolysis mechanisms were discussed in the case of dioxolanes which could be the cause of loss of emd fife and natarajan 1986 while a few other compounds such as geosmin ipmp and ibmp were also impacted by acid addition the reactions were reversed after neutralizing the acidified samples with sodium bicarbonate 3 2 1b effect of pre salting effect of pre salting was also studied during a separate experiment to understand the impacts of salt as a preservative in the raw water recoveries in pre salted samples of spiked raw water i e the samples stored with 40 w v nacl increased the recovery of dmts by 60 compared to non preserved raw water however the compound recovery still did not exceed 70 data not shown the impact of pre salting on the recoveries of other compounds was negligible satchwill et al 2007 evaluated pre salting of natural waters and reported no improvement in stability of t o compounds 3 3 2 stability of compounds in poe water most compounds that had low recoveries in raw water had greater recoveries in the poe samples with minor losses in the range of 2 20 even after 2 weeks si figs s2 and s3 however the recovery of dmts dropped below 70 after 48 h while 2 6 nd was above 70 for only up to 1 week other compounds including the aldehydes and ketones such as hexanal c3ha c3ho 2 4 hd and 2 6 nd were stable for 2 weeks with recoveries above 80 the average ph of poe water from the drinking water treatment plant was 7 5 the near neutral ph of the poe water and negligible matrix effects could be the reason for increased stability of compounds that experienced losses in mildly alkaline and nom rich raw water the results from the poe samples showed a similar trend to those observed in the control water for most compounds with the exception of 2 6 nd of the 18 compounds tested in the control water 17 compounds had recoveries greater than 70 for 2 weeks while the only compound dmts showed significant losses within 96 h similar to the observations in poe water the acidification of poe water and control water did not show any improvement in the recovery of dmts si fig s3 3 4 occurrence study the raw and poe samples collected from different treatment utilities across the midwest and eastern us were detected with non mib geosmin t o compounds such as β cyclocitral β ionone dmds and dmts and occasionally indole and hexanal table 4 most compounds detected above otcs in raw samples were from reservoir and lake sources 2 mib exceeded its otc in the reservoir at utility a

only two compounds 2 mib and geosmin were detected above their otcs in poe samples 2 mib was detected in the poe samples of utilities a and b with its highest concentration reaching 111 ng l at utility b in october 136 ng l in the corresponding raw sample while geosmin was detected at a concentration up to 15 ng l at utility a in july 70 ng l in the corresponding raw sample the odor activity values of detected compounds were calculated from detected concentration odor threshold concentration to determine the intensity of odors with respect to their threshold values wang et al 2020 co occurrence of t o compounds with toxin producing cyanobacterial species has been documented by various studies on midwestern lakes and reservoirs graham et al 2010 loftin et al 2016 shang et al 2018 watson et al 2008 while 2 mib and geosmin are produced by various cyanobacteria algae diatoms and actinomycetes bacteria such as streptomyces β cyclocitral is a metabolite mainly produced by microcystis a cyanobacterial species huang et al 2018 jüttner and watson 2007 lee et al 2017 microcystis also produces harmful cyanotoxins called microcystins that can have severe impact on human and animal life upon consumption in our study raw samples from a reservoir utility e with high concentrations of β cyclocitral up to 1 300 ng l also contained elevated concentrations of microcystins in the range of 0 4 5 µg l above the 10 day epa health advisory levels infants 0 3 µg l adults 1 6 µg l http water epa gov drink standards hascience cfm another river source utility b was detected with high levels of both β cyclocitral 1 255 ng l and microcystins 0 7 µg l β cyclocitral was suggested as a biomarker thus a potential indicator for the presence of toxin producing cyanobacterial species jones and korth 1995 watson et al 2008 however further research is needed to establish the statistical significance if a correlation between the occurrence of β cyclocitral and microcystins exists 4 conclusions based on the results of this study the following conclusions were drawn an advanced analytical method was developed based on spme and gc ms ms to detect 18 t o compounds including 2 mib and geosmin which can be implemented by water utilities to monitor for t o events the method detection limits were near or below otcs for most compounds except for 2 6 nd the method was quantitative for 17 compounds and semi quantitative for dmts sample preparation and spme method were optimized by studying the impact of salt content extraction time extraction temperature desorption temperature and desorption time a 40 w v of salt with 15 mins of extraction time at 55 c and 2 mins of desorption at 250 c were chosen as optimum spme conditions for maximizing recoveries the compounds were studied for their stability in raw and poe water matrices for the raw water the holding time for certain aldehydes ketones and esters was less than 96hours while for pyrazines and anisoles it was 2 weeks 2 mib and geosmin had acceptable recoveries at least up to 1 week the results and published literature suggest that hydrolysis is the major reason for the degradation of most of the compounds preservation of samples using acid hcl extended the holding times of aldehydes ketones and esters the occurrence study conducted with 13 drinking water utilities provided valuable insights into frequently occurring t o compounds other than 2 mib and geosmin including β cyclocitral β ionone dmds dmts indole and hexanal five of the compounds were present at concentrations above their otcs in the raw water while two of them 2 mib and geosmin were detected above otcs in the poe samples declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this study was supported and funded by american

19967,taste and odor t o issues have been a major concern among drinking water utilities as source waters are becoming increasingly vulnerable to compounds released during algal blooms as well as non algal compounds while most of the literature focuses on the two most common t o compounds 2 mib and geosmin there are other compounds that have the potential to cause t o events the aim of this study was to develop an advanced analytical method using solid phase microextraction spme and gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry gc ms ms to identify 18 t o compounds belonging to various odor classes the developed method was optimized for the 18 analytes and implemented to determine the holding time of the compounds in raw and treated distribution system point of entry or poe drinking water matrices compounds belonging to certain classes such as pyrazines and anisoles were found to be stable 30 loss in all tested waters for up to two weeks while aldehydes ketones esters and alkyl sulfides showed 30 loss within 96 h in raw water preservation of samples at low ph 2 using hydrochloric acid increased the holding times and reduced losses within 96 h for aldehydes ketones and esters the paper also discusses the occurrence of these compounds with water utilities from the midwest and eastern us during the summer months the study detected eight t o compounds 2 mib geosmin β cyclocitral β ionone hexanal indole dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide while five compounds were detected above their threshold concentrations in the raw water two of them 2 mib and geosmin were detected above threshold in the poe samples keywords taste and odor compounds drinking water spme gc ms ms holding time t o occurrence 1 introduction semi volatile and volatile organic compounds are released either naturally e g cyanobacteria algae and bacteria or anthropogenically e g chemical spills into source waters and can cause taste and odor t o issues in drinking water guo et al 2016 lu et al 2012 peter and von gunten 2007 these compounds alter the characteristics of drinking water such as smell and taste making the water unpleasant to drink and are not always effectively removed during conventional treatment this impacts customer confidence in water quality and poses a major problem to the water treatment industry zamyadi et al 2015 most laboratories in the us that conduct chemical analysis for t o compounds rely on the standard method 6040d that has been validated for detecting three t o compounds 2 mib geosmin and isopropyl methoxypyrazine ipmp t o events from algal blooms have been reported for decades but there is an increase in their frequency that could be attributed to changes in climatic conditions and increasing agricultural run offs carrying nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus anderson et al 2002 huang et al 2018 in addition to 2 mib and geosmin several potential t o compounds are released from blooms chemical spills and wastewater effluents bruchet et al 2007 it is important for drinking water utilities to identify and understand the stability and treatability of emerging non mib geosmin compounds so that the utilities are prepared to respond to t o events while a majority of t o events are caused by compounds released from algal blooms and decay of dead matter in aquatic ecosystems events have been reported to occur because of compounds that are formed during treatment such as disinfection byproducts dbps and compounds that are formed within the distribution system watson et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 industrial spills and releases to the environment are another source of synthetic organic compounds that contribute to occasional t o episodes compounds such as dioxanes and dioxolanes have been reported previously to have caused t o events and were associated with effluents from resin manufacturing plants boleda et al 2007 bruchet et al 2007 quintana et al 2016 romero et al 1998 2 mib and geosmin are earthy musty compounds that have very low odor threshold concentrations otc of 2 15 ng l and 4 ng l respectively and are detected in surface waters with algal bacterial and phytoplankton growth table 1 other compounds that cause t o issues have been documented in various case studies where customers have reported swampy septic fishy rancid chlorinous and vegetable odors guo et al 2019 ma et al 2011 2013 zhang et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 fishy rancid odors have been reported to be caused by aldehydes such as 2 4 heptadienal 2 4 hd while cucumber odor is caused by 2 6 nonadienal 2 6 nd and grassy vegetable lettuce odor by hexanal zhao et al 2013 septic and swampy odors have been linked with hydrogen sulfide dimethyl sulfide dms dimethyl disulfide dmds dimethyl trisulfide dmts and indole that are formed primarily because of decaying biomass chen et al 2010 feng et al 2018 guo et al 2019 musty corky flavors were observed during the formation of 2 4 6 trichloroanisole 2 4 6 tca 2 3 6 trichloroanisole 2 3 6 tca and 2 4 6 tribromoanisole 2 4 6 tba in the distribution systems from biomethylation of dbps chlorophenol and bromophenol byrd 2017 lee et al 2017 β cyclocitral and β ionone are algal and cyanobacterial metabolites and have been reported to co occur along with toxins released by cyanobacterial species graham et al 2010 huang et al 2018 jones and korth 1995 pyrazines although less frequently detected than 2 mib and geosmin have been included in various t o studies for their low threshold concentrations in the ng l range chen et al 2010 deng et al 2011 peter and von gunten 2007 isopropyl methoxy pyrazine ipmp is a microbial metabolite released by actinomycetes species while isobutyl methoxy pyrazine ibmp is commonly associated with the degradation of microbial biomass in natural waters khiari et al 1997 peter et al 2009 in addition grassy odors have been identified in water sources caused by compounds such as cis 3 hexenyl acetate c3ha and cis 3 hexen 1 ol c3ho which have otc values that are 3 5 orders of magnitude higher table 1 than pyrazines and anisoles khiari et al 1999 peter and von gunten 2007 suffet et al 2004 as water temperature increases during the summer months the odor threshold values might be lower than the otcs reported in table 1 whelton and dietrich 2004 the most important tool needed for monitoring and preventing t o issues is a robust analytical method for the detection of compounds near or below their otc values table 1 the detection of t o compounds is typically conducted using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms olfactory gc ms and sensory techniques such as flavor profile analysis and threshold odor number bruchet 2019 chen et al 2013 dietrich et al 2003 suffet et al 2004 although gc ms has been widely used for chemical analyses using tandem mass spectrometry ms ms was shown to have greater sensitivity by reducing background noise and improving signal to noise ratios wang et al 2019 for sample preparation several extraction techniques have been used such as solid phase extraction stir bar sorptive adsorption closed loop stripping analysis purge and trap headspace sampling and solid phase microextraction spme studies reported that headspace spme showed minimal interferences compared to other techniques thus resulting in better reproducibility and high sensitivity in the ng l range chen et al 2013 furtula et al 2004 godayol et al 2011 watson et al 2000 ma et al 2011 developed a spme method coupled with gc ms to quantify six t o causing aldehydes released in natural waters by algal cultures lu et al 2012 studied the application of headspace spme and gc with flame photometric detection to analyze hyper eutrophic lake water samples and found five odorous sulfur compounds hydrogen sulfide methanethiol dms dmds and dmts numerous studies optimized spme and gc ms methods to improve the sensitivity and achieve lower detection limits ma et al 2012 and chen et al 2013 developed and optimized a gc ms method using headspace spme to detect 2 mib geosmin haloanisoles pyrazines and aldehydes both studies focused on the optimization of the spme method by studying the effects of different types of spme fibers and determined that the most efficient fiber was divinylbenzene carboxen polydimethylsiloxane dvb car pdms the higher efficiency of this dual coated fiber compared to other commercially available single coated fibers was because of the high affinity of the dvb phase for small alcohols the presence of the non polar pdms stationary phase for highly nonpolar compounds and the increased fiber surface area of highly porous car phase godayol et al 2011 ma et al 2012 watson et al 2000 these results are corroborated by zhang et al 2005 who compared six commercially available spme fibers and reported that the dvb car pdms fiber had the highest extraction efficiency in achieving method detection limits in the pg l range for 10 t o analytes though there have been several studies on identifying non mib geosmin compounds very few of them focused on a wide range of compounds from various odor classes furthermore there is a paucity of mechanistic studies to understand the stability of these compounds or lack thereof in environmental water matrices hence the aim of this study was to i develop and optimize an expanded and semi automated analytical method that can detect t o compounds across various odor classes having different odor thresholds ranging from ng l to µg l ii conduct holding time and preservation studies to understand the stability of these compounds in different water matrices and iii conduct an occurrence study with drinking water utilities across the midwest and eastern us during the summer and fall months 2

holding 10 ml samples for gc ms ms analysis agilent technologies usa 2 2 solid phase microextraction spme a semi automated method based on headspace spme was developed using ctc pal sample preparation and injection system ctc analytics switzerland with an agitator module for heating and a conditioning station spme extractions were conducted after conditioning the fibers for 6 hours at 270 c the fiber was also conditioned for 1 min before each extraction and 5 min after desorption the sample was first heated at 55 c for 4 min in the agitator module at 500 rpm following this the analytes were extracted from the sample by exposing the fiber in the headspace of the vial for 15 min while the sample was continuously heated and agitated at 55 c and 500 rpm the fiber was then desorbed for 2 min at 250 c in the injection port 2 2 1 spme optimization the optimal spme conditions were determined after studying the effect of various factors on compound extraction such as salt content in the samples extraction time extraction temperature desorption time and desorption gc inlet temperature the conditions were optimized one at a time by testing a range of values for each parameter

samples and calibration curves were prepared by adding 10 ml sample volume to the gc vial with 40 w v nacl and then were spiked with 25 ng l of internal standards istds n d8 and 2 4 6 tca d5 lab control standards were prepared with 25 ng l of istds in 10 ml milli q water and lab fortified matrix spikes were prepared with 25 ng l istds and 25 ng l of t o compounds in 10 ml samples external calibration curves were used for 15 compounds while for 2 4 6 tca 2 3 6 tca and 2 4 6 tba internal calibration curves were used with isotopically labelled 2 4 6 tca d5 all the compounds were calibrated over a range of 0 5 250 ng l except for five compounds with lower sensitivities hexanal c3ho c3ha 2 6 nd and indole that were calibrated over a range of 50 25 000 ng l 2 5 holding time study a preliminary set of experiments were designed and conducted to study the effect of holding time on the stability of the selected 18 t o compounds in three different matrices lab grade water milli q referred to as control surface water from the mississippi river collected at the intake of a local water utility referred to as raw and the treated water collected post disinfection at the entry point into the distribution system referred to as point of entry or poe the utility has a conventional treatment train the raw water has an average ph of 8 3 turbidity average 50 ntu alkalinity 140 180 mg l as caco3 total organic carbon toc 5 6 mg l while poe has an average ph of 7 5 turbidity 0 3 ntu alkalinity 130 160 mg l as caco3 toc 3 4 mg l water samples were collected 1 2 hours prior to the start of the experiments in amber glass bottles sodium thiosulfate was added at a concentration of 75 mg l to quench chlorine disinfectant residual in the water samples compounds with lower sensitivity c3ho c3ha hexanal 2 6 nd and indole were spiked at 2 500 ng l while the others were spiked at 100 ng l after spiking the samples were transferred into 40 ml amber glass vials without headspace 2 5 1 effect of holding time to study the impact of storage on the stability of the compounds a range of holding times were selected that are typical for utilities and laboratories during sampling and storage ranging from short to long periods 0 h 24 h 48 h 72 h 96 h 168 h 1 week and 336 h 2 weeks samples at each time point were analyzed in triplicates 2 5 2 effect of preservatives to study the effect of different preservation techniques pre salting and acid preservation were tested for these experiments raw and poe samples were spiked at concentrations mentioned in section 2 5 and stored in vials with preservatives 16 g of nacl for pre salting to maintain salt concentration at 40 w v and 4 5 drops 1 1 hcl for acid preservation ph 2 per 40 ml vial samples were analyzed in triplicates at set holding times as mentioned in section 2 5 1 acidified samples were neutralized with 3 w v of sodium bicarbonate prior to analysis on the gc ms ms 2 6 occurrence study for the occurrence study raw and poe samples were collected over a period of four months in 2019 from 13 drinking water utilities table 2 samples were collected bi weekly shipped to the laboratory overnight and stored at 4 c until analysis samples were analyzed within 72 h whenever possible to minimize the holding time to determine the effect of water quality on compound recoveries lab fortified matrix spikes were prepared as described in section 2 4 for every raw and poe sample analyzed 3 results and discussion 3 1 method optimization the method precision was determined from triplicate analyses during the holding time study and the average relative standard deviation rsd was between 2 20 method detection limits for most compounds were below their corresponding odor threshold concentrations with the optimized spme and gc ms ms method table 1 the compound peak responses were evaluated for determining optimum values of each of the spme parameters tested salt content extraction time extraction temperature desorption time and desorption temperature the optimum values for individual t o compounds are shown in si table s2 3 1 1 salt content one of the most significant factors for extraction efficiency was the salt content of the sample as demonstrated in this study as well as previous spme studies furtula et al 2004 ma et al 2012 watson et al 2000 peak responses of all the 18 compounds increased proportionally with an increase in the salt concentration from 0 to 40 w v si fig s1 chen et al 2013 and lu et al 2012 reported similar increase in recoveries resulting from the increase in the ionic strength of the sample thus reducing the solubility of the compounds by increasing their partition coefficients however a further increase from 40 w v to 60 w v led to a decrease in the peak responses of six compounds β ionone indole dmds dmts c3ha and emd by 25 62 ma et al 2012 reported a decrease in compound recoveries at salt concentrations higher than 30 w v and hypothesized that the undissolved nacl under saturated conditions might adsorb the compounds hence for the compounds in this study 40 w v nacl was the optimum concentration 3 1 2 extraction time the peak responses for all 18 compounds increased with extraction times up to 15 min and slightly increased at 20 min chen et al 2013 showed that extraction time had a lesser impact on spme efficiency than extraction temperature salt content or agitation rate hence to keep the sample run time as short as possible an extraction time of 15 min was chosen for the rest of the study 3 1 3 extraction temperature the change in peak responses with temperature from 45 75 c varied among the compounds the peak responses decreased rapidly with increasing temperature for volatile compounds such as dimethyl sulfides i e dmds and dmts while semi volatile compounds while compounds such as β cyclocitral β ionone indole geosmin and pyrazines showed an increase in peak responses with temperature up to 65 c table s2 godayol et al 2011 and chen et al 2013 reported that high extraction temperatures might have a negative effect on recovery of highly volatile compounds as the fiber starts desorbing to maximize peak responses and minimize losses of highly volatile and semi volatile compounds the final extraction temperature was set at 55 c 3 1 4 desorption time the effect of desorption time was studied at 1 2 4 and 6 min the peak responses remained consistent with a low variation 15 between 1 and 6 min to keep the sample run time short the desorption time was set at 2 min 3 1 5 desorption temperature the desorption temperature gc inlet temperature is a critical parameter that impacts the partition of compounds from the solid phase fiber coating into the gaseous phase out of the four temperatures tested 225 c 235 c 250 c and 265 c the optimum temperature was found to be 250 c table s2 except for a few compounds such as β ionone c3ho emd hexanal and indole all the other compounds had maximum peak responses at 250 c hence this temperature was used for the rest of the study 3 2 holding time study the optimized method was used to study the stability and holding times of the t o compounds as described in section 2 4 the raw and poe samples spiked with t o compounds showed varying stability over time depending on the physical and chemical properties of the compounds compound recoveries between 70 130 were considered acceptable in accordance with the standard method guidelines for lab fortified sample matrices method 6040d standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater https www nemi gov methods method summary 5720 the holding times for the compounds determined in this study based on acceptable recoveries are summarized in table 3 3 2 1 stability of compounds in raw water the holding time study with raw water resulted in acceptable recoveries 70 for compounds such as geosmin 2 6 nd c3ho indole β cyclocitral and β ionone for the first 96 h but the recoveries decreased later in the 1 week and 2 weeks samples fig 1 compounds such as dmts had acceptable recoveries only at 0 h and decreased below 70 thereafter while hexanal had acceptable recoveries up to 8 h and 2 4 hd and c3ha up to 24 h fig 1 very few studies discuss the behavior of aldehydes esters and dimethyl sulfides in natural water matrices and the possible reasons for their losses some suggest that the reactive carbonyl group c o present in these compounds could participate in nucleophilic addition reactions in the presence of hydroxide oh ions in mildly alkaline waters resulting in the hydrolysis of the compounds chen et al 2013 sugaya et al 2004 sugaya et al 2004 indicated that the reactivity of the carbonyl group increases as the alkyl group size decreases the faster loss of 2 4 hd with time compared to more stable 2 6 nd fig 1 in this study was consistent with the observations by sugaya et al 2004 the reactions involving carbonyl groups in esters and aldehydes are often ph and temperature dependent khiari et al 1999 showed the degradation of c3ha in alkaline surface waters during storage even at 4 c it is hypothesized that hydrolysis in alkaline ph could be the cause for degradation of 2 4 hd and hexanal observed in our study the alkyl sulfide dmts experienced higher losses than the aldehydes and esters with a 50 loss within 24 h han et al 2017 showed that the dimethyl sulfides can undergo hydrolysis in natural water matrices however dmts showed a similar loss in the control sample as well suggesting that the compound is susceptible to loss in water regardless of ph and the presence of natural organic matter nom the haloanisoles 2 4 6 tca 2 3 6 tca and 2 4 6 tba showed consistent recoveries of above 90 for up to two weeks these compounds contain an ether functional group which is not susceptible to hydrolysis like the carbonyl group compounds such as 2 mib ipmp ibmp and dmds were stable for the duration of the study fig 1 geosmin was stable up to one week with a loss of only 12 observed in the 1 week samples which was similar to the losses reported in the studies by korth et al 1992 and zhang et al 2010 on stability of geosmin in water samples both 2 mib and geosmin are tertiary alcohols that are less vulnerable to nucleophilic attacks in alkaline waters compared to compounds such as aldehydes and ketones methoxypyrazines ipmp and ibmp are also very persistent compounds which makes their removal difficult in the wine industry where they are frequently detected reynolds 2010 3 2 1a effect of acid preservation samples preserved with acid 1 1 hcl showed higher stability for esters aldehydes alcohols and ketones such as hexanal c3ho 2 4 hd c3ha β cyclocitral indole geosmin and β ionone fig 2 while the holding time of 2 4 hd was only 24 h in the non preserved raw water it increased up to 1 week in acidified raw water fig 2 similarly there was an increase in holding times of c3ha 2 4 hd and hexanal which had recoveries above 90 up to 1 week the recoveries of compounds c3ho geosmin β cyclocitral and β ionone also increased by 10 50 in the 2 week samples of acidified raw water compared to the non acidified raw water fig 2 the impact of acid preservation on the stability of esters aldehydes and sulfides has been discussed in previous studies such as with c3ha and dmds han et al 2017 khiari et al 1999 as the studies showed faster degradation of the two compounds with increasing ph decreasing the ph thus may hinder the hydrolysis and extend their holding times the only compound out of acceptable recovery range in both non preserved raw and acidified raw water was dmts which showed 50 loss within 24 h in both the cases figs 1 and 2 while acid preservation improved the recoveries of most compounds 2 mib and emd were negatively impacted fig 2 previous studies that reported loss of 2 mib at low ph had attributed it to the dehydration of the tertiary alcohol in acidic environments bu et al 2017 hsieh et al 2012 similarly acid catalyzed hydrolysis mechanisms were discussed in the case of dioxolanes which could be the cause of loss of emd fife and natarajan 1986 while a few other compounds such as geosmin ipmp and ibmp were also impacted by acid addition the reactions were reversed after neutralizing the acidified samples with sodium bicarbonate 3 2 1b effect of pre salting effect of pre salting was also studied during a separate experiment to understand the impacts of salt as a preservative in the raw water recoveries in pre salted samples of spiked raw water i e the samples stored with 40 w v nacl increased the recovery of dmts by 60 compared to non preserved raw water however the compound recovery still did not exceed 70 data not shown the impact of pre salting on the recoveries of other compounds was negligible satchwill et al 2007 evaluated pre salting of natural waters and reported no improvement in stability of t o compounds 3 3 2 stability of compounds in poe water most compounds that had low recoveries in raw water had greater recoveries in the poe samples with minor losses in the range of 2 20 even after 2 weeks si figs s2 and s3 however the recovery of dmts dropped below 70 after 48 h while 2 6 nd was above 70 for only up to 1 week other compounds including the aldehydes and ketones such as hexanal c3ha c3ho 2 4 hd and 2 6 nd were stable for 2 weeks with recoveries above 80 the average ph of poe water from the drinking water treatment plant was 7 5 the near neutral ph of the poe water and negligible matrix effects could be the reason for increased stability of compounds that experienced losses in mildly alkaline and nom rich raw water the results from the poe samples showed a similar trend to those observed in the control water for most compounds with the exception of 2 6 nd of the 18 compounds tested in the control water 17 compounds had recoveries greater than 70 for 2 weeks while the only compound dmts showed significant losses within 96 h similar to the observations in poe water the acidification of poe water and control water did not show any improvement in the recovery of dmts si fig s3 3 4 occurrence study the raw and poe samples collected from different treatment utilities across the midwest and eastern us were detected with non mib geosmin t o compounds such as β cyclocitral β ionone dmds and dmts and occasionally indole and hexanal table 4 most compounds detected above otcs in raw samples were from reservoir and lake sources 2 mib exceeded its otc in the reservoir at utility a geosmin in 3 reservoirs utilities a d and e a lake utility i and a river utility j β cyclocitral in a reservoir utility e dmds in a reservoir utility a and dmts in two reservoirs utilities a and e only two compounds 2 mib and geosmin were detected above their otcs in poe samples 2 mib was detected in the poe samples of utilities a and b with its highest concentration reaching 111 ng l at utility b in october 136 ng l in the corresponding raw sample while geosmin was detected at a concentration up to 15 ng l at utility a in july 70 ng l in the corresponding raw sample the odor activity values of detected compounds were calculated from detected concentration odor threshold concentration to determine the intensity of odors with respect to their threshold values wang et al 2020 co occurrence of t o compounds with toxin producing cyanobacterial species has been documented by various studies on midwestern lakes and reservoirs graham et al 2010 loftin et al 2016 shang et al 2018 watson et al 2008 while 2 mib and geosmin are produced by various cyanobacteria algae diatoms and actinomycetes bacteria such as streptomyces β cyclocitral is a metabolite mainly produced by microcystis a cyanobacterial species huang et al 2018 jüttner and watson 2007 lee et al 2017 microcystis also produces harmful cyanotoxins called microcystins that can have severe impact on human and animal life upon consumption in our study raw samples from a reservoir utility e with high concentrations of β cyclocitral up to 1 300 ng l also contained elevated concentrations of microcystins in the range of 0 4 5 µg l above the 10 day epa health advisory levels infants 0 3 µg l adults 1 6 µg l http water epa gov drink standards hascience cfm another river source utility b was detected with high levels of both β cyclocitral 1 255 ng l and microcystins 0 7 µg l β cyclocitral was suggested as a biomarker thus a potential indicator for the presence of toxin producing cyanobacterial species jones and korth 1995 watson et al 2008 however further research is needed to establish the statistical significance if a correlation between the occurrence of β cyclocitral and microcystins exists 4 conclusions based on the results of this study the following conclusions were drawn an advanced analytical method was developed based on spme and gc ms ms to detect 18 t o compounds including 2 mib and geosmin which can be implemented by water utilities to monitor for t o events the method detection limits were near or below otcs for most compounds except for 2 6 nd the method was quantitative for 17 compounds and semi quantitative for dmts sample preparation and spme method were optimized by studying the impact of salt content extraction time extraction temperature desorption temperature and desorption time a 40 w v of salt with 15 mins of extraction time at 55 c and 2 mins of desorption at 250 c were chosen as optimum spme conditions for maximizing recoveries the compounds were studied for their stability in raw and poe water matrices for the raw water the holding time for certain aldehydes ketones and esters was less than 96hours while for pyrazines and anisoles it was 2 weeks 2 mib and geosmin had acceptable recoveries at least up to 1 week the results and published literature suggest that hydrolysis is the major reason for the degradation of most of the compounds preservation of samples using acid hcl extended the holding times of aldehydes ketones and esters the occurrence study conducted with 13 drinking water utilities provided valuable insights into frequently occurring t o compounds other than 2 mib and geosmin including β cyclocitral β ionone dmds dmts indole and hexanal five of the compounds were present at concentrations above their otcs in the raw water while two of them 2 mib and geosmin were detected above otcs in the poe samples declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this study was supported and funded by american

19968,wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 rna is increasingly being incorporated into public health efforts to respond to the covid 19 pandemic in order to obtain the maximum benefit from these efforts approaches to wastewater monitoring need to be rapid sensitive and relatable to relevant epidemiological parameters in this study we present an ultracentrifugation based method for the concentration of sars cov 2 wastewater rna and use crassphage a bacteriophage specific to the human gut to help account for rna loss during transit in the wastewater system and sample processing with these methods we were able to detect and sometimes quantify sars cov 2 rna from 20 ml wastewater samples within as little as 4 5 hours using known concentrations of bovine coronavirus rna and deactivated sars cov 2 we estimate recovery rates of approximately 7 12 of viral rna using our method results from 24 sewersheds across upstate new york during the spring and summer of 2020 suggested that stronger signals of sars cov 2 rna from wastewater may be indicative of greater covid 19 incidence in the represented service area approximately one week in advance sars cov 2 wastewater rna was quantifiable in some service areas with daily positives tests of less than 1 per 10 000 people or when weekly positive test rates within a sewershed were as low as 1 7 crassphage dna concentrations were significantly lower during periods of high flow in almost all areas studied after accounting for flow rate and population served crassphage levels per capita were estimated to be about 1 35 1011 and 2 42 108 genome copies per day for dna and rna respectively a negative relationship between per capita crassphage rna and service area size was also observed likely reflecting degradation of rna over long transit times our results reinforce the potential for wastewater surveillance to be used as a tool to supplement understanding of infectious disease transmission obtained by traditional testing and highlight the potential for crassphage co detection to improve interpretations of wastewater surveillance data graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater based epidemiology viral concentration cross assembly phage sars cov 2 1 introduction severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 has infected over 130 million people and has been attributed to over 2 8 million deaths globally as of april 9th 2021 who 2021 while the primary mechanism of transmission for sars cov 2 is through respiratory droplets and aerosols meselson 2020 viral rna has also been detected in the gastrointestinal system feces and urine of infected persons chen et al 2020 y wu et al 2020 singer and wray 2020 notably viral rna levels in the sputum and stool of patients with mild covid 19 symptoms are similar to that found in the upper respiratory tract wölfel et al 2020 the presence of a substantial quantity of viral rna in feces and urine provides the opportunity for wastewater based epidemiology wbe approaches to be applied to the surveillance of covid 19 tracking the emergence of disease and transmission trends over time daughton 2020 farkas et al 2020 such monitoring efforts are currently being explored worldwide in an attempt to bolster the public health response to the pandemic a robust and effective wastewater monitoring program for sars cov 2 could help to inform resource allocation decisions e g where to prioritize testing and contact tracing target community interventions such as social distancing measures or other restrictions and provide an additional tool by which policy makers could assess when and how to reopen local economies mallapaty 2020 larsen et al 2020 daughton 2020 additionally an effective wastewater monitoring approach could be used in the surveillance of facilities such as jails university dormitories colosi et al 2020 and assisted living facilities which may be especially susceptible to covid 19 outbreaks providing officials with the tools to limit the spread of the virus both within and from these types of facilities numerous groups have reported methods for the detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater following global outbreaks of covid 19 in early 2020 these approaches to concentrate viral particles and rna have included combinations of low speed centrifugation and centrifugal filters medema et al 2020 ahmed et al 2020a nemudryi et al 2020b alpaslan kocamemi et al 2020 polyethylene glycol peg precipitation zhang et al 2020 alpaslan kocamemi et al 2020 f wu et al 2020b la rosa et al 2020 colosi et al 2020 aluminum driven flocculation randazzo et al 2020 filtration through charged membranes ahmed et al 2020a colosi et al 2020 and ultracentrifugation wurtzer et al 2020 ampuero et al 2020 colosi et al 2020 while many of these methods can be applied to wastewater surveillance with varying degrees of success as reviewed in kitajima et al 2020 ahmed et al 2020b rusiñol et al 2020 colosi et al 2020 their practical application into large scale monitoring efforts can be limited by factors such as turnaround time i e the time from sample acquisition to data generation and dependence on supply chain continuity for single use materials such as charged membranes or centrifugal filtration units ultracentrifugation is an attractive approach because once the initial investment in equipment is made the material cost and sample processing time are low furthermore the ability to manipulate the amount and viscosity of the sedimentation medium as well as the ultracentrifugation time and speed permit partial nucleic acid purification concurrent with concentration while several studies have found correlations between viral concentrations in wastewater and the number of confirmed covid 19 cases nemudryi et al 2020a bar or et al 2020 ampuero et al 2020 attempts at quantifying the numbers of infected individuals have varied in their success medema et al 2020 ahmed et al 2020a f wu et al 2020a vallejo et al 2020 several studies have also indicated that wastewater monitoring of sars cov 2 could provide an early warning sign for viral outbreaks in the community with viral rna being detected in wastewater samples prior to positive clinical testing of individuals medema et al 2020 la rosa et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 with either approach some measure of the effects of decay and dilution in the wastewater infrastructure is needed so that changes in sars cov 2 rna over time or between sampling locations better reflect changes in infection levels versus changes in weather water usage or other factors co quantification of viruses that are abundant in the human gut such as pepper mild mottle virus pmmov d aoust et al 2021b f wu et al 2020b to act as surrogates for sars cov 2 is the prevailing approach although it is not completely clear which surrogates mimic the behavior of sars cov 2 in the wastewater system most closely furthermore for surrogates with a dna genome expressed rna can simultaneously be measured which may more closely reflect the decay of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater compared to dna targets non viral surrogates such as nicotine cortisol and creatinine have also been proposed as normalizers in wbe applications although the quantification of these targets may be challenging and variability in consumption and disposal rates can create uncertainties in analysis polo et al 2020 rico et al 2017 in this study our goals were to a develop a reliable and scalable method for detecting and quantifying sars cov 2 wastewater rna from areas with low infection rates and b integrate co quantification of viral nucleic acids from crassphage an abundant human gut bacteriophage into sars cov 2 wastewater monitoring to help account for sources of both inter and intra sewershed variability we measured both crassphage dna and rna because it is currently unclear which serves as a better fecal normalizer when trying to associate sars cov 2 wastewater rna concentrations to relevant epidemiological parameters ultracentrifugation optimization trials were initially conducted prior to analyzing 181 wastewater influent samples collected from six upstate new york counties 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling locations and sample collection and transport twenty four hour composite influent wastewater samples 110 ml 1 9 l were collected from 28 different access points in combined sewage networks across upstate new york in onondaga cayuga cortland tompkins oswego and warren counties table 1 figure s1 information on the age of wastewater in these systems was only available for six onondaga county access points table s1 where mean transit time ranged from 1 2 to 4 4 hours wang et al 2020 samples were stored at approximately 4 c following collection and were transported on ice to upstate medical university syracuse ny the following morning for processing and viral concentration with the exception of onondaga county samples collected on the 28th of april which were frozen at 20 c for processing at a later date following methodological optimizations from april 28th to june 24th 2020 a total of 181 wastewater samples were collected and processed for the detection of sars cov 2 and crassphage nucleic acids during the sample collection process influent flow rate ph and water temperature were also measured at some access points average daily minimum air temperature in each county during this time period ranged from 9 2 to 14 6 c average daily maximum air temperature ranged from 21 8 to 25 9 c average daily precipitation ranged from 0 07 to 0 21 cm and daily relative humidity ranged from 36 to 86 noaa information on the topographical area of each sewershed was accessed through new york state and or county databases and the size of the population served was estimated using census data characteristics of individual access points within each county are summarized in table s1 2 2 ultracentrifugation of wastewater through a sucrose cushion prior to ultracentrifugation wastewater samples were blended to resuspend particulates that had settled during transport or storage twenty milliliters were transferred into a

2 3 a 12 ml sucrose cushion 50 sucrose in tne buffer 20 mm tris hcl ph 7 0 100 mm nacl 2 mm edta was then carefully added underneath the wastewater using a serological pipette so that wastewater and the sucrose solution formed distinct layers in the ultracentrifuge tube fig 1 a in batches of six samples were balanced by the addition of distilled water 500 μl and then ultracentrifuged at 150 000 g at 4 c on a sorvall wx ultra series with a sorvall surespin 630 6 36 ml swinging bucket rotor thermofisher prepared samples were ultracentrifuged for 45 minutes unless otherwise noted for optimization experiments following ultracentrifugation and the generation of pellets containing viral particles and nucleic acids fig 1b the supernatant was carefully decanted with a new serological pipette and pellets were resuspended in 200 μl 1x pbs and transferred to 1 7 ml microcentrifuge tubes resuspended pellets were stored at 20 c for 24 hours until nucleic acid extraction replicates were processed for optimization experiments only 2 3 optimization of viral nucleic acid recovery samples collected from onondaga county on april 28th may 6th and may 13th 2020 were used to perform optimization experiments to identify sucrose concentrations and ultracentrifugation times that resulted in higher levels of viral nucleic acid recovery we used crassphage as a surrogate since native sars cov 2 concentrations were too low to be used as reliable indicator of recovery first well blended wastewater subsamples were ultracentrifuged with 20 50 and 70 sucrose cushions for 20 90 and 120 minutes respectively with lower concentration cushions receiving shorter ultracentrifugation times pellets were then analyzed for crassphage dna next once the optimal sucrose concentration was identified we tested the effect of reducing ultracentrifugation time by making six replicate subsamples and ultracentrifuging for 30 n 2 45 n 2 and 75 minutes n 2 while holding sucrose concentration constant pellets were then analyzed for both crassphage dna and rna then to estimate the efficiency with which sars cov 2 rna is pelleted 20 ml wastewater aliquots n 2 with low initial concentrations of sars cov 2 rna appx 8 genome copies per ml were spiked spike equivalent to appx 580 genome copies per ml wastewater with heat deactivated sars cov 2 catalog no nr 52286 bei resources virginia usa prior to

homogenized samples originating from several access points were spiked with appx 125 000 genome copies of bovine coronavirus bcov rna extracted from a vaccine bovine rotavirus coronavirus vaccine from zoetis nj usa extraction of total nucleic acids from wastewater pellets was carried out by the method described below bcov rna concentrations were determined via rt qpcr using a previously published assay decaro et al 2008 table s2 in routine processing deactivated sars cov 2 and bovine coronavirus vaccine were not used to estimate nucleic acid recoveries instead crassphage was used to confirm recovery of nucleic acids and as a fecal normalizer for sars cov 2 2 4 nucleic acid extraction and synthesis of crassphage cdna total nucleic acids were extracted from resuspended pellets using the allprep powerviral dna rna kit qiagen hilden germany according to manufacturer s protocol with the omission of the optional bead beating step nucleic acids were eluted in 50 μl elution buffer five of which was used immediately to generate total cdna using the quantitect reverse transcription kit qiagen according to manufacturer s protocol to allow estimation of crassphage rna total nucleic acid samples and cdna were immediately stored at 80 c until viral quantification via rt qpcr and qpcr 2 5 quantification of viral nucleic acids rt qpcr was used to detect the presence of sars cov 2 rna in undiluted total nucleic acid extracts using a multiplex reaction with the previously published ip2 and ip4 assays targeting separate regions of the rdrp gene institut pasteur 2020 reactions consisted of 6 25 μl reliance one step multiplex rt qpcr supermix bio rad california usa 0 4 μm each primer 160 nm each probe both hex molecular grade water and 2 5 μl nucleic acid template for a total reaction volume of 25 μl thermal cycling conditions were 10 minutes at 50 c 10 minutes at 95 c followed by 45 cycles of 95 c for 10 seconds and 59 c for 30 seconds crassphage nucleic acids were quantified using the previously published cpq 056 assay stachler et al 2017 reactions consisted of 12 5 μl taqman environmental mastermix thermofisher 1 μm primers 80 nm probe molecular grade water and 2 μl

from 1 106 to 5 copies per reaction of a diluted gblock idt iowa usa containing targets for the ip2ip4 assay or diluted purified crassphage amplicons produced with dna clean and concentratortm 25 zymo usa was used to convert ct values to gene copies per reaction nucleic acid concentrations for gblocks and purified amplicons were measured using a qubit 3 0 fluorometer invitrogen allowing copy number to be determined from the known length of the amplicon or gblock samples were quantified using either pcr plate specific standard curves or a composite standard curve from recent plates table 2 all qpcr reactions were carried out on either quantstudio 3 or quantstudio 5 thermofisher real time pcr systems 2 6 quality assurance for all days on which wastewater samples were purified via ultracentrifugation at least one processing blank was prepared by processing 20 ml distilled water instead of wastewater and measuring levels of sars cov 2 rna crassphage dna and crassphage rna throughout the study 2 of 22 processing blanks contained quantifiable levels of crassphage dna mean ct 36 019 2 259 which was several orders of magnitude less than crassphage quantities obtained from wastewater influent samples mean ct 22 662 1 418 for sars cov 2 2 of 22 processing blanks showed some degree of amplification with one being quantifiable june 10th 2020 ct 35 637 0 192 appx 10 copies

from 9th and 10th of june 2020 were omitted from our analysis effectively reducing the number of samples analyzed from 181 to 169 for rt qpcr and qpcr plates contained at least three no template control ntc reactions throughout the study 1 of 128 0 8 ip2ip4 ntc wells amplified ct 40 957 and 9 of 198 4 5 of cpq 056 ntc wells amplified for cpq 056 six of these ntc amplifications occurred on may 11th 2020 on this plate wastewater samples had a mean cpq 056 ct of 23 350 and positive ntcs had a mean ct of 38 580 which suggests that contamination did not greatly affect estimates of crassphage from wastewater on this run therefore since the sole ip2ip4 ntc that showed amplification was 40 cycles and the few positive cpq 056 ntcs were largely isolated to one plate and represented dna quantities several orders of magnitude less than our wastewater nucleic acid extracts no data were excluded from analysis based on the assessment of ntcs kinetic outlier detection kod was performed as described previously green and field 2012 kirtane et al 2019 tichopad et al 2010 on all 3 032 reactions to determine if qpcr inhibition affected the amplification of sars cov 2 or crassphage nucleic acid targets raw fluorescence data from each well were log transformed and fit to a 4 parameter sigmoidal model using the pcrbatch function in r package qpcr version 1 4 1 ritz and spiess 2008 spiess 2018 we then estimated the first and second derivative maxima of each fitted model using a 10 ct difference between the first and second derivative maxima as a quality criterion i e uni2 criteria in function pcrbatch kod analysis indicated that all wells with a ct value 45 maximum possible ct value displayed no signs of inhibition inherent in these methods is the assumption that dna polymerase and reverse transcriptase are equally susceptible to pcr inhibitors nonetheless the total absence of signs of qpcr inhibition as indicated by sensitive kod methods suggests that the purification methods used were effective at removing compounds that commonly affect qpcr amplification 2 7 integration of covid 19 case data covid 19 testing data consisting of all diagnostic tests including pcr and antigen based methods were obtained from the electronic clinical laboratory reporting system eclrs nysdoh 2020a b all test results were classified as positive negative inconclusive or invalid after excluding tests for out of state residents all tests for covid 19 during the study period were geocoded using the new york state street address maintenance sam program nys street address mapping sam 2020 additional geocoding was performed with geocoders from sas and mapmarker to improve accuracy shape files of each service area were obtained from each corresponding municipality addresses occurring within the studied service areas were retained while addresses occurring outside the study area were excluded residences with private septics were identified using statewide tax parcel data from the new york state gis clearinghouse nys gis parcels 2020 any addresses with private septics which accounted for approximately 5 of covid 19 tests were excluded from the analysis a daily count of positive test results by service area was tabulated after excluding inconclusive or invalid results human subject involvement with regards to covid 19 diagnostic testing was approved by the new york state department of health s institutional review board 2 8 data interpretation and analysis to aid interpretation sars cov 2 wastewater rna levels were classified into three distinct categories prior to data analysis samples that had all three qpcr replicates amplify above the loq of 5 genome copies per reaction were classified as quantifiable because both assays were able to amplify 5 copies per reaction consistently samples that had at least one qpcr replicate amplify with a ct 40 were considered detected but not quantifiable dnq many of the samples classified as dnq had one or two qpcr replicates above the loq of 5 copies but were still conservatively classified as dnq for our analysis samples that had no amplification in any of the three wells i e all three wells were undetermined ct 45 were considered below the limits of detection blod i e a negative sample to facilitate comparison of crassphage concentrations between service areas we used prior 24 hour flow and population serviced to calculate a per capita crassphage nucleic acid load as follows p e r c a p i t a n u c l e i c a c i d l o a d g e n o m e c o p i e s p e r l i t e r x d a i l y f l o w l p o p u l a t i

significant differences in mean recovery using different sucrose concentrations and spin times conditional inference trees ctrees were developed using the partykit version 1 2 10 package in r version 1 2 5019 as done previously weller et al 2020 to assess the effects of service area size average influent temperature and ph on crassphage dna and rna concentrations r code available at https github com maxwell wilder co quantification of crassphage increases confidence in wastewater based epidemiology for sars cov 2 transit times were also used a predictor variable but only for sites 601 604 605 606 617 and 619 as available wang et al 2020 3 results 3 1 optimizing recovery of viral nucleic acids in an assessment of sucrose concentration and ultracentrifugation spin time we found that a 50 cushion paired with a 90 minute spin time yielded greater crassphage dna concentrations than both a 20 cushion paired with a 20 minute spin time and a 70 cushion paired with a 150 minute spin time p 0 05 table 3 we then assessed the impact of 30 45 and 75 minute spin times on crassphage nucleic acid recovery using a 50 sucrose cushion in an attempt to reduce processing time we found that while both 45 and 75 minute spin times yielded greater quantities of crassphage dna than a 30 minute spin p 0 01 table 4 there was no significant difference in crassphage dna recovery between 45 and 75 minute spins quantifiable amounts of crassphage rna were only recovered with a 45 minute spin time table 4 low quantities of crassphage rna dnq are potentially due to degradation as rna may have degraded while the wastewater sample was stored at 4 c for approximately 5 days because 75 minute and 45 minute spin times yielded similar results with 45 minutes being the only treatment to recover quantifiable crassphage rna we proceeded with this spin time for further experiments and the analysis of wastewater samples having determined an optimal sucrose concentration and ultracentrifugation time we then determined the approximate nucleic acid recovery for the total process using spiked heat deactivated sars cov 2 bei resources and native crassphage dna and rna as surrogates quantifiable levels of sars cov 2 rna and crassphage rna were found only in the pellet indicating that the majority of viral rna is likely pelleted under these conditions table 5 trace levels of rna recovered from the cushion interface sars cov 2 and in the sucrose layers crassphage suggest that low levels of sars cov 2 rna also remain unpelleted while quantifiable levels of crassphage dna were present in most layers post ultracentrifugation quantities found in the pellet were far greater than that of any other layer p 0 001 table 5 although the magnitude of crassphage dna recovered from the pellet varied significantly among the two replicates p 0 002 sars cov 2 rna recovery was not statistically different based on the amount initially spiked we estimated that 12 s d 5 5 of deactivated sars cov 2 rna was recovered after both ultracentrifugation and nucleic acid extraction processes a follow up experiment in which bcov rna was added to pellets resulted in an average extraction recovery of 6 89 s d 1 58 suggesting that the majority of nucleic acid loss in the total process occurred at the nucleic acid extraction step 3 2 abundance of sars cov 2 and crassphage in wastewater samples while the vast majority of crassphage dna and rna values fell within the quantifiable range most sars cov 2 rna levels were either dnq 49 or blod 34 table 6 we were able to detect or quantify sars cov 2 rna from wastewater in 111 of the 169 samples that were analyzed over the study period of these 111 samples 29 had quantifiable levels of sars cov 2 rna in these samples the average quantity of sars cov 2 rna recovered was 2 16 104 s d 2 11 104 genome copies per l of wastewater while the maximum observed quantity was 1 02 105 s d 7 96 103 genome copies per l of wastewater crassphage nucleic acids were quantifiable from the vast majority of wastewater samples table 6 over the course of the study period the average and maximum quantities of crassphage dna recovered were 2 05 108 s d 2 18 108 and 1 73 109 s d 7 72 107 genome copies per l of wastewater for crassphage rna the average and maximum quantities recovered were 4 00 105 s d 4 61 105 and 2 88 107 s d 1 47 105 genome copies per l 3 3 association between crassphage loads influent flow and population served we observed a significant negative relationship between crassphage concentrations detected and influent wastewater flow rates across all sites table s3 we selected six sites with the greatest number of sampling events n 9 each to look at this relationship on an individual basis and found significant negative relationships between crassphage dna concentration and flow but no significant relationship between crassphage rna concentration and flow potentially due to increased variability in crassphage rna measurements fig 2 table s3 lower crassphage concentrations during higher flow rates are likely attributable to wastewater dilution though sources such as groundwater infiltration and stormwater runoff although the relative contribution of these sources in each service area is difficult to quantify we also found significant relationships between crassphage dna and rna loads and the population served in each service area fig 3 3 4 variability in physical chemical parameters and crassphage loads between service areas at each site n 8 where temperature and flow data were recorded we observed a significant positive correlation between temperature and sampling date pearson s r 0 94 0 97 p 0 05 and significant negative correlation between flow and sampling date r 0 82 0 96 p 0 05 reflecting the change toward warmer dryer weather at facilities 605 and 606 we also observed a significant negative correlation between ph and both sampling date r 0 75 0 86 p 0 05 and water temperature r 0 76 0 88 p 0 05 but at other sites no significant correlation was observed on average estimated per capita crassphage contributions were 1 35 1011 genome copies per day std dev 1 99 1011 and 2 42 108 genome copies per day std dev 2 77 108 for dna and rna respectively fig 4 based on regression analysis we observed significantly lower per capita crassphage dna in service area 999a 4 85 1010 p 0 0365 compared to other sites we also observed significantly higher crassphage rna per capita in service area oswego w 2 86 1011 p 0 0165 compared to other sites based on a pairwise comparison of service areas no two sites had a significant difference in mean crassphage dna p 0 11 tukey hsd 95 ci or mean crassphage rna p 0 09 although the sample size table s1 is too low at most sites to conclude no difference in means using ctrees we found that some of this variability in per capita crassphage rna loads could be explained by service area size per capita crassphage rna loads were 2 09 108 gene copies higher in service areas smaller than 34 681 km2 fig 5 a similar association was not observed for per capita dna loads no significant splits were identified when using average influent temperature ph or transit time as predictors for dna or rna loads as outcomes 3 5 association between sars cov 2 concentrations and covid 19 incidence following wastewater sample collection over all study areas the highest positive test rates for which sars cov 2 rna remained blod corresponded to a weekly positive test rate of 12 4 and a weekly average of 2 19 daily positive tests per 10 000 population the highest weekly positive test rates for samples classified as blod or dnq were 20 9 or 3 97 daily positive tests per 10 000 population weekly positive test rates corresponding to quantifiable samples ranged from 1 68 15 11 or 0 37 5 95 daily positive tests per 10 000 population depending on the site from a qualitative perspective samples with quantifiable levels of sars cov 2 rna were associated with higher levels of positive test results the week following sampling fig 6 over the seven days following wastewater sample collection both the average number of new positive tests per 10 000 persons and the testing positivity rate were significantly higher in quantifiable samples than in samples classified as blod or dnq for sars cov 2 welch two sample t test p 0 001 samples classified as dnq also had significantly higher rates and case counts than blod samples welch two sample t test p 0 002 although the number of samples with quantifiable levels of sars cov 2 rna was limited n 29 we did observe a significant relationship between the ratio of sars cov 2 rna to crassphage dna p 0 005 r2 0 27 and the number of positive tests per 10 000 population this relationship was somewhat improved after excluding samples for which no crassphage rna was recovered p 0 004 r2 0 31 a similar association was found between the sars cov 2 crassphage dna ratio and the number of positive tests per 10 000 population the week following sampling p 0 003 r2 0 30 which also improved slightly after excluding samples with no recoverable crassphage rna p 0 004 r2 0 33 interestingly significant positive associations between ratios and test rates were identified only when testing was expressed as a proportion of the population served and not as a proportion of total tests conducted i e test positivity no significant linear associations were identified between sars cov 2 wastewater rna concentrations and epidemiological parameters without first normalizing to crassphage dna 4 discussion 4 1 advantages of ultracentrifugation through a sucrose cushion we developed a sensitive rapid and scalable method for the detection and quantification of sars cov 2 wastewater rna based on direct ultracentrifugation though a sucrose cushion inspired by the early results of wurtzer and colleagues wurtzer et al 2020 we sought to further capitalize on the ability of ultracentrifugation to remove low density contaminants that could potentially interfere with subsequent nucleic acid extraction and qpcr despite loss of rna in the extraction process we were able to quantify sars cov 2 in areas with less than 1 positive test per 10 000 individuals with this approach it is possible to obtain wastewater testing results for both sars cov 2 and crassphage within 4 5 hours of a sample being received the major limiting factor to this method is both ultracentrifuge availability and capacity as the rotor used here can hold only six samples however the use of small volumes of wastewater only 20 ml per sample provides advantages in terms of transport storage and biosafety although the use of larger volumes of wastewater may improve sensitivity other groups have since found the method to outperform other common concentration procedures for the analysis of wastewater from individual facilities colosi et al 2020 this sensitivity relatively quick turnaround time and limited dependence on supply chain continuity may be an attractive option for groups considering wastewater surveillance different concentration and nucleic acid extraction approaches should also be considered in an attempt to improve upon the 7 12 recovery that we estimated in this study while approaches other than ultracentrifugation have reported higher recovery rates and variable cost and processing times table s4 colosi and colleagues 2020 recently found sucrose cushion based ultracentrifugation using a fixed angle rotor which accommodates tubes with twice the sample volume used in this study and a nucleospin extraction kit to outperform both electropositive filtration and peg precipitation methods while the ultracentrifugation approach described by colosi et al 2020 demonstrated success it is difficult to compare our methodologies without a direct measurement of nucleic acid percent recovery results from optimization trials indicate that viral particles in wastewater exist in a mixture of states and a range of sedimentation properties that are likely to change from sample to sample more sensitive methods but also improved interpretation of wastewater surveillance data would be facilitated by a better understanding of the state of both sars cov 2 rna and surrogate nucleic acids within wastewater and specifically what proportion are a contained within viral particles b released and dissolved or c released and bound to other particles while some studies have explored viral associations to various wastewater particles in terms of size and charge da silva et al 2008 hejkal et al 1981 variability in particle association between different types of viruses chahal et al 2016 suggests that both sars cov 2 and surrogate viral particle associations may require specific study with an additional focus on the state s of nucleic acids if some dna or rna is bound knowing the size and mass of the particles and how they vary over time and across locations would greatly improve the precision of methods based on size e g ultrafiltration charge e g electropositive filtration or mass e g ultracentrifugation additionally variability in wastewater particle composition between service areas and or sampling locations may affect viral decay as different particle associations have been shown to impact the survival of pathogens as reviewed in chahal et al 2016 bivins et al 2020 estimated that 90 of sars cov 2 rna is degraded after 3 3 days in wastewater a better understanding of how particle associations alter decay these rates is needed 4 2 epidemiologically relevant limits of detection although method performance varied across sites sars cov 2 wastewater rna could be quantified in some areas experiencing as low as a 1 68 positivity rate the method s ability to quantify such low levels of sars cov 2 rna suggests that the results are likely to be useful in managing public health responses at the initial stages of community spread making this an important public health tool for covid 19 surveillance our observation that sars cov 2 rna detection was associated with a higher incidence of covid 19 in the next seven days further supports the use of wastewater surveillance as an early warning system with the amount of early warning dependent on a wide range of factors including frequency of wastewater sampling site and sample characteristics affecting the sensitivity of detection and the rate of the spread of infection further characterization of the service areas themselves and their wastewater infrastructure is needed to determine more precisely the areas where wbe for sars cov 2 would be most useful 4 3 crassphage as a normalizer for spatiotemporal variability quantification of a surrogate organism in addition to sars cov 2 can not only serve as a quality assurance measure ensuring sufficient amounts of nucleic acids are recovered but can also be used to normalize measured sars cov 2 values to help account for the fluctuating concentrations of fecal material in wastewater our observation that sars cov 2 crassphage dna ratios were significantly associated with the number of positive tests per 10 000 individuals both 7 days before and after sampling supports the use of crassphage as a surrogate for sars cov 2 as the significance of this association was improved following the exclusion of samples from which crassphage rna was not recovered the quantification of both dna and expressed rna may be advantageous when using a dna virus as a surrogate other viruses such as pepper mild motile virus pmmov have been used to facilitate the interpretation of sars cov 2 wbe data d aoust et al 2021b 2021a gerrity et al 2021 jafferali et al 2021 f wu et al 2020b despite being an rna virus like sars cov 2 pmmov is a rod shaped virus that is very stable in the environment and has high temperature tolerance and resilience in adverse physiochemical conditions kitajima et al 2018 which likely contributes to its relatively consistent abundance across wastewater treatment facilities d aoust et al 2021b 2021a in contrast our results show that crassphage nucleic acid concentrations are somewhat reflective of site differences and that crassphage dna concentrations respond to changes in flow and crassphage rna fluctuates in part as a function of sewershed area lower crassphage rna levels from larger sewersheds likely reflects the relative instability of rna and suggests that measures of sewershed area or other proxies for waste transit time could help link sars cov 2 wastewater rna levels to relevant epidemiological parameters more studies comparing crassphage pmmov and other surrogates are needed in order to determine which most accurately reflects the behavior of sars cov 2 in wastewater the assay we used to target crassphage cpq 056 has been shown to cross react with poultry litter ahmed et al 2018 however cpq 056 marker concentrations were over 2 3 orders of magnitude lower in poultry litter compared to untreated wastewater and likely had little effect on our quantification of crassphage nucleic acids nonetheless use of this marker in areas heavily affected by poultry fecal contamination is not recommended 4 4 future work in addition to the research needs relevant to particle binding and decay as well as the continued methodological and processing refinements mentioned previously sars cov 2 strain identification from wastewater should be a priority of ongoing wbe for covid 19 while sequencing approaches have been used successfully to detect variants from wastewater crits christoph et al 2021 jahn et al 2021 these methods are relatively low throughput the rapid development of standardized pcr based assays to detect variants from wastewater would allow sensitive and early detection of variants that pose elevated health risks conclusions the ultracentrifugation based method described here is a rapid and sensitive approach for the detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater from areas with low numbers of covid 19 cases after normalization with crassphage dna higher concentrations of sars cov 2 wastewater rna were significantly associated with positive covid 19 tests the week following wastewater sample collection suggesting the approach could help predict near term covid 19 case levels funding this work would not have been possible without seed funding from

19968,wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 rna is increasingly being incorporated into public health efforts to respond to the covid 19 pandemic in order to obtain the maximum benefit from these efforts approaches to wastewater monitoring need to be rapid sensitive and relatable to relevant epidemiological parameters in this study we present an ultracentrifugation based method for the concentration of sars cov 2 wastewater rna and use crassphage a bacteriophage specific to the human gut to help account for rna loss during transit in the wastewater system and sample processing with these methods we were able to detect and sometimes quantify sars cov 2 rna from 20 ml wastewater samples within as little as 4 5 hours using known concentrations of bovine coronavirus rna and deactivated sars cov 2 we estimate recovery rates of approximately 7 12 of viral rna using our method results from 24 sewersheds across upstate new york during the spring and summer of 2020 suggested that stronger signals of sars cov 2 rna from wastewater may be indicative of greater covid 19 incidence in the represented service area approximately one week in advance sars cov 2 wastewater rna was quantifiable in some service areas with daily positives tests of less than 1 per 10 000 people or when weekly positive test rates within a sewershed were as low as 1 7 crassphage dna concentrations were significantly lower during periods of high flow in almost all areas studied after accounting for flow rate and population served crassphage levels per capita were estimated to be about 1 35 1011 and 2 42 108 genome copies per day for dna and rna respectively a negative relationship between per capita crassphage rna and service area size was also observed likely reflecting degradation of rna over long transit times our results reinforce the potential for wastewater surveillance to be used as a tool to supplement understanding of infectious disease transmission obtained by traditional testing and highlight the potential for crassphage co detection to improve interpretations of wastewater surveillance data graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater based

with mild covid 19 symptoms are similar to that found in the upper respiratory tract wölfel et al 2020 the presence of a substantial quantity of viral rna in feces and urine provides the opportunity for wastewater based epidemiology wbe approaches to be applied to the surveillance of covid 19 tracking the emergence of disease and transmission trends over time daughton 2020 farkas et al 2020 such monitoring efforts are currently being explored worldwide in an attempt to bolster the public health response to the pandemic a robust and effective wastewater monitoring program for sars cov 2 could help to inform resource allocation decisions e g where to prioritize testing and contact tracing target community interventions such as social distancing measures or other restrictions and provide an additional tool by which policy makers could assess when and how to reopen local economies mallapaty 2020 larsen et al 2020 daughton 2020 additionally an effective wastewater monitoring approach could be used in the surveillance of facilities such as jails university dormitories colosi et al 2020 and assisted living facilities which may be especially susceptible to covid 19 outbreaks providing officials with the tools to limit the spread of the virus both within and from these types of facilities numerous groups have reported methods for the detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater following global outbreaks of covid 19 in early 2020 these approaches to concentrate viral particles and rna have included combinations of low speed centrifugation and centrifugal filters medema et al 2020 ahmed et al 2020a nemudryi et al 2020b alpaslan kocamemi et al 2020 polyethylene glycol peg precipitation zhang et al 2020 alpaslan kocamemi et al 2020 f wu et al 2020b la rosa et al 2020 colosi et al

al 2020 while many of these methods can be applied to wastewater surveillance with varying degrees of success as reviewed in kitajima et al 2020 ahmed et al 2020b rusiñol et al 2020 colosi et al 2020 their practical application into large scale monitoring efforts can be limited by factors such as turnaround time i e the time from sample acquisition to data generation and dependence on supply chain continuity for single use materials such as charged membranes or centrifugal filtration units ultracentrifugation is an attractive approach because once the initial investment in equipment is made the material cost and sample processing time are low furthermore the ability to manipulate the amount and viscosity of the sedimentation medium as well as the ultracentrifugation time and speed permit partial nucleic acid purification concurrent with concentration while several studies have found correlations between viral concentrations in wastewater and the number of confirmed covid 19 cases nemudryi et al 2020a bar or et al 2020 ampuero et al 2020 attempts at quantifying the numbers of infected individuals have varied in their success medema et al 2020 ahmed et al 2020a f wu et al 2020a vallejo et al 2020 several studies have also indicated that wastewater monitoring of sars cov 2 could provide an early warning sign for viral outbreaks in the community with viral rna being detected in wastewater samples prior to positive clinical testing of individuals medema et al 2020 la rosa et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 with either approach some measure of the effects of decay and dilution in the wastewater infrastructure is needed so that changes in sars cov 2 rna over time or between sampling locations better reflect changes in infection levels versus changes in weather water usage or other factors co quantification of viruses that are abundant in the human gut such as pepper mild mottle virus pmmov d aoust et al 2021b f wu et al 2020b to act as surrogates for sars cov 2 is the prevailing approach although it is not completely clear which surrogates mimic the behavior of sars cov 2 in the wastewater system most closely furthermore for surrogates with a dna genome expressed rna can simultaneously be measured which may more closely reflect the decay of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater compared to dna targets non viral surrogates such as nicotine cortisol and creatinine have also been proposed as normalizers in wbe applications although the quantification of these targets may be challenging and variability in consumption and disposal rates can create uncertainties in analysis polo et al 2020 rico et al 2017 in this study our goals were to a develop a reliable and scalable method for detecting and quantifying sars cov 2 wastewater rna from areas with low infection rates and b integrate co quantification of viral nucleic acids from crassphage an abundant human gut bacteriophage into sars cov 2 wastewater monitoring to help account for sources of both inter and intra sewershed variability we measured both crassphage dna and rna because it is currently unclear which serves as a better fecal normalizer when trying to associate sars cov 2 wastewater rna

the 28th of april which were frozen at 20 c for processing at a later date following methodological optimizations from april 28th to june 24th 2020 a total of 181 wastewater samples were collected and processed for the detection of sars cov 2 and crassphage nucleic acids during the sample collection process influent flow rate ph and water temperature were also measured at some access points average

pellets were resuspended in 200 μl 1x pbs and transferred to 1 7 ml microcentrifuge tubes resuspended pellets were stored at 20 c for 24 hours until nucleic acid extraction replicates were processed for optimization experiments only 2 3 optimization of viral nucleic acid recovery samples collected from onondaga county on april 28th may 6th and may 13th 2020 were used to perform optimization experiments to identify sucrose concentrations and ultracentrifugation times that resulted in higher levels of viral nucleic acid recovery we used crassphage as a surrogate since native sars cov 2 concentrations were too low to be used as reliable indicator of recovery first well blended wastewater subsamples were ultracentrifuged with 20 50 and 70 sucrose cushions for 20 90 and 120 minutes respectively with lower concentration cushions receiving shorter ultracentrifugation times pellets were then analyzed for crassphage dna next once the optimal sucrose concentration was identified we tested the effect of reducing ultracentrifugation time by making six replicate subsamples and ultracentrifuging for 30 n 2 45 n 2 and 75 minutes n 2 while holding sucrose concentration constant

11th 2020 on this plate wastewater samples had a mean cpq 056 ct of 23 350 and positive ntcs had a mean ct of 38 580 which suggests that contamination did not greatly affect estimates of crassphage from wastewater on this run therefore since the sole ip2ip4 ntc that showed amplification was 40 cycles and the few positive cpq 056 ntcs were largely isolated to one plate and represented dna quantities several orders of magnitude less than our wastewater nucleic acid extracts no data were excluded from analysis based on the assessment of ntcs kinetic outlier detection kod was performed as described previously green and field 2012 kirtane et al 2019 tichopad et al 2010 on all 3 032 reactions to determine if qpcr inhibition affected the amplification of sars cov 2 or crassphage nucleic acid targets raw fluorescence data from each well were log transformed and fit to a 4 parameter sigmoidal model using the pcrbatch function in r package qpcr version 1 4 1 ritz and spiess 2008 spiess 2018 we then estimated the first and second derivative maxima of each fitted model using a 10 ct difference between the first and second derivative maxima as a quality criterion i e uni2 criteria in function pcrbatch kod analysis indicated that all wells with a ct value 45 maximum possible ct value displayed no signs of inhibition inherent in these methods is the assumption that dna polymerase and reverse transcriptase are equally susceptible to pcr inhibitors nonetheless the total absence of signs of qpcr inhibition as indicated by sensitive kod methods suggests that the purification methods used were effective at removing compounds that commonly affect qpcr amplification 2 7 integration of covid 19 case data covid 19 testing data consisting of all diagnostic tests including pcr and antigen based methods were obtained from the electronic clinical laboratory reporting system eclrs nysdoh 2020a b all test results were classified as positive negative inconclusive or invalid after excluding tests for out of state residents all tests for covid 19 during the study period were geocoded using the new york state street address maintenance sam program nys street address mapping

from the new york state gis clearinghouse nys gis parcels 2020 any addresses with private septics which accounted for approximately 5 of covid 19 tests were excluded from the analysis a daily count of positive test results by service area was tabulated after excluding inconclusive or invalid results human subject involvement with regards to covid 19 diagnostic testing was approved by the new york state department of health s institutional review board 2 8 data interpretation and analysis to aid interpretation sars cov 2 wastewater rna levels were classified into three distinct categories prior to data analysis samples that had all three qpcr replicates amplify above the loq of 5 genome copies per reaction were classified as quantifiable because both assays were able to amplify 5 copies per reaction consistently samples that had at least one qpcr replicate amplify with a ct 40 were considered detected but not quantifiable dnq many of the samples classified as dnq had one or two qpcr replicates above the loq of 5 copies but were still conservatively classified as dnq for our analysis samples that had no amplification in any of the three wells i e all three wells were undetermined ct 45 were considered below the limits of detection blod i e a negative sample to facilitate comparison of crassphage concentrations between service areas we used prior 24 hour flow and population

606 617 and 619 as available wang et al 2020 3 results 3 1 optimizing recovery of viral nucleic acids in an assessment of sucrose concentration and ultracentrifugation spin time we found that a 50 cushion paired with a 90 minute spin time yielded greater crassphage dna concentrations than both a 20 cushion paired with a 20 minute spin time and a 70 cushion paired with a 150 minute spin time p 0 05 table 3 we then assessed the impact of 30 45 and 75 minute spin times on crassphage nucleic acid recovery using a 50 sucrose cushion in an attempt to reduce processing time we found that while both 45 and 75 minute spin times yielded greater quantities of crassphage dna than a 30 minute spin p 0 01 table 4 there was no significant difference in crassphage dna recovery between 45 and 75 minute spins quantifiable amounts of crassphage rna were only recovered with a 45 minute spin time table 4 low quantities of crassphage rna dnq are potentially due to degradation as rna may have degraded while the wastewater sample was stored at 4 c for approximately 5 days because 75 minute and 45 minute spin times yielded similar results with 45 minutes being the only treatment to recover quantifiable crassphage rna we proceeded with this spin time for further experiments and the analysis of wastewater samples having determined an optimal sucrose concentration and ultracentrifugation time we then determined the approximate nucleic acid recovery for the total process using spiked heat deactivated sars cov 2 bei resources and native crassphage dna and rna as surrogates quantifiable levels of sars cov 2 rna and crassphage rna were found only in the pellet indicating that the majority of viral rna is likely pelleted under these conditions table 5 trace levels of rna recovered from the cushion interface sars cov 2 and in the sucrose layers crassphage suggest that low levels of sars cov 2 rna also remain unpelleted while quantifiable levels of crassphage dna were present in most layers post ultracentrifugation quantities found in the pellet were far greater than that of any other layer p 0 001 table 5 although the magnitude of crassphage dna recovered from the pellet varied significantly among the two replicates p 0 002 sars cov 2 rna recovery was not statistically different based on the amount initially spiked we estimated that 12 s d 5 5 of deactivated sars cov 2 rna was recovered after both ultracentrifugation and nucleic acid extraction processes a follow up experiment in which bcov rna was added to pellets resulted in an average extraction recovery of 6 89 s d 1 58 suggesting that the majority of nucleic acid loss in the total process occurred at the nucleic acid extraction step 3 2 abundance of sars cov 2 and crassphage in wastewater samples while the vast majority of crassphage dna and rna values fell within the quantifiable range most sars cov 2 rna levels were either dnq 49 or blod 34 table 6 we were able to detect or quantify sars cov 2 rna from wastewater in 111 of the 169 samples that were analyzed over the study period of these 111 samples 29 had quantifiable levels of sars cov 2 rna in these samples the average quantity of sars cov 2 rna recovered was 2 16 104 s d 2 11 104 genome copies per l of wastewater while the maximum observed quantity was 1 02 105 s d 7 96 103 genome copies per l of wastewater crassphage nucleic acids were quantifiable from the vast majority of wastewater samples table 6 over the course of the study period the average and maximum quantities of crassphage dna recovered were 2 05 108 s d 2 18 108 and 1 73 109 s d 7 72 107 genome copies per l of wastewater for crassphage rna the average and maximum quantities recovered were 4 00 105 s d 4 61 105 and 2 88 107 s d 1 47 105 genome copies per l 3 3 association between crassphage loads influent flow and population served we observed a significant negative relationship between crassphage concentrations detected and influent wastewater flow rates across all sites table s3 we selected six sites with the greatest number of sampling events n 9 each to look at this relationship on an individual basis and found significant negative relationships between crassphage dna concentration and flow but no significant relationship between crassphage rna concentration and flow potentially due to increased variability in crassphage rna measurements fig 2 table s3 lower crassphage concentrations during higher flow rates are likely attributable to wastewater dilution though sources such as groundwater infiltration and stormwater runoff although the relative contribution of these sources in each service area is difficult to quantify we also found significant relationships between crassphage dna and rna loads and the population served in each service area fig 3 3 4 variability in physical chemical parameters and crassphage loads between service areas at each site n 8 where temperature and flow data were recorded we observed a significant positive correlation between temperature and sampling date pearson s r 0 94 0 97 p 0 05 and significant negative correlation between flow and sampling date r 0 82 0 96 p 0 05 reflecting the change toward warmer dryer weather at facilities 605 and 606 we also observed a significant negative correlation between ph and both sampling date r 0 75 0 86 p 0 05 and water temperature r 0 76 0 88 p 0 05 but at other sites no significant correlation was observed on average estimated per capita crassphage contributions were 1 35 1011 genome copies per day std dev 1 99 1011 and 2 42 108 genome copies per day std dev 2 77 108 for dna and rna respectively fig 4 based on regression analysis we observed significantly lower per capita crassphage dna in service area 999a 4 85 1010 p 0 0365 compared to other sites we also observed significantly higher crassphage rna per capita in service area oswego w 2 86 1011 p 0 0165 compared to other sites based on a pairwise comparison of service areas no two sites had a significant difference in mean crassphage dna p 0 11 tukey hsd 95 ci or mean crassphage rna p 0 09 although the sample size table s1 is too low at most sites to conclude no difference in means using ctrees we found that some of this variability in per capita crassphage rna loads could be explained by service area size per capita crassphage rna loads were 2 09 108 gene copies higher in service areas smaller than 34 681 km2 fig 5 a similar association was not observed for per capita dna loads no significant splits were identified when using average influent temperature ph or transit time as predictors for dna or rna loads as outcomes 3 5 association between sars cov 2 concentrations and covid 19 incidence following wastewater sample collection over all study areas the highest positive test rates for which sars cov 2 rna remained blod corresponded to a weekly positive test rate of 12 4 and a weekly average of 2 19 daily positive tests per 10 000 population the highest weekly positive test rates for samples classified as blod or dnq were 20 9 or 3 97 daily positive tests per 10 000 population weekly positive test rates corresponding to quantifiable samples ranged from 1 68 15 11 or 0 37 5 95 daily positive tests per 10 000 population depending on the site from a qualitative perspective samples with quantifiable levels of sars cov 2 rna were associated with higher levels of positive test results the week following sampling fig 6 over the seven days following wastewater sample collection both the average number of new positive tests per 10 000 persons and the testing positivity rate were significantly higher in quantifiable samples than in samples classified as blod or dnq for sars cov 2 welch two sample t test p 0 001 samples classified as dnq also had significantly higher rates and case counts than blod samples welch two sample t test p 0 002 although the number of samples with quantifiable levels of sars cov 2 rna was limited n 29 we did observe a significant relationship between the ratio of sars cov 2 rna to crassphage dna p 0 005 r2 0 27 and the number of positive tests per 10 000 population this relationship was somewhat improved after excluding samples for which no crassphage rna was recovered p 0 004 r2 0 31 a similar association was found between the sars cov 2 crassphage dna ratio and the number of positive tests per 10 000 population the week following sampling p 0 003 r2 0 30 which also improved slightly after excluding samples with no recoverable crassphage rna p 0 004 r2 0 33 interestingly significant positive associations between ratios and test rates were identified only when testing was expressed as a proportion of the population served and not as a proportion of total tests conducted i e test positivity no significant linear associations were identified between sars cov 2 wastewater rna concentrations and epidemiological parameters without first normalizing to crassphage dna 4 discussion 4 1 advantages of ultracentrifugation through a sucrose cushion we developed a sensitive rapid and scalable method for the detection and quantification of sars cov 2 wastewater rna based on direct ultracentrifugation though a sucrose cushion inspired by the early results of wurtzer and colleagues wurtzer et al 2020 we sought to further capitalize on the ability of ultracentrifugation to remove low density contaminants that could potentially interfere with subsequent nucleic acid extraction and qpcr despite loss of rna in the extraction process we were able to quantify sars cov 2 in areas with less than 1 positive test per 10 000 individuals with this approach it is possible to obtain wastewater testing results for both sars cov 2 and crassphage within 4 5 hours of a sample being received the major limiting factor to this method is both ultracentrifuge availability and capacity as the rotor used here can hold only six samples however the use of small volumes of wastewater only 20 ml per sample provides advantages in terms of transport storage and biosafety although the use of larger volumes of wastewater may improve sensitivity other groups have since found the method to outperform other common concentration procedures for the analysis of wastewater from individual facilities colosi et al 2020 this sensitivity relatively quick turnaround time and limited dependence on supply chain continuity may be an attractive option for groups considering wastewater surveillance different concentration and nucleic acid extraction approaches should also be considered in an attempt to improve upon the 7 12 recovery that we estimated in this study while approaches other than ultracentrifugation have reported higher recovery rates and variable cost and processing times table s4 colosi and colleagues 2020 recently found sucrose cushion based ultracentrifugation using a fixed angle rotor which accommodates tubes with twice the sample volume used in this study and a nucleospin extraction kit to outperform both electropositive filtration and peg precipitation methods while the ultracentrifugation approach described by colosi et al 2020 demonstrated success it is difficult to compare our methodologies without a direct measurement of nucleic acid percent recovery results from optimization trials indicate that viral particles in wastewater exist in a mixture of states and a range of sedimentation properties that are likely to change from sample to sample more sensitive methods but also improved interpretation of wastewater surveillance data would be facilitated by a better understanding of the state of both sars cov 2 rna and surrogate nucleic acids within wastewater and specifically what proportion are a contained within viral particles b released and dissolved or c released and bound to other particles while some studies have explored viral associations to various wastewater particles in terms of size and charge da silva et al 2008 hejkal et al 1981 variability in particle association between different types of viruses chahal et al 2016 suggests that both sars cov 2 and surrogate viral particle associations may require specific study with an additional focus on the state s of nucleic acids if some dna or rna is bound knowing the size and mass of the particles and how they vary over time and across locations would greatly improve the precision of methods based on size e g ultrafiltration charge e g electropositive filtration or mass e g ultracentrifugation additionally variability in wastewater particle composition between service areas and or sampling locations may affect viral decay as different particle associations have been shown to impact the survival of pathogens as reviewed in chahal et al 2016 bivins et al 2020 estimated that 90 of sars cov 2 rna is degraded after 3 3 days in wastewater a better understanding of how particle associations alter decay these rates is needed 4 2 epidemiologically relevant limits of detection although method performance varied across sites sars cov 2 wastewater rna could be quantified in some areas experiencing as low as a 1 68 positivity rate the method s ability to quantify such low levels of sars cov 2 rna suggests that the results are likely to be useful in managing public health responses at the initial stages of community spread making this an important public health tool for covid 19 surveillance our observation that sars cov 2 rna detection was associated with a higher incidence of covid 19 in the next seven days further supports the use of wastewater surveillance as an early warning system with the amount of early warning dependent on a wide range of factors including frequency of wastewater sampling site and sample characteristics affecting the sensitivity of detection and the rate of the spread of infection further characterization of the service areas themselves and their wastewater infrastructure is needed to determine more precisely the areas where wbe for sars cov 2 would be most useful 4 3 crassphage as a normalizer for spatiotemporal variability quantification of a surrogate organism in addition to sars cov 2 can not only serve as a quality assurance measure ensuring sufficient amounts of nucleic acids are recovered but can also be used to normalize measured sars cov 2 values to help account for the fluctuating concentrations of fecal material in wastewater our observation that sars cov 2 crassphage dna ratios were significantly associated with the number of positive tests per 10 000 individuals both 7 days before and after sampling supports the use of crassphage as a surrogate for sars cov 2 as the significance of this association was improved following the exclusion of samples from which crassphage rna was not recovered the quantification of both dna and expressed rna may be advantageous when using a dna virus as a surrogate other viruses such as pepper mild motile virus pmmov have been used to facilitate the interpretation of sars cov 2 wbe data d aoust et al 2021b 2021a gerrity et al 2021 jafferali et al 2021 f wu et al 2020b despite being an rna virus like sars cov 2 pmmov is a rod shaped virus that is very stable in the environment and has high temperature tolerance and resilience in adverse physiochemical conditions kitajima et al 2018 which likely contributes to its relatively consistent abundance across wastewater treatment facilities d aoust et al 2021b 2021a in contrast our results show that crassphage nucleic acid concentrations are somewhat reflective of site differences and that crassphage dna concentrations respond to changes in flow and crassphage rna fluctuates in part as a function of sewershed area lower crassphage rna levels from larger sewersheds likely reflects the relative instability of rna and suggests that measures of sewershed area or other proxies for waste transit time could help link sars cov 2 wastewater rna levels to relevant epidemiological parameters more studies comparing crassphage pmmov and other surrogates are needed in order to determine which most accurately reflects the behavior of sars cov 2 in wastewater the assay we used to target crassphage cpq 056 has been shown to cross react with poultry litter ahmed et al 2018 however cpq 056 marker concentrations were over 2 3 orders of magnitude lower in poultry litter compared to untreated wastewater and likely had little effect on our quantification of crassphage nucleic acids nonetheless use of this marker in areas heavily affected by poultry fecal contamination is not recommended 4 4 future work in addition to the research needs relevant to particle binding and decay as well as the continued methodological and processing refinements mentioned previously sars cov 2 strain identification from wastewater should be a priority of ongoing wbe for covid 19 while sequencing approaches have been used successfully to detect variants from wastewater crits christoph et al 2021 jahn et al 2021 these methods are relatively low throughput the rapid development of standardized pcr based assays to detect variants from wastewater would allow sensitive and early detection of variants that pose elevated health risks conclusions the ultracentrifugation based method described here is a rapid and sensitive approach for the detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater from areas with low numbers of covid 19 cases after normalization with crassphage dna higher concentrations of sars cov 2 wastewater rna were significantly associated with positive covid 19 tests the week following wastewater sample collection suggesting the approach could help predict near term covid 19 case levels funding this work would not have been possible without seed funding from

19969,novel technologies allow to reuse or recycle water for on site applications such as toilet flushing showering or hand washing at the household or building scale many of these technologies have

non potable water reuse technologies have now reached technology readiness levels that require verification and validation testing in the field mercer et al 2018 results from such field tests of small scale water reuse and recycling systems have been published over the past few years to evaluate the microbial and chemical quality of the reclaimed water many researchers refer to quality targets from legal and regulatory frameworks for water reuse water reuse frameworks wrfs a term which is here used to designate regulatory tools such as guidelines standards regulations laws codes of practice etc to date many countries have not issued national requirements for the quality of reclaimed water especially for applications that go beyond agricultural reuse consequently many wrfs are limited to reuse for irrigation with the who guidelines for the safe use of wastewater excreta and greywater in agriculture and aquaculture who 2006 as a widely known example for wrfs with focus on irrigation a main goal is to protect the environment from high nutrient concentrations and other harmful substances in addition to protecting human health increasingly there are also wrfs targeting residential applications with stronger emphasis on health relevant parameters for instance the international organization for standardization has developed a standard for non sewered sanitation systems including performance requirements for unrestricted urban reuse iso 30500 iso 2018 sanz and gawlik 2014 present an overview of wrfs around the globe and reynaert et al 2020 summarize requirements from 18 wrfs that are applicable to toilet flushing and handwashing reuse applications including wrfs for the usa us epa 2012 western australia government of western autralia 2010 canada health canada 2010 and spain ministry of the presidency spain 2007 for contexts for which no wrfs exist environmental technology verification etv programs have been developed to verify claims about the performance of innovative environmental technologies by qualified third parties an inspection of field testing literature revealed that there is quite a range of approaches on choosing the appropriate wrf for small scale residential applications and how to interpret the quality targets from such frameworks this paper identifies the main errors and analyses whether these are due to inherent problems of the wrfs or to an inappropriate application we propose measures to avoid erroneous interpretations of quality targets describe how wrfs need to evolve with technology advancement and outline future research needs while we do not evaluate water reuse technologies nor present specific suggestions on how to define wrf quality targets in this paper we hope to initiate a discussion on such targets and associated monitoring methods amongst water reuse experts from science and practise common misinterpretations of water reuse frameworks applied to novel small scale water reuse technologies we investigated ten recent publications including our own on field tests of water reuse systems that compare their monitoring results to quality targets from wrfs reynaert et al 2020 sahondo et al 2020 varigala et al 2020 welling et al 2020 cid et al 2018 hawkins et al 2018 rogers et al 2018 fountoulakis et al 2016 santasmasas et al 2013 knerr et al 2011 the criteria for including a publication were i water reuse system with the aim for unrestricted urban reuse e g toilet flushing ii field test or full scale test with real wastewater input and iii comparison of reclaimed water quality to targets from wrf these publications were analysed in terms of selection application and interpretation of wrfs as summarized in table 1 detailed evaluation in supplementary information table s 1 doi 10 25678 0002qd including details on wrfs used the purpose of this evaluation is not a judgement on research quality in these publications but to highlight the challenges of linking novel reuse technologies and applications with appropriate wrfs selection of wrfs to allow for a meaningful interpretation a wrf must be locally applicable adapted to the type of wastewater input e g grey or blackwater and include adequate reuse purposes e g toilet flushing all but two publications referenced the water reuse or discharge frameworks unambiguously and all but one applied either locally relevant when existent or international wrfs or both with one exception all publications used wrfs that were adapted to the type of wastewater treated most errors were linked to the selection of wrfs that do not cover the intended application scope only one out of nine publications selected only quality targets aimed at the intended reuse application while six publications also compared their monitoring results to quality targets for agricultural reuse or surface water discharge though they examine systems which are intended for unrestricted urban reuse e g reuse as toilet flush water this is problematic because the logic behind the quality targets may differ health based considerations vs protection of the environment application of wrfs the application of wrfs was evaluated in terms of consistency only two out of ten publications unambiguously defined all quality targets four publications did not compare all parameters that were measured during the studies and for which quality targets were defined in the applied wrfs another issue was the incomplete application of different wrfs in addition to a main reference wrf only for selected parameters rather than all parameters defined in the wrfs we hypothesize that these inconsistencies were due to a selection of wrfs after the testing e g the frameworks were selected to meet the field test design instead of designing the testing to match the framework specifications the evaluation of the correct interpretation of the wrfs was hindered in many publications as they did not provide sufficient information for the reader to be able to compare the monitoring results to the quality targets many errors were linked to an inaccurate interpretation of quality targets from wrfs wrfs set different types of quality targets which in some cases may be simple maximum minimum or average concentrations in many cases however they set more complex targets e g effluent requirements in iso 30500 achieve quality targets in 4 out of 5 events with no more than 20 variance from the target for any failed parameter which require for an adequate testing design many publications presented average values for the monitoring parameters when the quality targets were defined as maximum or minimum values leading to a misinterpretation of their testing results interpretation of wrfs the evaluation of the quality targets is often described in the abstract or in the conclusion of the publication and is used as an argument in favour of the researched technology because an extended representation of the results is not possible in these sections the results are sometimes simplified to a point that is no longer correct which is the case in seven out of nine publications examples of such oversimplified statements are nearly met or partially met such statements show that too often the focus lies on the success of the technologies rather than on a critical discussion of the water quality reached when the researched technology and the target reuse application are not covered in the wrf it is of great importance to critically assess the suitability of the given quality targets only one publication critically discussed these mismatches on the difficulty of applying water reuse frameworks for small scale water reuse applications an investigation of the challenges involved in the establishment of wrfs can help understanding some of the widespread issues with their correct application and interpretation to novel water reuse systems most countries worldwide have adopted national regulations or standards for drinking water quality who 2018 with a focus on the protection of human health generally centralized solutions are favoured for the supply and distribution of the water peter varbanets et al 2009 which allows for the use of laboratory based analytical methods for microbial quality control the establishment of wrfs involves increased complexity especially for novel and small scale technologies this can translate into difficulties in the correct application of wrfs reasons are 1 diverse water inputs e g greywater vs blackwater vs mixed wastewater and a wide range of reuse applications e g irrigation vs handwashing this can result in ambiguous application scopes with many wrfs defining broad reuse categories such as unrestricted urban reuse us epa 2012 or supply to sanitary appliances spanish regulation rd 1620 2007 translated by the universitat politècnica de catalunya 2011 which cover a wide range of potential reuse applications with tremendous differences in human health risks 2 the necessity to incorporate human health as well as environmental considerations the interpretation of quality targets is particularly difficult for recycling systems without discharge to the environment many wrfs set effluent quality targets that aim at the protection of the environment e g phosphorus removal 80 according to iso 30500 but it is not clear whether meeting such targets is required for systems that fully recycle the water 3 as an additional difficulty water reuse technologies are increasingly small scale and decentralized daigger and crawford 2007 for such systems laboratory based methods may no longer be suitable due to economic and organizational constraints making adequate monitoring of the water quality another challenge to this day however most wrfs require frequent measurements of multiple water quality parameters as an example the us epa 2012 recommends continuous measurements of turbidity and chlorine daily monitoring of faecal coliforms and weekly measurements of ph and biological oxygen demand it is unclear how such a monitoring system and scheme can be economically implemented in a small scale e g household based water reuse system monitoring of many of these parameters requires access to well equipped laboratory facilities which may not be available in many contexts in which alternative water sources are most needed in our own work reynaert et al 2020 we faced all of these challenges when field testing prototypes recycling handwashing water in switzerland and south africa 1 it was not clear to what extent categories such as unrestricted urban reuse or supply to sanitation appliances were intended to cover high quality and thus high risk applications such as handwashing only one of the applicable wrfs explicitly mentioned handwashing iso 30500 2018 however without providing explicit quality targets 2 we were unsure to what extent the target effluent requirements were applicable to our closed loop water recycling without effluent to the environment 3 we had to transport samples over a distance of almost 50 km for analysis and the cost of the implemented online monitoring system surpassed the cost projection for the industrialized water reuse system we believe that some of the misinterpretations presented in table 1 could have been avoided with more critical scrutiny by the authors still these examples illustrate that many wrfs were not developed for the novel small scale water reuse technologies that are being field tested now hindering their judicious application way forward research on water reuse technologies is societally and environmentally highly relevant and receives increasing attention from industrial manufacturers and utilities operators longer term many of the novel water reuse technologies aim towards industrialization and commercialization from our own experience we know that publications on novel water reuse technologies are read by a varied audience including readers that do not have a background in engineering and may not be familiar with wrfs especially in such a context it is critical to introduce and apply quality targets with increased diligence best practice principles are needed for a careful and transparent use of wrfs carefulness comprises i the selection of a locally relevant wrf before the testing so that appropriate monitoring parameters and methods can be selected ii having an understanding of the wrf including general testing and monitoring requirements that goes beyond the quality target values and iii using wrf quality target values as a reference point rather than a goal e g avoiding statements like mostly nearly met quality targets transparency requires i the full details of the selected wrf including a justification on why it was selected ii an explicit mention of the parameters that are defined in the wrf but were not measured in the study and iii a presentation of the results in a form that the reader can compare them to the target values but researchers have to think further than these best practice principles as technology and regulations need to be co evolving researchers should go beyond a conscientious evaluation of the water quality and engage in the critical discussion of quality targets and associated monitoring methods from wrfs quality targets are tools that were developed to ensure the protection of human and environmental health these quality targets will vary with scientific and technological development economic and environmental constraints and cultural and political shifts hespanhol and prost 1994 thus it is not sufficient to select and implement the correct wrf where the wrf may not have been aware of the technology options available for an effective protection of human health and the environment we advocate for the implementation of wrfs that use risk based and thus end use dependant system performance targets for instance based on quantitative microbial risk assessments we see a responsibility of researchers to not blindly follow quality target values but critically assess the suitability of these targets for their specific testing context and technology and thus contribute to the further development revision and expansion of frameworks for water reuse this is particularly needed for 1 novel technologies that allow the reuse of water for applications that are not covered in existing frameworks 2 recycling technologies that do not produce an environmental effluent 3 applications with increased health risks for the users e g direct contact with the water where online monitoring of the hygienic water quality becomes indispensable ultimately water reuse technologies will not be certified or approved based on the field studies presented here as this is the responsibility of regulatory authorities or independent certification organizations but during field testing researchers are confronted with real world problems such as lacking access to a laboratory field testing thus not only provides an opportunity to validate technologies but also their maintenance control and monitoring of the reclaimed water quality with this experience the goal of researchers should not be to fulfil the wrf targets but also to make use of their experience and knowledge to critically discuss the wrfs this critical discussion is a valuable feedback that allows the wrfs to co evolve with emerging technologies these evolved wrfs will provide reasonable guidance to operators of conventional systems and therefore to ensure protection of the environment and public health conclusions quality targets from wrfs are often misinterpreted while some misinterpretations are avoidable if applying due diligence many wrfs are only partially applicable to novel small scale water reuse systems wrfs and associated monitoring strategies need to co evolve with advances in technology and new applications field testing of novel technologies provides an opportunity to test the applicability of wrfs this evaluation is only possible if researchers do not only focus on the success of the technology i e showing which quality targets are met but also consider the frameworks overarching principles an effective policy and regulatory process to provide adequate treatment of water for the intended end use will be key to the viability of small scale and

alternative water source as it provides reliable quantities of water all while relieving the stress on freshwater resources hardy et al 2015 recent technological developments especially the rapid development and wide acceptance of membrane technologies have multiplied the potential applications of reclaimed water far beyond traditional reuse in agriculture angelakis et al 2018 chen et al 2013 novel small scale technologies allow to reuse or recycle i e reuse for the same application water for on site residential uses such as toilet flushing bair et al 2015 cid et al 2018 rogers et al 2018 sahondo et al 2020 showering gassie and engelhardt 2017 or hand washing reynaert et al 2020 here we use the term small scale for technologies that operate at the household or building scale and are thus by definition decentralized especially for applications involving close contact to the water such as hand washing or showering the effective protection of user health is essential many of these non potable water reuse technologies have now reached technology readiness levels that require verification and validation testing in the field mercer et al 2018 results from such field tests of small scale water reuse and recycling systems have been published over the past few years to evaluate the microbial and chemical quality of the reclaimed water many researchers refer to quality targets from legal and regulatory frameworks for water reuse water reuse frameworks wrfs a term which is here used to designate regulatory tools such as guidelines standards regulations laws codes of practice etc to date many countries have not issued national requirements for the quality of reclaimed water especially for applications that go beyond agricultural reuse consequently many wrfs are limited to reuse for irrigation with the who guidelines for the safe use of wastewater excreta and greywater in agriculture and aquaculture who 2006 as a widely known example for wrfs with focus on irrigation a main goal is to protect the environment from high nutrient concentrations and other harmful substances in addition to protecting human health increasingly there are also wrfs targeting residential applications with stronger emphasis on health relevant parameters for instance the international organization for standardization has developed a standard for non sewered sanitation systems including performance requirements for unrestricted urban reuse iso 30500 iso 2018 sanz and gawlik 2014 present an overview of wrfs around the globe and reynaert et al 2020 summarize requirements from 18 wrfs that are applicable to toilet flushing and handwashing reuse applications including wrfs for the usa us epa 2012 western australia government of western autralia 2010 canada health canada 2010 and spain ministry of the presidency spain 2007 for contexts for which no wrfs exist environmental technology verification etv programs have been developed to verify claims about the performance of innovative environmental technologies by qualified third parties an inspection of field testing literature revealed that there is quite a range of approaches on choosing the appropriate wrf for small scale residential applications and how to interpret the quality targets from such frameworks this paper identifies the main errors and analyses whether these are due to inherent problems of the wrfs or to an inappropriate application we propose measures to avoid erroneous interpretations of quality targets describe how wrfs need to evolve with technology advancement and outline future research needs while we do not evaluate water reuse technologies nor present specific suggestions on how to define wrf quality targets in this paper we hope to initiate a discussion on such targets and associated monitoring methods amongst water reuse experts from science and practise common misinterpretations of water reuse frameworks applied to novel small scale water reuse technologies we investigated ten recent publications including our own on field tests of water reuse systems that compare their monitoring results to quality targets from wrfs reynaert et al 2020 sahondo et al 2020 varigala et al 2020 welling et al 2020 cid et al 2018 hawkins et al 2018 rogers et al 2018 fountoulakis et al 2016 santasmasas et al 2013 knerr et al 2011 the criteria for including a publication were i water reuse system with the aim for unrestricted urban reuse e g toilet flushing ii field test or full scale test with real wastewater input and iii comparison of reclaimed water quality to targets from wrf these publications were analysed in terms of selection application and interpretation of wrfs as summarized in table 1 detailed evaluation in supplementary information table s 1 doi 10 25678 0002qd including details on wrfs used the purpose of this evaluation is not a judgement on research quality in these publications but to highlight the challenges of linking novel reuse technologies and applications with appropriate wrfs selection of wrfs to allow for a meaningful interpretation a wrf must be locally applicable adapted to the type of wastewater input e g grey or blackwater and include adequate reuse purposes e g toilet flushing all but two publications referenced the water reuse or discharge frameworks unambiguously and all but one applied either locally relevant when existent or international wrfs or both with one exception all publications used wrfs that were adapted to the type of wastewater treated most errors were linked to the selection of wrfs that do not cover the intended application scope only one out of nine publications selected only quality targets aimed at the intended reuse application while six publications also compared their monitoring results to quality targets for agricultural reuse or surface water discharge though they examine systems which are intended for unrestricted urban reuse e g reuse as toilet flush water this is problematic because the logic behind the quality targets may differ health based considerations vs protection of the environment application of wrfs the application of wrfs was evaluated in terms of consistency only two out of ten publications unambiguously defined all quality targets four publications did not compare all parameters that were measured during the studies and for which quality targets were defined in the applied wrfs another issue was the incomplete application of different wrfs in addition to a main reference wrf only for selected parameters rather than all parameters defined in the wrfs we hypothesize that these inconsistencies were due to a selection of wrfs after the testing e g the frameworks were selected to meet the field test design instead of designing the testing to match the framework specifications the evaluation of the correct interpretation of the wrfs was hindered in many publications as they did not provide sufficient information for the reader to be able to compare the monitoring results to the quality targets many errors were linked to an inaccurate interpretation of quality targets from wrfs wrfs set different types of quality targets which in some cases may be simple maximum minimum or average concentrations in many cases however they set more complex targets e g effluent requirements in iso 30500 achieve quality targets in 4 out of 5 events with no more than 20 variance from the target for any failed parameter which require for an adequate testing design many publications presented average values for the monitoring parameters when the quality targets were defined as maximum or minimum values leading to a misinterpretation of their testing results interpretation of wrfs the evaluation of the quality targets is often described in the abstract or in the conclusion of the publication and is used as an argument in favour of the researched technology because an extended representation of the results is not possible in these sections the results are sometimes simplified to a point that is no longer correct which is the case in seven out of nine publications examples of such oversimplified statements are nearly met or partially met such statements show that too often the focus lies on the success of the technologies rather than on a critical discussion of the water quality reached when the researched technology and the target reuse application are not covered in the wrf it is of great importance to critically assess the suitability of the given quality targets only one publication critically discussed these mismatches on the difficulty of applying water reuse frameworks for small scale water reuse applications an investigation of the challenges involved in the establishment of wrfs can help understanding some of the widespread issues with their correct application and interpretation to novel water reuse systems most countries worldwide have adopted national regulations or standards for drinking water quality who 2018 with a focus on the protection of human health generally centralized solutions are favoured for the supply and distribution of the water peter varbanets et al 2009 which allows for the use of laboratory based analytical methods for microbial quality control the establishment of wrfs involves increased complexity especially for novel and small scale technologies this can translate into difficulties in the correct application of wrfs reasons are 1 diverse water inputs e g greywater vs blackwater vs mixed wastewater and a wide range of reuse applications e g irrigation vs handwashing this can result in ambiguous application scopes with many wrfs defining broad reuse categories such as unrestricted urban reuse us epa 2012 or supply to sanitary appliances spanish regulation rd 1620 2007 translated by the universitat politècnica de catalunya 2011 which cover a wide range of potential reuse applications with tremendous differences in human health risks 2 the necessity to incorporate human health as well as environmental considerations the interpretation of quality targets is particularly difficult for recycling systems without discharge to the environment many wrfs set effluent quality targets that aim at the protection of the environment e g phosphorus removal 80 according to iso 30500 but it is not clear whether meeting such targets is required for systems that fully recycle the water 3 as an additional difficulty water reuse technologies are increasingly small scale and decentralized daigger and crawford 2007 for such systems laboratory based methods may no longer be suitable due to economic and organizational constraints making adequate monitoring of the water quality another challenge to this day however most wrfs require frequent measurements of multiple water quality parameters as an example the us epa 2012 recommends continuous measurements of turbidity and chlorine daily monitoring of faecal coliforms and weekly measurements of ph and biological oxygen demand it is unclear how such a monitoring system and scheme can be economically implemented in a small scale e g household based water reuse system monitoring of many of these parameters requires access to well equipped laboratory facilities which may not be available in many contexts in which alternative water sources are most needed in our own work reynaert et al 2020 we faced all of these challenges when field testing prototypes recycling handwashing water in switzerland and south africa 1 it was not clear to what extent categories such as unrestricted urban reuse or supply to sanitation appliances were intended to cover high quality and thus high risk applications such as handwashing only one of the applicable wrfs explicitly mentioned handwashing iso 30500 2018 however without providing explicit quality targets 2 we were unsure to what extent the target effluent requirements were applicable to our closed loop water recycling without effluent to the environment 3 we had to transport samples over a distance of almost 50 km for analysis and the cost of the implemented online monitoring system surpassed the cost projection for the industrialized water reuse system we believe that some of the misinterpretations presented in table 1 could have been avoided with more critical scrutiny by the authors still these examples illustrate that many wrfs were not developed for the novel small scale water reuse technologies that are being field tested now hindering their judicious application way forward research on water reuse technologies is societally and environmentally highly relevant and receives increasing attention from industrial manufacturers and utilities operators longer term many of the novel water reuse technologies aim towards industrialization and commercialization from our own experience we know that publications on novel water reuse technologies are read by a varied audience including readers that do not have a background in engineering and may not be familiar with wrfs especially in such a context it is critical to introduce and apply quality targets with increased diligence best practice principles are needed for a careful and transparent use of wrfs carefulness comprises i the selection of a locally relevant wrf before the testing so that appropriate monitoring parameters and methods can be selected ii having an understanding of the wrf including general testing and monitoring requirements that goes beyond the quality target values and iii using wrf quality target values as a reference point rather than a goal e g avoiding statements like mostly nearly met quality targets transparency requires i the full details of the selected wrf including a justification on why it was selected ii an explicit mention of the parameters that are defined in the wrf but were not measured in the study and iii a presentation of the results in a form that the reader can compare them to the target values but researchers have to think further than these best practice principles as technology and regulations need to be co evolving researchers should go beyond a conscientious evaluation of the water quality and engage in the critical discussion of quality targets and associated monitoring methods from wrfs quality targets are tools that were developed to ensure the protection of human and environmental health these quality targets will vary with scientific and technological development economic and environmental constraints and cultural and political shifts hespanhol and prost 1994 thus it is not sufficient to select and implement the correct wrf where the wrf may not have been aware of the technology options available for an effective protection of human health and the environment we advocate for the implementation of wrfs that use risk based and thus end use dependant system performance targets for instance based on quantitative microbial risk assessments we see a responsibility of researchers to not blindly follow quality target values but critically assess the suitability of these targets for their specific testing context and technology and thus contribute to the further development revision and expansion of frameworks for water reuse this is particularly needed for 1 novel technologies that allow the reuse of water for applications that are not covered in existing frameworks 2 recycling technologies that do not produce an environmental effluent 3 applications with increased health risks for the users e g direct contact with the water where online monitoring of the hygienic water quality becomes indispensable ultimately water reuse technologies will not be certified or approved based on the field studies presented here as this is the responsibility of regulatory authorities or independent certification organizations but during field testing researchers are confronted with real world problems such as lacking access to a laboratory field testing thus not only provides an opportunity to validate technologies but also their maintenance control and monitoring of the reclaimed water quality with this experience the goal of researchers should not be to fulfil the wrf targets but also to make use of their experience and knowledge to critically discuss the wrfs this critical discussion is a valuable feedback that allows the wrfs to co evolve with emerging technologies these evolved wrfs will provide reasonable guidance to operators of conventional systems and therefore to ensure protection of the environment and public health conclusions quality targets from wrfs are often misinterpreted while some misinterpretations are avoidable if applying due diligence many wrfs are only partially applicable to novel small scale water reuse systems wrfs and associated monitoring strategies need to co evolve with advances in technology and new applications field testing of novel technologies provides an opportunity to test the applicability of wrfs this evaluation is only possible if researchers do not only focus on the success of the technology i e showing which quality targets are met but also consider the frameworks overarching principles an effective policy and regulatory process to provide adequate treatment of water for the intended end use will be key to the viability of small scale and
