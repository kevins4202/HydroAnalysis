19530,sewage sludge is an inevitable byproduct from municipal wastewater treatment processes and conversion of sewage sludge into high value added biochar is an effective strategy for resource utilization of sewage sludge the characterization on p speciation is important to control the practical applications and environmental behavior of the sewage sludge and its derived biochar the mobility and bioavailability of p is closely related to its speciation but knowledge gap in p speciation is still existed which needs to be narrowed by a systematic study including existing experimental methods and techniques as well as theoretical prediction to achieve a comprehensive understanding of p speciation this study conducted a series of research combining conventional fractionation of p with consideration of major concomitant elements al ca fe advanced analytical techniques solution and solid state 31p nuclear magnetic resonance nmr x ray diffraction xrd and theoretical simulation with respect to solubility of major elements in different acid base extractants results showed that ca and fe were dominantly extracted by hcl whereas p and al were both naoh and hcl soluble inorganic orthophosphates were detected as predominant molecular configurations of p from solution 31p nmr spectra while the existence of calcium and aluminum orthophosphates was revealed by solid state 31p nmr moreover the poor crystalline alpo4 mineral was further evidenced by xrd patterns of the sewage sludge and biochar finally a theoretical simulation of p containing minerals was performed on the basis of results above which suggested the existence of variscite berlinite and amorphous ca3 po4 2 in the sludge and biochar this study does not only explore the p speciation in the sewage sludge and its derived biochar but also provides a methodology for further research on p speciation through the intensive study on the environmental behavior of p this work might further contribute to the fundamental knowledge basis for the recycle of p during integrate waste management graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphorus speciation sewage sludge biochar minerals 1 introduction sewage sludge is an inevitable byproduct from municipal wastewater treatment processes and has become a serious threat to the environment in china more than 129 million tons of municipal wastewater were treated daily in wastewater treatment plants and over 30 million tons of sewage sludge were generated annually since the year of 2014 awasthi et al 2017 among various treatment techniques for sewage sludge pyrolysis has been recognized as an effective alternative to largely reduce the volume of sewage sludge destroy pathogens and convert the sludge into high value added carbonaceous materials biochar for multiple applications like soil amendment carbon sequestration and contaminants mitigation feng et al 2015 yuan and dai 2015 zhang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 the application of sewage sludge as soil amendment has been reported to improve urban soil properties and promote grass growth yue et al 2017 it was also found that using sewage sludge biochar as soil amendment plays important roles in the stabilization of metal species fang et al 2016 attenuation of phenanthrene pyrene adsorption zielińska and oleszczuk 2016a as well as reduction of bioavailability bioaccessibility of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs zielińska and oleszczuk 2016b sewage sludge typically contains 2 3 of phosphorus p by dry mass mayer et al 2016 which makes its derived biochar as potential fertilizer during soil application hossain et al 2011 khan et al 2013 pyrolysis of sewage sludge can affect both quantity and speciation of p in the solid residues biochar and it has been reported that the mobility and bioavailability of p is closely related to its speciation qian and jiang 2014 liu et al 2013 nanzer et al 2014 wisawapipat et al 2017 huang and tang 2015 an insight into p speciation is indispensable to understand the fate of p which further helps to predict the improvement of soil conditions after recycling the sewage sludge derived biochar as soil amendment both operational and direct speciation analysis of p have been conducted via employing a variety of characterization techniques liu et al 2013 qian and jiang 2014 nanzer et al 2014 huang and tang 2015 wisawapipat et al 2017 operational speciation refers to the definition of p pools according to their solubility in a variety of extractants for sequential fractionation qian and jiang 2014 which cannot reflect the exact species of p but provides quantitative knowledge on available fractions of p to plants and terrestrial environment in terms of p solubility in different extractants wisawapipat et al 2017 meanwhile direct speciation reflects the truly existing forms of p including molecular configuration e g inorganic orthophosphate and organic orthophosphate monoester and p containing phases e g cation complexes incorporated into minerals or adsorbed species on other minerals huang and tang 2015 both direct and operational speciation can be performed by techniques such as 31p nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and x ray diffraction xrd to define the structure and chemical state of p which can help to explicate the fate and behavior of p in the environment for example a combination of alkaline extraction and solution 31p nmr is usually adopted to determine the molecular configuration of p whereas solid state 31p magic angle spinning nmr solid state 31p mas nmr and xrd can be employed to identify p containing phases qian and jiang 2014 huang and tang 2015 the speciation of p in sewage sludge and sludge biochar has attracted researchers attention and been reported in some existing works based on sequential fractionation qian and jiang 2014 reported the migration of p operational speciation to medium and long term plant available p pools in sewage sludge biochar prepared with elevated temperatures using solution 31p nmr following naoh edta extraction a variety of molecular configurations of p e g orthophosphate pyrophosphate and orthophosphate monoesters was detected in the sewage sludge and orthophosphate was found to dominantly remain in biochar after sewage sludge pyrolysis qian and jiang 2014 huang and tang 2015 other studies revealed the existence of possible p containing minerals like calcium phosphate hinedi et al 1989 frossard et al 1994 huang and tang 2015 by solid state 31p mas nmr but failed to identify the mineral phase precisely due to broad signals of solid state 31p nmr spectra the speciation of p reported by previous works qian and jiang 2014 hinedi et al 1989 frossard et al 1994 huang and tang 2015 greatly facilitated to acquire a better understanding on the fate of p during recycling reclamation of sewage sludge biochar but some intrinsic limitations can be perceived firstly in sequential fractionation p is extracted routinely by various extractants in specific order however when the p containing phases can be dissolved substantially in either former or latter extractants the specific order may lead to incomplete or even misleading picture of p solubility and classification thus a combination of sequential fractionation and additional independent extraction seems indispensable for a full picture of p solubility which can also provide data for theoretical calculation of p containing phases secondly previous studies merely focused on the analysis of p itself but ignored the concomitant metals e g al ca fe extracted along with p turner and leytem 2004 josan et al 2005 hunger et al 2005 he et al 2007 uchimiya and hiradate 2014 thomsen et al 2017 which can provide better insight into p speciation by sequential fractionation and or independent extraction thirdly although molecular configuration of extracted p can be detected by solution 31p nmr following alkaline extraction the exact p containing phases cannot be identified precisely due to broad solid state 31p nmr spectra hinedi et al 1989 frossard et al 1994 huang and tang 2015 the limitations listed above indicated that there is still a large gap in the speciation of p which cannot be filled by only relying p extraction or even advanced analytical techniques therefore it is essential to conduct a systematic study to combine the existing experimental methods and techniques as well as theoretical prediction for the speciation of p in sewage sludge and its derived biochar in this study the speciation of p was systematically interpreted in sewage sludge and its derived biochar obtained at a temperature range of 200 700 c via a combination of various methods sequential fractionation was used to examine operational speciation of p and meanwhile the main concomitant metals released along with p were also determined for a better understanding of the extraction behavior moreover independent extraction was employed with h2o naoh and hcl as extractants to assess the dissolution profile of p and other metals with respect to different acid base chemistry which further provided data for theoretical calculation of possible p containing phases the solution 31p nmr following naoh edta extraction was adopted to characterize the molecular configuration of p while the p containing phases were detected directly by techniques such as xrd and solid state 31p mas nmr finally after intensive discussion on both experimental results of p speciation and a further theoretical simulation of mineral p this study deduced the possible p containing phases and greatly contributed to explication on the fate of p during soil application of the sewage sludge and its derived biochar besides the intensive interpretation of p speciation this study also proposed a strategy to promote the systematical study with a combination of advanced technologies together with theoretical simulation for further research on transformation of p during waste management 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation the sewage sludge was collected in the year of 2015 from a municipal wastewater treatment plant of shenzhen china and used as raw biomass for the preparation of biochar samples the influent for this plant is a mixture of municipal wastewater and rainfall which shows low carbon but high nitrogen and phosphorus content typically codcr 260 mg l 1 bod5 150 mg l 1 tn 45 mg l 1 tp 5 mg l 1 moreover the plant utilizes primary physical and secondary anaerobic anoxic oxic aao treatments as dominant processes and polyaluminium chloride was added as coagulant the collected sewage sludge is the combined sludge from primary and secondary treatment processes which is dewatered mechanically by centrifugation after dried at 60 c the sludge was ground into fine powder and passed through a 0 15 mm sieve the biochar was produced through pyrolysis of 50 g dry sludge powder each time in a horizontal tube furnace equipped with a quartz tube inner diameter 95 mm outer diameter 100 mm and length 100 cm a high purity n2 flow 400 ml min 1 was first introduced to purge the air in the quartz tube for 1 h before the start of the pyrolysis processes the samples were heated over a pyrolysis temperature range of 200 700 c at a heating rate of 5 c min 1 in the n2 flow after a dwell time of 4 h at the target temperature the samples were then cooled naturally and the obtained sludge biochar referred to as ss200 700 the number represents pyrolysis temperature were ground to fine powder passing through a 0 15 mm sieve the physicochemical properties of the sewage sludge and the sludge biochar have been described in details in our recently published work li et al 2017 which shows that al si fe and p are major inorganic elements in sewage sludge 2 2 measurement of major elements the compositions of major elements in the sewage sludge were determined by x ray fluorescence spectrometry xrf s2 ranger bruker and the results table s1 showed p al ca and fe as major elements which were further considered in the following experiments the total quantity of the relevant elements i e p al ca and fe was determined according to the method in the reference huang and tang 2015 and the results were shown in fig s1 briefly sewage sludge and its derived biochar were combusted at 600 c for 2 h in a muffle furnace and each obtained residue was extracted by hcl 1 m solution for 16 h then the suspension was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and concentrations of p al ca and fe in the filtrate were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes optima 8000 perkinelmer 2 3 sequential fractionation of samples the modified hedley sequential fractionation was employed to differentiate and quantify the major pools of p qian and jiang 2014 wisawapipat et al 2017 0 2 g of each solid sample sewage sludge or sludge biochar was placed into 100 ml centrifuge tube and then extracted at 25 c for 16 h sequentially by 40 ml of h2o nahco3 0 5 m naoh 0 1 m and hcl 1 m after each successive extraction the suspension was centrifuged and separated into supernatant and solid residue the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and stored at 4 c for further analysis whereas the solid residue was used for the next extraction step concentrations of p al ca and fe in the supernatant were determined by icp oes extraction capacity and extraction efficiency were employed as two indices to reflect the extraction performance qian and jiang 2014 huang and tang 2015 the extraction capacity mg g 1 was calculated from the amount of extracted element divided by sample mass whereas the extraction efficiency was obtained by the ratio of extracted to total content of the element in samples 2 4 independent extraction of samples to investigate the solubility of major elements in different acid base environments the sewage sludge and sludge biochar were exposed to h2o naoh 1 m or hcl 1 m separately for independent extraction each sample was mixed with h2o 1 m naoh or 1 m hcl independently at a solid liquid ratio of 0 2 g 40 ml and shaken with a speed of 180 rpm at 25 c for 16 h then the suspension was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and concentrations of p al ca and fe in the filtrate were determined by icp oes 2 5 p extraction for solution 31p nmr analysis for subsequent speciation by solution 31p nmr analysis the widely used naoh edta extraction method huang and tang 2015 was employed in this experiment for p extraction from the sewage sludge and biochar each sample was mixed with a solution containing 0 25 m naoh and 0 05 m edta at a solid liquid ratio of 0 2 g 40 ml and shaken with a speed of 180 rpm at 25 c for 16 h the suspension was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter while 0 6 ml of the filtrate was transferred together with 0 4 ml of d2o to a 5 mm nmr tube for nmr analysis solution 31p nmr spectra were obtained using a bruker ascend 400 spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm broadband probe at operation of 162 mhz for 31p nuclei the nmr parameters were set as follows pulse width of 8 μs 90 pulse delay of 2 0 s acquisition time of 3 4 s dwell time of 51 6 μs number of scans as 16 and broadband proton decoupling at 27 c according to previous study huang and tang 2015 chemical shifts ppm were calibrated by an external standard prepared from 85 h3po4 as 0 ppm 2 6 solid state 31p mas nmr analysis and phase identification by xrd solid state 31p mas nmr spectra with single pulse and cross polarization were acquired on selected samples sewage sludge ss400 and ss700 the single pulse nmr spectra were obtained using bruker ascend 600 spectrometer 243 hz with 31p 90 pulse of 4 μs relaxation delay of 60 s acquisition time of 2 4 ms dwell time of 2 9 μs and number of scans as 12 288 at 30 c the cross polarization nmr spectra were recorded on a bruker avance iii 400 162 mhz spectrometer using proton 90 pulse of 5 μs recycle delay of 4 s acquisition time of 16 ms dwell time of 10 2 μs and number of scans as 2080 at 27 c the xrd patterns of the sewage sludge and sludge biochar were recorded from 10 to 90 2θ at a scan rate of 0 02 s 1 using a rigaku smartlab powder diffractometer with the characteristic cu kα radiation and operating conditions of 35 kv and 40 ma 3 results and discussion 3 1 operational speciation of p together with al ca and fe the hedley sequential fractionation was originally developed to differentiate various pools of p but besides p other elements e g al ca and fe may also be extracted concomitantly turner and leytem 2004 josan et al 2005 hunger et al 2005 he et al 2007 uchimiya and hiradate 2014 thomsen et al 2017 since al ca and fe have been detected as major elements contained in the sludge and its derived biochar their extraction behavior was analyzed together with that of p during sequential fractionation the distribution of p al ca and fe in each extraction step for the sludge and biochar was shown in fig 1 with respect to extraction capacity mg g 1 and extraction efficiency which are defined in experimental section for sewage sludge a very small amount of p was extracted by h2o with extraction capacity of 0 30 mg g 1 and extraction efficiency of 0 94 the extraction capacity and extraction efficiency were detected as 0 073 mg g 1 and 0 14 for al and 1 45 mg g 1 and 11 73 for ca there was no fe detected in the solution extracted by h2o low extraction of p 3 50 mg g 1 10 75 al 0 39 mg g 1 0 72 ca 1 55 mg g 1 12 52 and fe 0 45 mg g 1 1 01 were also observed when the residues were further extracted by nahco3 solution which indicated a relatively low plant available fraction of p in the raw sludge qian and jiang 2014 hunger et al 2005 however when the residues were extracted by naoh the extraction efficiency increased substantially to 64 23 for p and 72 55 for al together with the growth of extraction capacity to 20 88 mg g 1 and 39 32 mg g 1 respectively the extraction of ca was obviously decreased with extraction capacity of 0 25 mg g 1 and extraction efficiency of 2 00 while a very small amount of fe was released with extraction capacity of 0 31 mg g 1 and extraction efficiency of 0 69 moreover the hcl extractable p and al were 3 13 mg g 1 9 62 and 9 84 mg g 1 18 16 concomitant with substantial increase in both ca 5 92 mg g 1 42 97 and fe 34 16 mg g 1 76 54 finally the portion that is recalcitrant to extraction and thus remains in the residues is 14 47 for p 4 70 mg g 1 8 43 for al 4 57 mg g 1 25 77 for ca 3 18 mg g 1 and 21 75 for fe 9 71 mg g 1 therefore most of p and al is naoh extractable while the majority of ca and fe is hcl extractable besides that a considerable amount of ca and fe was also found to remain in the residues after sequential fractionation compared with p pools in sewage sludge reported by qian and jiang 2014 the sludge shows less h2o p 0 30 mg g 1 in this study versus 5 3 mg g 1 in the reference qian and jiang 2014 less nahco3 p 3 50 mg g 1 versus 9 5 mg g 1 and less hcl p 3 13 mg g 1 versus 5 3 mg g 1 but much more naoh p 20 88 mg g 1 versus 6 9 mg g 1 and nearly comparable residue p 4 70 mg g 1 versus 3 9 mg g 1 the extraction behavior of p al ca and fe in the five pools for ss200 700 was also demonstrated in fig 1 the results were discussed extensively in supporting information si and showed a similar release pattern of p al ca and fe between the sludge and biochar the fractions of p al ca and fe extracted by h2o and nahco3 are generally low when compared to other pools most of the p and al were extracted by naoh while the majority of ca and fe were acid extractable or recalcitrant to extraction furthermore when the effect of temperatures was considered on the change of pools with respect to p al ca and fe the amount of h2o extractable and nahco3 extractable p al ca and fe decreased with the elevated pyrolysis temperature moreover naoh extractable p and al increased with decline in ca and fe while hcl extractable p ca and fe increased but al decreased in addition the amount of p al and ca was found to increase but that of fe kept decreasing in the residues it is generally thought that h2o p and nahco3 p can be available to plant in the short term and naoh p in the medium term but hcl p can hardly be absorbed by plant directly qian and jiang 2014 based on results from sequential extraction it appears that p and al are mainly naoh soluble and rather than hcl soluble indicating a relatively stable pool of p but also available to plants to some extent the results also show that the extraction of p increased with pyrolysis temperatures until 500 c and then reached relatively stable afterwards which implies a potential increase in p availability to plant with the elevated pyrolysis temperature samples were usually first attacked by naoh because naoh extraction is ahead of hcl extraction in conventional sequential fractionation however different phenomenon might be observed if the samples were first extracted by hcl and then transferred to naoh extractant especially when the p and al containing phases are amphoteric the extraction by acidic basic extractants has only been done as a part of sequential extraction protocol which may lead to incomplete picture of p solubility and classification as mentioned above therefore it seems necessary to carry out independent extraction to better investigate the extraction behavior of the relevant elements and further deduce the speciation of p in the sludge and its derived biochar 3 2 independent extraction in different acid base environments independent extraction was further performed with h2o 1 m naoh and 1 m hcl representing three typical acid base environments by a combination of results from both sequential and independent extraction a full mapping of p speciation can be obtained fig 2 and fig s2 of si summarized the extraction capacity mg g 1 and extraction efficiency respectively from independent extraction of the sewage sludge and its derived biochar by h2o naoh and hcl in comparison with sequential fractionation similar extraction capacity and efficiency were detected for p al ca and fe when the samples were independently extracted by h2o both extraction capacity and efficiency of p al and ca for the samples were slightly higher in naoh extractant after independent extraction than those derived from naoh extraction in sequential fractionation which might be caused by a higher concentration of naoh for independent extraction or the partial element removal before naoh extraction in sequential fractionation in contrast the extraction capacity and efficiency of fe for both sludge and biochar is obviously lower in independent extraction than the corresponding value in sequential fractionation indicating lower dissolution of fe in solution with higher naoh concentration however when the sludge and biochar were extracted independently by hcl an interesting and distinct phenomenon was observed for the extraction behavior of the elements above besides slightly higher extraction capacity and efficiency of ca and fe in hcl of independent extraction than sequential fractionation for the sewage sludge and ss200 700 a significant amount of p and al were released with extraction capacities of 26 61 46 40 mg g 1 and 44 68 82 55 mg g 1 respectively when the extraction capacities of p and al were compared the amount was dramatically higher by hcl independent extraction than that in hcl of sequential fractionation p 3 13 9 38 mg g 1 al 6 43 9 84 mg g 1 which is mainly due to low p al content in the residue after substantial extraction by naoh ahead of hcl from the results above ca and fe in the sludge and biochar are mainly hcl extractable while p and al containing components can either be extracted by naoh or hcl independently therefore different from dominantly naoh extractable p observed in sequential fractionation a combination of independent and sequential extraction revealed the existence of amphoteric p and al containing phases moreover although p and al can dissolve substantially in naoh or hcl p extracted by naoh is slightly lower than that by hcl in agreement with the previous work dou et al 2000 whereas inversely for al indicating the sensitivity of p and al speciation to different acid base environments furthermore the impact of pyrolysis temperature can also be observed from the extraction capacity and efficiency of p ca and fe as shown in fig 2 and fig s2 the extraction capacity of p by h2o was increased from the sludge to ss200 but declined afterwards which shows an increase in short term p availability after low temperature pyrolysis but the short term availability was decreased with further increase in the pyrolysis temperature besides that the amount of ca extracted by h2o was also found to increase from the sludge to ss200 but decreased eventually with elevated temperatures however when the samples were attracted by naoh or hcl independently the extraction capacities of p al and fe rose up obviously with increasing pyrolysis temperatures moreover a slight increase in the extraction capacity of ca by hcl was observed with elevated temperature which indicates the potential stabilization of ca with pyrolysis processing moreover the extraction efficiencies for p and ca by h2o were found to decrease obviously from ss200 to ss700 with the increase in pyrolysis temperature however in independent extraction by naoh or hcl the extraction efficiencies for p al ca and fe were all found to be relatively stable even with enrichment fig s1 of si due to weight loss during biochar production with elevated temperatures 3 3 molecular configuration of p to explore the molecular configuration of p in the sewage sludge and its derived biochar samples were first extracted by naoh edta and then processed for measurement by solution 31p nmr before the analysis of solution 31p nmr spectra the extraction efficiency was first calculated as an important index to ensure the representativeness of extractable p with respect to the total p and the results were shown in fig 3 a the extraction efficiency is 92 8 for the sewage sludge and then increased with elevated pyrolysis temperature until reaching 97 4 for the ss400 however further increase of pyrolysis temperatures results in a gradual decrease of extraction efficiency to 87 6 for ss700 previous studies have also reported similar variation of extraction efficiencies with elevated temperatures huang and tang 2015 xu et al 2016 which can be ascribed to physical constrains as a result of carbon condensation during pyrolysis huang and tang 2015 the range of extraction efficiency for all samples 84 8 97 4 indicates that p in the extracts constitutes the majority of the total p and thus solution 31p nmr spectra can represent the main information about molecular configuration of p due to high concentrations of p in naoh edta extracts 100 mg l 1 fig s3 the extracts were directly employed for solution 31p nmr analysis without further enrichment and resuspension as shown in fig 3b a sharp peak at 5 ppm was observed without any other observable peaks from the solution 31p nmr spectrum of the sewage sludge indicating inorganic orthophosphate as the dominant molecular configuration of p in the sewage sludge cade menun 2005 the absence of organic p may be ascribed to low content of organic components in the collected sewage sludge for this study li et al 2017 moreover similar solution 31p nmr spectra were also observed for all sludge biochar and further confirmed the persistence of orthophosphates during sludge pyrolysis although other molecular configurations of p have also been reported in sewage sludge qian and jiang 2014 huang and tang 2015 inorganic orthophosphate was identified as the predominant molecular configuration of p in both sludge and derived biochar which is consistent with the findings in this study 3 4 possible p containing phases although alkaline extraction together with solution 31p nmr can determine the molecular configuration of dissolved p they cannot identify p containing phases in original solid samples therefore in this study xrd as well as solid state 31p mas nmr with single pulse and cross polarization was employed for direct identification of possible p containing phases the single pulse mode allows for the detection of all 31p nuclei nonselectively whereas the cross polarization mode enables the selective observation of the 31p nuclei located in close proximity to 1h nuclei within 1 nm frossard et al 2002 a combination of both modes is helpful for a thorough characterization of p species and fig 4 a collates both spectra from single pulse and cross polarization modes of the sewage sludge the resonance centered at chemical shift of 8 0 ppm in single pulse or 3 8 ppm in cross polarization is recognized as the centerband reflecting the isotropic 31p chemical shift while the other resonances spaced symmetrically with respect to centerband are spinning sidebands denoted by asterisks in fig 4a showing chemical shift anisotropy bleam et al 1989 the single pulse spectrum of the sewage sludge has a fairly broad centerband with 13 0 ppm of linewidth at half height and prominent spinning sidebands while the cross polarization spectrum contains a broad centerband half height linewidth 8 2 ppm but with weak spinning sidebands fig 4a the obviously distinctive spectra of single pulse and cross polarization modes indicate the occurrence of at least two different local p environments i e p in some local environment is far from proton while in other local environments is close to proton but with a small fraction for the latter the range of chemical shift for single pulse spectrum shows the presence of mineral aluminum orthophosphates generally 5 ppm bleam et al 1989 mcdowell et al 2002 whereas the range for cross polarization spectrum indicates the existence of mineral calcium orthophosphates generally 5 ppm rothwell et al 1980 belton et al 1988 however precise assignment of calcium or aluminum orthophosphates is difficult due to the broad resonance probably resulting from poorly ordered p minerals or paramagnetic effect bleam et al 1989 moreover the intense and multi order spinning sidebands from single pulse spectrum reflect the large chemical shift anisotropy due to the occurrence of asymmetrically protonated orthophosphate while the small but readily observable sidebands from the cross polarization spectrum can be ascribed to a characteristic structural distortion of symmetrically unprotonated orthophosphate from tetrahedral symmetry tropp et al 1983 furthermore the presence of isotropic resonance and anisotropic sidebands for cross polarization spectrum imply the existence of p in immediate proximity to proton but not protonated e g orthophosphate bound by hydrogen bonds to nearly water molecules in the sample hunger et al 2004 as for the sludge biochar no p signal can be detected from solid state 31p mas nmr with both single pulse and cross polarization modes which might be due to the strong paramagnetic linebroading of enriched fe in the sludge biochar fig s1 hinedi et al 1989 hunger et al 2005 the loss of p signal in spectrum of cross polarization may be additionally attributed to the removal of hydrogen in close vicinity to p during pyrolysis in addition xrd patterns of the sludge and biochar were collected and shown in fig 4b from the results of phase identification poorly crystallized alpo4 can be detected in the sludge in agreement with orthophosphate as dominant molecular configuration of p in solution 31p nmr fig 3b and the existence of aluminum orthophosphate from solid state 31p mas nmr fig 4a for the sludge the alpo4 was also detected in the sludge biochar which is consistent with the dominant molecular configuration of p as orthophosphate in solution 31p nmr for the sludge biochar fig 3b moreover quartz was also observed as one major phase in the sewage sludge and biochar but kaolinite disappeared at higher temperatures 500 c due to thermal decomposition sperinck et al 2011 3 5 theoretical prediction of p containing minerals from results depicted above inorganic orthophosphates were observed as dominant molecular configurations of p for the sludge and biochar from solution 31p nmr analysis while the existence of calcium and aluminum orthophosphates can be suggested from solid state 31p mas nmr but with difficulties for their specific assignment although alpo4 was clearly detected by xrd other p containing phases may also be present given that the extraction of p is always accompanied by concomitant release of al ca and fe in both sequential fractionation and independent extraction with different solubility of elements above in different acid base extractants figs 1 and 2 the p containing minerals can be possibly expected by comparing the experimental solubility with theoretically simulated solubility of assumed known minerals at different phs this idea has already been applied to characterize the p speciation in sludge amended soils by hinedi and chang 1989 with carbonated apatite as the possible p containing phase in this section the presence of mineral p was predicted by comparing the extraction behavior of p al ca and fe in independent extraction with the solubility of common al p ca p and fe p minerals at different phs since similar extraction behavior has been observed for the sewage sludge and biochar the theoretical simulation based on the extraction data of sewage sludge is representative for the prediction of p containing minerals the procedure of theoretical simulation was described in the supporting information si and the results were discussed as following for al p the common crystalline variscite alpo4 2h2o and amorphous variscite alpo4 1 5h2o are completely dissolved at ph 0 and ph 14 but virtually no dissolution at ph 7 which corresponds well to the simultaneously substantial extraction of p and al in 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh but little extraction in h2o for ca p only the theoretical solubility of amorphous ca3 po4 2 is consistent with that of experimental extraction for p and ca i e large solubility in acid medium in h2o and small in base for fe p the experimental extraction of p and fe does not conform to solubility of common iron orthophosphate and probably indicate the absence of fe p minerals in the samples based on the above results the possible p containing minerals in the sludge were predicted as variscite alpo4 2h2o and alpo4 1 5h2o and amorphous ca3 po4 2 which is in agreement with the existence of alpo4 from xrd results due to the similar extraction behavior of relevant elements between the sludge and biochar minerals like berlinite alpo4 and amorphous ca3 po4 2 may also exist but with enrichment in the sludge biochar due to weight loss during pyrolysis processes 4 conclusions knowledge of p speciation is of vital importance for further recycle and reclamation of p in the sewage sludge and its derived biochar when applied as soil amendments although the speciation of p has been previously investigated in literatures with a variety of methods the results obtained in this work fig 5 proved that it is critical to conduct a systematic study combining conventional extraction advanced analytical techniques and theoretical simulation to achieve a comprehensive understanding of p speciation the results obtained from sequential fractionation and independent extraction revealed that the order in sequential fractionation may result in misleading information on p solubility in extractants and thus lead to incorrect explanation on the environmental behavior of p for example conventional sequential fractionation shows that p is dominantly naoh soluble but independent extraction demonstrates that p can be substantially extracted by both naoh and hcl extractants previous studies only investigated the behavior of p in sequential fractionation however consideration of other metals e g al ca fe extracted along with p seems helpful to better understand the speciation of p containing phases although solution 31p nmr is widely employed for speciation analysis of p it can only offer information on molecular configuration of p but failed to provide insight into the identification of exact p containing phases which are more decisive to control the environmental behavior

19530,sewage sludge is an inevitable byproduct from municipal wastewater treatment processes and conversion of sewage sludge into high value added biochar is an effective strategy for resource utilization of sewage sludge the characterization on p speciation is important to control the practical applications and environmental behavior of the sewage sludge and its derived biochar the mobility and bioavailability of p is closely related to its speciation but knowledge gap in p speciation is still existed which needs to be narrowed by a systematic study including existing experimental methods and techniques as well as theoretical prediction to achieve a comprehensive understanding of p speciation this study conducted a series of research combining conventional fractionation of p with consideration of major concomitant elements al ca fe advanced analytical techniques solution and solid state 31p nuclear magnetic resonance nmr x ray diffraction xrd and theoretical simulation with respect to solubility of major elements in different acid base extractants results showed that ca and fe were dominantly extracted by hcl whereas p and al were both naoh and hcl soluble inorganic orthophosphates were detected as predominant molecular configurations of p from solution 31p nmr spectra while the existence of calcium and aluminum orthophosphates was revealed by solid state 31p nmr moreover the poor crystalline alpo4 mineral was further evidenced by xrd patterns of the sewage sludge and biochar finally a theoretical simulation of p containing minerals was performed on the basis of results above which suggested the existence of variscite berlinite and amorphous ca3 po4 2 in the sludge and biochar this study does not only explore the p speciation in the sewage sludge and its derived biochar but also provides a methodology for further research on p speciation through the intensive study on the environmental behavior of p this work might further contribute to the fundamental knowledge basis for the recycle of p during integrate waste management graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphorus speciation sewage sludge biochar minerals 1 introduction sewage sludge is an inevitable byproduct from municipal wastewater treatment processes and has become a serious threat to the environment in china more than 129 million tons of municipal wastewater were treated daily in wastewater treatment plants and over 30 million tons of sewage sludge were generated annually since the year of 2014 awasthi et al 2017 among various treatment techniques for sewage sludge pyrolysis has been recognized as an effective alternative to largely reduce the volume of sewage sludge destroy pathogens and convert the sludge into high value added carbonaceous materials biochar for multiple applications like soil amendment carbon sequestration and contaminants mitigation feng et al 2015 yuan and dai 2015 zhang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 the application of sewage sludge as soil amendment has been reported to improve urban soil properties and promote grass growth yue et al 2017 it was also found that using sewage sludge biochar as soil amendment plays important roles in the stabilization of metal species fang et al 2016 attenuation of phenanthrene pyrene adsorption zielińska and oleszczuk 2016a as well as reduction of bioavailability bioaccessibility of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs zielińska and oleszczuk 2016b sewage sludge typically contains 2 3 of phosphorus p by dry mass mayer et al 2016 which makes its derived biochar as potential fertilizer during soil application hossain et al 2011 khan et al 2013 pyrolysis of sewage sludge can affect both quantity and speciation of p in the solid residues biochar and it has been reported that the mobility and bioavailability of p is closely related to its speciation qian and jiang 2014 liu et al 2013 nanzer et al 2014 wisawapipat et al 2017 huang and tang 2015 an insight into p speciation is indispensable to understand the fate of p which further helps to predict the improvement of soil conditions after recycling the sewage sludge derived biochar as soil amendment both operational and direct speciation analysis of p have been conducted via employing a variety of characterization techniques liu et al 2013 qian and jiang 2014 nanzer et al 2014 huang and tang 2015 wisawapipat et al 2017 operational speciation refers to the definition of p pools according to their solubility in a variety of extractants for sequential fractionation qian and jiang 2014 which cannot reflect the exact species of p but provides quantitative knowledge on available fractions of p to plants and terrestrial environment in terms of p solubility in different extractants wisawapipat et al 2017 meanwhile direct speciation reflects the truly existing forms of p including molecular configuration e g inorganic orthophosphate and organic orthophosphate monoester and p containing phases e g cation complexes incorporated into minerals or adsorbed species on other minerals huang and tang 2015 both direct and operational speciation can be performed by techniques such as 31p nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and x ray diffraction xrd to define the structure and chemical state of p which can help to explicate the fate and behavior of p in the environment for example a combination of alkaline extraction and solution 31p nmr is usually adopted to determine the molecular configuration of p whereas solid state 31p magic angle spinning nmr solid state 31p mas nmr and xrd can be employed to identify p containing phases qian and jiang 2014 huang and tang 2015 the speciation of p in sewage sludge and sludge biochar has attracted researchers attention and been reported in some existing works based on sequential fractionation qian and jiang 2014 reported the migration of p operational speciation to medium and long term plant available p pools in sewage sludge biochar prepared with elevated temperatures using solution 31p nmr following naoh edta extraction a variety of molecular configurations of p e g orthophosphate pyrophosphate and orthophosphate monoesters was detected in the sewage sludge and orthophosphate was found to dominantly remain in biochar after sewage sludge pyrolysis qian and jiang 2014 huang and tang 2015 other studies revealed the existence of possible p containing minerals like calcium phosphate hinedi et al 1989 frossard et al 1994 huang and tang 2015 by solid state 31p mas nmr but failed to identify the mineral phase precisely due to broad signals of solid state 31p nmr spectra the speciation of p reported by previous works qian and jiang 2014 hinedi et al 1989 frossard et al 1994 huang and tang 2015 greatly facilitated to acquire a better understanding on the fate of p during recycling reclamation of sewage sludge biochar but some intrinsic limitations can be perceived firstly in sequential fractionation p is extracted routinely by various extractants in specific order however when the p containing phases can be dissolved substantially in either former or latter extractants the specific order may lead to incomplete or even misleading picture of p solubility and classification thus a combination of sequential fractionation and additional independent extraction seems indispensable for a full picture of p solubility which can also provide data for theoretical calculation of p containing phases secondly previous studies merely focused on the analysis of p itself but ignored the concomitant metals e g al ca fe extracted along with p turner and leytem 2004 josan et al 2005 hunger et al 2005 he et al 2007 uchimiya and hiradate 2014 thomsen et al 2017 which can provide better insight into p speciation by sequential fractionation and or independent extraction thirdly although molecular configuration of extracted p can be detected by solution 31p nmr following alkaline extraction the exact p containing phases cannot be identified precisely due to broad solid state 31p nmr spectra hinedi et al 1989 frossard et al 1994 huang and tang 2015 the limitations listed above indicated that there is still a large gap in the speciation of p which cannot be filled by only relying p extraction or even advanced analytical techniques therefore it is essential to conduct a systematic study to combine the existing experimental methods and techniques as well as theoretical prediction for the speciation of p in sewage sludge and its derived biochar in this study the speciation of p was systematically interpreted in sewage sludge and its derived biochar obtained at a temperature range of 200 700 c via a combination of various methods sequential fractionation was used to examine operational speciation of p and meanwhile the main concomitant metals released along with p were also determined for a better understanding of the extraction behavior moreover independent extraction was employed with h2o naoh and hcl as extractants to assess the dissolution profile of p and other metals with respect to different acid base chemistry which further provided data for theoretical calculation of possible p containing phases the solution 31p nmr following naoh edta extraction was adopted to characterize the molecular configuration of p while the p containing phases were detected directly by techniques such as xrd and solid state 31p mas nmr finally after intensive discussion on both experimental results of p speciation and a further theoretical simulation of mineral p this study deduced the possible p containing phases and greatly contributed to explication on the fate of p during soil application of the sewage sludge and its derived biochar besides the intensive interpretation of p speciation this study also proposed a strategy to promote the systematical study with a combination of advanced technologies together with theoretical simulation for further research on transformation of p during waste management 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation the sewage sludge was collected in the year of 2015 from a municipal wastewater treatment plant of shenzhen china and used as raw biomass for the preparation of biochar samples the influent for this plant is a mixture of municipal wastewater and rainfall which shows low carbon but high nitrogen and phosphorus content typically codcr 260 mg l 1 bod5 150 mg l 1 tn 45 mg l 1 tp 5 mg l 1 moreover the plant utilizes primary physical and secondary anaerobic anoxic oxic aao treatments as dominant processes and polyaluminium chloride was added as coagulant the collected sewage sludge is the combined sludge from primary and secondary treatment processes which is dewatered mechanically by centrifugation after dried at 60 c the sludge was ground into fine powder and passed through a 0 15 mm sieve the biochar was produced through pyrolysis of 50 g dry sludge powder each time in a horizontal tube furnace equipped with a quartz tube inner diameter 95 mm outer diameter 100 mm and length 100 cm a high purity n2 flow 400 ml min 1 was first introduced to purge the air in the quartz tube for 1 h before the start of the pyrolysis processes the samples were heated over a pyrolysis temperature range of 200 700 c at a heating rate of 5 c min 1 in the n2 flow after a dwell time of 4 h at the target temperature the samples were then cooled naturally and the obtained sludge biochar referred to as ss200 700 the number represents pyrolysis temperature were ground to fine powder passing through a 0 15 mm sieve the physicochemical properties of the sewage sludge and the sludge biochar have been described in details in our recently published work li et al 2017 which shows that al si fe and p are major inorganic elements in sewage sludge 2 2 measurement of major elements the compositions of major elements in the sewage sludge were determined by x ray fluorescence spectrometry xrf s2 ranger bruker and the results table s1 showed p al ca and fe as major elements which were further considered in the following experiments the total quantity of the relevant elements i e p al ca and fe was determined according to the method in the reference huang and tang 2015 and the results were shown in fig s1 briefly sewage sludge and its derived biochar were combusted at 600 c for 2 h in a muffle furnace and each obtained residue was extracted by hcl 1 m solution for 16 h then the suspension was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and concentrations of p al ca and fe in the filtrate were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes optima 8000 perkinelmer 2 3 sequential fractionation of samples the modified hedley sequential fractionation was employed to differentiate and quantify the major pools of p qian and jiang 2014 wisawapipat et al 2017 0 2 g of each solid sample sewage sludge or sludge biochar was placed into 100 ml centrifuge tube and then extracted at 25 c for 16 h sequentially by 40 ml of h2o nahco3 0 5 m naoh 0 1 m and hcl 1 m after each successive extraction the suspension was centrifuged and separated into supernatant and solid residue the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and stored at 4 c for further analysis whereas the solid residue was used for the next extraction step concentrations of p al ca and fe in the supernatant were determined by icp oes extraction capacity and extraction efficiency were employed as two indices to reflect the extraction performance qian and jiang 2014 huang and tang 2015 the extraction capacity mg g 1 was calculated from the amount of extracted element divided by sample mass whereas the extraction efficiency was obtained by the ratio of extracted to total content of the element in samples 2 4 independent extraction of samples to investigate the solubility of major elements in different acid base environments the sewage sludge and sludge biochar were exposed to h2o naoh 1 m or hcl 1 m separately for independent extraction each sample was mixed with h2o 1 m naoh or 1 m hcl independently at a solid liquid ratio of 0 2 g 40 ml and shaken with a speed of 180 rpm at 25 c for 16 h then the suspension was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and concentrations of p al ca and fe in the filtrate were determined by icp oes 2 5 p extraction for solution 31p nmr analysis for subsequent speciation by solution 31p nmr analysis the widely used naoh edta extraction method huang and tang 2015 was employed in this experiment for p extraction from the sewage sludge and biochar each sample was mixed with a solution containing 0 25 m naoh and 0 05 m edta at a solid liquid ratio of 0 2 g 40 ml and shaken with a speed of 180 rpm at 25 c for 16 h the suspension was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter while 0 6 ml of the filtrate was transferred together with 0 4 ml of d2o to a 5 mm nmr tube for nmr analysis solution 31p nmr spectra were obtained using a bruker ascend 400 spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm broadband probe at operation of 162 mhz for 31p nuclei the nmr parameters were set as follows pulse width of 8 μs 90 pulse delay of 2 0 s acquisition time of 3 4 s dwell time of 51 6 μs number of scans as 16 and broadband proton decoupling at 27 c according to previous study huang and tang 2015 chemical shifts ppm were calibrated by an external standard prepared from 85 h3po4 as 0 ppm 2 6 solid state 31p mas nmr analysis and phase identification by xrd solid state 31p mas nmr spectra with single pulse and cross polarization were acquired on selected samples sewage sludge ss400 and ss700 the single pulse nmr spectra were obtained using bruker ascend 600 spectrometer 243 hz with 31p 90 pulse of 4 μs relaxation delay of 60 s acquisition time of 2 4 ms dwell time of 2 9 μs and number of scans as 12 288 at 30 c the cross polarization nmr spectra were recorded on a bruker avance iii 400 162 mhz spectrometer using proton 90 pulse of 5 μs recycle delay of 4 s acquisition time of 16 ms dwell time of 10 2 μs and number of scans as 2080 at 27 c the xrd patterns of the sewage sludge and sludge biochar were recorded from 10 to 90 2θ at a scan rate of 0 02 s 1 using a rigaku smartlab powder diffractometer with the characteristic cu kα radiation and operating conditions of 35 kv and 40 ma 3 results and discussion 3 1 operational speciation of p together with al ca and fe the hedley sequential fractionation was originally developed to differentiate various pools of p but besides p other elements e g al ca and fe may also be extracted concomitantly turner and leytem 2004 josan et al 2005 hunger et al 2005 he et al 2007 uchimiya and hiradate 2014 thomsen et al 2017 since al ca and fe have been detected as major elements contained in the sludge and its derived biochar their extraction behavior was analyzed together with that of p during sequential fractionation the distribution of p al ca and fe in each extraction step for the sludge and biochar was shown in fig 1 with respect to extraction capacity mg g 1 and extraction efficiency which are defined in experimental section for sewage sludge a very small amount of p was extracted by h2o with extraction capacity of 0 30 mg g 1 and extraction efficiency of 0 94 the extraction capacity and extraction efficiency were detected as 0 073 mg g 1 and 0 14 for al and 1 45 mg g 1 and 11 73 for ca there was no fe detected in the solution extracted by h2o low extraction of p 3 50 mg g 1 10 75 al 0 39 mg g 1 0 72 ca 1 55 mg g 1 12 52 and fe 0 45 mg g 1 1 01 were also observed when the residues were further extracted by nahco3 solution which indicated a relatively low plant available fraction of p in the raw sludge qian and jiang 2014 hunger et al 2005 however when the residues were extracted by naoh the extraction efficiency increased substantially to 64 23 for p and 72 55 for al together with the growth of extraction capacity to 20 88 mg g 1 and 39 32 mg g 1 respectively the extraction of ca was obviously decreased with extraction capacity of 0 25 mg g 1 and extraction efficiency of 2 00 while a very small amount of fe was released with extraction capacity of 0 31 mg g 1 and extraction efficiency of 0 69 moreover the hcl extractable p and al were 3 13 mg g 1 9 62 and 9 84 mg g 1 18 16 concomitant with substantial increase in both ca 5 92 mg g 1 42 97 and fe 34 16 mg g 1 76 54 finally the portion that is recalcitrant to extraction and thus remains in the residues is 14 47 for p 4 70 mg g 1 8 43 for al 4 57 mg g 1 25 77 for ca 3 18 mg g 1 and 21 75 for fe 9 71 mg g 1 therefore most of p and al is naoh extractable while the majority of ca and fe is hcl extractable besides that a considerable amount of ca and fe was also found to remain in the residues after sequential fractionation compared with p pools in sewage sludge reported by qian and jiang 2014 the sludge shows less h2o p 0 30 mg g 1 in this study versus 5 3 mg g 1 in the reference qian and jiang 2014 less nahco3 p 3 50 mg g 1 versus 9 5 mg g 1 and less hcl p 3 13 mg g 1 versus 5 3 mg g 1 but much more naoh p 20 88 mg g 1 versus 6 9 mg g 1 and nearly comparable residue p 4 70 mg g 1 versus 3 9 mg g 1 the extraction behavior of p al ca and fe in the five pools for ss200 700 was also demonstrated in fig 1 the results were discussed extensively in supporting information si and showed a similar release pattern of p al ca and fe between the sludge and biochar the fractions of p al ca and fe extracted by h2o and nahco3 are generally low when compared to other pools most of the p and al were extracted by naoh while the majority of ca and fe were acid extractable or recalcitrant to extraction furthermore when the effect of temperatures was considered on the change of pools with respect to p al ca and fe the amount of h2o extractable and nahco3 extractable p al ca and fe decreased with the elevated pyrolysis temperature moreover naoh extractable p and al increased with decline in ca and fe while hcl extractable p ca and fe increased but al decreased in addition the amount of p al and ca was found to increase but that of fe kept decreasing in the residues it is generally thought that h2o p and nahco3 p can be available to plant in the short term and naoh p in the medium term but hcl p can hardly be absorbed by plant directly qian and jiang 2014 based on results from sequential extraction it appears that p and al are mainly naoh soluble and rather than hcl soluble indicating a relatively stable pool of p but also available to plants to some extent the results also show that the extraction of p increased with pyrolysis temperatures until 500 c and then reached relatively stable afterwards which implies a potential increase in p availability to plant with the elevated pyrolysis temperature samples were usually first attacked by naoh because naoh extraction is ahead of hcl extraction in conventional sequential fractionation however different phenomenon might be observed if the samples were first extracted by hcl and then transferred to naoh extractant especially when the p and al containing phases are amphoteric the extraction by acidic basic extractants has only been done as a part of sequential extraction protocol which may lead to incomplete picture of p solubility and classification as mentioned above therefore it seems necessary to carry out independent extraction to better investigate the extraction behavior of the relevant elements and further deduce the speciation of p in the sludge and its derived biochar 3 2 independent extraction in different acid base environments independent extraction was further performed with h2o 1 m naoh and 1 m hcl representing three typical acid base environments by a combination of results from both sequential and independent extraction a full mapping of p speciation can be obtained fig 2 and fig s2 of si summarized the extraction capacity mg g 1 and extraction efficiency respectively from independent extraction of the sewage sludge and its derived biochar by h2o naoh and hcl in comparison with sequential fractionation similar extraction capacity and efficiency were detected for p al ca and fe when the samples were independently extracted by h2o both extraction capacity and efficiency of p al and ca for the samples were slightly higher in naoh extractant after independent extraction than those derived from naoh extraction in sequential fractionation which might be caused by a higher concentration of naoh for independent extraction or the partial element removal before naoh extraction in sequential fractionation in contrast the extraction capacity and efficiency of fe for both sludge and biochar is obviously lower in independent extraction than the corresponding value in sequential fractionation indicating lower dissolution of fe in solution with higher naoh concentration however when the sludge and biochar were extracted independently by hcl an interesting and distinct phenomenon was observed for the extraction behavior of the elements above besides slightly higher extraction capacity and efficiency of ca and fe in hcl of independent extraction than sequential fractionation for the sewage sludge and ss200 700 a significant amount of p and al were released with extraction capacities of 26 61 46 40 mg g 1 and 44 68 82 55 mg g 1 respectively when the extraction capacities of p and al were compared the amount was dramatically higher by hcl independent extraction than that in hcl of sequential fractionation p 3 13 9 38 mg g 1 al 6 43 9 84 mg g 1 which is mainly due to low p al content in the residue after substantial extraction by naoh ahead of hcl from the results above ca and fe in the sludge and biochar are mainly hcl extractable while p and al containing components can either be extracted by naoh or hcl independently therefore different from dominantly naoh extractable p observed in sequential fractionation a combination of independent and sequential extraction revealed the existence of amphoteric p and al containing phases moreover although p and al can dissolve substantially in naoh or hcl p extracted by naoh is slightly lower than that by hcl in agreement with the previous work dou et al 2000 whereas inversely for al indicating the sensitivity of p and al speciation to different acid base environments furthermore the impact of pyrolysis temperature can also be observed from the extraction capacity and efficiency of p ca and fe as shown in fig 2 and fig s2 the extraction capacity of p by h2o was increased from the sludge to ss200 but declined afterwards which shows an increase in short term p availability after low temperature pyrolysis but the short term availability was decreased with further increase in the pyrolysis temperature besides that the amount of ca extracted by h2o was also found to increase from the sludge to ss200 but decreased eventually with elevated temperatures however when the samples were attracted by naoh or hcl independently the extraction capacities of p al and fe rose up obviously with increasing pyrolysis temperatures moreover a slight increase in the extraction capacity of ca by hcl was observed with elevated temperature which indicates the potential stabilization of ca with pyrolysis processing moreover the extraction efficiencies for p and ca by h2o were found to decrease obviously from ss200 to ss700 with the increase in pyrolysis temperature however in independent extraction by naoh or hcl the extraction efficiencies for p al ca and fe were all found to be relatively stable even with enrichment fig s1 of si due to weight loss during biochar production with elevated temperatures 3 3 molecular configuration of p to explore the molecular configuration of p in the sewage sludge and its derived biochar samples were first extracted by naoh edta and then processed for measurement by solution 31p nmr before the analysis of solution 31p nmr spectra the extraction efficiency was first calculated as an important index to ensure the representativeness of extractable p with respect to the total p and the results were shown in fig 3 a the extraction efficiency is 92 8 for the sewage sludge and then increased with elevated pyrolysis temperature until reaching 97 4 for the ss400 however further increase of pyrolysis temperatures results in a gradual decrease of extraction efficiency to 87 6 for ss700 previous studies have also reported similar variation of extraction efficiencies with elevated temperatures huang and tang 2015 xu et al 2016 which can be ascribed to physical constrains as a result of carbon condensation during pyrolysis huang and tang 2015 the range of extraction efficiency for all samples 84 8 97 4 indicates that p in the extracts constitutes the majority of the total p and thus solution 31p nmr spectra can represent the main information about molecular configuration of p due to high concentrations of p in naoh edta extracts 100 mg l 1 fig s3 the extracts were directly employed for solution 31p nmr analysis without further enrichment and resuspension as shown in fig 3b a sharp peak at 5 ppm was observed without any other observable peaks from the solution 31p nmr spectrum of the sewage sludge indicating inorganic orthophosphate as the dominant molecular configuration of p in the sewage sludge cade menun 2005 the absence of organic p may be ascribed to low content of organic components in the collected sewage sludge for this study li et al 2017 moreover similar solution 31p nmr spectra were also observed for all sludge biochar and further confirmed the persistence of orthophosphates during sludge pyrolysis although other molecular configurations of p have also been reported in sewage sludge qian and jiang 2014 huang and tang 2015 inorganic orthophosphate was identified as the predominant molecular configuration of p in both sludge and derived biochar which is consistent with the findings in this study 3 4 possible p containing phases although alkaline extraction together with solution 31p nmr can determine the molecular configuration of dissolved p they cannot identify p containing phases in original solid samples therefore in this study xrd as well as solid state 31p mas nmr with single pulse and cross polarization was employed for direct identification of possible p containing phases the single pulse mode allows for the detection of all 31p nuclei nonselectively whereas the cross polarization mode enables the selective observation of the 31p nuclei located in close proximity to 1h nuclei within 1 nm frossard et al 2002 a combination of both modes is helpful for a thorough characterization of p species and fig 4 a collates both spectra from single pulse and cross polarization modes of the sewage sludge the resonance centered at chemical shift of 8 0 ppm in single pulse or 3 8 ppm in cross polarization is recognized as the centerband reflecting the isotropic 31p chemical shift while the other resonances spaced symmetrically with respect to centerband are spinning sidebands denoted by asterisks in fig 4a showing chemical shift anisotropy bleam et al 1989 the single pulse spectrum of the sewage sludge has a fairly broad centerband with 13 0 ppm of linewidth at half height and prominent spinning sidebands while the cross polarization spectrum contains a broad centerband half height linewidth 8 2 ppm but with weak spinning sidebands fig 4a the obviously distinctive spectra of single pulse and cross polarization modes indicate the occurrence of at least two different local p environments i e p in some local environment is far from proton while in other local environments is close to proton but with a small fraction for the latter the range of chemical shift for single pulse spectrum shows the presence of mineral aluminum orthophosphates generally 5 ppm bleam et al 1989 mcdowell et al 2002 whereas the range for cross polarization spectrum indicates the existence of mineral calcium orthophosphates generally 5 ppm rothwell et al 1980 belton et al 1988 however precise assignment of calcium or aluminum orthophosphates is difficult due to the broad resonance probably resulting from poorly ordered p minerals or paramagnetic effect bleam et al 1989 moreover the intense and multi order spinning sidebands from single pulse spectrum reflect the large chemical shift anisotropy due to the occurrence of asymmetrically protonated orthophosphate while the small but readily observable sidebands from the cross polarization spectrum can be ascribed to a characteristic structural distortion of symmetrically unprotonated orthophosphate from tetrahedral symmetry tropp et al 1983 furthermore the presence of isotropic resonance and anisotropic sidebands for cross polarization spectrum imply the existence of p in immediate proximity to proton but not protonated e g orthophosphate bound by hydrogen bonds to nearly water molecules in the sample hunger et al 2004 as for the sludge biochar no p signal can be detected from solid state 31p mas nmr with both single pulse and cross polarization modes which might be due to the strong paramagnetic linebroading of enriched fe in the sludge biochar fig s1 hinedi et al 1989 hunger et al 2005 the loss of p signal in spectrum of cross polarization may be additionally attributed to the removal of hydrogen in close vicinity to p during pyrolysis in addition xrd patterns of the sludge and biochar were collected and shown in fig 4b from the results of phase identification poorly crystallized alpo4 can be detected in the sludge in agreement with orthophosphate as dominant molecular configuration of p in solution 31p nmr fig 3b and the existence of aluminum orthophosphate from solid state 31p mas nmr fig 4a for the sludge the alpo4 was also detected in the sludge biochar which is consistent with the dominant molecular configuration of p as orthophosphate in solution 31p nmr for the sludge biochar fig 3b moreover quartz was also observed as one major phase in the sewage sludge and biochar but kaolinite disappeared at higher temperatures 500 c due to thermal decomposition sperinck et al 2011 3 5 theoretical prediction of p containing minerals from results depicted above inorganic orthophosphates were observed as dominant molecular configurations of p for the sludge and biochar from solution 31p nmr analysis while the existence of calcium and aluminum orthophosphates can be suggested from solid state 31p mas nmr but with difficulties for their specific assignment although alpo4 was clearly detected by xrd other p containing phases may also be present given that the extraction of p is always accompanied by concomitant release of al ca and fe in both sequential fractionation and independent extraction with different solubility of elements above in different acid base extractants figs 1 and 2 the p containing minerals can be possibly expected by comparing the experimental solubility with theoretically simulated solubility of assumed known minerals at different phs this idea has already been applied to characterize the p speciation in sludge amended soils by hinedi and chang 1989 with carbonated apatite as the possible p containing phase in this section the presence of mineral p was predicted by comparing the extraction behavior of p al ca and fe in independent extraction with the solubility of common al p ca p and fe p minerals at different phs since similar extraction behavior has been observed for the sewage sludge and biochar the theoretical simulation based on the extraction data of sewage sludge is representative for the prediction of p containing minerals the procedure of theoretical simulation was described in the supporting information si and the results were discussed as following for al p the common crystalline variscite alpo4 2h2o and amorphous variscite alpo4 1 5h2o are completely dissolved at ph 0 and ph 14 but virtually no dissolution at ph 7 which corresponds well to the simultaneously substantial extraction of p and al in 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh but little extraction in h2o for ca p only the theoretical solubility of amorphous ca3 po4 2 is consistent with that of experimental extraction for p and ca i e large solubility in acid medium in h2o and small in base for fe p the experimental extraction of p and fe does not conform to solubility of common iron orthophosphate and probably indicate the absence of fe p minerals in the samples based on the above results the possible p containing minerals in the sludge were predicted as variscite alpo4 2h2o and alpo4 1 5h2o and amorphous ca3 po4 2 which is in agreement with the existence of alpo4 from xrd results due to the similar extraction behavior of relevant elements between the sludge and biochar minerals like berlinite alpo4 and amorphous ca3 po4 2 may also exist but with enrichment in the sludge biochar due to weight loss during pyrolysis processes 4 conclusions knowledge of p speciation is of vital importance for further recycle and reclamation of p in the sewage sludge and its derived biochar when applied as soil amendments although the speciation of p has been previously investigated in literatures with a variety of methods the results obtained in this work fig 5 proved that it is critical to conduct a systematic study combining conventional extraction advanced analytical techniques and theoretical simulation to achieve a comprehensive understanding of p speciation the results obtained from sequential fractionation and independent extraction revealed that the order in sequential fractionation may result in misleading information on p solubility in extractants and thus lead to incorrect explanation on the environmental behavior of p for example conventional sequential fractionation shows that p is dominantly naoh soluble but independent extraction demonstrates that p can be substantially extracted by both naoh and hcl extractants previous studies only investigated the behavior of p in sequential fractionation however consideration of other metals e g al ca fe extracted along with p seems helpful to better understand the speciation of p containing phases although solution 31p nmr is widely employed for speciation analysis of p it can only offer information on molecular configuration of p but failed to provide insight into the identification of exact p containing phases which are more decisive to control the environmental behavior of p the results from solution and solid state 31p nmr showed the possible existence of aluminum and calcium orthophosphate while the xrd technology clearly detected the poorly crystallized alpo4 furthermore by combining the experimental results together with theoretical simulation of mineral p results summarized in fig 5 revealed the existence of mineral variscite berlinite amorphous ca3 po4 2 in the sludge and biochar besides the systematic explication on p speciation through methods including conventional extraction advanced techniques and theoretical calculation this study also contributed to a comprehensive understanding on the environmental behavior of p and further promoted the waste to resource strategy for sewage sludge and its derived biochar during soil application

19531,n nitrosodimethylamine ndma a probable human carcinogen disinfection by product has been detected in chloraminated drinking water systems understanding its formation over time is important to control ndma levels in distribution systems the main objectives of this study were to investigate the role of chloramine species i e monochloramine and dichloramine and the factors such as ph sulfate and natural organic matter nom influencing the formation of ndma five ndma precursors i e dimethylamine dma trimethylamine tma n n dimethylisopropylamine dmipa n n dimethylbenzylamine dmbza and ranitidine rntd were carefully selected based on their chemical structures and exposed to varying ratios of monochloramine and dichloramine all amine precursors reacted relatively fast to form ndma and reached their maximum ndma yields within 24 h in the presence of excess levels of chloramines both mono and dichloramine or excess levels of dichloramine conditions with limited monochloramine when the formation of dichloramine was suppressed i e only monochloramine existed in the system over the 5 day contact time ndma formation from dma tma and dmipa was drastically reduced 0 under monochloramine abundant conditions however dmbza and rntd showed 40 and 90 ndma conversions at the end of 5 day contact time respectively with slow formation rates indicating that while these amine precursors react preferentially with dichloramine to form ndma they can also react with monochloramine in the absence of dichloramine nom and ph influenced dichloramine levels that affected ndma yields nom had an adverse effect on ndma formation as it created a competition with ndma precursors for dichloramine sulfate did not increase the ndma formation from the two selected ndma precursors ph played a key role as it influenced both chloramine speciation and protonation state of amine precursors and the highest ndma formation was observed at the ph range where dichloramine and deprotonated amines coexisted in selected natural water and wastewater samples dichloramine led to the formation of more ndma than monochloramine graphical abstract image 1 keywords ndma

drawn the most attention due to its frequent detection and elevated concentrations russell et al 2012 although there are currently no federal regulations for nitrosamines in drinking water in the

a function of time is essential to develop feasible and effective strategies for controlling ndma and other nitrosamines in drinking water distribution systems in the literature dichloramine has been recognized as the reactive chloramine species to form ndma from different precursors huang et al 2018 mccurry et al 2017 mitch et al 2009 2005 schreiber and mitch 2006 shen and andrews 2013 and subsequent work indicated that minimizing dichloramine formation has reduced ndma formation during drinking water and wastewater chloramination mitch et al 2005 mccurry et al 2017 furthermore in other studies monochloramine was identified to lead to ndma formation from ranitidine rntd le roux et al 2012 2011 liu et al 2014 selbes et al 2013 however the role of mono or dichloramine was not sufficiently examined in terms of ndma formation rates from model precursors with different chemical structures it has been reported that the ndma formation in natural and wastewater impacted waters was relatively slow and further ndma could continue to form in distribution systems with increasing water age i e a plateau was reached after 150 200 h of chloramine contact time barrett et al 2003 charrois and hrudey 2007 krasner et al 2010 russell et al 2012 sacher et al 2008 since various precursors with different reactivity are present in source waters it is not simple to predict which major factors would determine ndma formation rates only a few studies have investigated the ndma formation rates from model compounds i e dma rntd chlorphenamine and doxylamine krasner et al 2010 padhye et al 2013 shen and andrews 2013 2011b these studies showed that the ndma formation reached the plateau after 24 h during chloramination furthermore these studies focusing on specific model compounds have investigated the role of various factors influencing the ndma formation i the effect of temperature and ph with rntd krasner et al 2010 and ii the effect of nom and ph with selected pharmaceuticals including rntd shen and andrews 2011b it has been reported that temperature can affect both stability and the reactivity of chloramines krasner et al 2010 the ndma formation from rntd was found to be relatively constant independent of either temperature 5 vs 25 c or ph 7 vs 8 vs 9 krasner et al 2010 at low temperatures due to reduced chloramine reactivity toward nom chloramines became more available to react with ndma precursors a study reported a decrease in ndma formation from rntd in the presence of nom which was attributed to the decreased availability of chloramine species shen and andrews 2011b despite these previous studies there is limited information on the impact of some key background water chemistry parameters i e ph nom temperature on the chloramine speciation and ndma formation as a function of time moreover findings from selected model precursor compounds so far have been insufficient to explain the observed ndma formation trends i e the ndma

and selected background water matrix components i e ph sulfate and nom in the formation of ndma from dma and selected tertiary amine precursors dma and four tertiary amines were carefully selected based on their chemical structures and the ndma formation as a function of time was monitored during four parallel experiments with varying amounts of dichloramine then given their reactivity with each chloramine species two amines were selected to examine the effects of ph sulfate and nom on the ndma formation chloramine speciation can be an important factor controlling the ndma formation rate

sds experiments with an initial dichloramine dose of 3 mg l additional information about the chloramine chemistry is provided in the supporting information text s1 since sulfate can contribute to decay of chloramines vikesland et al 2001 ammonium chloride was used in all of the sds experiments to achieve excess ammonia and in the preparation of chloramine stock chloramine species and their

the sds experiments the preformed monochloramine stock solution was prepared by mixing diluted sodium hypochlorite and ammonium chloride solutions at cl2 n mass ratio of 4 1 at ph 9 to prepare dichloramine stock solutions monochloramine stock solution was prepared as described above followed by gradual adjustment of its ph to 3 5 4 0 by using hydrochloric acid pre determined amount of preformed chloramine solution monochloramine or dichloramine was spiked into eight identical amber bottles which were opened at 3 6 12 24 48 72 and 120 h to measure ndma formation and residual chloramines the factors that may influence chloramine decomposition and speciation were assessed under sds conditions for two model precursors dmipa and rntd the effect of nom was investigated in background solutions that were prepared using raw collected from the influent and treated waters collected between coagulation flocculation sedimentation and filtration obtained from a drinking water treatment plant dwtp water samples were filtered immediately with pre washed 0 2 μm polyethersulfone filters dissolved organic carbon doc levels of the nom solutions were adjusted to 1 5 2 5 and 5 0 mg c l by diluting with ddw selected characteristics of nom solutions are shown in table 1 for the ph effect on ndma formation sds tests were conducted at ph 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 the effect of sulfate was investigated in ddw by spiking sodium sulfate to achieve 10 25 and 50 mg l sulfate concentrations in order to investigate the ndma formation in natural waters dwtp raw and treated water samples were used without any dilution moreover a ww impacted creek was selected and samples were collected at three different locations i e upstream of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp wwtp effluent and 8 4 km downstream from the ww discharge point further details of the watershed can be found elsewhere gan et al 2013a 2013b selected characteristics of natural water samples are also given in table 1 the initial chloramine concentrations i e either 3 or 100 mg l were enough to provide an excess amount of chloramine for all tests i e ddw or natural samples during the 5 day reaction time all of the ndma formation tests were conducted in 1 l amber glass bottles without headspace and stored in the dark at 22 c 2 3 analytical methods ndma was analyzed following us epa method 521 us epa 2004 consisting

cartridges preconditioned with dichloromethane methanol and ddw the cartridges were dried with air and then eluted with dichloromethane eluents were passed through sodium sulfate columns to remove residual moisture and then concentrated to 1 ml under a gentle stream of high purity nitrogen gas the extracts were spiked with ndpa d14 as an internal standard and analyzed using a varian gc 3800 ms

due to multiple analysis n 2 anova was performed using origin pro to assess the statistical differences between the results of data sets examples of the analysis are provided in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 ndma conversion from selected model compounds fig 2 shows the ndma molar conversion yields from dma and four tertiary amines over reaction time under four different chloramination conditions fp sds sds with monochloramine in the presence of excess background ammonia and sds with dichloramine in the fp tests an excessive dose of chloramine i e 100 mg l resulted in sufficient levels of both monochloramine 95 and dichloramine 5 at ph 7 5 to form ndma from selected amines under the fp test conditions the ndma formation rates from all five model compounds were relatively fast in general the maximum ndma formation was achieved within 24 h of chloramination although further increases up to 120 h were observed only from tma fig 2b and dmipa fig 2c the ndma yields obtained at 120 h of contact time for the five model precursors were comparable to those reported in the literature huang et al 2018 le roux et al 2012 lee et al 2007 mitch et al 2009 sacher et al 2008 selbes et al 2014 2013 shen and andrews 2011a 2011b spahr et al 2017 the differences of ndma yields observed in our study vs those reported in the literature were attributed to some differences in experimental conditions e g reaction time chloramine dose buffer stoichiometric ratio of oxidant to precursor etc the ndma formation rates for dma fig 2a tma fig 2b and dmipa fig 2c were significantly affected by dichloramine concentrations the higher ndma yields were observed in the sds with dichloramine and fp test experiments i e more dichloramine was present in the fp experiment the decomposition of monochloramine formed a maximum of 5 mg l dichloramine along with the formation rates the ndma conversion yields also decreased as dichloramine levels decreased e g 57 and 84 for dmipa 0 3 and 1 7 for tma 0 8 and 1 1 for dma under sds and fp conditions respectively on the other hand under sds conditions in the presence of excess background ammonia where almost no dichloramine existed in the system ndma barely formed from those three amine precursors dmipa tma and dma suggesting that dichloramine is the more favorable species to form ndma than monochloramine and the ndma formation was controlled by the decomposition of monochloramine to dichloramine the ndma formation rates for these three amines dramatically increased under sds with dichloramine only especially for tma fig 2b and dma fig 2c their ndma molar conversions were even greater than those under the fp tests within 24 h on the contrary the ndma formation rates for dmbza fig 2d and rntd fig 2e showed very similar patterns in both fp and sds tests although slightly higher yields were achieved under fp conditions at the end of 5 days contact time in the absence of dichloramine i e dichloramine formation suppressed by excess background ammonia considerable ndma formed from dmbza and rntd suggesting monochloramine reacts with these amines to form ndma similarly it has been reported that rntd can form ndma by the reaction with monochloramine le roux et al 2012 liu et al 2014 selbes et al 2013 however the ndma formation from dmbza and rntd was slower than those when dichloramine was present i e sds test interestingly under sds with preformed dichloramine ndma formed very fast from dmbza and rntd the formation rates were comparable with those under fp tests indicating that the reaction rates of dichloramine with any amine precursors are always faster than those of monochloramine and only some amine precursors e g dbmza and rntd can also react with monochloramine to form ndma although the formation rate for the reaction between monochloramine and rntd was slower than that between dichloramine and rntd fig 2e the ndma conversion yield in the fp test was almost same as that in the sds test in the presence of excess ammonia at 120 h contact time indicating that both monochloramine and dichloramine can react with rntd to form ndma with different reaction rates it is important to note that all chloramine species including mono di and trichloramine are in equilibrium reactions and trace concentrations of dichloramine can be present even if dichloramine is not detected i e sds test with monochloramine in the presence of excess ammonia the standard method 4500 cl f method and uv spectrophotometer 5 cm cuvette used for the detection of dichloramine have minimum reporting levels of 0 05 mg l dichloramine it is possible that some trace concentrations of dichloramine may be present even under the conditions of the sds test in the presence of excess ammonia which may have contributed to some ndma formation from rntd and dmbza however if trace amounts of dichloramine were resulting in ndma formation from rntd and dmbza this effect would have been observed in other precursors such as in dmipa fig 3 c sds in the presence of excess background ammonia given that ndma barely formed from dmipa tma and dma under the sds conditions in the presence of excess background ammonia the high ndma yields observed from rntd and dmbza under the same test conditions would be mainly formed by monochloramine therefore the findings of our study indicate that dichloramine is more reactive species to form ndma from tertiary amine precursors as reported in the literature huang et al 2018 mccurry et al 2017 mitch et al 2005 schreiber and mitch 2006 shen and andrews 2013 however ndma can also form from the reactions with monochloramine depending on the precursor structure le roux et al 2012 2011 liu et al 2014 selbes et al 2013 in our previous research we found that in sds tests with and without ammonia dma tma and dmipa were dichloramine reactive while dmbza and rntd were monochloramine reactive selbes et al 2013 consistently in the present study dma tma and dmipa were found to be dichloramine reactive and the additional data collected over 120 h in different mono and dichloramine conditions allowed us to further refine the findings and show that both mono and dichloramine can contribute to ndma formation from dmbza and rntd the higher reactivity of dichloramine to form ndma can be attributed to more partial positive charge on nitrogen atom due to two neighboring chlorine atoms than that of monochloramine with only one chlorine fig s5 nitrogen atom of tertiary amines would always be partially negative due to two neighboring methyl functional groups during a nucleophilic substitution therefore bonding between nitrogen atoms of amine and dichloramine would form first because of partially more positive charge on nitrogen of dichloramine overall the results suggest that the ndma formation from the reaction of amine compounds with chloramines is dependent on the dichloramine concentration and higher concentrations of dichloramine increases ndma formation rates however monochloramine can also form ndma depending on the precursor s structure if available dichloramine is limited in the literature several ndma formation pathways have been proposed involving either monochloramine le roux et al 2012 2011 liu et al 2014 selbes et al 2013 or dichloramine huang et al 2018 mccurry et al 2017 mitch et al 2009 schreiber and mitch 2006 shen and andrews 2013 and in all studies the first reaction is the nucleophilic substitution findings of our study indicate a potential reactivity of rntd with both monochloramine and dichloramine the questions to how both chloramine species can react with rntd are still outstanding further research is required to examine formation pathways and identify the intermediates formed during the reactions 3 2 factors influencing ndma conversion yields 3 2 1 the nom effect to investigate the nom effect on the ndma formation rates raw and treated water samples collected from a dwtp were used as background matrices hydrophobic hpo organic matter is typically the major fraction of nom in raw waters while nom in treated waters i e after coagulation flocculation sedimentation contains mostly transphilic tph and hydrophilic hpi organic matter croué et al 1993 karanfil et al 2007 kim and yu 2005 thus selected amines spiked in raw and treated waters could react and or compete with nom i e hpo tph and hpi toward ndma formation nom characteristics may play an important role in either enhancement or reduction of ndma formation in natural water systems the ndma molar conversion yields from rntd and dmipa as a function of reaction time at different doc levels of raw and treated waters are given in fig 3 for dwtp treated water there was a slight decrease in ndma conversion yields from rntd as doc increased fig 3a the formation of ndma from rntd proceeded faster in ddw than in the presence of 1 0 mg c l and 2 5 mg c l of doc particularly during the first 24 h of reaction time for instance the ndma yields were 61 9 and 2 for ddw treated 1 0 mg c l and treated 2 5 mg c l at 6 h respectively while these conversion rates were 74 70 and 26 at 12 h fig 3a the maximum yield from rntd occurred at 24 h for ddw and treated 1 0 mg c l while it happened at 48 h for treated 2 5 mg c l despite the slower conversion rate the presence of doc caused no significant effect on the formation of ndma from rntd during the experiment enough monochloramine was available and the concentration of dichloramine remained 0 10 mg l table s6 on the other hand the ndma conversion yields from dmipa were reduced drastically in the presence of tph and hpi dominated nom fig 3b the ndma yields for 120 h of contact time decreased from 56 9 which was in ddw to 32 0 and 9 1 at 1 0 and 2 5 mg c l doc respectively more specifically decreases in ndma yields are probably due to the competition of nom with dmipa for dichloramine since rntd could also react with monochloramine to form ndma the drastic reduction of ndma formation was observed only from dmipa overall these results indicate that nom could reduce available dichloramine resulting in less ndma formation this nom effect however can be insignificant for certain precursors which can react with both monochloramine and dichloramine to form ndma when dwtp raw water containing hpo dominated nom was used as the background matrix the ndma conversion yield from rntd decreased as doc levels increased fig 3c the ndma conversion yield from rntd in the absence of nom reached the maximum 85 within 24 h while slightly slower conversion was observed in the presence of nom at 1 0 mg c l of doc when the doc concentration increased to 2 5 mg c l the maximum yield 71 of ndma did not reach the level 85 observed in ddw even after 120 h of contact time at 5 0 mg c l of doc however the ndma conversion was significantly suppressed and its maximum was only 7 4 after 120 h of chloramination nom in raw water caused more drastic decreases in the ndma conversion yield from rntd than nom in treated water indicating that nom characteristics in natural water also influence the ndma formation slightly higher decay of chloramines was observed in raw water than treated water table s6 dwtp raw water had higher aromatic components than the treated water according to their suva254 values 3 3 and 1 7 l mg m respectively therefore the concentration of aromatic compounds in natural water may also influence the ndma formation during chloramination of amines similar decreases in the formation of ndma were reported when river water with 6 2 mg c l of doc and 2 3 l mg m of suva254 was used shen and andrews 2011b however the changes of the ndma conversion in their study were not as drastic as the results in our study which may be due to the difference in the suva254 values as for the importance of suva254 in the ndma formation it has been found that aromatic amines can undergo reversible covalent bonding with carbonyls and quinones which are present in nom text s2 chen 2007 parris 1980 thorn et al 1996 weber et al 1996 and consequently the precursor initial contact with chloramines can be hindered shen and andrews 2011b some preliminary data supporting this hypothesis are given in text s3 it should be noted that there are other functional groups in nom that may have caused this hindrance which would require further research the ndma molar conversion of dmipa was slightly higher in treated water fig 3b than in raw water fig 3d the ndma yields at 120 h decreased as doc increased in both treated and raw waters indicating that there is less interaction between hpo fraction of nom and dmipa an aliphatic amine than between hpo and rntd an aromatic amine the nom effect on the ndma conversion and the interaction of nom fractions with aliphatic and aromatic amines warrants further investigations with various precursors in different water matrices to better understand the ndma formation mechanism in natural water systems overall these results suggest that the presence of nom may decrease the formation of ndma in distribution systems when certain precursors are present e g dmipa hpo fraction of nom can be more effective than thp to reduce the ndma formation probably due to its covalent binding capability with aromatic amines and also creating a competition for dichloramine although the majority of the hpo fraction is removed during coagulation flocculation sedimentation processes the remaining tph fraction of nom may also decrease the ndma formation by competing with precursors toward dichloramine for both nom fractions higher doc levels showed more decreases in the ndma formation via covalent binding or creating a competition for dichloramine however high doc levels are associated with the formation of regulated carbonaceous dbps such as trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids during free chlorine application prior to ammonia addition 3 2 2 the ph effect the effect of ph 6 5 8 5 on the ndma conversion from rntd and dmipa was investigated and the results are shown in fig 4 changing ph did not cause statistically meaningful changes in the ndma formation from rntd probably due to rntd s high ndma formation within the first 24 h under sds conditions table s3 the ndma formation from rntd at ph 7 5 was slightly faster than at ph 6 5 or 8 5 which is in good agreement with a previous study shen and andrews 2013 on the other hand distinct changes were observed for the ndma formation from dmipa under different ph conditions the ndma conversion yields from dmipa at 120 h were highest 56 9 at ph 7 5 an increase or decrease in ph adversely affected the ndma formation rate the ndma yield was decreased to 7 6 and 35 4 when ph was changed from 7 5 to 6 5 and 8 5 respectively assuming that ndma forms via nucleophilic substitution of dichloramine with deprotonated amines rntd and dmipa mitch et al 2009 schreiber and mitch 2006 the highest ndma yield is expected to be observed at an optimum ph where both dichloramine and deprotonated amine species may coexist and consequently enhancing the reaction kinetics towards the ndma formation shen and andrews 2013 2011b for example dichloramine is the dominant chloramine species at ph 3 0 4 0 text s1 and pka of dmipa is 10 3 selbes et al 2014 therefore the highest ndma yield from dmipa was achieved at ph 7 5 which is an optimal ph condition for the maximum coexistence of dichloramine and deprotonated dmipa 3 2 3 the sulfate effect it has been known that sulfate bicarbonate and phosphate can facilitate transformation of monochloramine to dichloramine valentine and jafver 1988 vikesland et al 2001 the presence of those ions would increase dichloramine concentrations and consequently the ndma conversion yields could also increase from some amine precursors which react preferentially with dichloramine to form ndma to investigate the anion effect on the ndma formation sulfate was chosen since it is introduced during coagulation with alum in conventional drinking water treatment sds tests were performed in the presence of sulfate at three different concentrations i e 10 25 and 50 mg l with rntd and dmipa and the results are presented in fig 5 sulfate did not cause statistically significant changes in the ndma formation from rntd probably due to rntd s high ndma formation within the first 24 h under sds conditions table s4 similarly sulfate caused no significant changes in the formation of ndma from dmipa text s5 fig 5 similar patterns of conversion curves observed at different sulfate concentrations indicate that the ndma formation from dmipa was still limited by dichloramine concentration the overall ndma yields at 120 h increased up to 79 4 as sulfate was added although the initial chloramine dose in the sds tests was much lower than the fp experiments the ndma conversion yield from dmipa after 120 h in the presence of 50 mg l sulfate reached 80 which is close to the maximum level observed from the fp test these results suggest that introducing sulfate during coagulation or phosphate during corrosion inhibitor addition or bicarbonate addition during recarbonation may increase the ndma formation as a result of enhanced chloramine decomposition valentine and jafver 1988 vikesland et al 2001 3 3 case studies the ndma formation as a function of time was also examined in natural water samples under three different chloramination conditions i e fp sds and sds in the presence of excess ammonia table 2 3 3 1 drinking water treatment plant in the fp experiment with both raw and treated waters the ndma formation was rapid within the initial 24 h of chloramination and then increased gradually until 120 h of chloramination yielding 59 and 45 ng l of ndma respectively the difference in ndma fp values of raw and treated waters corresponds to a 24 reduction in ndma precursors this is in good agreement with a recent study reporting that coagulation flocculation sedimentation without any polymer influence resulted in 9 23 reduction in ndma fp uzun et al 2017 the ndma formation in raw water under sds conditions was below mrl while up to 9 ng l of ndma was observed in treated water at 120 h of chloramination doc decreased from 6 3 mg c l to 2 8 mg c l after coagulation flocculation sedimentation and thus the competition between nom and amine precursors toward dichloramine might also decrease and consequently more dichloramine could be available leading to higher ndma formation in addition since alum was used at this dwtp as the coagulant increased sulfate 6 3 mg l in raw and 36 8 mg l in treated water could also contribute to dichloramine levels leading to higher ndma formation under sds conditions to further examine the alum effect on the ndma formation dwtp raw water was spiked with 50 mg l of sulfate and was subjected to the sds test in the presence of sulfate however the ndma formation was still below mrl data not shown indicating that introduction of sulfate in the coagulation process did not affect the ndma formation this suggests that doc was more responsible than sulfate for the ndma formation in the treated water used in the present study the importance of doc and the ndma formation curve over the contact time under sds conditions indicate that i the ndma formation is limited by the transformation of monochloramine to dichloramine and ii ndma can continue to form as long as there is residual chloramine present under sds conditions in the presence of excess ammonia the ndma formation in both raw and treated water samples was below mrl indicating that in this water source there are a negligible amount of precursors which can potentially react with monochloramine 3 3 2 wastewater impacted watershed with samples collected from three sampling locations i e upstream discharge and downstream of a wwtp the formation of ndma was monitored as a function of time upstream samples represented pristine source water with minimal anthropogenic impact the ndma fp for this location was 23 ng l after 120 h of chloramination while under sds conditions only 7 ng l of ndma formed in the presence of excess ammonia 5 ng l of ndma formed within the first 3 h and remained constant afterwards on the other hand very high levels of ndma fp were observed in the samples collected at ww discharge point 1316 ng l and 1659 ng l at 3 h and 120 h of chloramination respectively under sds conditions however only 5 ng l of ndma formed within the first 3 h and ndma formation increased to 16 ng l after 120 h since this yield was much lower than expected a ww sample was diluted with ddw at several different ratios and chloraminated under sds conditions in attempting to explain this anomaly more dilution resulted in more ndma yields getting closer to the values under fp tests fig s6 reduced concentration of organics i e doc due to dilution would lead to less competition with precursors toward dichloramine consequently more available dichloramine would react with precursors to form more ndma the ndma formation caused by monochloramine i e under sds with excess ammonia was 7 ng l at 3 h and remained until 120 h these findings indicate that dichloramine was more important species than monochloramine for the ndma formation in this ww matrix which is consistent with the findings reported in the literature mitch et al 2005 mccurry et al 2017 downstream ndma fp was 94 ng l at 3 h of chloramination and additional ndma up to 149 ng l formed with further exposure to chloramine under sds test conditions without ammonia ndma formed gradually over contact time reaching 102 ng l at 120 h which was close to ndma fp 149 ng l the ndma formation caused by monochloramine i e under sds with excess ammonia was 5 ng l at 3 h and remained the same until 120 h once again these findings indicate that dichloramine is more important species than monochloramine for the ndma formation however monochloramine may also lead to formation of some ndma 4 conclusions the ndma formation as a function of time from dma and four tertiary amines was examined under four chloramination conditions i e fp sds sds in the presence of excess ammonia and sds with preformed dichloramine to understand the role of chloramine species in the ndma formation during fp test and sds test with preformed dichloramine having sufficient dichloramine concentrations in the system the ndma formation rates were relatively fast reaching a plateau approximately within initial 24 h of chloramination however when much lower level of dichloramine was applied i e sds test the ndma formation rates from dma tma and dmipa were noticeably reduced while the effect of dichloramine on dmbza and rntd was less significant when only monochloramine existed i e dichloramine formation suppressed by excess ammonia in the system the ndma formation from dma tma and dmipa was negligible the ndma formation rates were reduced with monochloramine from dmbza and rntd indicating that dichloramine is more important chloramine species for ndma formation from these precursors as well over the extended contact time monochloramine reacted with rntd and dmbza to form ndma reaching comparable yields to dichloramine present conditions but the reaction rates for dichloramine was faster than those for monochloramine from the experiments with selected model precursors dichloramine was found to be more reactive species to form ndma from the selected precursors however monochloramine can also lead to the ndma formation from certain precursors such as rntd and dmbza even in the absence of dichloramine the ndma formation from both dmipa and rntd was reduced in the presence of nom probably due to less available dichloramine caused by the reactions between nom and dichloramine and or precursors binding with nom ph played a key role as it influenced both chloramine speciation and protonation state of amine precursors sulfate had no effect on ndma formation from dmipa and rntd dichloramine limited conditions therefore would be beneficial to control the ndma formation from precursors which react exclusively with dichloramine dichloramine also lead to higher ndma formation than monochloramine in both drinking water and wastewater impacted water systems tested in this study acknowledgments this work was

19531,n nitrosodimethylamine ndma a probable human carcinogen disinfection by product has been detected in chloraminated drinking water systems understanding its formation over time is important to control ndma levels in distribution systems the main objectives of this study were to investigate the role of chloramine species i e monochloramine and dichloramine and the factors such as ph sulfate and natural organic matter nom influencing the formation of ndma five ndma precursors i e dimethylamine dma trimethylamine tma n n dimethylisopropylamine dmipa n n dimethylbenzylamine dmbza and ranitidine rntd were carefully selected based on their chemical structures and exposed to varying ratios of monochloramine and dichloramine all amine precursors reacted relatively fast to form ndma and reached their maximum ndma yields within 24 h in the presence of excess levels of chloramines both mono and dichloramine or excess levels of dichloramine conditions with limited monochloramine when the formation of dichloramine was suppressed i e only monochloramine existed in the system over the 5 day contact time ndma formation from dma tma and dmipa was drastically reduced 0 under monochloramine abundant conditions however dmbza and rntd showed 40 and 90 ndma conversions at the end of 5 day contact time respectively with slow formation rates indicating that while these amine precursors react preferentially with dichloramine to form ndma they can also react with monochloramine in the absence of dichloramine nom and ph influenced dichloramine levels that affected ndma yields nom had an adverse effect on ndma formation as it created a competition with ndma precursors for dichloramine sulfate did not increase the ndma formation from the two selected ndma precursors ph played a key role as it influenced both chloramine speciation and protonation state of amine precursors and the highest ndma formation was observed at the ph range where dichloramine and deprotonated amines coexisted in selected natural water and wastewater samples dichloramine led to the formation of more ndma than monochloramine graphical abstract image 1 keywords ndma

a function of time is essential to develop feasible and effective strategies for controlling ndma and other nitrosamines in drinking water distribution systems in the literature dichloramine has been recognized as the reactive chloramine species to form ndma from different precursors huang et al 2018 mccurry et al 2017 mitch et al 2009 2005 schreiber and mitch 2006 shen and andrews 2013 and subsequent work indicated that minimizing dichloramine formation has reduced ndma formation during drinking water and wastewater chloramination mitch et al 2005 mccurry et al 2017 furthermore in other studies monochloramine was identified to lead to ndma formation from ranitidine rntd le roux et al 2012 2011 liu et al 2014 selbes et al 2013 however the role of mono or dichloramine was not sufficiently examined in terms of ndma formation rates from model precursors with different chemical structures it has been reported that the ndma formation in natural and wastewater impacted waters was relatively slow and further ndma could continue to form in distribution systems with increasing water age i e a plateau was reached after 150 200 h of chloramine contact time barrett et al 2003 charrois and hrudey 2007 krasner et al 2010 russell et al 2012 sacher et al 2008 since various precursors with different reactivity are present in source waters it is not simple to predict which major factors would determine ndma formation rates only a few studies have investigated the ndma formation rates from model compounds i e dma rntd chlorphenamine and doxylamine krasner et al 2010 padhye et al 2013 shen and andrews 2013 2011b these studies showed that the ndma formation reached the plateau after 24 h during chloramination furthermore these studies focusing on specific model compounds have investigated the role of various factors influencing the ndma formation i the effect of temperature and ph with rntd krasner et al 2010 and ii the effect of nom and ph with selected pharmaceuticals including rntd shen and andrews 2011b it has been reported that temperature can affect both stability and the reactivity of chloramines krasner et al 2010 the ndma formation from rntd was found to be relatively constant independent of either temperature 5 vs 25 c or ph 7 vs 8 vs 9 krasner et al 2010 at low temperatures due to reduced chloramine reactivity toward nom chloramines became more available to react with ndma precursors a study reported a decrease in ndma formation from rntd in the presence of nom which was attributed to the decreased availability of chloramine species shen and andrews 2011b despite these previous studies there is limited information on the impact of some key background water chemistry parameters i e ph nom temperature on the chloramine speciation and ndma formation as a function of time moreover findings from selected model precursor compounds so far have been insufficient to explain the observed ndma formation trends i e the ndma formation over time and the role of chloramine species in natural water samples the main objective of this study was to investigate the roles of chloramine species i e monochloramine vs dichloramine and selected background water matrix components i e ph sulfate and nom in the formation of ndma from dma and selected tertiary amine precursors dma and four tertiary amines were carefully selected based on their chemical structures and the ndma formation as a function of time was monitored during four parallel experiments with varying amounts of dichloramine then given their reactivity with each chloramine species two amines were selected to examine the effects of ph sulfate and nom on the ndma formation chloramine speciation can be an important factor controlling the ndma formation rate in natural water samples with a variety of precursors present thus the role of monochloramine vs dichloramine was also investigated in selected natural waters a drinking water system i e before and after treatment and a wastewater ww impacted water system i e before and after ww confluence 2 materials and methods 2 1 amine precursors the selected amines for the study are shown in fig 1 all

rntd was in the hydrochloride solid powder form while the other amines were in liquid form 2 2 experimental procedure a stock solution 4 mm of each amine was prepared in methanol and stored in an amber glass bottle at 4 c until use each model compound was diluted to 200 nm in distilled and deionized water ddw the role of chloramine species was investigated by conducting four parallel experiments i formation potential fp experiments with an initial monochloramine dose of 100 mg l ii simulated distribution system sds experiments with an initial dose of 3 mg l monochloramine iii sds experiments with an initial dose of 3 mg l monochloramine in the presence of 100 mg l background ammonia which was added to suppress the transformation of monochloramine to dichloramine eq 1 and iv sds experiments with an initial dichloramine dose of 3 mg l additional information about the chloramine chemistry is provided in the supporting information text s1 since sulfate can contribute to decay of chloramines vikesland et al 2001 ammonium chloride was used in all of the sds experiments to achieve excess ammonia and in the preparation of chloramine stock chloramine species and their concentrations in ddw during the experiment are provided in figs s1 s4 1 2 nh 2 cl h nhcl 2 nh 4 ph was adjusted at 7 5 with 10 mm phosphate buffer for the fp experiments and 4 mm carbonate buffer for the sds experiments the preformed monochloramine stock solution was prepared by mixing diluted sodium hypochlorite and ammonium chloride solutions at cl2 n mass ratio of 4 1 at ph 9 to prepare dichloramine stock solutions monochloramine stock solution was prepared as described above followed by gradual adjustment of its ph to 3 5 4 0 by using hydrochloric acid pre determined amount of preformed chloramine solution monochloramine or dichloramine was spiked into eight identical amber bottles which were opened at 3 6 12 24 48 72 and 120 h to measure ndma formation and residual chloramines the factors that may influence chloramine decomposition and speciation were assessed under sds conditions for two model precursors dmipa and rntd the effect of nom was investigated in background solutions that were prepared using raw collected from the influent and treated waters collected between coagulation flocculation sedimentation and filtration obtained from a drinking water treatment plant dwtp water samples were filtered immediately with pre washed 0 2 μm polyethersulfone filters dissolved organic carbon doc levels of the nom solutions were adjusted to 1 5 2 5 and 5 0 mg c l by diluting with ddw selected characteristics of nom solutions are shown in table 1 for the ph effect on ndma formation sds tests were conducted at ph 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 the effect of sulfate was investigated in ddw by spiking sodium sulfate to achieve 10 25 and 50 mg l sulfate concentrations in order to investigate the ndma formation in natural waters dwtp raw and treated water samples were used without any dilution moreover a ww impacted creek was selected and samples were collected at three different locations i e upstream of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp wwtp effluent and 8 4 km downstream from the ww discharge point further details of the watershed can be found elsewhere gan et al 2013a 2013b selected characteristics of natural water samples are also given in table 1 the initial chloramine concentrations i e either 3 or 100 mg l were enough to provide an excess amount of chloramine for all tests i e ddw or natural samples during the 5 day reaction time all of the ndma formation tests were conducted in 1 l amber glass bottles without headspace and stored in the dark at 22 c 2 3 analytical methods ndma was analyzed following us epa method 521 us epa 2004 consisting of solid phase extraction using coconut charcoal tubes followed by gc ms ms analysis analytical details can be found elsewhere selbes et al 2014 2013 and a brief summary is as follows for the analysis after chloramination 500 ml amine solutions were quenched with sodium thiosulfate and ndma d6 was added as a surrogate before solid phase extraction samples were passed through coconut charcoal cartridges preconditioned with dichloromethane methanol and ddw the cartridges were dried with air and then eluted with dichloromethane eluents were passed through sodium sulfate columns to remove residual moisture and then concentrated to 1 ml under a gentle stream of high purity nitrogen gas the extracts were spiked with ndpa d14 as an internal standard and analyzed using a varian gc 3800 ms

due to multiple analysis n 2 anova was performed using origin pro to assess the statistical differences between the results of data sets examples of the analysis are provided in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 ndma conversion from selected model compounds fig 2 shows the ndma molar conversion yields from dma and four tertiary amines over reaction time under four different chloramination conditions fp sds sds with monochloramine in the presence of excess background ammonia and sds with dichloramine in the fp tests an excessive dose of chloramine i e 100 mg l resulted in sufficient levels of both monochloramine 95 and dichloramine 5 at ph 7 5 to form ndma from selected amines under the fp test conditions the ndma formation rates from all five model compounds were relatively fast in general the maximum ndma formation was achieved within 24 h of chloramination although further increases up to 120 h were observed only from tma fig 2b and dmipa fig 2c the ndma yields obtained at 120 h of contact time for the five model precursors were comparable to those reported in the literature huang et al 2018 le roux et al 2012 lee et al 2007 mitch et al 2009 sacher et al 2008 selbes et al 2014 2013 shen and andrews 2011a 2011b spahr et al 2017 the differences of ndma yields observed in our study vs those reported in the literature were attributed to some differences in experimental conditions e g reaction time chloramine dose buffer stoichiometric ratio of oxidant to precursor etc the ndma formation rates for dma fig 2a tma fig 2b and dmipa fig 2c were significantly affected by dichloramine concentrations the higher ndma yields were observed in the sds with dichloramine and fp test experiments i e more dichloramine was present in the fp experiment the decomposition of monochloramine formed a maximum of 5 mg l dichloramine along with the formation rates the ndma conversion yields also decreased as dichloramine levels decreased e g 57 and 84 for dmipa 0 3 and 1 7 for tma 0 8 and 1 1 for dma under sds and fp conditions respectively on the other hand under sds conditions in the presence of excess background ammonia where almost no dichloramine existed in the system ndma barely formed from those three amine precursors dmipa tma and dma suggesting that dichloramine is the more favorable species to form ndma than monochloramine and the ndma formation was controlled by the decomposition of monochloramine to dichloramine the ndma formation rates for these three amines dramatically increased under sds with dichloramine only especially for tma fig 2b and dma fig 2c their ndma molar conversions were even greater than those under the fp tests within 24 h on the contrary the ndma formation rates for dmbza fig 2d and rntd fig 2e showed very similar patterns in both fp and sds tests although slightly higher yields were achieved under fp conditions at the end of 5 days contact time in the absence of dichloramine i e dichloramine formation suppressed by excess background ammonia considerable ndma formed from dmbza and rntd suggesting monochloramine reacts with these amines to form ndma similarly it has been reported that rntd can form ndma by the reaction with monochloramine le roux et al 2012 liu et al 2014 selbes et al 2013 however the ndma formation from dmbza and rntd was slower than those when dichloramine was present i e sds test interestingly under sds with preformed dichloramine ndma formed very fast from dmbza and rntd the formation rates were comparable with those under fp tests indicating that the reaction rates of dichloramine with any amine precursors are always faster than those of monochloramine and only some amine precursors e g dbmza and rntd can also react with monochloramine to form ndma although the formation rate for the reaction between monochloramine and rntd was slower than that between dichloramine and rntd fig 2e the ndma conversion yield in the fp test was almost same as that in the sds test in the presence of excess ammonia at 120 h contact time indicating that both monochloramine and dichloramine can react with rntd to form ndma with different reaction rates it is important to note that all chloramine species including mono di and trichloramine are in equilibrium reactions and trace concentrations of dichloramine can be present even if dichloramine is not detected i e sds test with monochloramine in the presence of excess ammonia the standard method 4500 cl f method and uv spectrophotometer 5 cm cuvette used for the detection of dichloramine have minimum reporting levels of 0 05 mg l dichloramine it is possible that some trace concentrations of dichloramine may be present even under the conditions of the sds test in the presence of excess ammonia which may have contributed to some ndma formation from rntd and dmbza however if trace amounts of dichloramine were resulting in ndma formation from rntd and dmbza this effect would have been observed in other precursors such as in dmipa fig 3 c sds in the presence of excess background ammonia given that ndma barely formed from dmipa tma and dma under the sds conditions in the presence of excess background ammonia the high ndma yields observed from rntd and dmbza under the same test conditions would be mainly formed by monochloramine therefore the findings of our study indicate that dichloramine is more reactive species to form ndma from tertiary amine precursors as reported in the literature huang et al 2018 mccurry et al 2017 mitch et al 2005 schreiber and mitch 2006 shen and andrews 2013 however ndma can also form from the reactions with monochloramine depending on the precursor structure le roux et al 2012 2011 liu et al 2014 selbes et al 2013 in our previous research we found that in sds tests with and without ammonia dma tma and dmipa were dichloramine reactive while dmbza and rntd were monochloramine reactive selbes et al 2013 consistently in the present study dma tma and dmipa were found to be dichloramine reactive and the additional data collected over 120 h in different mono and dichloramine conditions allowed us to further refine the findings and show that both mono and dichloramine can contribute to ndma formation from dmbza and rntd the higher reactivity of dichloramine to form ndma can be attributed to more partial positive charge on nitrogen atom due to two neighboring chlorine atoms than that of monochloramine with only one chlorine fig s5 nitrogen atom of tertiary amines would always be partially negative due to two neighboring methyl functional groups during a nucleophilic substitution therefore bonding between nitrogen atoms of amine and dichloramine would form first because of partially more positive charge on nitrogen of dichloramine overall the results suggest that the ndma formation from the reaction of amine compounds with chloramines is dependent on the dichloramine concentration and higher concentrations of dichloramine increases ndma formation rates however monochloramine can also form ndma depending on the precursor s structure if available dichloramine is limited in the literature several ndma formation pathways have been proposed involving either monochloramine le roux et al 2012 2011 liu et al 2014 selbes et al 2013 or dichloramine huang et al 2018 mccurry et al 2017 mitch et al 2009 schreiber and mitch 2006 shen and andrews 2013 and in all studies the first reaction is the nucleophilic substitution findings of our study indicate a potential reactivity of rntd with both monochloramine and dichloramine the questions to how both chloramine species can react with rntd are still outstanding further research is required to examine formation pathways and identify the intermediates formed during the reactions 3 2 factors influencing ndma conversion yields 3 2 1 the nom effect to investigate the nom effect on the ndma formation rates raw and treated water samples collected from a dwtp were used as background matrices hydrophobic hpo organic matter is typically the major fraction of nom in raw waters while nom in treated waters i e after coagulation flocculation sedimentation contains mostly transphilic tph and hydrophilic hpi organic matter croué et al 1993 karanfil et al 2007 kim and yu 2005 thus selected amines spiked in raw and treated waters could react and or compete with nom i e hpo tph and hpi toward ndma formation nom characteristics may play an important role in either enhancement or reduction of ndma formation in natural water systems the ndma molar conversion yields from rntd and dmipa as a function of reaction time at different doc levels of raw and treated waters are given in fig 3 for dwtp treated water there was a slight decrease in ndma conversion yields from rntd as doc increased fig 3a the formation of ndma from rntd proceeded faster in ddw than in the presence of 1 0 mg c l and 2 5 mg c l of doc particularly during the first 24 h of reaction time for instance the ndma yields were 61 9 and 2 for ddw treated 1 0 mg c l and treated 2 5 mg c l at 6 h respectively while these conversion rates were 74 70 and 26 at 12 h fig 3a the maximum yield from rntd occurred at 24 h for ddw and treated 1 0 mg c l while it happened at 48 h for treated 2 5 mg c l despite the slower conversion rate the presence of doc caused no significant effect on the formation of ndma from rntd during the experiment enough monochloramine was available and the concentration of dichloramine remained 0 10 mg l table s6 on the other hand the ndma conversion yields from dmipa were reduced drastically in the presence of tph and hpi dominated nom fig 3b the ndma yields for 120 h of contact time decreased from 56 9 which was in ddw to 32 0 and 9 1 at 1 0 and 2 5 mg c l doc respectively more specifically decreases in ndma yields are probably due to the competition of nom with dmipa for dichloramine since rntd could also react with monochloramine to form ndma the drastic reduction of ndma formation was observed only from dmipa overall these results indicate that nom could reduce available dichloramine resulting in less ndma formation this nom effect however can be insignificant for certain precursors which can react with both monochloramine and dichloramine to form ndma when dwtp raw water containing hpo dominated nom was used as the background matrix the ndma conversion yield from rntd decreased as doc levels increased fig 3c the ndma conversion yield from rntd in the absence of nom reached the maximum 85 within 24 h while slightly slower conversion was observed in the presence of nom at 1 0 mg c l of doc when the doc concentration increased to 2 5 mg c l the maximum yield 71 of ndma did not reach the level 85 observed in ddw even after 120 h of contact time at 5 0 mg c l of doc however the ndma conversion was significantly suppressed and its maximum was only 7 4 after 120 h of chloramination nom in raw water caused more drastic decreases in the ndma conversion yield from rntd than nom in treated water indicating that nom characteristics in natural water also influence the ndma formation slightly higher decay of chloramines was observed in raw water than treated water table s6 dwtp raw water had higher aromatic components than the treated water according to their suva254 values 3 3 and 1 7 l mg m respectively therefore the concentration of aromatic compounds in natural water may also influence the ndma formation during chloramination of amines similar decreases in the formation of ndma were reported when river water with 6 2 mg c l of doc and 2 3 l mg m of suva254 was used shen and andrews 2011b however the changes of the ndma conversion in their study were not as drastic as the results in our study which may be due to the difference in the suva254 values as for the importance of suva254 in the ndma formation it has been found that aromatic amines can undergo reversible covalent bonding with carbonyls and quinones which are present in nom text s2 chen 2007 parris 1980 thorn et al 1996 weber et al 1996 and consequently the precursor initial contact with chloramines can be hindered shen and andrews 2011b some preliminary data supporting this hypothesis are given in text s3 it should be noted that there are other functional groups in nom that may have caused this hindrance which would require further research the ndma molar conversion of dmipa was slightly higher in treated water fig 3b than in raw water fig 3d the ndma yields at 120 h decreased as doc increased in both treated and raw waters indicating that there is less interaction between hpo fraction of nom and dmipa an aliphatic amine than between hpo and rntd an aromatic amine the nom effect on the ndma conversion and the interaction of nom fractions with aliphatic and aromatic amines warrants further investigations with various precursors in different water matrices to better understand the ndma formation mechanism in natural water systems overall these results suggest that the presence of nom may decrease the formation of ndma in distribution systems when certain precursors are present e g dmipa hpo fraction of nom can be more effective than thp to reduce the ndma formation probably due to its covalent binding capability with aromatic amines and also creating a competition for dichloramine although the majority of the hpo fraction is removed during coagulation flocculation sedimentation processes the remaining tph fraction of nom may also decrease the ndma formation by competing with precursors toward dichloramine for both nom fractions higher doc levels showed more decreases in the ndma formation via covalent binding or creating a competition for dichloramine however high doc levels are associated with the formation of regulated carbonaceous dbps such as trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids during free chlorine application prior to ammonia addition 3 2 2 the ph effect the effect of ph 6 5 8 5 on the ndma conversion from rntd and dmipa was investigated and the results are shown in fig 4 changing ph did not cause statistically meaningful changes in the ndma formation from rntd probably due to rntd s high ndma formation within the first 24 h under sds conditions table s3 the ndma formation from rntd at ph 7 5 was slightly faster than at ph 6 5 or 8 5 which is in good agreement with a previous study shen and andrews 2013 on the other hand distinct changes were observed for the ndma formation from dmipa under different ph conditions the ndma conversion yields from dmipa at 120 h were highest 56 9 at ph 7 5 an increase or decrease in ph adversely affected the ndma formation rate the ndma yield was decreased to 7 6 and 35 4 when ph was changed from 7 5 to 6 5 and 8 5 respectively assuming that ndma forms via nucleophilic substitution of dichloramine with deprotonated amines rntd and dmipa mitch et al 2009 schreiber and mitch 2006 the highest ndma yield is expected to be observed at an optimum ph where both dichloramine and deprotonated amine species may coexist and consequently enhancing the reaction kinetics towards the ndma formation shen and andrews 2013 2011b for example dichloramine is the dominant chloramine species at ph 3 0 4 0 text s1 and pka of dmipa is 10 3 selbes et al 2014 therefore the highest ndma yield from dmipa was achieved at ph 7 5 which is an optimal ph condition for the maximum coexistence of dichloramine and deprotonated dmipa 3 2 3 the sulfate effect it has been known that sulfate bicarbonate and phosphate can facilitate transformation of monochloramine to dichloramine valentine and jafver 1988 vikesland et al 2001 the presence of those ions would increase dichloramine concentrations and consequently the ndma conversion yields could also increase from some amine precursors which react preferentially with dichloramine to form ndma to investigate the anion effect on the ndma formation sulfate was chosen since it is introduced during coagulation with alum in conventional drinking water treatment sds tests were performed in the presence of sulfate at three different concentrations i e 10 25 and 50 mg l with rntd and dmipa and the results are presented in fig 5 sulfate did not cause statistically significant changes in the ndma formation from rntd probably due to rntd s high ndma formation within the first 24 h under sds conditions table s4 similarly sulfate caused no significant changes in the formation of ndma from dmipa text s5 fig 5 similar patterns of conversion curves observed at different sulfate concentrations indicate that the ndma formation from dmipa was still limited by dichloramine concentration the overall ndma yields at 120 h increased up to 79 4 as sulfate was added although the initial chloramine dose in the sds tests was much lower than the fp experiments the ndma conversion yield from dmipa after 120 h in the presence of 50 mg l sulfate reached 80 which is close to the maximum level observed from the fp test these results suggest that introducing sulfate during coagulation or phosphate during corrosion inhibitor addition or bicarbonate addition during recarbonation may increase the ndma formation as a result of enhanced chloramine decomposition valentine and jafver 1988 vikesland et al 2001 3 3 case studies the ndma formation as a function of time was also examined in natural water samples under three different chloramination conditions i e fp sds and sds in the presence of excess ammonia table 2 3 3 1 drinking water treatment plant in the fp experiment with both raw and treated waters the ndma formation was rapid within the initial 24 h of chloramination and then increased gradually until 120 h of chloramination yielding 59 and 45 ng l of ndma respectively the difference in ndma fp values of raw and treated waters corresponds to a 24 reduction in ndma precursors this is in good agreement with a recent study reporting that coagulation flocculation sedimentation without any polymer influence resulted in 9 23 reduction in ndma fp uzun et al 2017 the ndma formation in raw water under sds conditions was below mrl while up to 9 ng l of ndma was observed in treated water at 120 h of chloramination doc decreased from 6 3 mg c l to 2 8 mg c l after coagulation flocculation sedimentation and thus the competition between nom and amine precursors toward dichloramine might also decrease and consequently more dichloramine could be available leading to higher ndma formation in addition since alum was used at this dwtp as the coagulant increased sulfate 6 3 mg l in raw and 36 8 mg l in treated water could also contribute to dichloramine levels leading to higher ndma formation under sds conditions to further examine the alum effect on the ndma formation dwtp raw water was spiked with 50 mg l of sulfate and was subjected to the sds test in the presence of sulfate however the ndma formation was still below mrl data not shown indicating that introduction of sulfate in the coagulation process did not affect the ndma formation this suggests that doc was more responsible than sulfate for the ndma formation in the treated water used in the present study the importance of doc and the ndma formation curve over the contact time under sds conditions indicate that i the ndma formation is limited by the transformation of monochloramine to dichloramine and ii ndma can continue to form as long as there is residual chloramine present under sds conditions in the presence of excess ammonia the ndma formation in both raw and treated water samples was below mrl indicating that in this water source there are a negligible amount of precursors which can potentially react with monochloramine 3 3 2 wastewater impacted watershed with samples collected from three sampling locations i e upstream discharge and downstream of a wwtp the formation of ndma was monitored as a function of time upstream samples represented pristine source water with minimal anthropogenic impact the ndma fp for this location was 23 ng l after 120 h of chloramination while under sds conditions only 7 ng l of ndma formed in the presence of excess ammonia 5 ng l of ndma formed within the first 3 h and remained constant afterwards on the other hand very high levels of ndma fp were observed in the samples collected at ww discharge point 1316 ng l and 1659 ng l at 3 h and 120 h of chloramination respectively under sds conditions however only 5 ng l of ndma formed within the first 3 h and ndma formation increased to 16 ng l after 120 h since this yield was much lower than expected a ww sample was diluted with ddw at several different ratios and chloraminated under sds conditions in attempting to explain this anomaly more dilution resulted in more ndma yields getting closer to the values under fp tests fig s6 reduced concentration of organics i e doc due to dilution would lead to less competition with precursors toward dichloramine consequently more available dichloramine would react with precursors to form more ndma the ndma formation caused by monochloramine i e under sds with excess ammonia was 7 ng l at 3 h and remained until 120 h these findings indicate that dichloramine was more important species than monochloramine for the ndma formation in this ww matrix which is consistent with the findings reported in the literature mitch et al 2005 mccurry et al 2017 downstream ndma fp was 94 ng l at 3 h of chloramination and additional ndma up to 149 ng l formed with further exposure to chloramine under sds test conditions without ammonia ndma formed gradually over contact time reaching 102 ng l at 120 h which was close to ndma fp 149 ng l the ndma formation caused by monochloramine i e under sds with excess ammonia was 5 ng l at 3 h and remained the same until 120 h once again these findings indicate that dichloramine is more important species than monochloramine for the ndma formation however monochloramine may also lead to formation of some ndma 4 conclusions the ndma formation as a function of time from dma and four tertiary amines was examined under four chloramination conditions i e fp sds sds in the presence of excess ammonia and sds with preformed dichloramine to understand the role of chloramine species in the ndma formation during fp test and sds test with preformed dichloramine having sufficient dichloramine concentrations in the system the ndma formation rates were relatively fast reaching a plateau approximately within initial 24 h of chloramination however when much lower level of dichloramine was applied i e sds test the ndma formation rates from dma tma and dmipa were noticeably reduced while the effect of dichloramine on dmbza and rntd was less significant when only monochloramine existed i e dichloramine formation suppressed by excess ammonia in the system the ndma formation from dma tma and dmipa was negligible the ndma formation rates were reduced with monochloramine from dmbza and rntd indicating that dichloramine is more important chloramine species for ndma formation from these precursors as well over the extended contact time monochloramine reacted with rntd and dmbza to form ndma reaching comparable yields to dichloramine present conditions but the reaction rates for dichloramine was faster than those for monochloramine from the experiments with selected model precursors dichloramine was found to be more reactive species to form ndma from the selected precursors however monochloramine can also lead to the ndma formation from certain precursors such as rntd and dmbza even in the absence of dichloramine the ndma formation from both dmipa and rntd was reduced in the presence of nom probably due to less available dichloramine caused by the reactions between nom and dichloramine and or precursors binding with nom ph played a key role as it influenced both chloramine speciation and protonation state of amine precursors sulfate had no effect on ndma formation from dmipa and rntd dichloramine limited conditions therefore would be beneficial to control the ndma formation from precursors which react exclusively with dichloramine dichloramine also lead to higher ndma formation than monochloramine in both drinking water and wastewater impacted water systems tested in this study acknowledgments this work was

19532,legacy lead and copper components are ubiquitous in plumbing of large buildings including schools that serve children most vulnerable to lead exposure lead and copper samples must be collected

μg pb l after 30ms confirming the need to sample at each outlet to identify high risk taps based on the much higher concentrations observed in first draw samples even after a short stagnation the first 250ml should be discarded unless no sources of lead are present results question the cost benefit of daily or weekly flushing as a remediation strategy as such current regulatory requirements

located in two canadian provinces buildings sampled were served by municipal distribution systems fed by surface water sources three types of buildings were sampled 1 schools without corrosion control

this context schools were defined as small buildings with 80 850 students large building complexes as multi storey buildings with an average capacity ranging from 7000 to 60 000 people large buildings

1977 2 2 sampling protocol the sampling protocol included the sequential collection of 5 samples at selected tap leaving the aerator in place a first draw of 250 ml 1s 8h and second draw sample of 1 75 l 2s 8h were collected following at least 8h of stagnation immediately there after the water was left running and two additional 250 ml samples were collected one after 30 s of flushing 30sf and the other after 5 min 5minf flushing was timed after the second draw 2s 8h was taken therefore the 30sf sample corresponded more precisely to a sample collected between 30 s and 1 min of flushing finally a stagnation of 30 min was performed and a 250 ml sample was collected 30mins following completion of sampling aerators were removed from kitchen and bathroom faucets such that particles could be collected where possible water temperature was measured after both 30 s and 5 min of flushing all samples were drawn at maximum flow rate 0 8 7 7 lpm for fountains 0 8 18 lpm for kitchen faucets and 1 6 13 lpm for bathroom faucets and collected using wide mouth bottles sampling points were allocated across the building general water quality parameters including ph total and free chlorine cl2 and heterotrophic plate count were evaluated at the closest point to the main water entry and at the point the furthest away after overnight stagnation and 10 min of flushing additional testing was performed at the schools the most at risk of elevated pb based on their low ph and alkalinity as well as on the absence of corrosion control treatment during the second day kitchen faucets n 7 were sampled according to the procedure described by deshommes et al 2010 to stimulate particulate detachment following overnight stagnation a 1l sample pss1 was collected by opening and closing the tap 5 times reaching maximum flow rate a second 1l sample pss2 was collected using maximum flow rate and a third 1 l sample pss3 was collected using the same procedure as for pss1 2 3 analytical methods water samples were analyzed for total and dissolved lead copper zinc tin and iron a 40 ml aliquot was immediately filtered 0 45 μm for digestion of colloids and particles samples were acidified within 36 h using 2 ultra pure hno3 for total metals and 0 5 ultra pure hno3 for dissolved metal samples as modified from triantafyllidou et al 2007 analysis was performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms based on the epa 200 8 protocol detection limits were 0 02 μg pb l 0 06 μg cu l 0 2 μg zn l 1 μg sn l 0 9 μg fe l on site temperature and ph were measured using a hach sension 1 portable ph meter total and residual chlorine using a hach pocket colorimeter ii 2 4 statistical analysis and ieubk modeling non parametric statistical analyses including marspline analyses and kruskal wallis anova tests were performed in statistica version 13 statsoft ok usa differences were considered significant if p 0 05 unless stated otherwise the usepa ieubk version win1 1 build11 model was used to predict the blls for children 5 7 years old as described by deshommes et al 2016a when considering canadian inputs for lead sources other than water tap water intake at school was attributed to be 50 of the daily water intake 3 results and discussion 3 1 lead and copper concentrations per type of sampling protocol the overall distribution of total dissolved and particulate lead as well as copper concentrations and the percentage of particulate content are presented in fig 1 the highest pb and cu concentrations were observed in the first 250 ml sampled following overnight stagnation 1s 8h subsequently as water was flushed concentrations decreased lead concentrations after extended stagnation 8h and short stagnation 30min periods are statistically different whereas they are similar for copper kruskal wallis anova test among the various samples 90th percentile concentrations were highest in the first 21 μg pb l and second 8 1 μg pb l draws following an extended 8h stagnation levels decreased to 5 2 and 2 4 μg pb l after flushing for 30 s and 5 min and increased to 8 9 μg pb l after 30 min of stagnation the median and 90th percentile concentrations following 30 min of stagnation represented 45 2 and 42 8 of those following extended stagnation the highest lead concentration was observed after 30 min of stagnation 850 μg pb l of which 99 4 was pbparticulate these results follow expected trends of a decrease of pbtotal as water is flushed from the tap barn et al 2014 boyd et al 2008b cartier et al 2012b mcilwain et al 2015 triantafyllidou et al 2014 fig 1 also shows large variability for a given type of sample typically exceeding one order of magnitude wide variability between taps was observed in schools which received aggressive water in a community in british columbia canada as shown by first draw pbtotal concentrations ranging from 5 9 to 306 μg pb l barn et al 2014 larger datasets from across canada indicate an even greater variation of over 4 orders of magnitude deshommes et al 2016a in the current study short 30 s flush decreased lead and copper concentrations by 81 and 59 respectively from first draw samples while elevated concentrations continued to occur first draw 90th percentile concentrations of 738 μg cu l decreased to 502 μg cu l after a 30 s flush and to 381 μg cu l after 30 min of stagnation approximately 78 of our first draw samples exceed the california public health goal phg of 300 μg cu l fig 2 shows the variability of pb and cu concentrations at each of the tap of the 11 buildings sampled b1 b11 firstly lead and copper concentrations at a given tap can vary up to 415 fold for lead up to 39 fold for cu depending on the sampling protocol used and the presence of particulate metals furthermore within a given school the median concentrations measured at the different outlets can vary by 114 fold for pb and 202 fold for cu regardless of the groups of buildings considered lower corrosivity clearly decreases all pb and cu concentrations observed but elevated pb taps remain as shown in building b8 these results reinforce the need to sample at every outlet used for drinking water with the objective of identifying taps at risk of elevated concentration of lead and or copper 3 2 water quality and type of faucet overall results show that the first 250 ml collected following 8h stagnation contains significantly higher pb levels suggesting that the faucet and its connecting piping are dominant lead contributors in the buildings sampled the internal volumes of faucet can vary between 24 and 106 ml cartier et al 2012b and tank volume of fountain have been estimated to be 750 ml mcilwain et al 2015 lead levels measured were the highest in schools which received low ph and low alkalinity water per type of tap fig 3 with median and 90th percentile respectively of 3 0 and 21 1 μg pb l for fountains 4 7 and 47 4 μg pb l for kitchen taps and 3 0 and 175 μg pb l for bathroom taps this group of buildings is statistically different from the other two p 0 05 similar to murphy 1993 corrosive water low ai was associated with the highest lead release after overnight stagnation median first draw concentrations measured in fountains 13 8 μg pb l fig s1b were similar to values reported by the same author 15 μg pb l for similar water corrosivity when considering the schools investigated first draw 1s 8h median lead concentration in locations serviced by water with high alkalinity and with ph adjustment were 78 times lower 1 7 133 μg pb l therefore cc treatment can effectively be used to decrease lead concentrations in buildings median and 90th percentile copper concentrations were generally higher in the large building group 141 and 619 μg cu l when compared to schools with 13 7 and 63 5 μg cu l and without 73 5 and 415 μg cu l cc fig 3 and fig s2 in contrast to total pb concentrations which were generally the highest in schools without cc copper levels overlap between the various water qualities investigated and between the different types of samples fig s2 this suggests that the sources of copper are more widespread confirmed by the frequent presence of copper piping or different within the buildings water system than the sources of lead this is also consistent with the fact that it takes a longer flushing time to decrease copper concentrations when compared to lead barn et al 2014 as expected and previously reported by murphy 1993 ai is not a useful predictor of copper concentrations since the factors influencing lead and copper corrosion differ copper corrosion increases at alkalinities below 25 mg caco3 l and above 75 mg caco3 l schock et al 1995 which cannot be determined by the ai 3 3 impact of flushing the percentage of samples 10 μg pb l decreases with flushing table 2 in agreement with previous studies cartier et al 2012b deshommes et al 2016a mcilwain et al 2015 triantafyllidou et al 2014 first draw samples in schools without cc most frequently 65 exceeded 10 μg pb l regardless of the type of tap the percentage exceedance decreased to 22 in the second 1 75l draw after 8h stagnation a short 30s flush resulted in a further reduction to 14 as observed in bryant 2004 in schools supplied by water with ph control only kitchen taps exceeded 10 μg pb l in first draw samples 43 while fountains and bathroom taps remained 10 μg pb l even following overnight stagnation periodical flushing at taps used for consumption has been proposed as a remediation method government of ontario 2010 health canada 2009 usepa 2006 prior investigations document the efficacy of a short flush 30 s in decreasing lead concentrations in schools when sampling fountains in seattle 33 of first draw samples exceeded 10 μg pb l down to 7 after a 30 s flush boyd et al 2008b the effectiveness of flushing varied within each school in british columbia canada and reduced more lead than copper barn et al 2014 flushing taps for 10 min in the morning did not result in lead and copper reductions throughout the day in schools in new jersey murphy 1993 questioning the benefits from flushing considered together these results show the benefits of avoiding the very first draw after both a short or extended stagnation and of flushing to reduce the proportion of samples with elevated lead however this mitigation method is not effective in reducing lead levels in all taps since a significant proportion of them still exceed 10 μg pb l considering the health based standard of 5 μg pb l recently proposed by health canada 2017 schools with adequate cc in this study had pb levels that were lower in most samples except the first 250 ml after 8h stagnation table 2 finally considering the american academy of pediatrics aap proposed level of 1 μg pb l only the fully flushed 5 min samples in schools with ph adjustment would meet this low threshold at most taps 93 table s3 similar to lead copper concentrations also decrease when taps are flushed the maximum concentration measured after 5 min of flushing in this study 784 μg cu l is 10 fold lower than that reported by barn et al 2014 for elementary 10 700 μg cu l and secondary schools 7000 μg cu l following a 10 min flush this reinforces the fact that the impact of flushing can vary depending on the building and water quality as also reported by murphy 1993 for a 10 min flush in schools without cc the median concentration in first draw samples collected from fountains following a 30 min stagnation 81 7 μg cu l was 35 6 of that observed after extended overnight stagnation 229 μg cu l when considering all samples collected 90th percentile concentrations at fountains 331 μg cu l exceed the californian phg 300 μg cu l for schools without cc and having low alkalinity as well as large buildings without cc and high alkalinity 482 μg cu l table 3 flushing the first 250 ml decreased the 90th percentile concentrations to 215 μg cu l in the schools without cc and low alkalinity however in the large buildings flushing the stagnated water did not reduce the 90th percentile copper concentrations below 300 μg cu l for schools with ph control and low alkalinity all concentrations were 300 μg cu l maximum 146 μg cu l 3 4 particulate lead and copper fig 4 shows the distributions of the concentrations and fractions of particulate lead 4a and 4b and copper 4c and 4d schools without cc present the highest particulate lead and copper concentrations with 90th percentile concentrations of 14 μg pb l and 54 μg cu l these values are considerably lower than prior reports for a large penitentiary complex serviced with corrosive water and with low water usage 90th percentiles of 98 μg pb l and 2720 μg cu l for drinking fountains cartier et al 2012b the pbpart and cupart fractions were the lowest for large buildings with 56 and 17 9 respectively of non detectable particulate corresponding to low pbpart concentrations median 0 03 μg pb l 10 7 higher median pbpart were present at taps with low alkalinity water with 0 17 μg pb l 26 5 and without 1 55 μg l 37 cc these results illustrate that high particulate fractions are not necessarily associated with elevated lead levels for the 13 650 samples that exceeded 50 μg pbtotal l the particulate fraction ranged from 15 2 to 99 9 interestingly 11 of the 13 high concentrations samples were detected in schools supplied with low alkalinity water without cc the particulate fraction exceeded 87 in most of 8 13 of the elevated samples while 4 samples contained mainly pbdiss 15 24 pbpart higher particulate median concentrations and fractions were present at the taps without cc 6 3 μg pb l 12 2 in comparison to those with low alkalinity water with ph control 1 7 μg l 13 8 and large buildings with high alkalinity 2 6 μg l 3 6 for the 5 650 samples that exceeded 1000 μg cutotal l the particulate fraction ranged from 0 1 to 99 9 these were all detected in fountains following a period of extended stagnation furthermore the two samples for which cupart was elevated 84 9 also showed high particulate pb and zn indicating galvanic corrosion of leaded brass as a probable source of both the particulate pb concentrations and fractions in this study particulate pb concentrations and fractions were considerably lower than reported previously for a penitentiary complex 50 μg pb l vs 2 1 μg pb l and 48 vs 14 where it was found to be twice the concentration of pbdiss deshommes et al 2012 such a relationship cannot be observed at the points sampled in this study only one sample collected at a kitchen faucet after 30 min of stagnation exceeded the acute single dose equivalent concentration of 580 μg l uscpsc 2005 3 5 particulate simulation sampling when considering schools with low ph water and alkalinity 7 taps were re sampled on the second day of sampling using a protocol designed to stimulate particulate release from the taps fig 5 on the first day of sampling the taps were flushed for 5 min the following day when sampling for the psss concentrations 10 μg pb l were observed in the first 2 l sampled at high flow rate total lead concentrations were highest in the second sample collected when combining samples 1s 8h and 2s 8h first 2l from day 1 a weighted average of 15 2 μg pb l was obtained with most of the pb being contributed by the 1st sample 250 ml the weighted average is comparable to the mean concentration obtained when pss1 and pss2 are combined 16 2 μg pb l disturbances in the sampling flow rate did not increase the lead release and mean lead concentrations in the 3rd liter pss3 were lower than in pss1 and pss2 again showing the benefits of avoiding the first draw volume disturbances in flow rate during sampling have been shown to increase the detachment of small colloids 0 45 μm from scales formed inside lsls of single family homes whereas lead particles from solders and brass fixtures were released in first draw samples deshommes et al 2010 the difference observed in this study could therefore be explained by the nature and source of the particles re suspended in water with hydraulic disturbances and the premise plumbing 3 6 contributors to lead and copper concentrations marspline regressions were conducted to identify the factors which impact lead and copper concentrations when considering metal analyzed total and particulate pb fe sn zn and cu sampling point group of building water quality school and type of taps and flow rate table s4 following overnight stagnation the building and specific point of sampling were the dominant factors predicting pbtotal followed to a lesser degree by other total metals sn zn fe cu if only concentrations exceeding 5 or 10 μg pb l are considered the relative contribution of sntotal indicative of the contribution of leaded solder increases following a 30 s flush multiple metals become important fe zn sn cu revealing multiple sources of lead the strong contribution of iron potentially reflects the impact of water quality defining the combined level of iron release from the iron water mains in the building as well as lead release from both solders and leaded brass following extended flushing the dominant contribution of sn was no longer present with cu and zn becoming the most important factors along with the specific sampling point and building as such as the 5 min flushed sample cannot be used to detect the contribution of leaded solders when considering a shorter 30 min stagnation tin becomes the dominant factor over building reflecting the contribution of solders at the tap and its connecting plumbing unlike the 8h stagnation particulate samples only tin and not copper were associated with elevated pbpart after a shorter stagnation this suggests that a 30 min stagnation can be used to detect the contribution of lead from distal solders pbpart is best predicted when considering different factors than those for pbtotal including cupart sampling point and snpart leaded brass and solder both generated lead particles factors associated with pbpart following short 30 min and overnight stagnation suggest that different mechanisms are at play in the release of pbpart following overnight stagnation all particulate metal concentrations are considered to be factors associated with pbpart cu sn fe zn as well as the sampling point the group of buildings the buildings and taps in large buildings the main sources of copper are copper piping and brass fixtures following overnight stagnation and 30 min stagnation the building sampling point and zinc concentrations are dominant factors explaining in copper concentrations as such the sources of copper in the buildings are leaded brass components for flushed samples 30sf the group of buildings represents the main factor for predicting copper concentrations sampling point pb and zn concentrations remain important predictors for fully flushed samples 5minf the sampling point building and water quality are important predictors as well as the other metals measured pb fe zn sn indicating that the sources of copper are different and could come from solder 3 7 blood lead levels modelling and copper intake drinking water consumption scenarios typically assume that children consume 50 of their daily intake at home and 50 at schools triantafyllidou et al 2014 with a house lead concentration of 2 μg pb l deshommes et al 2016a as the statistical analysis confirmed the overwhelming importance of the sampling point and building we elected to use mean values from all 90th percentile concentrations including first and second draw after extended stagnation partially and fully flushed samples and samples after a short 30 min stagnation a measurable impact of water consumption while at school on the gm blls is seen in schools without cc and low alkalinity fig 6 for this case avoiding the first draw 250 ml results in a 21 7 decrease of the gm bll to 2 16 μg dl without 1s 8h and of 38 7 to 1 69 μg dl without both 8h and 30mins avoiding all first 250 ml draw is not as beneficial when ph adjustment is practiced 7 8 gm bll or for high alkalinity waters 10 5 modelled blls are comparable to those reported by deshommes et al 2016a who showed that lead at the tap could cause elevated bll in some children and in some cases a rare but concerning risk of acute exposure our detailed sampling results confirm the need to use a sampling protocol capable of identifying outlets with elevated lead the impact of cu from drinking water from large buildings can be assessed by considering the fraction of the daily intake versus the recommended daily allowance and the tolerable upper intake level recommended for children aged between 4 and 8 years old health canada who and the state of california refer a daily allowance of 340 μg d and a tolerable upper intake level of 3000 μg d california epa 2008 the median exposure for all buildings sampled represented 37 7 of the recommended daily allowance and reached 83 1 in the case of large buildings group using the 90th percentile values the daily intake of copper from drinking water exceeded the total daily recommended allowance in all but one group of schools with corrosion control but did not exceed the tolerable upper level intake most observed copper levels represent a significant fraction of the recommended total daily allowance that should be avoided in the case of formula fed infants california epa 2008 3 8 possible remedial actions various actions can be considered to lower lead exposure at the tap in schools and large buildings and to guide sampling 3 8 1 replacement of leaded components as observed in boyd et al 2008b the removal of lead containing components in fountains and faucets as well as their connecting piping resulted in the removal of the distal volume in which the highest lead concentrations were systematically measured despite replacing these taps and their connecting piping the remaining sources such as leaded solders and brass and in rarer cases lead pipes and service lines may still be present in schools lead concentrations measured after 5 min of flushing in this study indicate that some non distal sources of lead were present in the buildings whilst the removal of all sources of lead in large building would be desirable our results suggest that removing the sources of lead at the tap and its connecting immediate piping may suffice to considerably decrease pb exposure a system wide investigation of all sources of lead in the internal plumbing of large buildings may appear the best approach to identify sources of lead to be removed however as older buildings contain a variety of materials for piping solders brass fittings and faucets it would be difficult or even impossible to conduct a thorough assessment of all pb sources by inspection as many of these elements are not readily accessible water sampling can be used as a proxy to identify pb sources it is widely accepted for the detection of lsls cartier et al 2012a deshommes et al 2016b 3 8 2 corrosion control ph adjustment of low alkalinity water can be efficient to lower lead levels when considering various types of faucets and fountains compensating in part for the presence of leaded materials at the tap various onsite cc treatments have been shown to be effective for the control of lead release from taps and their connecting piping cartier et al 2012b our results confirm that system wide corrosion control contributes to lowering lead in large buildings in the absence of system wide corrosion control on site corrosion control could be considered however on site treatment may have regulatory implications and requires human and financial resources that may not be available or feasible in many schools 3 8 3 flushing extended flushing of taps in the morning is ineffective for lowering lead and copper concentrations throughout the day as pb concentrations can again exceed 10 μg pb l after only 30 min of stagnation and 90th percentile cu concentrations exceed the california phg it is not realistic to recommend a 5 min flush prior to each use the waiting time would be unacceptable to the user and the wasted water would be considerable to fully flush premise plumbing a volume equivalent to both the service line and internal plumbing or more is needed in this study the service line volumes were considerable ranging from 50 l to 180 l furthermore the lower flows at fountains and the need to manually maintain the flow make it even more unpractical alternatively flushing for 20 s or less was sufficient to flush out the first 250 ml at maximum flow rate in our study such a procedure would be more feasible to implement and did decrease potential exposure significantly in buildings with corrosive water 3 8 4 designating drinking points within buildings lead free supply locations should be designated for drinking water and food preparation and regularly sampled to ensure acceptable water quality if the presence of leaded components is suspected building wide a pou device installed prior to the tap or fountain should be considered to help ensure low lead and copper concentrations as previously reported by deshommes et al 2012 3 9 selecting a sampling protocol the optimal sampling protocols depends on the sampling specific objectives assessing typical exposure the best approach to measure typical metal concentrations at drinking water points in households is proportional sampling van den hoven and slaats 2006 such sampling is resource intensive costly invasive and only feasible for research purposes a combination of the various protocols examined including long and short stagnation and flushed samples can serve to estimate a realistic range of concentrations to which children can be exposed random day time rdt and 30mins can provide results more indicative of typical exposure than 1st draw samples collected after overnight stagnation in households deshommes et al 2016b van den hoven and slaats 2006 however a much larger number of rdt samples would need to be collected to estimate typical exposure in this study table s5 assessing acute exposure the assessment of acute exposure at a tap poses a challenge as extreme lead concentrations are typically caused by sporadic release of pbpart in this study we did not observe an impact of the type of sampling protocol on the likelihood of elevated particulate lead as even the pss protocol did not produce more pbpart release however very high lead concentrations in this study mostly only exceeded 100 μg pb l in 4 130 taps after 8h of stagnation for these taps 30mins samples all exceeded 10 μg pb l however some elevated values 100 μg pb l were also measured after 30 min stagnation 3 130 suggesting worst case taps as previously reported by deshommes et al 2016a using extended stagnation and profiling sampling are most likely to provide worst case exposure identifying sources of lead the collection of consecutive samples following overnight stagnation profiling can be used to identify sources of lead and copper in large buildings cartier et al 2012b mcilwain et al 2015 first draw samples collected after stagnation can confirm distal contamination from the tap and its connecting plumbing subsequent samples collected as water is flowing can help identify other sources of lead in the remaining premise plumbing the concentrations in semi and fully flushed samples can also be used to identify buildings with more systemic presence of lead components in premise plumbing in our study 2 3 of flushed samples exceeded 5 μg pb l and 15 4 were 2 μg pb l when contamination is found in flushed samples then sequential sampling can be considered for detailed investigative work or research it is however very costly time consuming and more disruptive health canada 2009 estimating the effectiveness of treatment and remediation measures rdt sampling representative of a typical inter use stagnation is recommended in the eu european commission 2015 hoekstra et al 2009 the same reference stagnation time should be used to be able to compare the results before and after the remediation measures at a given site identifying critical taps 10 μg pb l recent investigations including this study reveal that 1 outlets with a high potential for lead release can be found in all buildings even when other taps show low lead release and 2 these high risk outlets can be a significant source of lead for children therefore identifying outlets of concern that are used for drinking water consumption and meal preparation should be a priority identifying high lead outlets is possible using a fixed stagnation protocol either 30 min or overnight in this study 30 min stagnation samples increased back to about 50 of the concentration of samples collected following overnight stagnation when lead levels after a 30 min stagnation exceed 5 μg pb l more detailed investigation including sequential sampling should be conducted to confirm if the problem is distal or systemic if this is not the case then full profiling and material investigations should be conducted this study s results and the meta analysis conducted by deshommes et al 2016a suggest that lead concentrations are highest at the distal point directly at the outlet and its connecting plumbing recommended sampling approach to minimize lead exposure in school outlets we recommend a two tier sampling approach consisting of 1 sampling after 6 h of stagnation and 2 investigative sampling combining a first draw 250 ml and second draw 1 min flush samples after fixed stagnation at all taps exceeding 10 μg pb l all outlets used for drinking water and cooking in a building should be tested with this approach the elevated lead outlets can be quickly identified and the significant sources of lead identified elevated lead outlets or taps have been shown to the most significant in terms of exposure in the meta analysis conducted by deshommes et al 2016a as well as by the bll analysis this study sampling after extended stagnation is difficult to implement in private households as it is invasive it is easier to implement in a school as it is possible to sample prior to the beginning of a school day although we sampled after at least 8h of stagnation in this study we recommend a minimum stagnation time of 6 h for the following reasons 1 although lead levels may increase after 6 h they will be sufficient to allow the detection of high risk outlets 2 the presence of extended child care services and evening use of facilities may limit the possibility to sample after more than 6 h stagnation considering the necessity to flush 5 min and the challenge of ensuring a controlled stagnation of 30 min the 30mins would be more difficult to implement in large buildings sampling after 1 min of flushing would allow the detection of leaded materials in the plumbing considering the limited resources available to many school boards and schools we believe that the use of a portable anodic stripping voltammetry analyzers is an attractive option to rapidly identify elevated lead taps in schools preventing further exposure of children these devices are low cost and can be used with minimal training by local staff including janitors furthermore as samples collected following overnight stagnation typically corresponded to a high estimate of potential concentration at the tap such samples can be measured on site using portable devices despite their high detection limit 2 μg pb l however on site portable anodic stripping voltammetry could only detect a fraction of all particulate lead present in samples containing high proportions of particulate lead after partial lead service line replacements cartier et al 2012a however even with this partial detection 24 9 for total pb the 68 samples which exceeded 10 μg pb l in this study would have been detected even if no particulate lead was detected by voltammetry we estimate that still 88 of the taps exceeding 10 μg pb l would have been identified in the case of cold water samples 15 c samples should be allowed to reach room temperature prior to analysis nonetheless additional validation of the use if these devices appears desirable to ensure their proper use finally schools more likely to contain legacy solder and leaded brass should be prioritized for intervention especially those receiving corrosive water as the proportion of outlets with elevated lead and the levels of lead measured will be more significant 4 conclusions flushing taps in large buildings provides short term benefits that are lost following a short stagnation 30 min as lead and copper concentrations increase to values about half of those measured following extended stagnation flushing represented a less effective mean to decrease copper when compared to lead concentrations at the tap furthermore copper concentrations were not as well controlled using ph adjustment as for lead a simple aggressivity index may be useful screening index to identify buildings at risk for elevated lead concentrations but should not be used to predict lead and copper concentrations all types of consumption points are at risk in buildings supplied by corrosive water buildings susceptible to having leaded components in their plumbing faucets valves lsls etc and or serviced with water of low alkalinity and ph should be prioritized the first 250 ml of water stagnating in taps should not be consumed water should be flushed prior to consumption even following short stagnation in most fountains it takes 2 20 s to flush this volume of water a first draw collected after overnight stagnation allows for quick and easy identification of the distal sources of lead which have been shown to be dominant in large buildings the probability for exposure to high lead levels being increased if follow up samples collected after shorter stagnation present significant concentrations all outlets used for drinking water consumption should be tested for lead acknowledgements the

19532,legacy lead and copper components are ubiquitous in plumbing of large buildings including schools that serve children most vulnerable to lead exposure lead and copper samples must be collected after varying stagnation times and interpreted in reference to different thresholds a total of 130 outlets fountains bathroom and kitchen taps were sampled for dissolved and particulate lead as well as copper sampling was conducted at 8 schools and 3 institutional non residential buildings served by municipal water of varying corrosivity with and without corrosion control cc and without a lead service line samples included first draw following overnight stagnation 8h partial 30 s and fully 5 min flushed and first draw after 30 min of stagnation total lead concentrations in first draw samples after overnight stagnation varied widely from 0 07 to 19 9 μg pb l median 1 7 μg pb l for large buildings served with non corrosive water higher concentrations were observed in schools with corrosive water without cc 0 9 201 μg pb l median 14 3 μg pb l while levels in schools with cc ranged from 0 2 to 45 1 μg pb l median 2 1 μg pb l partial flushing 30 s and full flushing 5 min reduced concentrations by 88 and 92 respectively for corrosive waters without cc lead concentrations were 10 μg pb l in all samples following 5 min of flushing however after only 30 min of stagnation first draw concentrations increased back to 45 than values in 1st draw samples collected after overnight stagnation concentrations of particulate pb varied widely 0 02 846 μg pb l and was found to be the cause of very high total pb concentrations in the 2 of samples exceeding 50 μg pb l pb levels across outlets within the same building varied widely up to 1000x especially in corrosive water 0 85 851 μg pb l after 30ms confirming the need to sample at each outlet to identify high risk taps based on the much higher concentrations observed in first draw samples even after a short stagnation the first 250ml should be discarded unless no sources of lead are present results question the cost benefit of daily or weekly flushing as a remediation strategy as such current regulatory requirements may fail to protect children as they may not identify problematic taps and effective mitigation measures graphical abstract image 1 keywords lead copper drinking water sampling large building school 1

options to decrease exposure to lead and copper 2 materials and methods 2 1 building selection and sampling campaign in may and june 2012 drinking water was sampled in schools and large buildings located in two canadian provinces buildings sampled were served by municipal distribution systems fed by surface water sources three types of buildings were sampled 1 schools without corrosion control cc and low alkalinity water 40 mg caco3 l 2 schools with ph control ph 8 5 and low alkalinity and 3 large building complexes with high alkalinity 70 mg caco3 l moderate ph ph 7 5 8 0 without cc in this context schools were defined as small buildings with 80 850 students large building complexes as multi storey buildings with an average capacity ranging from 7000 to 60 000 people large buildings b9 and b11 are university complexes building b10 is a pediatric hospital there were no lsls installed in the buildings sampled in total 130 taps were sampled including fountains kitchen and bathroom faucets table 1 shows the number of samples collected ph alkalinity and mean temperature the type of faucets and the year of construction of the building the aggressivity index ai was computed recognizing that it may not be the best predictor of lead release ai ph log ah a being the alkalinity and h the hardness both expressed as concentration of calcium or as mg l equivalent caco3 awwa 1977 2 2 sampling protocol the sampling protocol included the sequential collection of 5 samples at selected tap leaving the aerator in place a first draw of 250 ml 1s 8h and second draw sample of 1 75 l 2s 8h were collected following at least 8h of stagnation immediately there after the water was left running and two additional 250 ml samples were collected one after 30 s of flushing 30sf and the other after 5 min 5minf flushing was timed after the second draw 2s 8h was taken therefore the 30sf sample corresponded more precisely to a sample collected between 30 s and 1 min of flushing finally a stagnation of 30 min was performed and a 250 ml sample was collected 30mins following completion of sampling aerators were removed from kitchen and bathroom faucets such that particles could be collected where possible water temperature was measured after both 30 s and 5 min of flushing all samples were drawn at maximum flow rate 0 8 7 7 lpm for fountains 0 8 18 lpm for kitchen faucets and 1 6 13 lpm for bathroom faucets and collected using wide mouth bottles sampling points were allocated across the building general water quality parameters including ph total and free chlorine cl2 and heterotrophic plate count were evaluated at the closest point to the main water entry and at the point the furthest away after overnight stagnation and 10 min of flushing additional testing was performed at the schools the most at risk of elevated pb based on their low ph and alkalinity as well as on the absence of corrosion control treatment during the second day kitchen faucets n 7 were sampled according to the procedure described by deshommes et al 2010 to stimulate particulate detachment following overnight stagnation a 1l sample pss1 was collected by opening and closing the tap 5 times reaching maximum flow rate a second 1l sample pss2 was collected using maximum flow rate and a third 1 l sample pss3 was collected using the same procedure as for pss1 2 3 analytical methods water samples were analyzed for total and dissolved lead copper zinc tin and iron a 40 ml aliquot was immediately filtered 0 45 μm for digestion of colloids and particles samples were acidified within 36 h using 2 ultra pure hno3 for total metals and 0 5 ultra pure hno3 for dissolved metal samples as modified from triantafyllidou et al 2007 analysis was performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms based on the epa 200 8 protocol detection limits were 0 02 μg pb l 0 06 μg cu l 0 2 μg zn l 1 μg sn l 0 9 μg fe l on site temperature and ph were measured using a hach sension 1 portable ph meter total and residual chlorine using a hach pocket colorimeter ii 2 4 statistical analysis and ieubk modeling non parametric statistical analyses including marspline analyses and kruskal wallis anova tests were performed in statistica version 13 statsoft ok usa differences were considered significant if p 0 05 unless stated otherwise the usepa ieubk version win1 1 build11 model was used to predict the blls for children 5 7 years old as described by deshommes et al 2016a when considering canadian inputs for lead sources other than water tap water intake at school was attributed to be 50 of the daily water intake 3 results and discussion 3 1 lead and copper concentrations per type of sampling protocol the overall distribution of total dissolved and particulate lead as well as copper concentrations and the percentage of particulate content are presented in fig 1 the highest pb and cu concentrations were observed in the first 250 ml sampled following overnight stagnation 1s 8h subsequently as water was flushed concentrations decreased lead concentrations after extended stagnation 8h and short stagnation 30min periods are statistically different whereas they are similar for copper kruskal wallis anova test among the various samples 90th percentile concentrations were highest in the first 21 μg pb l and second 8 1 μg pb l draws following an extended 8h stagnation levels decreased to 5 2 and 2 4 μg pb l after flushing for 30 s and 5 min and increased to 8 9 μg pb l after 30 min of stagnation the median and 90th percentile concentrations following 30 min of stagnation represented 45 2 and 42 8 of those following extended stagnation the highest lead concentration was observed after 30 min of stagnation 850 μg pb l of which 99 4 was pbparticulate these results follow expected trends of a decrease of pbtotal as water is flushed from the tap barn et al 2014 boyd et al 2008b cartier et al 2012b mcilwain et al 2015 triantafyllidou et al 2014 fig 1 also shows large variability for a given type of sample typically exceeding one order of magnitude wide variability between taps was observed in schools which received aggressive water in a community in british columbia canada as shown by first draw pbtotal concentrations ranging from 5 9 to 306 μg pb l barn et al 2014 larger datasets from across canada indicate an even greater variation of over 4 orders of magnitude deshommes et al 2016a in the current study short 30 s flush decreased lead and copper concentrations by 81 and 59 respectively from first draw samples while elevated concentrations continued to occur first draw 90th percentile concentrations of 738 μg cu l decreased to 502 μg cu l after a 30 s flush and to 381 μg cu l after 30 min of stagnation approximately 78 of our first draw samples exceed the california public health goal phg of 300 μg cu l fig 2 shows the variability of pb and cu concentrations at each of the tap of the 11 buildings sampled b1 b11 firstly lead and copper concentrations at a given tap can vary up to 415 fold for lead up to 39 fold for cu depending on the sampling protocol used and the presence of particulate metals furthermore within a given school the median concentrations measured at the different outlets can vary by 114 fold for pb and 202 fold for cu regardless of the groups of buildings considered lower corrosivity clearly decreases all pb and cu concentrations observed but elevated pb taps remain as shown in building b8 these results reinforce the need to sample at every outlet used for drinking water with the objective of identifying taps at risk of elevated concentration of lead and or copper 3 2 water quality and type of faucet overall results show that the first 250 ml collected following 8h stagnation contains significantly higher pb levels suggesting that the faucet and its connecting piping are dominant lead contributors in the buildings sampled the internal volumes of faucet can vary between 24 and 106 ml cartier et al 2012b and tank volume of fountain have been estimated to be 750 ml mcilwain et al 2015 lead levels measured were the highest in schools which received low ph and low alkalinity water per type of tap fig 3 with median and 90th percentile respectively of 3 0 and 21 1 μg pb l for fountains 4 7 and 47 4 μg pb l for kitchen taps and 3 0 and 175 μg pb l for bathroom taps this group of buildings is statistically different from the other two p 0 05 similar to murphy 1993 corrosive water low ai was associated with the highest lead release after overnight stagnation median first draw concentrations measured in fountains 13 8 μg pb l fig s1b were similar to values reported by the same author 15 μg pb l for similar water corrosivity when considering the schools investigated first draw 1s 8h median lead concentration in locations serviced by water with high alkalinity and with ph adjustment were 78 times lower 1 7 133 μg pb l therefore cc treatment can effectively be used to decrease lead concentrations in buildings median and 90th percentile copper concentrations were generally higher in the large building group 141 and 619 μg cu l when compared to schools with 13 7 and 63 5 μg cu l and without 73 5 and 415 μg cu l cc fig 3 and fig s2 in contrast to total pb concentrations which were generally the highest in schools without cc copper levels overlap between the various water qualities investigated and between the different types of samples fig s2 this suggests that the sources of copper are more widespread confirmed by the frequent presence of copper piping or different within the buildings water system than the sources of lead this is also consistent with the fact that it takes a longer flushing time to decrease copper concentrations when compared to lead barn et al 2014 as expected and previously reported by murphy 1993 ai is not a useful predictor of copper concentrations since the factors influencing lead and copper corrosion differ copper corrosion increases at alkalinities below 25 mg caco3 l and above 75 mg caco3 l schock et al 1995 which cannot be determined by the ai 3 3 impact of flushing the percentage of samples 10 μg pb l decreases with flushing table 2 in agreement with previous studies cartier et al 2012b deshommes et al 2016a mcilwain et al 2015 triantafyllidou et al 2014 first draw samples in schools without cc most frequently 65 exceeded 10 μg pb l regardless of the type of tap the percentage exceedance decreased to 22 in the second 1 75l draw after 8h stagnation a short 30s flush resulted in a further reduction to 14 as observed in bryant 2004 in schools supplied by water with ph control only kitchen taps exceeded 10 μg pb l in first draw samples 43 while fountains and bathroom taps remained 10 μg pb l even following overnight stagnation periodical flushing at taps used for consumption has been proposed as a remediation method government of ontario 2010 health canada 2009 usepa 2006 prior investigations document the efficacy of a short flush 30 s in decreasing lead concentrations in schools when sampling fountains in seattle 33 of first draw samples exceeded 10 μg pb l down to 7 after a 30 s flush boyd et al 2008b the effectiveness of flushing varied within each school in british columbia canada and reduced more lead than copper barn et al 2014 flushing taps for 10 min in the morning did not result in lead and copper reductions throughout the day in schools in new jersey murphy 1993 questioning the benefits from flushing considered together these results show the benefits of avoiding the very first draw after both a short or extended stagnation and of flushing to reduce the proportion of samples with elevated lead however this mitigation method is not effective in reducing lead levels in all taps since a significant proportion of them still exceed 10 μg pb l considering the health based standard of 5 μg pb l recently proposed by health canada 2017 schools with adequate cc in this study had pb levels that were lower in most samples except the first 250 ml after 8h stagnation table 2 finally considering the american academy of pediatrics aap proposed level of 1 μg pb l only the fully flushed 5 min samples in schools with ph adjustment would meet this low threshold at most taps 93 table s3 similar to lead copper concentrations also decrease when taps are flushed the maximum concentration measured after 5 min of flushing in this study 784 μg cu l is 10 fold lower than that reported by barn et al 2014 for elementary 10 700 μg cu l and secondary schools 7000 μg cu l following a 10 min flush this reinforces the fact that the impact of flushing can vary depending on the building and water quality as also reported by murphy 1993 for a 10 min flush in schools without cc the median concentration in first draw samples collected from fountains following a 30 min stagnation 81 7 μg cu l was 35 6 of that observed after extended overnight stagnation 229 μg cu l when considering all samples collected 90th percentile concentrations at fountains 331 μg cu l exceed the californian phg 300 μg cu l for schools without cc and having low alkalinity as well as large buildings without cc and high alkalinity 482 μg cu l table 3 flushing the first 250 ml decreased the 90th percentile concentrations to 215 μg cu l in the schools without cc and low alkalinity however in the large buildings flushing the stagnated water did not reduce the 90th percentile copper concentrations below 300 μg cu l for schools with ph control and low alkalinity all concentrations were 300 μg cu l maximum 146 μg cu l 3 4 particulate lead and copper fig 4 shows the distributions of the concentrations and fractions of particulate lead 4a and 4b and copper 4c and 4d schools without cc present the highest particulate lead and copper concentrations with 90th percentile concentrations of 14 μg pb l and 54 μg cu l these values are considerably lower than prior reports for a large penitentiary complex serviced with corrosive water and with low water usage 90th percentiles of 98 μg pb l and 2720 μg cu l for drinking fountains cartier et al 2012b the pbpart and cupart fractions were the lowest for large buildings with 56 and 17 9 respectively of non detectable particulate corresponding to low pbpart concentrations median 0 03 μg pb l 10 7 higher median pbpart were present at taps with low alkalinity water with 0 17 μg pb l 26 5 and without 1 55 μg l 37 cc these results illustrate that high particulate fractions are not necessarily associated with elevated lead levels for the 13 650 samples that exceeded 50 μg pbtotal l the particulate fraction ranged from 15 2 to 99 9 interestingly 11 of the 13 high concentrations samples were detected in schools supplied with low alkalinity water without cc the particulate fraction exceeded 87 in most of 8 13 of the elevated samples while 4 samples contained mainly pbdiss 15 24 pbpart higher particulate median concentrations and fractions were present at the taps without cc 6 3 μg pb l 12 2 in comparison to those with low alkalinity water with ph control 1 7 μg l 13 8 and large buildings with high alkalinity 2 6 μg l 3 6 for the 5 650 samples that exceeded 1000 μg cutotal l the particulate fraction ranged from 0 1 to 99 9 these were all detected in fountains following a period of extended stagnation furthermore the two samples for which cupart was elevated 84 9 also showed high particulate pb and zn indicating galvanic corrosion of leaded brass as a probable source of both the particulate pb concentrations and fractions in this study particulate pb concentrations and fractions were considerably lower than reported previously for a penitentiary complex 50 μg pb l vs 2 1 μg pb l and 48 vs 14 where it was found to be twice the concentration of pbdiss deshommes et al 2012 such a relationship cannot be observed at the points sampled in this study only one sample collected at a kitchen faucet after 30 min of stagnation exceeded the acute single dose equivalent concentration of 580 μg l uscpsc 2005 3 5 particulate simulation sampling when considering schools with low ph water and alkalinity 7 taps were re sampled on the second day of sampling using a protocol designed to stimulate particulate release from the taps fig 5 on the first day of sampling the taps were flushed for 5 min the following day when sampling for the psss concentrations 10 μg pb l were observed in the first 2 l sampled at high flow rate total lead concentrations were highest in the second sample collected when combining samples 1s 8h and 2s 8h first 2l from day 1 a weighted average of 15 2 μg pb l was obtained with most of the pb being contributed by the 1st sample 250 ml the weighted average is comparable to the mean concentration obtained when pss1 and pss2 are combined 16 2 μg pb l disturbances in the sampling flow rate did not increase the lead release and mean lead concentrations in the 3rd liter pss3 were lower than in pss1 and pss2 again showing the benefits of avoiding the first draw volume disturbances in flow rate during sampling have been shown to increase the detachment of small colloids 0 45 μm from scales formed inside lsls of single family homes whereas lead particles from solders and brass fixtures were released in first draw samples deshommes et al 2010 the difference observed in this study could therefore be explained by the nature and source of the particles re suspended in water with hydraulic disturbances and the premise plumbing 3 6 contributors to lead and copper concentrations marspline regressions were conducted to identify the factors which impact lead and copper concentrations when considering metal analyzed total and particulate pb fe sn zn and cu sampling point group of building water quality school and type of taps and flow rate table s4 following overnight stagnation the building and specific point of sampling were the dominant factors predicting pbtotal followed to a lesser degree by other total metals sn zn fe cu if only concentrations exceeding 5 or 10 μg pb l are considered the relative contribution of sntotal indicative of the contribution of leaded solder increases following a 30 s flush multiple metals become important fe zn sn cu revealing multiple sources of lead the strong contribution of iron potentially reflects the impact of water quality defining the combined level of iron release from the iron water mains in the building as well as lead release from both solders and leaded brass following extended flushing the dominant contribution of sn was no longer present with cu and zn becoming the most important factors along with the specific sampling point and building as such as the 5 min flushed sample cannot be used to detect the contribution of leaded solders when considering a shorter 30 min stagnation tin becomes the dominant factor over building reflecting the contribution of solders at the tap and its connecting plumbing unlike the 8h stagnation particulate samples only tin and not copper were associated with elevated pbpart after a shorter stagnation this suggests that a 30 min stagnation can be used to detect the contribution of lead from distal solders pbpart is best predicted when considering different factors than those for pbtotal including cupart sampling point and snpart leaded brass and solder both generated lead particles factors associated with pbpart following short 30 min and overnight stagnation suggest that different mechanisms are at play in the release of pbpart following overnight stagnation all particulate metal concentrations are considered to be factors associated with pbpart cu sn fe zn as well as the sampling point the group of buildings the buildings and taps in large buildings the main sources of copper are copper piping and brass fixtures following overnight stagnation and 30 min stagnation the building sampling point and zinc concentrations are dominant factors explaining in copper concentrations as such the sources of copper in the buildings are leaded brass components for flushed samples 30sf the group of buildings represents the main factor for predicting copper concentrations sampling point pb and zn concentrations remain important predictors for fully flushed samples 5minf the sampling point building and water quality are important predictors as well as the other metals measured pb fe zn sn indicating that the sources of copper are different and could come from solder 3 7 blood lead levels modelling and copper intake drinking water consumption scenarios typically assume that children consume 50 of their daily intake at home and 50 at schools triantafyllidou et al 2014 with a house lead concentration of 2 μg pb l deshommes et al 2016a as the statistical analysis confirmed the overwhelming importance of the sampling point and building we elected to use mean values from all 90th percentile concentrations including first and second draw after extended stagnation partially and fully flushed samples and samples after a short 30 min stagnation a measurable impact of water consumption while at school on the gm blls is seen in schools without cc and low alkalinity fig 6 for this case avoiding the first draw 250 ml results in a 21 7 decrease of the gm bll to 2 16 μg dl without 1s 8h and of 38 7 to 1 69 μg dl without both 8h and 30mins avoiding all first 250 ml draw is not as beneficial when ph adjustment is practiced 7 8 gm bll or for high alkalinity waters 10 5 modelled blls are comparable to those reported by deshommes et al 2016a who showed that lead at the tap could cause elevated bll in some children and in some cases a rare but concerning risk of acute exposure our detailed sampling results confirm the need to use a sampling protocol capable of identifying outlets with elevated lead the impact of cu from drinking water from large buildings can be assessed by considering the fraction of the daily intake versus the recommended daily allowance and the tolerable upper intake level recommended for children aged between 4 and 8 years old health canada who and the state of california refer a daily allowance of 340 μg d and a tolerable upper intake level of 3000 μg d california epa 2008 the median exposure for all buildings sampled represented 37 7 of the recommended daily allowance and reached 83 1 in the case of large buildings group using the 90th percentile values the daily intake of copper from drinking water exceeded the total daily recommended allowance in all but one group of schools with corrosion control but did not exceed the tolerable upper level intake most observed copper levels represent a significant fraction of the recommended total daily allowance that should be avoided in the case of formula fed infants california epa 2008 3 8 possible remedial actions various actions can be considered to lower lead exposure at the tap in schools and large buildings and to guide sampling 3 8 1 replacement of leaded components as observed in boyd et al 2008b the removal of lead containing components in fountains and faucets as well as their connecting piping resulted in the removal of the distal volume in which the highest lead concentrations were systematically measured despite replacing these taps and their connecting piping the remaining sources such as leaded solders and brass and in rarer cases lead pipes and service lines may still be present in schools lead concentrations measured after 5 min of flushing in this study indicate that some non distal sources of lead were present in the buildings whilst the removal of all sources of lead in large building would be desirable our results suggest that removing the sources of lead at the tap and its connecting immediate piping may suffice to considerably decrease pb exposure a system wide investigation of all sources of lead in the internal plumbing of large buildings may appear the best approach to identify sources of lead to be removed however as older buildings contain a variety of materials for piping solders brass fittings and faucets it would be difficult or even impossible to conduct a thorough assessment of all pb sources by inspection as many of these elements are not readily accessible water sampling can be used as a proxy to identify pb sources it is widely accepted for the detection of lsls cartier et al 2012a deshommes et al 2016b 3 8 2 corrosion control ph adjustment of low alkalinity water can be efficient to lower lead levels when considering various types of faucets and fountains compensating in part for the presence of leaded materials at the tap various onsite cc treatments have been shown to be effective for the control of lead release from taps and their connecting piping cartier et al 2012b our results confirm that system wide corrosion control contributes to lowering lead in large buildings in the absence of system wide corrosion control on site corrosion control could be considered however on site treatment may have regulatory implications and requires human and financial resources that may not be available or feasible in many schools 3 8 3 flushing extended flushing of taps in the morning is ineffective for lowering lead and copper concentrations throughout the day as pb concentrations can again exceed 10 μg pb l after only 30 min of stagnation and 90th percentile cu concentrations exceed the california phg it is not realistic to recommend a 5 min flush prior to each use the waiting time would be unacceptable to the user and the wasted water would be considerable to fully flush premise plumbing a volume equivalent to both the service line and internal plumbing or more is needed in this study the service line volumes were considerable ranging from 50 l to 180 l furthermore the lower flows at fountains and the need to manually maintain the flow make it even more unpractical alternatively flushing for 20 s or less was sufficient to flush out the first 250 ml at maximum flow rate in our study such a procedure would be more feasible to implement and did decrease potential exposure significantly in buildings with corrosive water 3 8 4 designating drinking points within buildings lead free supply locations should be designated for drinking water and food preparation and regularly sampled to ensure acceptable water quality if the presence of leaded components is suspected building wide a pou device installed prior to the tap or fountain should be considered to help ensure low lead and copper concentrations as previously reported by deshommes et al 2012 3 9 selecting a sampling protocol the optimal sampling protocols depends on the sampling specific objectives assessing typical exposure the best approach to measure typical metal concentrations at drinking water points in households is proportional sampling van den hoven and slaats 2006 such sampling is resource intensive costly invasive and only feasible for research purposes a combination of the various protocols examined including long and short stagnation and flushed samples can serve to estimate a realistic range of concentrations to which children can be exposed random day time rdt and 30mins can provide results more indicative of typical exposure than 1st draw samples collected after overnight stagnation in households deshommes et al 2016b van den hoven and slaats 2006 however a much larger number of rdt samples would need to be collected to estimate typical exposure in this study table s5 assessing acute exposure the assessment of acute exposure at a tap poses a challenge as extreme lead concentrations are typically caused by sporadic release of pbpart in this study we did not observe an impact of the type of sampling protocol on the likelihood of elevated particulate lead as even the pss protocol did not produce more pbpart release however very high lead concentrations in this study mostly only exceeded 100 μg pb l in 4 130 taps after 8h of stagnation for these taps 30mins samples all exceeded 10 μg pb l however some elevated values 100 μg pb l were also measured after 30 min stagnation 3 130 suggesting worst case taps as previously reported by deshommes et al 2016a using extended stagnation and profiling sampling are most likely to provide worst case exposure identifying sources of lead the collection of consecutive samples following overnight stagnation profiling can be used to identify sources of lead and copper in large buildings cartier et al 2012b mcilwain et al 2015 first draw samples collected after stagnation can confirm distal contamination from the tap and its connecting plumbing subsequent samples collected as water is flowing can help identify other sources of lead in the remaining premise plumbing the concentrations in semi and fully flushed samples can also be used to identify buildings with more systemic presence of lead components in premise plumbing in our study 2 3 of flushed samples exceeded 5 μg pb l and 15 4 were 2 μg pb l when contamination is found in flushed samples then sequential sampling can be considered for detailed investigative work or research it is however very costly time consuming and more disruptive health canada 2009 estimating the effectiveness of treatment and remediation measures rdt sampling representative of a typical inter use stagnation is recommended in the eu european commission 2015 hoekstra et al 2009 the same reference stagnation time should be used to be able to compare the results before and after the remediation measures at a given site identifying critical taps 10 μg pb l recent investigations including this study reveal that 1 outlets with a high potential for lead release can be found in all buildings even when other taps show low lead release and 2 these high risk outlets can be a significant source of lead for children therefore identifying outlets of concern that are used for drinking water consumption and meal preparation should be a priority identifying high lead outlets is possible using a fixed stagnation protocol either 30 min or overnight in this study 30 min stagnation samples increased back to about 50 of the concentration of samples collected following overnight stagnation when lead levels after a 30 min stagnation exceed 5 μg pb l more detailed investigation including sequential sampling should be conducted to confirm if the problem is distal or systemic if this is not the case then full profiling and material investigations should be conducted this study s results and the meta analysis conducted by deshommes et al 2016a suggest that lead concentrations are highest at the distal point directly at the outlet and its connecting plumbing recommended sampling approach to minimize lead exposure in school outlets we recommend a two tier sampling approach consisting of 1 sampling after 6 h of stagnation and 2 investigative sampling combining a first draw 250 ml and second draw 1 min flush samples after fixed stagnation at all taps exceeding 10 μg pb l all outlets used for drinking water and cooking in a building should be tested with this approach the elevated lead outlets can be quickly identified and the significant sources of lead identified elevated lead outlets or taps have been shown to the most significant in terms of exposure in the meta analysis conducted by deshommes et al 2016a as well as by the bll analysis this study sampling after extended stagnation is difficult to implement in private households as it is invasive it is easier to implement in a school as it is possible to sample prior to the beginning of a school day although we sampled after at least 8h of stagnation in this study we recommend a minimum stagnation time of 6 h for the following reasons 1 although lead levels may increase after 6 h they will be sufficient to allow the detection of high risk outlets 2 the presence of extended child care services and evening use of facilities may limit the possibility to sample after more than 6 h stagnation considering the necessity to flush 5 min and the challenge of ensuring a controlled stagnation of 30 min the 30mins would be more difficult to implement in large buildings sampling after 1 min of flushing would allow the detection of leaded materials in the plumbing considering the limited resources available to many school boards and schools we believe that the use of a portable anodic stripping voltammetry analyzers is an attractive option to rapidly identify elevated lead taps in schools preventing further exposure of children these devices are low cost and can be used with minimal training by local staff including janitors furthermore as samples collected following overnight stagnation typically corresponded to a high estimate of potential concentration at the tap such samples can be measured on site using portable devices despite their high detection limit 2 μg pb l however on site portable anodic stripping voltammetry could only detect a fraction of all particulate lead present in samples containing high proportions of particulate lead after partial lead service line replacements cartier et al 2012a however even with this partial detection 24 9 for total pb the 68 samples which exceeded 10 μg pb l in this study would have been detected even if no particulate lead was detected by voltammetry we estimate that still 88 of the taps exceeding 10 μg pb l would have been identified in the case of cold water samples 15 c samples should be allowed to reach room temperature prior to analysis nonetheless additional validation of the use if these devices appears desirable to ensure their proper use finally schools more likely to contain legacy solder and leaded brass should be prioritized for intervention especially those receiving corrosive water as the proportion of outlets with elevated lead and the levels of lead measured will be more significant 4 conclusions flushing taps in large buildings provides short term benefits that are lost following a short stagnation 30 min as lead and copper concentrations increase to values about half of those measured following extended stagnation flushing represented a less effective mean to decrease copper when compared to lead concentrations at the tap furthermore copper concentrations were not as well controlled using ph adjustment as for lead a simple aggressivity index may be useful screening index to identify buildings at risk for elevated lead concentrations but should not be used to predict lead and copper concentrations all types of consumption points are at risk in buildings supplied by corrosive water buildings susceptible to having leaded components in their plumbing faucets valves lsls etc and or serviced with water of low alkalinity and ph should be prioritized the first 250 ml of water stagnating in taps should not be consumed water should be flushed prior to consumption even following short stagnation in most fountains it takes 2 20 s to flush this volume of water a first draw collected after overnight stagnation allows for quick and easy identification of the distal sources of lead which have been shown to be dominant in large buildings the probability for exposure to high lead levels being increased if follow up samples collected after shorter stagnation present significant concentrations all outlets used for drinking water consumption should be tested for lead acknowledgements the

19533,nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi has been proposed to remediate heavy metal ions in the subsurface however the fate of metal nzvi hybrid has not been fully investigated in this study we investigated 1 the long term removal performance of nzvi for molybdate mo vi 2 the relationship between the ageing of mo nzvi hybrid in specific solution chemistries and the remobilization of mo vi from the hybrid and 3 the effects of mo nzvi hybrid on cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa results showed that although common ions have limited influence on the removal ratio of mo vi by nzvi they do impact the structure evolution and transformation of the mo nzvi nanohybrid formed thereafter ageing time was crucial for the chemical stabilization of mo nzvi hybrid but common groundwater ions retarded the stabilizing process which may lead to a significant remobilization of mo vi from the hybrid after exposure to water bodies while low levels of mo vi ions could stimulate the growth of m aeruginosa aged mo nzvi hybrid inhibited the growth of m aeruginosa except when ageing occurred in the presence of hpo4 2 co3 2 which also retarded hybrid stabilization this study shows that nzvi can immobilize mo vi ions in groundwater and the derived metal nzvi hybrid can effectively suppress the potential growth of m aeruginosa in river water graphical abstract image 1 keywords molybdate

majority of current studies have focused on the short term removal performance of nzvi li and zhang 2007 tanboonchuy et al 2012 zhu et al 2009 in the long term the decline of fe 0 content liu and lowry 2006 changes to the core shell structure liu et al 2015 and the different iron oxides derived from fe 0 oxidation lowry and liu 2006 can impact the metal removal performance of nzvi as well as the removal mechanism although several studies investigated the transformation of nzvi in groundwater liu et al 2017 reinsch et al 2010 to the best of our knowledge there are no studies integrating long term metal removal performance with the transformation and aging of nzvi under specific conditions particularly in the presence of common groundwater ions further unlike with applications of nzvi in industrial wastewater treatment li et al 2016 the metal nzvi hybrid formed during the remediation groundwater pollution is nearly impossible to contain and or remove from the matrix as a result the nanohybrid can be released into nearby surface waters lefevre et al 2015 thus the fate of metal nzvi hybrid in aqueous media must be fully investigated as an important part of any groundwater nzvi based remediation project before the nanohybrid reaches a waterbody it undergoes ageing for different lengths of time different ageing times under different conditions will result in different nanohybrid compositions johnson et al 2013 lefevre et al 2015 for instance the nanohybrid may contain different fe 0 amounts various types of iron oxides and different species of metals furthermore the different compositions of nanohybrid can cause different toxic effects on ecologically important organisms such as freshwater algae keller et al 2012 and cyanobacteria marsalek et al 2012 microcystis aeruginosa is a common cyanobacteria in freshwater which can produce harmful microcystin funari and testai 2008 a previous study showed that pristine nzvi can destroy cyanobacterial cells marsalek et al 2012 but it remains unknown whether nzvi still possesses its inhibitory effects on cyanobacteria after particle ageing and or adsorption of metal ions further organism derived organic matters can affect the stability and transformation of iron based nanoparticles adeleye et al 2016a which may affect the chemical stability of the metal nzvi hybrid in ways we currently do not know a comprehensive study of the fate of metal nzvi hybrid in water is therefore required in order to fully evaluate the effectiveness and implications of nzvi in remediation of metal polluted groundwater in this study we investigated the long term 30 days removal performance of nzvi for mo vi under different environmentally relevant conditions while monitoring the transformation of nzvi during a 30 day experiment to simulate the release of metal nzvi nanohybrid into a river mo nzvi nanohybrid was aged for different times and then transferred into a modified river water 90 raw river water and 10 bg 11 medium containing cyanobacteria for another 30 days chlorophyll a chl a was monitored for the 30 days in order to understand the effects of metal nzvi nanohybrid on the growth of cyanobateria 2

ddiw was used for solution preparation in batch experiments the nzvi synthesis method was based on previously published methods su et al 2014a 2014b zhang et al 2013 according to the following reaction 4fe3 3bh4 9h2o 4fe0 3h2bo3 12h 6h2 freshly prepared nzvi was stored in 100 ethanol detailed synthesis conditions and characterization of nzvi can be found in our previous studies su et al 2014a 2014b zhang et al 2013 2 2 long term removal experiments of mo vi in ddiw the influence of different cations na mg2 ca2 and anions cl so4 2 hpo4 2 and co3 2 on mo vi removal by nzvi was investigated in ddiw experiments were carried out in 100 ml serum bottles under different conditions on a shaking table 250 rpm 25 1 c shanghai fengling laboratory instrument fly 111b china each bottle was filled with 500 mg l nzvi and 20 mg l mo vi except for one set of bottles used for pure nzvi ageing 20 mg l mo vi was selected so we could clearly see the influence of ions and nzvi transformation on removal efficiency as 500 mg l nzvi only removed 90 of 20 mg l mo vi in a previous study qian et al 2018 moreover after 10 fold dilution preliminary studies showed that 2 mg l mo vi enhanced the growth of cyanobacteria while 50 mg l nzvi exerted no toxicity to algae adeleye et al 2016b l m stevenson et al 2017 this concentration of mo vi thus allowed us to clearly see the effect of the mo nzvi hybrids on cyanobacteria growth at each sampling point days 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 three bottles per condition were sacrificed for aqueous mo vi and fe ii analysis after filtration with 0 22 μm filters metal analysis was carried out via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes agilent 720es santa clara ca after the aliquots for aqueous metal analysis were

hubbard and snyder 1988 2 3 characterization of river water river water was collected from the confluence of the suzhou river and huangpu river shanghai china and filtered 0 22 μm to remove suspended solids and other material that can interfere with experiments dissolved organic carbon doc was measured by using a shimadzu toc v toc analyzer shimadzu scientific instruments the ph and conductivity of river water were determined by using a phsj 4f ph meter and dds 307a conductivity meter inesa scientific instrument shanghai respectively metal ions in water were determined using the agilent 720es

these raw river water indexes are shown in table 1 2 4 test organism culture and media cyanobacteria m aeruginosa was bought from the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology wuhan china batch cultures of m aeruginosa were first grown in basal glucose bg 11 media new cultures were inoculated to obtain an initial chl a concentration of 1 25 mg l and placed in an illumination incubator 12 12 light dark t 30 c gzx 300bs iii cimo medical instrument shanghai china su et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 preliminary studies showed that raw river water did not have enough nutrients to support the growth of m aeruginosa to obtain a suitable culture medium for m aeruginosa we amended the river water with bg 11 river water to bg 11 ratios 3 1 5 1 7 1 9 1 and found that m aeruginosa grew well in all those media we chose the culture media with 90 of river water to cultivate the blue green algae for studying the influence of mo nzvi on the growth of cyanobacteria as it had a high content of raw water this modification with 10 bg 11 led to a substantial increase in nitrate 24 6 mg l and phosphate 0 71 mg l concentrations compared to raw river water shown in table 1 2 5 fate and effects of mo nzvi hybrid on cyanobacteria cultures considering that mo vi might stimulate cyanobacteria bloom in surface water the interactions between mo nzvi nanohybrid and cyanobacteria were investigated after ageing the nanoparticles with or without mo vi for different time periods 2 h and 5 15 and 30 days the nanoparticles nanohybrid obtained were exposed to cyanobacteria the 10 ml mixture collected from the aged nanoparticle nanohybrid explained in section 2 2 was added into 80 ml of culture media and 10 ml inoculant preliminary test showed that under this condition the initial chl a concentration was 1 25 mg l as such the theoretical concentration of nzvi and mo in the cultures was 50 and 2 mg l respectively but the theoretical value of the fraction of remobilized mo at time 0 in cyanobacteria culture still equaled to that in 10 ml aged nanoparticle nanohybrid mixture the cells were cultivated for another 30 days a control condition was also setup which contained a similar algal density but no nanohybrids were added on days 1 3 5 7 11 15 22 and 30 doc and total nitrogen tn were determined using a shimadzu toc v toc analyzer mo vi was measured by icp oes and and fe ii was measured by phenanthroline based spectrophotometric method chl a concentration was used as a proxy for cell density and was monitored using a gemini xps fluorescence microplate reader fluorescence was converted to concentration of chl a μg l similar to our previous studies adeyemi s adeleye et al 2016b louise m stevenson et al 2017 additionally to analyze the molecular weight of the organic materials present in the cultures gel permeation chromatography lc 10ad shimadzu japan was employed 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term mo removal performance of nzvi the long term removal performance of nzvi for mo vi in the presence of different common groundwater ions was determined in control samples that is ddiw without ions 80 of the initial mo vi was immobilized within 5 days and after 30 days over 90 was sequestered removal of metallic pollutants was reported to reach equilibrium after 20 min in short term studies su et al 2015a zhang et al 2013 and the structure and composition of nzvi may not have changed significantly within such a short period of time over time not only does nzvi undergo structural and compositional changes liu et al 2015 2007 but the form species of immobilized metals on nzvi changes as well such as oxidized reduced and intra diffusing ling and zhang 2015 2014 since the adsorption capacity of iron oxide for mo vi at ph 9 was limited gustafsson 2003 the improvement during the long term experiments in the control system indicates that continuous reduction qian et al 2017 and probably intra diffusion of mo vi contribute to mo vi immobilization similar to the control system fast removal was recorded within initial 5 days in systems with 10 mm na mg2 or ca2 cation dosage yet slightly higher concentration of mo vi was detected after 30 days this is in good agreement with previous studies which suggest mo vi forms inner sphere binding after adsorption on nzvi for common anions while so4 2 and hpo4 2 had no obvious impact on mo vi removal co3 2 had a clearly negative influence coincidently while the initial ph of the system with so4 2 or hpo4 2 was close to the control 8 75 the one with co3 2 was much higher 10 75 figure s1 it appears that regardless of whether the co existing anions are adsorbed through inner sphere hpo4 2 or outer sphere so4 2 binding xu et al 2006a 10 mm anions won t impose significant impact on mo vi adsorption as long as the initial media ph is below 9 in addition although during the 30 day experiment the ph in control system gradually increased to 10 5 which was close to that in system with co3 2 the immobilized mo vi was not released back this is consistent with our previous study which showed that low ph contributes to fast and efficient removal of mo vi while high ph favors for mo vi reduction qian et al 2017 3 2 effect of ions on accumulation of fe ii fe ii is able to stimulate the generation of free radicals such as superoxide o2 hydroxyl radical oh and ferryl ion feo2 all of which are potentially toxic to organisms halliwell and gutteridget 1984 imlay et al 1988 wu et al 2014 we continuously monitored fe ii concentrations in the supernatant of each reaction system throughout the 30 day experiments similar to the control system increase of fe ii concentration in systems with cations addition was recorded after 10 days while 10 mm na or mg2 did not have any obvious effect on fe ii concentration figure s2 a 10 mm ca2 doubled fe ii concentration after 30 days although the highest fe ii concentration in control or systems with added cations reached to 12 mg l the presence of so4 2 hpo4 2 or co3 2 effectively brought down fe ii concentration to below 3 mg l figure s2 b which could be attributed to the iron precipitation on particle surface indicated by xps analysis in section 3 4 further in a natural environment fe ii produced from injected nzvi can be oxidized to iron oxide by dissolved oxygen resulting from regular groundwater fluctuation appelo and postma 2006 liu et al 2015 3 3 effect of different ions on the transformation of nzvi during the reaction with mo vi in ddiw xrd was employed to analyze crystals in the solids from different reaction systems over time the peaks at 2θ 44 8 and 62 5 were assigned to fe0 zhang et al 2013 and characteristic peaks of moo3 2θ 12 5 and fe2o3 2θ 35 5 were observed in the samples fig 2a through semi quantitative reference intensity ratio rir analysis we further estimated the fe 0 content in the samples obtained over the course of the experiment figure s3 except for the reaction system with so4 2 fe 0 content of all the systems declined rapidly during the first 5 days from 80 the initial fraction of fe 0 in nzvi to about 45 the decrease of fe 0 fraction was more gradual from day 5 30 when compared with the other ions tested sharp differences were observed in the fe 0 consumption trend in the presence of so4 2 and ca2 so4 2 initially inhibited fe 0 consumption mainly during the first 14 days after which the rate of fe 0 consumption was not much different from the other ions previously discussed the greatest fe 0 consumption was observed in the presence of ca2 almost all fe 0 was exhausted by the end of the experiments fig 2a since the ph of both so4 2 and ca2 reaction systems were around 9 0 the differences in fe 0 consumption behavior may be due to different effects arising from the different types of iron oxide produced from fe 0 oxidation based on previous studies so4 2 can stimulate the formation of green rust gr ahmed et al 2010 which may cover the surface of nzvi thereby decreasing fe 0 consumption however cl and co3 2 may also facilitate the generation of gr drissi et al 1995 refait et al 1998 but we did not observe a similar inhibition of fe 0 consumption in the presence of these anions the reason behind this phenomenon is still not clear and would require further studies unfortunately neither type of gr was identified in xrd analysis due to their strong reactivity with oxygen the strong signal of fe3 po4 2 peaks masked all the others peaks of samples obtained from the hpo4 2 system fig 2c making it impossible to calculate the fe 0 content throughout the study in general we found that ca2 accelerated the consumption of fe 0 while so4 2 depressed its consumption while other ions had a limited impact 3 4 surface reactions between mo and fe during the long term removal experiments we employed xps to analyze surface reactions during the 30 day experiments and found that different anions had different impacts on the composition of the mo nzvi hybrids formed figures s4 and s5 the fe 2p3 2 region was deconvoluted into three peaks which were assigned to feo 710 3 ev fe2o3 711 8 ev and ferrous iron salt figure s4 yamashita and hayes 2008 since xps only provides information on the outermost surface average depth of 3 5 nm nurmi et al 2005 failure to detect fe 0 via xps implies that the iron oxide layer is much thicker than 3 5 nm as shown in table 2 the iron oxide fractions in nanoparticles collected from the reaction systems with co3 2 and hpo4 2 were relatively stable in the presence of so4 2 however the abundance of the iron oxides decreased between days 15 and 30 fe2o3 decreased from 35 3 to 19 7 while feo increased from 10 to 31 7 at the end of the experiments nanoparticles from the system with hpo4 2 had the highest content of fe2o3 65 2 which was much higher than those obtained from the system with co3 2 32 3 or so4 2 19 7 regarding the ferrous iron salts feco3 and feso4 accounted for up to 50 of the total fe in their respective systems while fe3 po4 2 content decreased from 28 5 on day 15 17 4 on day 30 speciation of mo as revealed by mo 3d region analysis of samples shown in figure s5 and summarized in table 3 provides detailed information on the immobilization pathway of mo by nzvi for the reaction system with co3 2 a considerable amount of moo4 2 was reduced to moox 2 x 3 but the content of moox remained relatively stable from day 15 30 in the presence of so4 2 however while mo existed as pure moo3 after 15 days 47 5 of the moo3 was reduced to moox by day 30 the different mo vi reduction behavior between the systems with co3 2 and so4 2 may be due to 1 promotion of mo vi reduction by high ph qian et al 2017 2 formation of different types of gr hydroxycarbonate gr hydroxysulphate gr randall et al 2000 simon et al 2003 williams and scherer 2001 and 3 differences in the trend of fe 0 consumption increased abundance of moox in the system with so4 2 at the late phase may also result from the preserved fe 0 content as well interestingly while the majority of mo vi on nzvi surface existed as moo3 in the presence of so4 2 or co3 2 mo existed mainly as nh4 2moo4 the mo vi source used in experiment 59 7 after 15 days and 55 after 30 days in the presence of hpo4 it suggests that hpo4 might occupy the inner sphere adsorption sites which were previously occupied by mo vi xu et al 2006a 2006b leading to the formation of outer sphere complexes of mo vi in addition moo2 was found on the surface of nanoparticles collected from the reaction system with hpo4 the good electrical conductivity of iron phosphates herle et al 2004 may explain this further reduction of mo vi to form moo2 rather than moox detected in the presence of co3 2 and so4 2 3 5 structural evolution of mo nzvi hybrids during ageing in solutions with different ions tem was employed to examine the structural evolution of the nanoparticles nanohybrids in the different reaction systems throughout the experiment the pristine nzvi formed a chain like configuration figure s6 similar to reports from other studies zhang et al 2013 after 10 days in the control system as shown in fig 3 the majority of particles still possessed the core shell structure although it seemed that smaller sized particles were oxidized the majority of the nanoparticles were oxidized after 20 days and the core shell structure was no longer observable after 30 days the spherical morphology of nzvi was no longer obvious as the particles were mostly oxidized fig 4 illustrates the structural evolution of nzvi in the reaction system with different cations namely na a b c mg2 d e f and ca2 g h i in comparison with the structure evolution of nzvi in the control system the presence of na did not have any obvious impact on the structure which agrees with the results obtained from xrd analysis fe 0 content trend in the presence of mg2 the structure evolution was not different from the control conditions during the initial 20 days however wrinkled sheet like particles were observed on day 30 which were not seen in the control samples the chain like structure of nzvi were not found in the presence of ca2 by day 10 due to rapid oxidation in agreement with xrd analysis fig 5 demonstrates the structural evolution of nzvi in the presence of different anions the anions so4 2 co3 2 and hpo4 2 exhibited stronger influence on the structural evolution of nzvi compared to the cations the most striking difference is the formation of hollow structures which were previously reported by others wang et al 2013 fig 5 a c and f however the hollow structures were preserved for up to 30 days only in the reaction system with hpo4 2 given that the formation of hollow nanostructure is mainly due to the reaction between h and fe 0 qian et al 2017 these anions may be able to accelerate h diffusion within grain boundaries of the iron oxide shells xia et al 2016 further different anions resulted in the formation of different species of iron compounds iron salts as can be seen from the different morphologies obtained on day 30 of the experiments additionally tem images of nzvi collected from system with hpo4 2 showed the presence of fe 0 dark core area fig 5 e during the initial 20 days although nzvi s peaks were masked by the strong fe3 po4 2 peaks in xrd analysis as explained earlier it is notable that all these changes in the structure of nzvi over a period of 30 days did not result in the remobilization of already adsorbed mo vi as confirmed via icp oes fig 1 in agreement with the icp oes data xps analysis showed the presence of mo vi on the surface of the solids obtained throughout the experiments 3 6 remobilization of mo from mo nzvi hybrid in cyanobacteria culture media mo nzvi hybrid might end up in surface waters such as rivers and lakes near the remediation zone as shown earlier all the ions tested except co3 2 did not inhibit the removal of mo vi by nzvi and the immobilized mo vi was not released back into solution from the nanohybrid over a period of 30 days however remobilization of adsorbed mo vi from the hybrids occurred upon the introduction of the mo nzvi hybrid into cyanobacteria culture media fig 6 shows that a fraction of mo vi was released back into culture media from nanohybrid aged in the presence of common ions is much higher than that aged in ddiw indicating the presence of the ions decreased the long term stability of the mo nzvi hybrid for instance 20 of the mo vi initially removed by nzvi aged for 2 h inddiw was released back into the culture media from day 0 29 fig 6 a but the amount released when nzvi was aged for the same period of time in the presence of most of the ions exceeded 40 fig 6 b c d e g it has been reported that mo vi forms inner sphere complexes on iron oxide surfaces xu et al 2013 which is relatively stable inner sphere complexes may prevent the remobilization of mo vi from the mo nzvi hybrid into the culture media but common ions na mg2 ca2 cl so4 2 hpo4 2 appeared to have slowed down the formation of inner sphere complexes in most systems longer ageing time of mo nzvi hybrid resulted in lower remobilization of mo vi fig 6 in the absence of ions the amount of mo vi remobilized declined sharply with ageing time for up to 15 days after which further ageing did not really improve the stability of the hybrid in cyanobacteria culture media fig 6 a a similar trend was observed in the presence of na and mg2 fraction of mo vi released decreased from 80 when the nanohybrid was aged for 2 h to about 30 when aged for 30 days notably the improvement of hybrid s stability was minimal between ageing for 5 days and 15 days xrd analysis shows that fe0 content from 5 to 15 days is stable in na and mg2 systems which means that mo vi reduction to mo iv moo2 which has a low solubility product constant tucker et al 1998 is suppressed during this phase it is very likely that lack mo vi reduction leads to the poor improvement of mo nzvi hybrid stability however the reason why the fraction of mo vi did not change much between day 5 15 requires further study for anions 33 of the total mo vi initially removed by nzvi aged for 30 days was detected in the supernatant on day 30 when cl was present compared to the control system in which 15 was remobilized cl reduced the chemical stability of the mo nzvi nanohybrids fig 6b so4 2 retarded the stabilizing of the hybrids when aged for 0 15 days but only 10 of adsorbed mo was released back into aqueous phase when the hybrid was aged for 30 days slightly lower than what was observed in the control system the persistence of fe 0 in the presence of so4 2 fig 2 may have resulted in the continuous reduction of mo vi over 30 days enhancing the hybrid s stability as for co3 2 the low removal efficiency in batch experiment leads to an initial decline of a large fraction of mo vi detected after release to culture media but later increased back to levels similar to the initial amount between days 5 and 10 fig 6 f considering that the fraction of mo vi in culture media on day 30 was similar to day 0 the immobilized mo in this system was relatively stable even though its total amount on nanohybrid was much less than those in the other systems notably in fig 6 the trend of remobilized mo vi concentration was different when the nanoparticles were aged in ca2 and hpo4 2 fig 6 d g in these two systems there was no strong correlation between nanoparticle ageing time and mo vi remobilization behavior and a considerable fraction of mo was released into media again xrd analysis showed that ca2 accelerated fe 0 consumption which may have interfered with the subsequent reduction of mo vi immobilized on nzvi additionally ca2 may bind with moo4 2 and precipitate on the particle surface kindness et al 1994 restricting further diffusion of mo vi into fe 0 binding sites as for hpo4 2 its occupation on inner sphere adsorption sites xu et al 2013 may have led to the formation of outer sphere complexes of mo vi leading to easier remobilization in cyanobacteria culture media this is consistent with the results of xps analysis which showed that 55 of mo still existed as nh4 2moo4 on the surface of the particles after ageing for 30 days finally longer ageing time led to lower mo vi remobilization in the system with nanoparticles aged in the mixed each ion 2 mm solution however the amount of mo vi initially released between 0 and 10 days from the nanohybrid aged for 30 days in the mixed solution was higher than the amount released when the nanohybrid was aged in the same solution for 15 days similar to the system with co3 2 or hpo4 2 over 70 of mo was released in media the results from releasing the nanohybrid into cyanobacteria culture media suggest that 1 longer ageing time alleviates the adverse effects of most ions including na mg2 cl and so4 2 on mo nzvi hybrid chemical stability and 2 hpo4 2 strongly promotes the release of mo vi from mo nzvi hybrid 3 7 effect of aged mo nzvi nanoparticle on cyanobacteria growth rapid growth of cyanobacteria causes severe water quality issue we evaluated the influence of mo vi on cyanobacteria growth as illustrated by figure s7 mo vi does favor the growth of cyanobacteria at concentrations below 10 mg l which suggests mo vi pollution has to be treated however in cyanobacteria culture media with mo nzvi hybrid even though we detected a considerable amount of released mo vi we still observed a clear inhibition of cyanobacteria growth upon their exposure to the mo nzvi hybrid fig 7 which means that aged nzvi is effective for cyanobacteria growth control in the control treatment m aeruginosa grew rapidly after acclimatizing to the new media fig 7a we observed two different patterns in the cultures amended with nanohybrid 1 cyanobacteria cultures treated with nanohybrid aged in na2hpo4 na2co3 or mixed solution declined in the first 10 15 days and thereafter recovered to different extents fig 7 f g h and 2 cultures exposed to nanohybrid aged in ddiw nacl mgcl2 cacl2 or na2so4 did not grow appreciably throughout the 30 day experiments fig 7 a b c d e hpo4 2 and co3 2 two key factors for mo vi remobilization from aged mo nzvi hybrid are also the crucial influencing factors on the efficacy of aged mo nzvi hybrid for cyanobacteria growth inhibition growth inhibition might be due to cell lysis since high levels of doc figure s8 and decline of chl a concentration was observed at the initial stage of cell cultivation cell lysis will cause the release of intracellular high molecular weight macromolecules such as proteins and dna into the growth media marmur 1961 to verify this hypothesis cell lysis we analyzed the molecular weight of the organic materials present in the cultures and compared it with the molecular weight of doc obtained from cyanobacteria culture subjected to ultrasonication for 20 min to achieve cell lysis as shown in table 4 the number average weight average and z average of cyanobacteria cultures exposed to nanoparticles are similar to those obtained from ultrasound treated cells weight average 108 da li et al 2012 but are several orders of magnitude greater than what was observed in control cultures weight average 104 da indicating the dominance of extracellular organic materials in nanoparticle exposed cells li et al 2012 this corroborates the chl a data indicating that aged nzvi is still effective for inhibiting cyanobacteria growth the toxicity of aged nanohybrid may be due partly to fe ii ions that were released into the culture media as high levels of fe ii concentration was recorded at the beginning of cultivation figure s9 fe ii ions can stimulate the generation of free radicals under oxic conditions which can cause cell damage and impair photosynthesis adeyemi s adeleye et al 2016b sevcu et al 2011 winterbourn 1995 however fe ii ions was probably not the only reason for the cell lysis for example while the cells in cultures containing nanohybrid aged in na2so4 never grew with an initial fe ii concentration of 0 2 mg l fig 7 e cells in cultures containing nanohybrid aged in nah2po4 recovered despite having an initial fe ii concentration that was greater than 0 2 mg l fig 7 g lipczynska kochany et al 1995 reported that hpo4 2 and hco3 efficiently quenched free radicals in solution while so4 2 and cl transformed into free radicals after reacting with hydroxyl radicals the radical quenching effects of hpo4 2 and hco3 may have provided some protection for the cells exposed to nanohybrid aged in solutions containing the two anions furthermore toxicity may have been caused by the different iron oxides formed upon fe 0 consumption iron oxide nanoparticles such as fe3o4 ɤ fe2o3 fe2o3 are known to produce surface bound free radicals that can cause adverse effects to microorganisms valentine and wang 1998 voinov et al 2011 additionally high levels of mo vi were observed in culture system seeded with nanohybrid derived from hpo4 2 or hco3 solution which might stimulate the growth of cyanobacteria we also found that the effects of the nanohybrid on cyanobacterial growth may vary not only with ageing media but also with ageing time for instance nanohybrid aged for 15 days in h2po4 and mix solution was toxic more so than those aged for a shorter or a longer time given that the fe ii concentrations in these cultures are lower than that in cultures dosed with nanoparticles aged for 2 h it is not likely that the fe ii ions caused the growth inhibition instead higher toxicity at this time period may be due to the transformation of nanoparticles leading to the formation of different particles composition and morphology of nanohybrid which may exhibit varying toxicity over time with respect to mo vi pollution remediation ageing in groundwater with limited presence of phosphate helps to stabilize the mo nzvi hybrid which reduces mo vi release once the hybrids are released into surface water although mo vi is able to stimulate the growth of cyanobacteria aged mo nzvi can effectively inhibit its growth under most conditions 4 conclusions in this study we carried out a comprehensive investigation on the application of nzvi for remediation of mo vi polluted groundwater and the effect of aged mo nzvi hybrid on the growth of cyanobacteria common cations na mg2 and ca2 and anions cl so4 2 and hpo4 2 have little influence on the long term removal of mo vi by nzvi but they influence the structure evolution and composition of mo nzvi hybrids formed thereafter while na mg2 cl and co3 2 have limited impact on the consumption trend of fe 0 in mo nzvi hybrid ca2 and so4 2 have strong effects promoting and inhibiting fe 0 consumption respectively ageing in the aqueous phase is crucial for the chemical stabilization of the nanohybrid and its fate in water bodies into which the nanohybrid may be transported additional conclusions from this study include 1 ageing time is crucial for the stabilization of mo nzvi hybrid in the absence of ions longer ageing times resulted in more chemically stable hybrids and less mo vi remobilization from the hybrids into a river water 2 ions did not have much effects on long term removal of mo by nzvi but they disturbed the stability of the mo nzvi hybrids formed thereafter as evident by the remobilization of mo vi from the hybrids upon their release into a river water all the ions investigated in this study especially hpo4 2 inhibited the stabilization of the nanohybrid except so4 2 3 in general aged mo nzvi hybrid was able to inhibit the growth of cyanobacteria but ageing in hpo4 2 and co3 2 reduced the toxicity of the nanohybrid acknowledgement this work was supported by national natural science foundation of china no 51625804

19533,nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi has been proposed to remediate heavy metal ions in the subsurface however the fate of metal nzvi hybrid has not been fully investigated in this study we investigated 1 the long term removal performance of nzvi for molybdate mo vi 2 the relationship between the ageing of mo nzvi hybrid in specific solution chemistries and the remobilization of mo vi from the hybrid and 3 the effects of mo nzvi hybrid on cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa results showed that although common ions have limited influence on the removal ratio of mo vi by nzvi they do impact the structure evolution and transformation of the mo nzvi nanohybrid formed thereafter ageing time was crucial for the chemical stabilization of mo nzvi hybrid but common groundwater ions retarded the stabilizing process which may lead to a significant remobilization of mo vi from the hybrid after exposure to water bodies while low levels of mo vi ions could stimulate the growth of m aeruginosa aged mo nzvi hybrid inhibited the growth of m aeruginosa except when ageing occurred in the presence of hpo4 2 co3 2 which also retarded hybrid stabilization this study shows that nzvi can immobilize mo vi ions in groundwater and the derived metal nzvi hybrid can effectively suppress the potential growth of m aeruginosa in river water graphical abstract image 1 keywords molybdate pollution nzvi common ions remobilization of mo vi cyanobacteria 1 introduction heavy metal pollution in natural water bodies imposes a serious health risk to human beings and the environment bhuiyan et al 2010 demirel 2007 duruibe et al 2007 in recent years china has particularly been facing an increasing threat from this problem hu et al 2014 particularly in areas close to mining sites gong et al 2014 heavy metals are persistent pollutants which can be biomagnified in living organisms khan et al 2008 while the removal of heavy metals such as chromium fruchter 2002 cadmium su et al 2016 2015a 2014a lead su et al 2015b zhang et al 2013 and arsenate arsenic mohan and pittman 2007 from different water matrices have received a considerable amount of attention remediation of molybdate mo vi pollution has not been widely investigated even though there has been a consistent increase in molybdenum mo utilization in lighting advanced material forming and electronics industry in recent years braithwaite and haber 2013 saji and lee 2012 saji and lopatin 2014 release of mo vi into the environment including water bodies at different stages of a product s life cycle is likely to occur which may impact water quality mo vi is part of the nitrogen fixation process howarth and cole 1985 and can stimulate the growth of cyanobacteria which can lead to blue green algae blooms cole et al 1993 hence it is essential to develop an effective but accessible technique for remediation of mo vi pollution in natural waters nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi has been employed to remediate organic pollution such as chlorinated compounds in groundwater adeleye et al 2016a liu et al 2007 zheng et al 2008 but its application towards remediating heavy metal pollution in groundwater has not been fully explored although a considerable number of papers on metal removal mechanism by nzvi has been published since 2007 li et al 2014 li and zhang 2007 su et al 2014a 2014b zhang et al 2014 based on previous published works metal ions or metal containing anions are sequestered by nzvi through adsorption precipitation co precipitation and reduction oxidation li and zhang 2007 tosco et al 2014 over a short period of time e g a few hours the removal performance of nzvi for metals is not sensitive to ionic strength or the presence of common anions boparai et al 2013 thus it is surprising that the majority of current studies have focused on the short term removal performance of nzvi li and zhang 2007 tanboonchuy et al 2012 zhu et al 2009 in the long term the decline of fe 0 content liu and lowry 2006 changes to the core shell structure liu et al 2015 and the different iron oxides derived from fe 0 oxidation lowry and liu 2006 can impact the metal removal performance of nzvi as well as the removal mechanism although several studies investigated the transformation of nzvi in groundwater liu et al 2017 reinsch et al 2010 to the best of our knowledge there are no studies integrating long term metal removal performance with the transformation and aging of nzvi under specific conditions particularly in the presence of common groundwater ions further unlike with applications of nzvi in industrial wastewater treatment li et al 2016 the metal nzvi hybrid formed during the remediation groundwater pollution is nearly impossible to contain and or remove from the matrix as a result the nanohybrid can be released into nearby surface waters lefevre et al 2015 thus the fate of metal nzvi hybrid in aqueous media must be fully investigated as an important part of any groundwater nzvi based remediation project before the nanohybrid reaches a waterbody it undergoes ageing for different lengths of time different ageing times under different conditions will result in different nanohybrid compositions johnson et al 2013 lefevre et al 2015 for instance the nanohybrid may contain different fe 0 amounts various types of iron oxides and different species of metals furthermore the different compositions of nanohybrid can cause different toxic effects on ecologically important organisms such as freshwater algae keller et al 2012 and cyanobacteria marsalek et al 2012 microcystis aeruginosa is a common cyanobacteria in freshwater which can produce harmful microcystin funari and testai 2008 a previous study showed that pristine nzvi can destroy cyanobacterial cells marsalek et al 2012 but it remains unknown whether nzvi still possesses its inhibitory effects on cyanobacteria after particle ageing and or adsorption of metal ions further organism derived organic matters can affect the stability and transformation of iron based nanoparticles adeleye et al 2016a which may affect the chemical stability of the metal nzvi hybrid in ways we currently do not know a comprehensive study of the fate of metal nzvi hybrid in water is therefore required in order to fully evaluate the effectiveness and implications of nzvi in remediation of metal polluted groundwater in this study we investigated the long term 30 days removal performance of nzvi for mo vi under different environmentally relevant conditions while monitoring the transformation of nzvi during a 30 day experiment to simulate the release of metal nzvi nanohybrid into a river mo nzvi nanohybrid was aged for different times and then transferred into a modified river water 90 raw river water and 10 bg 11 medium containing cyanobacteria for another 30 days chlorophyll a chl a was monitored for the 30 days in order to understand the effects of metal nzvi nanohybrid on the growth of cyanobateria 2

ddiw was used for solution preparation in batch experiments the nzvi synthesis method was based on previously published methods su et al 2014a 2014b zhang et al 2013 according to the following reaction 4fe3 3bh4 9h2o 4fe0 3h2bo3 12h 6h2 freshly prepared nzvi was stored in 100 ethanol detailed synthesis conditions and characterization of nzvi can be found in our previous studies su et al 2014a 2014b zhang et al 2013 2 2 long term removal experiments of mo vi in ddiw the influence of different cations na mg2 ca2 and anions cl so4 2 hpo4 2 and co3 2 on mo vi removal by nzvi was investigated in ddiw experiments were carried out in 100 ml serum bottles under different conditions on a shaking table 250 rpm 25 1 c shanghai fengling laboratory instrument fly 111b china each bottle was filled with 500 mg l nzvi and 20 mg l mo vi except for one set of bottles used for pure nzvi ageing 20 mg l mo vi was selected so we could clearly see the influence of ions and nzvi transformation on removal efficiency as 500 mg l nzvi only removed 90 of 20 mg l mo vi in a previous study qian et al 2018 moreover after 10 fold dilution preliminary studies showed that 2 mg l mo vi enhanced the growth of cyanobacteria while 50 mg l nzvi exerted no toxicity to algae adeleye et al 2016b l m stevenson et al 2017 this concentration of mo vi thus allowed us to clearly see the effect of the mo nzvi hybrids on cyanobacteria growth at each sampling point days 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 three bottles per condition were sacrificed for aqueous mo vi and fe ii analysis after filtration with 0 22 μm filters metal analysis was carried out via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes agilent 720es santa clara ca after the aliquots for aqueous metal analysis were

these raw river water indexes are shown in table 1 2 4 test organism culture and media cyanobacteria m aeruginosa was bought from the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology wuhan china batch cultures of m aeruginosa were first grown in basal glucose bg 11 media new cultures were inoculated to obtain an initial chl a concentration of 1 25 mg l and placed in an illumination incubator 12 12 light dark t 30 c gzx 300bs iii cimo medical instrument shanghai china su et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 preliminary studies showed that raw river water did not have enough nutrients to support the growth of m aeruginosa to obtain a suitable culture medium for m aeruginosa we amended the river water with bg 11 river water to bg 11 ratios 3 1 5 1 7 1 9 1 and found that m aeruginosa grew well in all those media we chose the culture media with 90 of river water to cultivate the blue green algae for studying the influence of mo nzvi on the growth of cyanobacteria as it had a high content of raw water this modification with 10 bg 11 led to a substantial increase in nitrate 24 6 mg l and phosphate 0 71 mg l concentrations compared to raw river water shown in table 1 2 5 fate and effects of mo nzvi hybrid on cyanobacteria cultures considering that mo vi might stimulate cyanobacteria bloom in surface water the interactions between mo nzvi nanohybrid and cyanobacteria were investigated after ageing the nanoparticles with or without mo vi for different time periods 2 h and 5 15 and 30 days the nanoparticles nanohybrid obtained were exposed to cyanobacteria the 10 ml mixture collected from the aged nanoparticle nanohybrid explained in section 2 2 was added into 80 ml of culture media and 10 ml inoculant preliminary test showed that under this condition the initial chl a concentration was 1 25 mg l as such the theoretical concentration of nzvi and mo in the cultures was 50 and 2 mg l respectively but the theoretical value of the fraction of remobilized mo at time 0 in cyanobacteria culture still equaled to that in 10 ml aged nanoparticle nanohybrid mixture the cells were cultivated for another 30 days a control condition was also setup which contained a similar algal density but no nanohybrids were added on days 1 3 5 7 11 15 22 and 30 doc and total nitrogen tn were determined using a shimadzu toc v toc analyzer mo vi was measured by icp oes and and fe ii was measured by phenanthroline based spectrophotometric method chl a concentration was used as a proxy for cell density and was monitored using a gemini xps fluorescence microplate reader fluorescence was converted to concentration of chl a μg l similar to our previous studies adeyemi s adeleye et al 2016b louise m stevenson et al 2017 additionally to analyze the molecular weight of the organic materials present in the cultures gel permeation chromatography lc 10ad shimadzu japan was employed 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term mo removal performance of nzvi the long term removal performance of nzvi for mo vi in the presence of different common groundwater ions was determined in control samples that is ddiw without ions 80 of the initial mo vi was immobilized within 5 days and after 30 days over 90 was sequestered removal of metallic pollutants was reported to reach equilibrium after 20 min in short term studies su et al 2015a zhang et al 2013 and the structure and composition of nzvi may not have changed significantly within such a short period of time over time not only does nzvi undergo structural and compositional changes liu et al 2015 2007 but the form species of immobilized metals on nzvi changes as well such as oxidized reduced and intra diffusing ling and zhang 2015 2014 since the adsorption capacity of iron oxide for mo vi at ph 9 was limited gustafsson 2003 the improvement during the long term experiments in the control system indicates that continuous reduction qian et al 2017 and probably intra diffusion of mo vi contribute to mo vi immobilization similar to the control system fast removal was recorded within initial 5 days in systems with 10 mm na mg2 or ca2 cation dosage yet slightly higher concentration of mo vi was detected after 30 days this is in good agreement with previous studies which suggest mo vi forms inner sphere binding after adsorption on nzvi for common anions while so4 2 and hpo4 2 had no obvious impact on mo vi removal co3 2 had a clearly negative influence coincidently while the initial ph of the system with so4 2 or hpo4 2 was close to the control 8 75 the one with co3 2 was much higher 10 75 figure s1 it appears that regardless of whether the co existing anions are adsorbed through inner sphere hpo4 2 or outer sphere so4 2 binding xu et al 2006a 10 mm anions won t impose significant impact on mo vi adsorption as long as the initial media ph is below 9 in addition although during the 30 day experiment the ph in control system gradually increased to 10 5 which was close to that in system with co3 2 the immobilized mo vi was not released back this is consistent with our previous study which showed that low ph contributes to fast and efficient removal of mo vi while high ph favors for mo vi reduction qian et al 2017 3 2 effect of ions on accumulation of fe ii fe ii is able to stimulate the generation of free radicals such as superoxide o2 hydroxyl radical oh and ferryl ion feo2 all of which are potentially toxic to organisms halliwell and gutteridget 1984 imlay et al 1988 wu et al 2014 we continuously monitored fe ii concentrations in the supernatant of each reaction system throughout the 30 day experiments similar to the control system increase of fe ii concentration in systems with cations addition was recorded after 10 days while 10 mm na or mg2 did not have any obvious effect on fe ii concentration figure s2 a 10 mm ca2 doubled fe ii concentration after 30 days although the highest fe ii concentration in control or systems with added cations reached to 12 mg l the presence of so4 2 hpo4 2 or co3 2 effectively brought down fe ii concentration to below 3 mg l figure s2 b which could be attributed to the iron precipitation on particle surface indicated by xps analysis in section 3 4 further in a natural environment fe ii produced from injected nzvi can be oxidized to iron oxide by dissolved oxygen resulting from regular groundwater fluctuation appelo and postma 2006 liu et al 2015 3 3 effect of different ions on the transformation of nzvi during the reaction with mo vi in ddiw xrd was employed to analyze crystals in the solids from different reaction systems over time the peaks at 2θ 44 8 and 62 5 were assigned to fe0 zhang et al 2013 and characteristic peaks of moo3 2θ 12 5 and fe2o3 2θ 35 5 were observed in the samples fig 2a through semi quantitative reference intensity ratio rir analysis we further estimated the fe 0 content in the samples obtained over the course of the experiment figure s3 except for the reaction system with so4 2 fe 0 content of all the systems declined rapidly during the first 5 days from 80 the initial fraction of fe 0 in nzvi to about 45 the decrease of fe 0 fraction was more gradual from day 5 30 when compared with the other ions tested sharp differences were observed in the fe 0 consumption trend in the presence of so4 2 and ca2 so4 2 initially inhibited fe 0 consumption mainly during the first 14 days after which the rate of fe 0 consumption was not much different from the other ions previously discussed the greatest fe 0 consumption was observed in the presence of ca2 almost all fe 0 was exhausted by the end of the experiments fig 2a since the ph of both so4 2 and ca2 reaction systems were around 9 0 the differences in fe 0 consumption behavior may be due to different effects arising from the different types of iron oxide produced from fe 0 oxidation based on previous studies so4 2 can stimulate the formation of green rust gr ahmed et al 2010 which may cover the surface of nzvi thereby decreasing fe 0 consumption however cl and co3 2 may also facilitate the generation of gr drissi et al 1995 refait et al 1998 but we did not observe a similar inhibition of fe 0 consumption in the presence of these anions the reason behind this phenomenon is still not clear and would require further studies unfortunately neither type of gr was identified in xrd analysis due to their strong reactivity with oxygen the strong signal of fe3 po4 2 peaks masked all the others peaks of samples obtained from the hpo4 2 system fig 2c making it impossible to calculate the fe 0 content throughout the study in general we found that ca2 accelerated the consumption of fe 0 while so4 2 depressed its consumption while other ions had a limited impact 3 4 surface reactions between mo and fe during the long term removal experiments we employed xps to analyze surface reactions during the 30 day experiments and found that different anions had different impacts on the composition of the mo nzvi hybrids formed figures s4 and s5 the fe 2p3 2 region was deconvoluted into three peaks which were assigned to feo 710 3 ev fe2o3 711 8 ev and ferrous iron salt figure s4 yamashita and hayes 2008 since xps only provides information on the outermost surface average depth of 3 5 nm nurmi et al 2005 failure to detect fe 0 via xps implies that the iron oxide layer is much thicker than 3 5 nm as shown in table 2 the iron oxide fractions in nanoparticles collected from the reaction systems with co3 2 and hpo4 2 were relatively stable in the presence of so4 2 however the abundance of the iron oxides decreased between days 15 and 30 fe2o3 decreased from 35 3 to 19 7 while feo increased from 10 to 31 7 at the end of the experiments nanoparticles from the system with hpo4 2 had the highest content of fe2o3 65 2 which was much higher than those obtained from the system with co3 2 32 3 or so4 2 19 7 regarding the ferrous iron salts feco3 and feso4 accounted for up to 50 of the total fe in their respective systems while fe3 po4 2 content decreased from 28 5 on day 15 17 4 on day 30 speciation of mo as revealed by mo 3d region analysis of samples shown in figure s5 and summarized in table 3 provides detailed information on the immobilization pathway of mo by nzvi for the reaction system with co3 2 a considerable amount of moo4 2 was reduced to moox 2 x 3 but the content of moox remained relatively stable from day 15 30 in the presence of so4 2 however while mo existed as pure moo3 after 15 days 47 5 of the moo3 was reduced to moox by day 30 the different mo vi reduction behavior between the systems with co3 2 and so4 2 may be due to 1 promotion of mo vi reduction by high ph qian et al 2017 2 formation of different types of gr hydroxycarbonate gr hydroxysulphate gr randall et al 2000 simon et al 2003 williams and scherer 2001 and 3 differences in the trend of fe 0 consumption increased abundance of moox in the system with so4 2 at the late phase may also result from the preserved fe 0 content as well interestingly while the majority of mo vi on nzvi surface existed as moo3 in the presence of so4 2 or co3 2 mo existed mainly as nh4 2moo4 the mo vi source used in experiment 59 7 after 15 days and 55 after 30 days in the presence of hpo4 it suggests that hpo4 might occupy the inner sphere adsorption sites which were previously occupied by mo vi xu et al 2006a 2006b leading to the formation of outer sphere complexes of mo vi in addition moo2 was found on the surface of nanoparticles collected from the reaction system with hpo4 the good electrical conductivity of iron phosphates herle et al 2004 may explain this further reduction of mo vi to form moo2 rather than moox detected in the presence of co3 2 and so4 2 3 5 structural evolution of mo nzvi hybrids during ageing in solutions with different ions tem was employed to examine the structural evolution of the nanoparticles nanohybrids in the different reaction systems throughout the experiment the pristine nzvi formed a chain like configuration figure s6 similar to reports from other studies zhang et al 2013 after 10 days in the control system as shown in fig 3 the majority of particles still possessed the core shell structure although it seemed that smaller sized particles were oxidized the majority of the nanoparticles were oxidized after 20 days and the core shell structure was no longer observable after 30 days the spherical morphology of nzvi was no longer obvious as the particles were mostly oxidized fig 4 illustrates the structural evolution of nzvi in the reaction system with different cations namely na a b c mg2 d e f and ca2 g h i in comparison with the structure evolution of nzvi in the control system the presence of na did not have any obvious impact on the structure which agrees with the results obtained from xrd analysis fe 0 content trend in the presence of mg2 the structure evolution was not different from the control conditions during the initial 20 days however wrinkled sheet like particles were observed on day 30 which were not seen in the control samples the chain like structure of nzvi were not found in the presence of ca2 by day 10 due to rapid oxidation in agreement with xrd analysis fig 5 demonstrates the structural evolution of nzvi in the presence of different anions the anions so4 2 co3 2 and hpo4 2 exhibited stronger influence on the structural evolution of nzvi compared to the cations the most striking difference is the formation of hollow structures which were previously reported by others wang et al 2013 fig 5 a c and f however the hollow structures were preserved for up to 30 days only in the reaction system with hpo4 2 given that the formation of hollow nanostructure is mainly due to the reaction between h and fe 0 qian et al 2017 these anions may be able to accelerate h diffusion within grain boundaries of the iron oxide shells xia et al 2016 further different anions resulted in the formation of different species of iron compounds iron salts as can be seen from the different morphologies obtained on day 30 of the experiments additionally tem images of nzvi collected from system with hpo4 2 showed the presence of fe 0 dark core area fig 5 e during the initial 20 days although nzvi s peaks were masked by the strong fe3 po4 2 peaks in xrd analysis as explained earlier it is notable that all these changes in the structure of nzvi over a period of 30 days did not result in the remobilization of already adsorbed mo vi as confirmed via icp oes fig 1 in agreement with the icp oes data xps analysis showed the presence of mo vi on the surface of the solids obtained throughout the experiments 3 6 remobilization of mo from mo nzvi hybrid in cyanobacteria culture media mo nzvi hybrid might end up in surface waters such as rivers and lakes near the remediation zone as shown earlier all the ions tested except co3 2 did not inhibit the removal of mo vi by nzvi and the immobilized mo vi was not released back into solution from the nanohybrid over a period of 30 days however remobilization of adsorbed mo vi from the hybrids occurred upon the introduction of the mo nzvi hybrid into cyanobacteria culture media fig 6 shows that a fraction of mo vi was released back into culture media from nanohybrid aged in the presence of common ions is much higher than that aged in ddiw indicating the presence of the ions decreased the long term stability of the mo nzvi hybrid for instance 20 of the mo vi initially removed by nzvi aged for 2 h inddiw was released back into the culture media from day 0 29 fig 6 a but the amount released when nzvi was aged for the same period of time in the presence of most of the ions exceeded 40 fig 6 b c d e g it has been reported that mo vi forms inner sphere complexes on iron oxide surfaces xu et al 2013 which is relatively stable inner sphere complexes may prevent the remobilization of mo vi from the mo nzvi hybrid into the culture media but common ions na mg2 ca2 cl so4 2 hpo4 2 appeared to have slowed down the formation of inner sphere complexes in most systems longer ageing time of mo nzvi hybrid resulted in lower remobilization of mo vi fig 6 in the absence of ions the amount of mo vi remobilized declined sharply with ageing time for up to 15 days after which further ageing did not really improve the stability of the hybrid in cyanobacteria culture media fig 6 a a similar trend was observed in the presence of na and mg2 fraction of mo vi released decreased from 80 when the nanohybrid was aged for 2 h to about 30 when aged for 30 days notably the improvement of hybrid s stability was minimal between ageing for 5 days and 15 days xrd analysis shows that fe0 content from 5 to 15 days is stable in na and mg2 systems which means that mo vi reduction to mo iv moo2 which has a low solubility product constant tucker et al 1998 is suppressed during this phase it is very likely that lack mo vi reduction leads to the poor improvement of mo nzvi hybrid stability however the reason why the fraction of mo vi did not change much between day 5 15 requires further study for anions 33 of the total mo vi initially removed by nzvi aged for 30 days was detected in the supernatant on day 30 when cl was present compared to the control system in which 15 was remobilized cl reduced the chemical stability of the mo nzvi nanohybrids fig 6b so4 2 retarded the stabilizing of the hybrids when aged for 0 15 days but only 10 of adsorbed mo was released back into aqueous phase when the hybrid was aged for 30 days slightly lower than what was observed in the control system the persistence of fe 0 in the presence of so4 2 fig 2 may have resulted in the continuous reduction of mo vi over 30 days enhancing the hybrid s stability as for co3 2 the low removal efficiency in batch experiment leads to an initial decline of a large fraction of mo vi detected after release to culture media but later increased back to levels similar to the initial amount between days 5 and 10 fig 6 f considering that the fraction of mo vi in culture media on day 30 was similar to day 0 the immobilized mo in this system was relatively stable even though its total amount on nanohybrid was much less than those in the other systems notably in fig 6 the trend of remobilized mo vi concentration was different when the nanoparticles were aged in ca2 and hpo4 2 fig 6 d g in these two systems there was no strong correlation between nanoparticle ageing time and mo vi remobilization behavior and a considerable fraction of mo was released into media again xrd analysis showed that ca2 accelerated fe 0 consumption which may have interfered with the subsequent reduction of mo vi immobilized on nzvi additionally ca2 may bind with moo4 2 and precipitate on the particle surface kindness et al 1994 restricting further diffusion of mo vi into fe 0 binding sites as for hpo4 2 its occupation on inner sphere adsorption sites xu et al 2013 may have led to the formation of outer sphere complexes of mo vi leading to easier remobilization in cyanobacteria culture media this is consistent with the results of xps analysis which showed that 55 of mo still existed as nh4 2moo4 on the surface of the particles after ageing for 30 days finally longer ageing time led to lower mo vi remobilization in the system with nanoparticles aged in the mixed each ion 2 mm solution however the amount of mo vi initially released between 0 and 10 days from the nanohybrid aged for 30 days in the mixed solution was higher than the amount released when the nanohybrid was aged in the same solution for 15 days similar to the system with co3 2 or hpo4 2 over 70 of mo was released in media the results from releasing the nanohybrid into cyanobacteria culture media suggest that 1 longer ageing time alleviates the adverse effects of most ions including na mg2 cl and so4 2 on mo nzvi hybrid chemical stability and 2 hpo4 2 strongly promotes the release of mo vi from mo nzvi hybrid 3 7 effect of aged mo nzvi nanoparticle on cyanobacteria growth rapid growth of cyanobacteria causes severe water quality issue we evaluated the influence of mo vi on cyanobacteria growth as illustrated by figure s7 mo vi does favor the growth of cyanobacteria at concentrations below 10 mg l which suggests mo vi pollution has to be treated however in cyanobacteria culture media with mo nzvi hybrid even though we detected a considerable amount of released mo vi we still observed a clear inhibition of cyanobacteria growth upon their exposure to the mo nzvi hybrid fig 7 which means that aged nzvi is effective for cyanobacteria growth control in the control treatment m aeruginosa grew rapidly after acclimatizing to the new media fig 7a we observed two different patterns in the cultures amended with nanohybrid 1 cyanobacteria cultures treated with nanohybrid aged in na2hpo4 na2co3 or mixed solution declined in the first 10 15 days and thereafter recovered to different extents fig 7 f g h and 2 cultures exposed to nanohybrid aged in ddiw nacl mgcl2 cacl2 or na2so4 did not grow appreciably throughout the 30 day experiments fig 7 a b c d e hpo4 2 and co3 2 two key factors for mo vi remobilization from aged mo nzvi hybrid are also the crucial influencing factors on the efficacy of aged mo nzvi hybrid for cyanobacteria growth inhibition growth inhibition might be due to cell lysis since high levels of doc figure s8 and decline of chl a concentration was observed at the initial stage of cell cultivation cell lysis will cause the release of intracellular high molecular weight macromolecules such as proteins and dna into the growth media marmur 1961 to verify this hypothesis cell lysis we analyzed the molecular weight of the organic materials present in the cultures and compared it with the molecular weight of doc obtained from cyanobacteria culture subjected to ultrasonication for 20 min to achieve cell lysis as shown in table 4 the number average weight average and z average of cyanobacteria cultures exposed to nanoparticles are similar to those obtained from ultrasound treated cells weight average 108 da li et al 2012 but are several orders of magnitude greater than what was observed in control cultures weight average 104 da indicating the dominance of extracellular organic materials in nanoparticle exposed cells li et al 2012 this corroborates the chl a data indicating that aged nzvi is still effective for inhibiting cyanobacteria growth the toxicity of aged nanohybrid may be due partly to fe ii ions that were released into the culture media as high levels of fe ii concentration was recorded at the beginning of cultivation figure s9 fe ii ions can stimulate the generation of free radicals under oxic conditions which can cause cell damage and impair photosynthesis adeyemi s adeleye et al 2016b sevcu et al 2011 winterbourn 1995 however fe ii ions was probably not the only reason for the cell lysis for example while the cells in cultures containing nanohybrid aged in na2so4 never grew with an initial fe ii concentration of 0 2 mg l fig 7 e cells in cultures containing nanohybrid aged in nah2po4 recovered despite having an initial fe ii concentration that was greater than 0 2 mg l fig 7 g lipczynska kochany et al 1995 reported that hpo4 2 and hco3 efficiently quenched free radicals in solution while so4 2 and cl transformed into free radicals after reacting with hydroxyl radicals the radical quenching effects of hpo4 2 and hco3 may have provided some protection for the cells exposed to nanohybrid aged in solutions containing the two anions furthermore toxicity may have been caused by the different iron oxides formed upon fe 0 consumption iron oxide nanoparticles such as fe3o4 ɤ fe2o3 fe2o3 are known to produce surface bound free radicals that can cause adverse effects to microorganisms valentine and wang 1998 voinov et al 2011 additionally high levels of mo vi were observed in culture system seeded with nanohybrid derived from hpo4 2 or hco3 solution which might stimulate the growth of cyanobacteria we also found that the effects of the nanohybrid on cyanobacterial growth may vary not only with ageing media but also with ageing time for instance nanohybrid aged for 15 days in h2po4 and mix solution was toxic more so than those aged for a shorter or a longer time given that the fe ii concentrations in these cultures are lower than that in cultures dosed with nanoparticles aged for 2 h it is not likely that the fe ii ions caused the growth inhibition instead higher toxicity at this time period may be due to the transformation of nanoparticles leading to the formation of different particles composition and morphology of nanohybrid which may exhibit varying toxicity over time with respect to mo vi pollution remediation ageing in groundwater with limited presence of phosphate helps to stabilize the mo nzvi hybrid which reduces mo vi release once the hybrids are released into surface water although mo vi is able to stimulate the growth of cyanobacteria aged mo nzvi can effectively inhibit its growth under most conditions 4 conclusions in this study we carried out a comprehensive investigation on the application of nzvi for remediation of mo vi polluted groundwater and the effect of aged mo nzvi hybrid on the growth of cyanobacteria common cations na mg2 and ca2 and anions cl so4 2 and hpo4 2 have little influence on the long term removal of mo vi by nzvi but they influence the structure evolution and composition of mo nzvi hybrids formed thereafter while na mg2 cl and co3 2 have limited impact on the consumption trend of fe 0 in mo nzvi hybrid ca2 and so4 2 have strong effects promoting and inhibiting fe 0 consumption respectively ageing in the aqueous phase is crucial for the chemical stabilization of the nanohybrid and its fate in water bodies into which the nanohybrid may be transported additional conclusions from this study include 1 ageing time is crucial for the stabilization of mo nzvi hybrid in the absence of ions longer ageing times resulted in more chemically stable hybrids and less mo vi remobilization from the hybrids into a river water 2 ions did not have much effects on long term removal of mo by nzvi but they disturbed the stability of the mo nzvi hybrids formed thereafter as evident by the remobilization of mo vi from the hybrids upon their release into a river water all the ions investigated in this study especially hpo4 2 inhibited the stabilization of the nanohybrid except so4 2 3 in general aged mo nzvi hybrid was able to inhibit the growth of cyanobacteria but ageing in hpo4 2 and co3 2 reduced the toxicity of the nanohybrid acknowledgement this work was supported by national natural science foundation of china no 51625804

19534,an autocatalytic system permanganate ultrasonic pm us system was applied to degrade perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in aqueous solutions after a 120 min ultrasonication a pm dosage of 6 mm increased the pseudo first order rate constant k1 for pfoa decomposition from 3 5 10 3 to 13 0 10 3 min 1 and increased the pseudo zeroth order rate constant k2 for pfoa defluorination from 1 5 10 3 to 7 9 10 3 mm min 1 respectively the pfoa degradation rates increased proportionally with the enhanced production rates of mno2 particles an initial ph 4 condition was optimal for the pfoa degradation compared to highly acidic and neutral conditions pfoa degradation could be significantly facilitated by increasing power density of ultrasonication from 60 to 180 w l 1 while increasing solution temperature to 50 c only slightly promoted the pfoa decomposition and defluorination to 1 15 and 1 07 times of that at 30 c respectively the solution saturated with argon was more favorable for the pfoa degradation in the pm us system than that saturated with air and oxygen co dissolved cu ii fe ii and fe iii ions inhibited the pfoa degradation by forming metal pfoa complexes based on the experimental results

its chemical stability and capacity of lowering surface tension lindstrom et al 2011 zareitalabad et al 2013 around 260 tons of pfoa produced annually in the world resulted in its wide presence in surface waters groundwater and sediments in many countries with concentrations ranging from ng l 1 to mg l 1 level schultz et al 2004 zareitalabad et al 2013 the fact that people living in

to humans benbrahim tallaa et al 2014 and a toxicant for liver thyroid developmental and immune systems lau et al 2007 melzer et al 2010 hence removing pfoa from the environment is of increasing importance to abate health risks of humans and wildlife however due to the strong bond energy of the c c bond 410 kj mol 1 and c f bond 530 kj mol 1 vecitis et al 2008 using ozonation or fenton reaction alone could not efficiently degrade aqueous pfoa post et al 2012 trojanowicz et al 2018 considerable efforts have been expended to break the strong bonds in order to degrade pfoa to harmless species photocatalysis li et al 2012 electrochemical oxidation zhao et al 2013 and microwave induced decomposition lee et al 2009 are recently investigated as effective techniques to remove pfoa nevertheless perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas with shorter chains were produced as intermediates by those techniques ultrasonication us technique is a promising process for complete

effects the present study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of a permanganate ultrasonic pm us system for degradation of pfoa using a low frequency ultrasonic system by altering permanganate dosages and ultrasonic power additionally effects of solution conditions i e initial ph temperature and atmosphere on system performance were evaluated systematically moreover the degradation pathways of pfoa in the pm us system were discussed the results in this study implied that the pm us system is a cost effective technology which can be applied in treating wastewater polluted with pfoa or other persistent organics pollutants 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa c7f15cooh 96 was purchased from sigma aldrich humic acids perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa c6f13cooh 98

used to prepare stock and reaction solutions throughout this study 2 2 experimental procedures ultrasonic irradiation of pfoa solution was performed in a cylindrical jacketed glass reactor inside diameter 8 cm height 17 8 cm mounted on a magnetic stirring apparatus fargo ms 90 the ultrasonic irradiation was provided by an ultrasonic apparatus branson lpt 150 w 40 khz which consists of an ultrasonic drive device and a handpiece the handpiece contained an ultrasonic oscillator and a probe length 9 cm diameter 3 5 cm aluminum alloy for a typical run the reactor was filled with a 500 ml aqueous solution containing 132 μm pfoa then the pm powder was dissolved in the pfoa solution to obtain a predetermined concertation of pm finally the ultrasonic probe providing a power density of 180 w l 1 was inserted into the solution at a depth of 5 8 cm and the solution was irradiated continuously for 120 min the solution temperature was kept at 30 1 c by cooling water flowing through the jacket during the 120 min reaction a suspension of 2 ml was collected from the reactor at a 10 min interval centrifugation of the suspension at 8000 rpm followed by filtration with a 0 22 μm membrane was applied to remove mno2 particles to study the capacity of mno2 production by ultrasonic reduction of pm experiments were conducted under the same conditions in the presence or absence of pfoa the concentration of pm was adjusted to range from 1 to 20 mm to study the effects of pm dosage and mno2 production on the degradation of pfoa tba of 0 1 mm was added to quench ho radicals produced under ultrasonication nagata et al 1996 to study the contribution of the ho radicals in the pm us system power output ratio of us was set from 20 to 60 to obtain ultrasonic power densities from 60 to 180 w l 1 the initial ph value of the solution was adjusted from 2 0 to 7 0 with 1 8 m h2so4 and 0 05 m naoh solutions the temperature of the solution was elevated stepwise to 50 1 c by increasing the temperature of the cooling water argon or oxygen gas 99 99 was bubbled into the solutions from the reactor bottom during ultrasonication at a flow rate of 500 ml min 1 to study the effects of the atmosphere humic acids with a concentration of 20 mg l 1 was added to evaluate the effects of background organics on the pfoa degradation rates fe2 cu2 or fe3 was added when needed to obtain a concentration of 0 2 mm before ultrasonication the solubility of pfoa in the presence of co dissolved transition metal cations was measured without the ultrasonication all the experiments were conducted in duplicate 2 3 analytical procedures concentrations of pfoa and pfcas with shorter chains were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc dionex ultimate 3000 u s a equipped with an agilent column eclipse xdb c18 u s a a conductivity detector and an anion self regenerating suppressor asrs 300 2 mm u s a concentrations of pfpra tfa and fluoride ion were measured with an

limit of detection for the measurements with the hplc and ic are presented in the supplemental information si decomposition and defluorination efficiency of pfoa were defined as follows eqs 5 and 6 5

concentrations of pfoa μm f is the concentration of f ions μm the concentrations of pm and mno2 in aqueous solutions were measured with a uv vis spectrophotometer genesys 10s thermo the difference of absorbance at 400 nm between the suspension and the filtrate i400 indicated the production of mno2 particles while the absorbance of filtrate at 525 nm was used to quantify the concentration of pm abulizi et al 2014 mno2 particles obtained from the centrifugation were washed with milli q water and vacuum dried for solid phase characterizations the details of the characterizations were presented in the si section variations of the solution ph during the reactions were recorded with a ph meter htc 201u taiwan 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfoa degradation in the pm us system the synergistic effects of dissolved permanganate and ultrasonic irradiation on pfoa degradation are shown in fig 1 pfoa was decomposed scarcely and no fluorine ion was detected after the oxidation by permanganate at a concentration of 10 mm the result was consistent with that of liu et al 2012 who investigated the oxidation of perfluorooctanesulfonate pfos by pm and reported that pm could hardly decompose pfos or ionize the organo fluorine after one day while with ultrasonication alone only 29 6 of pfoa was decomposed and 7 7 of fluorine was mineralized the smaller defluorination efficiency compared to the decomposition efficiency indicated the decomposed pfoa was not fully mineralized that phenomenon was also observed in some us systems which might be because the ros generated was not sufficient for the oxidative defluorination of pfoa having a high concentration vecitis et al 2008 lee et al 2016 lin et al 2016 in the pm us system 84 3 decomposition and 63 1 defluorination efficiencies were achieved the decomposition efficiency increased by a factor of 2 8 in the pm us system compared to that in the us system while the defluorination efficiency in the pm us system increased 7 2 times therefore the synergistic effect between pm and us for defluorination was more pronounced than that for decomposition on the other hand the ratio of defluorination to decomposition efficiency was increased from 0 26 to 0 75 by adding 10 mm pm into the us system which indicated the pm addition increased the mineralization efficiency of organo fluorine in the us system pfoa decomposition and defluorination could be well simulated by the pseudo first order and pseudo zeroth order kinetics eqs 7 and 8 respectively 7 r 1 d p f o a d t k 1 p f o a 8 r 2 d f d t k 2 where r1 and r2 are the rates of pfoa decomposition and defluorination respectively k1 min 1 and k2 mm min 1 are the rate constants of pfoa decomposition and defluorination respectively pfoa in μm and f in mm are concentrations of pfoa and fluoride ions at time t as the organo fluorine was sufficient during the reactions the defluorination rate was not concentration dependent and the kinetics followed the pseudo zeroth order model the phenomenon was also observed in other us systems and advanced oxidation process for pfoa degradation when the defluorination efficiency was less than 80 zhao et al 2013 lin et al 2015 with the pm doses increased from 0 to 20 mm k1 increased from 3 5 10 3 to 15 1 10 3 min 1 and k2 increased from 1 5 10 3 to 12 0 10 3 mm min 1 fig 2 in order to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the pm us system for pfoa degradation energy consumption relative to pfoa decomposition and defluorination were calculated and compared with other advanced oxidation processes aops table s1 the electrical energy consumed to reduce the concentration of pfoa by one order of magnitude in one m3 of the treated solution eeo lyu et al 2015 was 457 5 kwh m 3 order 1 for the pm us system in comparison of the k1 and eeo values pfoa decomposition in the pm us system is more cost effective than that in most microwave induced lee et al 2010 photocatalytic li et al 2012 phan thi et al 2013 chen et al 2016 and ultrasonic systems panchangam et al 2009 lin et al 2015 2016 but less than that in some electrochemical systems zhuo et al 2011 on the other hand the electrical energy required to ionize 1 g fluorine of pfoa eif was 13 2 kwh g 1 in the pm us system which is less than that using other techniques table s1 therefore the pm us system is more energy efficient than the previously investigated aops with a more effective pfoa degradation and a better energy efficiency the pm us system would be a good alternative to the commercially available aops such as uv h2o2 for practical applications to degrade pfoa in addition no catalyst or electrode is needed which makes the pm us system more facile 3 2 effects of mno2 production in the pm us system brownish precipitates were generated during the pfoa degradation and well suspended in the aqueous solution during the reaction as shown in fig s3a precipitates formed are sheet like nanoparticles the lattice spacing of about 0 49 0 31 and 0 25 nm for 200 310 and 211 planes respectively of mno2 across the nanoparticles could be readily resolved fig s3b according to the energy dispersive spectrum eds of the precipitates the atomic ratio of mn to o was around 1 2 table s2 the results indicated that mno2 was obtained as the main solid products in the pm us system mn iii might also be generated as an intermediate species and exist in the solid products by ultrasonic reduction of pm dhas et al 1997 the intermediate mn iii was highly reactive for organics oxidation jiang et al 2012 sun et al 2015 2018 hu et al 2017 while in the presence of carboxylic groups the solid mn would mainly be maintained in the higher oxidation state as mn iv under ultrasonication zhu et al 2005 which was also observed in this study the mno2 particles produced during the pfoa degradation have a diameter ranging from 0 09 to 6 15 μm fig s4 which could act as cavitation nuclei in the us systems for the formation of cavitation bubbles and pyrolytic conditions shchukin et al 2011 zhao et al 2014 while in the absence of pfoa the mean diameter of mno2 significantly increased from 3 81 to 24 29 μm fig s4 the effects of pfoa addition on the particle size of produced mno2 witnessed the possible complexation between the surface mn iv or mn iii of mno2 particles and the carboxyl groups cooh of pfoa wang and stone 2006 xu et al 2017 the surface pfoa with the long perfluoroalkyl chains could provide steric repulsion force to hinder the mno2 particles from aggregation as a result the adsorbates on the mno2 surface could be oxidized by permanganate much more quickly than their counterparts in the solution jiang et al 2009 perez benito 2009 overall the auto generated mno2 could catalyze the pfoa degradation via enhancing pyrolytic decomposition and oxidation by pm in the vicinity of the mno2 surface 9 mno 2 2 h mn 2 2 oh 10 mno 2 h 2 o 2 mn 2 2 oh o 2 the consumption of pm and the production of mno2 in the pm us system were quantified to study the effects of pm mno2 couple on the pfoa degradation mno2 could also be reduced to mn2 ions under ultrasonication eqs 9 and 10 abulizi et al 2014 however as the pm doses were sufficient mno2 particles could accumulate in the us system in the absence of pfoa a pm dosage of 10 mm resulted in the i400 gradually increasing from 0 to 1 01 after a 120 min ultrasonication fig 3 a adding pfoa did not significantly influence the accumulation of mno2 particles fig 3a however the consumption of pm after the ultrasonication increased from 0 31 to 0 52 mm with the pfoa addition in the 10 mm pm us system the results indicated that additional pm and mno2 particles were consumed for the pfoa degradation under ultrasonication the electron transfer in the pm us system from pfoa to pm mn iii or other intermediate mn will be confirmed in a future study the capacity of mno2 accumulation by the ultrasonication of pm gradually increased with the pm dosages fig 3b the results of mno2 accumulation were fitted with the pseudo zeroth order kinetic model eq 11 11 r m n o 2 d i 400 d t k m n o 2 where r m n o 2 and k m n o 2 min 1 are the rate and rate constant of the mno2 accumulation respectively the increase in k m n o 2 diminished with the pm dosages increasing from 6 to 20 mm fig 2 the trend was also observed for k1 and k2 as a result k 1 and k 2 increased more proportionally with the increased k m n o 2 fig 3c than with the increased pm dosages fig 2 the results indicated that with sufficient pm dosages the pfoa degradation might be dependent on the mno2 accumulation the improvements in the decomposition and defluorination with the increasing pm dosages would be restricted to the maximum accumulation of mno2 particles in the us system therefore in terms of cost effectiveness a pm dosage in the range of 6 10 mm is optimal for pfoa degradation in the us system as the ho radical was one prerequisite of mno2 production eqs 1 4 and could be an oxidant in the pm us system the contribution of the ho radicals was identified by adding tba before the reaction the addition of tba enhanced the production of mno2 with k m n o 2 increased from 8 5 10 3 to 15 0 10 3 min 1 fig s5 the enhanced mno2 production was due to that tba could be oxidized by ho and h radicals to alkyl radicals r which were also agents for pm reduction okitsu et al 2016 as a result the rates of pfoa decomposition and defluorination increased accordingly with the mno2 production enhanced in the presence of tba fig s5b the results implied that the ho radicals might not take the main responsibility to degrade pfoa in the pm us system the dissolved background organics would also influence the mno2 production and pfoa degradation in the pm us system humic acids were added at a concentration of 20 mg l 1 to evaluate the effects of natural organic matters on the performance of the pm us system fig s5 shows that the mno2 production was significantly enhanced by the dissolved humic acids with k m n o 2 increased from 8 5 10 3 to 32 6 10 3 min 1 due to the oxidation of humic acids by pm however rates of pfoa decomposition and defluorination only increased by 37 and 18 fig s5b respectively which were not proportional to the extent of enhancement in mno2 production the phenomenon was also observed for the oxidation of organics by pm in the presence of excessive humic acids xu et al 2017 that might be due to that the humic acids with carboxylic groups would compete for the complexation sites on the mno2 surface and hinder the catalytic oxidation of pfoa overall the dissolved humic acids slightly improved pfoa degradation in the pm us system 3 3 effects of initial ph it has been reported that ph condition affected the pfoa degradation panchangam et al 2009 and the performance of oxidation by pm han et al 2013 the h ions would influence the redox pathway and redox potential p ε 0 of pm table s3 yan and schwartz 1999 with the initial ph decreased from 7 to 2 the performance of oxidation by pm was expected to increase however the results of pfoa degradation in the pm us system deviated from the expectation pfoa was actually decomposed more effectively under weak acidic conditions ph 3 5 than under a strong acidic ph 2 and a neutral condition ph 7 fig 4 a in the meantime the efficiency of pfoa defluorination increased from 14 4 to 62 4 with the initial ph decreased from 7 to 4 fig 4b further decreasing the initial ph to 2 the defluorination efficiency decreased from 62 4 to 14 7 the solution ph varied gradually with time fig s6 which was resulted from the pm reduction and pfoa degradation with different degradation efficiencies overall both k 1 and k 2 in the ph range from 2 to 7 peaked at initial ph 4 fig 4c the phenomenon was due to the molecular form and vapor pressure of pfoa that changed with phs the pka value of a monomeric pfoa was estimated to be less than 1 0 cheng et al 2009a however the experimental results showed that the pka of pfoa at the mm level was around 3 8 eq s 1 burns et al 2008 which might be due to the aggregation of pfoa in aqueous solvents cheng et al 2009a therefore in this study pfoa would probably transform from anionic species c7f15coo to neutral species c7f15cooh when the ph condition changed from weak acidic ph 3 8 to strong acidic ph 3 8 conditions and more than 98 of the total pfoa existed in the neutral form at ph 2 pfoa as a surfactant initially accumulated at the gas liquid interface of the cavitation bubbles vecitis et al 2008 the acidified aqueous conditions would increase the vapor pressure of pfoa kutsuna and hori 2008 and partition pfoa into the gas phase armitage et al 2009 ultrasonic degradation is more effective for contaminants with higher hydrophobicity and herry s law constant that readily partitioning into the bubbles nanzai et al 2008 as the temperature in the cavitation bubbles 4000 k is higher than that at the gas liquid interfaces 600 1000 k when the bubbles collapse vecitis et al 2008 however pfoa partitioning into the gas phase could not effectively be in contact with the pm dissolved in the bulk solution therefore the rates of pfoa decomposition and defluorination decreased significantly with initial ph decreased from 4 to 2 the results of pfoa degradation under highly acidic conditions indicated the oxidation at the gas liquid interfaces is an important mechanism for pfoa degradation in the pm us system 3 4 effects of the power density of ultrasonication ultrasonic power density is an important operation parameter for pfoa degradation in a pm us system decomposition and defluorination of pfoa in the pm us system were accelerated with power density increased from 60 to 180 w l 1 fig 5 k 1 and k 2 increased gradually from 2 5 10 3 to 13 0 10 3 min 1 and 1 7 10 3 to 7 9 10 3 mm min 1 respectively with the increased power density the facilitating effects of the increased power density were also observed for degradation of hydrophobic organic compounds in different us systems liang et al 2016a in general a higher power density would supply more energy for cavitation and thermal cleavage of water eq 1 destaillats et al 2001 however the maximum size of cavitation bubbles also increases with the power density which would increase the collapse time of cavitation bubbles and result in incomplete collapses during a single compression cycle kang et al 1999 therefore an optimum could occur with regards to the rates of ultrasonic degradation however the optimum was not observed in the power density range applied 60 180 w l 1 in this study that may be due to a power density of 200 w l 1 is optimal for us systems with a frequency around 40 khz liu et al 2009b 3 5 effects of solution temperature the output power of ultrasonication decreased as the temperature rose under a constant pressure raso et al 1999 while a higher temperature could activate the oxidations by permanganate liu et al 2009a thus the effects of temperature on pfoa degradation in the pm us system were investigated as shown in fig 6 k 1 and k 2 values follow the arrhenius law eq 12 12 l n k l n a e a a p p r t where k is k 1 or k 2 a is a pre exponential factor with a unit identical to k e a a p p kj mol 1 represents the apparent activation energy for pfoa decomposition e a 1 a p p or defluorination e a 2 a p p r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 and t k is the liquid temperature e a 1 a p p and e a 2 a p p were calculated to be 8 23 kj mol 1 and 2 66 kj mol 1 respectively the low positive values of e a a p p implied that the pfoa degradation in the pm us system was contributed to both pyrolytic cleavage and chemical oxidation for a cleavage dominated degradation such as the pfoa degradation in a us system lin et al 2015 the increasing solution temperature would decrease the degradation rate that was due to the fact that the increased solution temperature would increase the vapor pressure of water reduce the quantity of the dissolved gas and decrease the extremes of the temperature and pressure generated bhatnagar and cheung 1994 jiang et al 2006 accordingly a negative e a a p p usually occurred in ultrasonic degradation vijayalakshmi and madras 2004 on the other hand chemical oxidation by pm is highly temperature dependent the increasing temperature could promote the oxidation resulting in a positive e a a p p liu et al 2009a 2012 the overall effects of the solution temperature on ultrasonic conditions and chemical oxidation by pm are that the pfoa degradation slightly facilitated by the increasing solution temperature heat dissipation from the ultrasonic probe surface without a temperature control would increase the solution temperature however the temperature control is unpractical during on site remediation or treatment with ultrasonic techniques consequently the adverse effects of rising temperatures would be a problem for real site applications of the us systems decreasing the mineralization efficiency of organic pollutants while using the pm us system the pfoa degradation is relatively insensitive to the solution temperature which increases its feasibility for on site applications 3 6 effects of the solution atmosphere the rate constants of pfoa decomposition and defluorination under argon air and oxygen atmosphere conditions are presented in fig 7 in the 6 mm pm us system k 1 and k 2 under the argon atmosphere increased from 13 0 10 3 to 14 4 10 3 min 1 and 7 9 10 3 to 12 3 10 3 mm min 1 respectively while under the oxygen atmosphere k 1 and k 2 decreased to 72 3 and 71 7 of that under the air atmosphere respectively argon gas has a specific heat ratio γ of 1 67 at 20 c which is higher than that of air 1 40 and oxygen 1 40 a higher γ will result in a higher transient temperature when cavitation bubbles collapse which would promote the cleavage of water and formation of ros therefore the production of mno2 and the oxidation of pfoa by pm could be improved with the favorable cavitation conditions in addition the atmosphere also influences the production rate of ho and h2o2 in the water under ultrasonication in the low frequency us system the formation of h2o2 and sonochemical reduction by h2o2 occurring in the water were less under the oxygen atmosphere than those under the argon or air atmosphere petrier et al 1992 ge and qu 2003 on the contrary more ho radicals were produced and more sonochemical oxidations were affected when the solution was saturated with oxygen ge and qu 2003 overall as the γ values of air and oxygen gas are the same the adverse effects of oxygen atmosphere was mainly contributed to the inhibited sonochemical reduction of pm by h2o2 and the reduced production of mno2 particles on the other hand the pfoa degradation in the pm us system promoted under the argon atmosphere was due to the increased extreme temperature and the enhanced h2o2 formation 3 7 effects of co dissolved transition metal cations various cations present in groundwater and wastewater may influence the pfoa degradation in the pm us system no obvious effects of na ca2 mg2 ions were observed on the pfoa degradation under ultrasonication cheng et al 2009b while in the presence of transition metals such as cu2 fe2 and fe3 ions the pfoa removals via photochemical decomposition wang et al 2008 and foam flotation lee et al 2017 could be enhanced due to the complexation of the transition metal cations with the carboxylate group of pfoa eq 13 therefore the effects of co dissolved cu2 fe2 and fe3 ions on the pfoa degradation in the pm us system were investigated 13 ncf 3 cf 2 6 coo me m cf 3 cf 2 6 coo n me m n the rate constants shown in fig 8 indicate that the cu2 fe2 and fe3 ions would inhibit the pfoa decomposition and defluorination in the pm us system with both the k 1 and k 2 values following the decreasing order control cu2 fe2 fe3 according to the solubility test the concentration of dissolved pfoa decreased with the dosages of the transition metal cations fig s7 in the presence of 0 2 mm cu2 fe2 and fe3 the residual dissolved pfoa decreased to 94 1 94 3 and 33 6 respectively the results were reasonable since the complex stability constant of pfoa with fe3 is higher than that with fe2 or those with other divalent metallic cations lee et al 2017 the complexation of fe3 with pfoa could also be witnessed by the uv vis spectra of the ferric ion solutions in the absence and presence of pfoa liang et al 2016b thus the actual rate constant of pfoa decomposition with the transition metal cations might be lower than the apparent k 1 shown in fig 8 because some pfoa compounds were removed from the aqueous phase via the complexation while the k 2 values could reflect the actual decrements in pfoa degradation with the transition metal cations in the pm us system the complexation of pfoa with transition metal cations would inhibit the coordination of the carboxylic groups of pfoa onto the mno2 surface which might reduce the catalytic effects of mno2 particles it should be noted that fe2 and cu2 affected the pfoa solubility similarly but fe2 inhibited the pfoa degradation in the pm us system more that was because fe2 could be oxidized to fe3 under ultrasonication by ros and form more complexes with pfoa during the degradation 3 8 intermediates and pathways of pfoa degradation in the pm us system concentrations of pfcas in the solution were analyzed to investigate the intermediates of pfoa degradation in the pm us system only pfcas with shorter chains i e pfpra c3 and tfa c2 could be detected during the reactions fig 9 in addition the concentrations of pfpra and tfa increased with reaction time similar to the pfoa degradation in other us systems moriwaki et al 2005 according to the intermediates analysis and the experimental results presented in the previous sections the pathways of pfoa degradation in the pm us system were proposed in eqs 14 19 first the pfoa degradation was initiated via a one electron extraction on the carboxylic group forming an organic free radical eq 14 the organic free radical then underwent a pyrolytic cleavage of the c c bond between the perfluoroalkyl tail and the carboxylate group yielding a perfluoroalkyl free radical and a co2 molecule eq 15 the perfluoroalkyl free radical might be oxidized on the cf2 group to pfhpa c6 releasing fluorine ions eq 16 the steps in eqs 14 16 could repeat similarly to degrade pfhpa to other pfcas with fewer alkyl units c2 c5 pathway i panchangam et al 2009 the perfluoroalkyl free radicals with different chain lengths also could undergo direct cleavage of the c c bonds and produce cf3 and cf2 free radicals eq 17 pathway ii vecitis et al 2008 the cf3 and cf2 free radicals were ultimately oxidized to co2 and fluoride ions eqs 18 and 19 as pfpra and tfa accumulated during the reaction the pathway i could exist in the pm us system however intermediate pfcas with longer chains c4 c6 were not detected which might be due to these intermediate pfcas were quickly decomposed after generation with the maximum concentrations smaller than the detection limits in this study 14 3 cf 3 cf 2 6 coo mno 2 cf 3 cf 2 6 coo e 15 cf 3 cf 2 6 coo mno 2 cf 3 cf 2 6 co 2 16 cf 3 cf 2 6 2

effectiveness of an autocatalytic system the pm us system for pfoa degradation was systematically investigated the synergism between pm and us were significant for both pfoa decomposition and defluorination the rates of pfoa decomposition and defluorination increased proportionally with the production rate of mno2 particles in the pm us system an initial ph of 4 was optimal for the pfoa degradation the power density of ultrasonication solution atmosphere and transition metal cations were also influential on the performance of the pm us system while the increasing solution temperature had an insignificant impact overall this study developed a promising technology for pfoa degradation in the aqueous phase which can be applied in the wastewater treatment plants as a post treatment

19534,an autocatalytic system permanganate ultrasonic pm us system was applied to degrade perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in aqueous solutions after a 120 min ultrasonication a pm dosage of 6 mm increased the pseudo first order rate constant k1 for pfoa decomposition from 3 5 10 3 to 13 0 10 3 min 1 and increased the pseudo zeroth order rate constant k2 for pfoa defluorination from 1 5 10 3 to 7 9 10 3 mm min 1 respectively the pfoa degradation rates increased proportionally with the enhanced production rates of mno2 particles an initial ph 4 condition was optimal for the pfoa degradation compared to highly acidic and neutral conditions pfoa degradation could be significantly facilitated by increasing power density of ultrasonication from 60 to 180 w l 1 while increasing solution temperature to 50 c only slightly promoted the pfoa decomposition and defluorination to 1 15 and 1 07 times of that at 30 c respectively the solution saturated with argon was more favorable for the pfoa degradation in the pm us system than that saturated with air and oxygen co dissolved cu ii fe ii and fe iii ions inhibited the pfoa degradation by forming metal pfoa complexes based on the experimental results

its chemical stability and capacity of lowering surface tension lindstrom et al 2011 zareitalabad et al 2013 around 260 tons of pfoa produced annually in the world resulted in its wide presence in

to humans benbrahim tallaa et al 2014 and a toxicant for liver thyroid developmental and immune systems lau et al 2007 melzer et al 2010 hence removing pfoa from the environment is of increasing importance to abate health risks of humans and wildlife however due to the strong bond energy of the c c bond 410 kj mol 1 and c f bond 530 kj mol 1 vecitis et al 2008 using ozonation or fenton reaction alone could not efficiently degrade aqueous pfoa post et al 2012 trojanowicz et al 2018 considerable efforts have been expended to break the strong bonds in order to degrade pfoa to harmless

effects the present study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of a permanganate ultrasonic pm us system for degradation of pfoa using a low frequency ultrasonic system by altering permanganate dosages and ultrasonic power additionally effects of solution conditions i e initial ph temperature and atmosphere on system performance were evaluated systematically moreover the degradation pathways of pfoa in the pm us system were discussed the results in this study implied that the pm us system is a cost effective technology which can be applied in treating wastewater polluted with pfoa or

used to prepare stock and reaction solutions throughout this study 2 2 experimental procedures ultrasonic irradiation of pfoa solution was performed in a cylindrical jacketed glass reactor inside diameter 8 cm height 17 8 cm mounted on a magnetic stirring apparatus fargo ms 90 the ultrasonic irradiation was provided by an ultrasonic apparatus branson lpt 150 w 40 khz which consists of an ultrasonic drive device and a handpiece the handpiece contained an ultrasonic oscillator and a probe length 9 cm diameter 3 5 cm aluminum alloy for a typical run the reactor was filled with a 500 ml aqueous solution containing 132 μm pfoa then the pm powder was dissolved in the pfoa solution to obtain a predetermined concertation of pm finally the ultrasonic probe providing a power density of 180 w l 1 was inserted into the solution at a depth of 5 8 cm and the solution was irradiated continuously for 120 min the solution temperature was kept at 30 1 c by cooling water flowing through the jacket during the 120 min reaction a suspension of 2 ml was collected from the reactor at a 10 min interval centrifugation of the suspension at 8000 rpm followed by filtration with a 0 22 μm membrane was applied to remove mno2 particles to study the capacity of mno2 production by ultrasonic reduction of pm experiments were conducted under the same conditions in the presence or absence of pfoa the concentration of pm was adjusted to range from 1 to 20 mm to study the effects of pm dosage and mno2 production on the degradation of pfoa tba of 0 1 mm was added to quench ho radicals produced under ultrasonication nagata et al 1996 to study the contribution of the ho radicals in the pm us system power output ratio of us was set from 20 to 60 to obtain ultrasonic power densities from 60 to 180 w l 1 the initial ph value of the solution was adjusted from 2 0 to 7 0 with 1 8 m h2so4 and 0 05 m naoh solutions the temperature of the solution was elevated stepwise to 50 1 c by increasing the temperature of the cooling water argon or oxygen gas 99 99 was bubbled into the solutions from the reactor bottom during ultrasonication at a flow rate of 500 ml min 1 to study the effects of the atmosphere humic acids with a concentration of 20 mg l 1 was added to evaluate the effects of background organics on the pfoa degradation rates fe2 cu2 or fe3 was added when needed to obtain a concentration of 0 2 mm before ultrasonication the solubility of pfoa in the presence of co dissolved transition metal cations was measured without the ultrasonication all the experiments were conducted in duplicate 2 3 analytical procedures concentrations of pfoa and pfcas with shorter chains were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc dionex ultimate 3000 u s a equipped

concentrations of pfoa μm f is the concentration of f ions μm the concentrations of pm and mno2 in aqueous solutions were measured with a uv vis spectrophotometer genesys 10s thermo the difference of absorbance at 400 nm between the suspension and the filtrate i400 indicated the production of mno2 particles while the absorbance of filtrate at 525 nm was used to quantify the concentration of pm abulizi et al 2014 mno2 particles obtained from the centrifugation were washed with milli q water and vacuum dried for solid phase characterizations the details of the characterizations were presented in the si section variations of the solution ph during the reactions were recorded with a ph meter htc 201u taiwan 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfoa degradation in the pm us system the synergistic effects of dissolved permanganate and ultrasonic irradiation on pfoa degradation are shown in fig 1 pfoa was decomposed scarcely and no fluorine ion was detected after the oxidation by permanganate at a concentration of 10 mm the result was consistent with that of liu et al 2012 who investigated the oxidation of perfluorooctanesulfonate pfos by pm and reported that pm could hardly decompose pfos or ionize the organo fluorine after one day while with ultrasonication alone only 29 6 of pfoa was decomposed and 7 7 of fluorine was mineralized the smaller defluorination efficiency compared to the decomposition efficiency indicated the decomposed pfoa was not fully mineralized that phenomenon was also observed in some us systems which might be because the ros generated was not sufficient for the oxidative defluorination of pfoa having a high concentration vecitis et al 2008 lee et al 2016 lin et al 2016 in the pm us system 84 3 decomposition and 63 1 defluorination efficiencies were achieved the decomposition efficiency increased by a factor of 2 8 in the pm us system compared to that in the us system while the defluorination efficiency in the pm us system increased 7 2 times therefore the synergistic effect between pm and us for defluorination was more pronounced than that for decomposition on the other hand the ratio of defluorination to decomposition efficiency was increased from 0 26 to 0 75 by adding 10 mm pm into the us system which indicated the pm addition increased the mineralization efficiency of organo fluorine in the us system pfoa decomposition and defluorination could be well simulated by the pseudo first order and pseudo zeroth order kinetics eqs 7 and 8 respectively 7 r 1 d p f o a d t k 1 p f o a 8 r 2 d f d t k 2 where r1 and r2 are the rates of pfoa decomposition and defluorination respectively k1 min 1 and k2 mm min 1 are the rate constants of pfoa decomposition and defluorination respectively pfoa in μm and f in mm are concentrations of pfoa and fluoride ions at time t as the organo fluorine was sufficient during the reactions the defluorination rate was not concentration dependent and the kinetics followed the pseudo zeroth order model the phenomenon was also observed in other us systems and advanced oxidation process for pfoa degradation when the defluorination efficiency was less than 80 zhao et al 2013 lin et al 2015 with the pm doses increased from 0 to 20 mm k1 increased from 3 5 10 3 to 15 1 10 3 min 1 and k2 increased from 1 5 10 3 to 12 0 10 3 mm min 1 fig 2 in order to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the pm us system for pfoa degradation energy consumption relative to pfoa decomposition and defluorination were calculated and compared with other advanced oxidation processes aops table s1 the electrical energy consumed to reduce the concentration of pfoa by one order of magnitude in one m3 of the treated solution eeo lyu et al 2015 was 457 5 kwh m 3 order 1 for the pm us system in comparison of the k1 and eeo values pfoa decomposition in the pm us system is more cost effective than that in most microwave induced lee et al 2010 photocatalytic li et al 2012 phan thi et al 2013 chen et al 2016 and ultrasonic systems panchangam et al 2009 lin et al 2015 2016 but less than that in some electrochemical systems zhuo et al 2011 on the other hand the electrical energy required to ionize 1 g fluorine of pfoa eif was 13 2 kwh g 1 in the pm us system which is less than that using other techniques table s1 therefore the pm us system is more energy efficient than the previously investigated aops with a more effective pfoa degradation and a better energy efficiency the pm us system would be a good alternative to the commercially available aops such as uv h2o2 for practical applications to degrade pfoa in addition no catalyst or electrode is needed which makes the pm us system more facile 3 2 effects of mno2 production in the pm us system brownish precipitates were generated during the pfoa degradation and well suspended in the aqueous solution during the reaction as shown in fig s3a precipitates formed are sheet like nanoparticles the lattice spacing of about 0 49 0 31 and 0 25 nm for 200 310 and 211 planes respectively of mno2 across the nanoparticles could be readily resolved fig s3b according to the energy dispersive spectrum eds of the precipitates the atomic ratio of mn to o was around 1 2 table s2 the results indicated that mno2 was obtained as the main solid products in the pm us system mn iii might also be generated as an intermediate species and exist in the solid products by ultrasonic reduction of pm dhas et al 1997 the intermediate mn iii was highly reactive for organics oxidation jiang et al 2012 sun et al 2015 2018 hu et al 2017 while in the presence of carboxylic groups the solid mn would mainly be maintained in the higher oxidation state as mn iv under ultrasonication zhu et al 2005 which was also observed in this study the mno2 particles produced during the pfoa degradation have a diameter ranging from 0 09 to 6 15 μm fig s4 which could act as cavitation nuclei in the us systems for the formation of cavitation bubbles and pyrolytic conditions shchukin et al 2011 zhao et al 2014 while in the absence of pfoa the mean diameter of mno2 significantly increased from 3 81 to 24 29 μm fig s4 the effects of pfoa addition on the particle size of produced mno2 witnessed the possible complexation between the surface mn iv or mn iii of mno2 particles and the carboxyl groups cooh of pfoa wang and stone 2006 xu et al 2017 the surface pfoa with the long perfluoroalkyl chains could provide steric repulsion force to hinder the mno2 particles from aggregation as a result the adsorbates on the mno2 surface could be oxidized by permanganate much more quickly than their counterparts in the solution jiang et al 2009 perez benito 2009 overall the auto generated mno2 could catalyze the pfoa degradation via enhancing pyrolytic decomposition and oxidation by pm in the vicinity of the mno2 surface 9 mno 2 2 h mn 2 2 oh 10 mno 2 h 2 o 2 mn 2 2 oh o 2 the consumption of pm and the production of mno2 in the pm us system were quantified to study the effects of pm mno2 couple on the pfoa degradation mno2 could also be reduced to mn2 ions under ultrasonication eqs 9 and 10 abulizi et al 2014 however as the pm doses were sufficient mno2 particles could accumulate in the us system in the absence of pfoa a pm dosage of 10 mm resulted in the i400 gradually increasing from 0 to 1 01 after a 120 min ultrasonication fig 3 a adding pfoa did not significantly influence the accumulation of mno2 particles fig 3a however the consumption of pm after the ultrasonication increased from 0 31 to 0 52 mm with the pfoa addition in the 10 mm pm us system the results indicated that additional pm and mno2 particles were consumed for the pfoa degradation under ultrasonication the electron transfer in the pm us system from pfoa to pm mn iii or other intermediate mn will be confirmed in a future study the capacity of mno2 accumulation by the ultrasonication of pm gradually increased with the pm dosages fig 3b the results of mno2 accumulation were fitted with the pseudo zeroth order kinetic model eq 11 11 r m n o 2 d i 400 d t k m n o 2 where r m n o 2 and k m n o 2 min 1 are the rate and rate constant of the mno2 accumulation respectively the increase in k m n o 2 diminished with the pm dosages increasing from 6 to 20 mm fig 2 the trend was also observed for k1 and k2 as a result k 1 and k 2 increased more proportionally with the increased k m n o 2 fig 3c than with the increased pm dosages fig 2 the results indicated that with sufficient pm dosages the pfoa degradation might be dependent on the mno2 accumulation the improvements in the decomposition and defluorination with the increasing pm dosages would be restricted to the maximum accumulation of mno2 particles in the us system therefore in terms of cost effectiveness a pm dosage in the range of 6 10 mm is optimal for pfoa degradation in the us system as the ho radical was one prerequisite of mno2 production eqs 1 4 and could be an oxidant in the pm us system the contribution of the ho radicals was identified by adding tba before the reaction the addition of tba enhanced the production of mno2 with k m n o 2 increased from 8 5 10 3 to 15 0 10 3 min 1 fig s5 the enhanced mno2 production was due to that tba could be oxidized by ho and h radicals to alkyl radicals r which were also agents for pm reduction okitsu et al 2016 as a result the rates of pfoa decomposition and defluorination increased accordingly with the mno2 production enhanced in the presence of tba fig s5b the results implied that the ho radicals might not take the main responsibility to degrade pfoa in the pm us system the dissolved background organics would also influence the mno2 production and pfoa degradation in the pm us system humic acids were added at a concentration of 20 mg l 1 to evaluate the effects of natural organic matters on the performance of the pm us system fig s5 shows that the mno2 production was significantly enhanced by the dissolved humic acids with k m n o 2 increased from 8 5 10 3 to 32 6 10 3 min 1 due to the oxidation of humic acids by pm however rates of pfoa decomposition and defluorination only increased by 37 and 18 fig s5b respectively which were not proportional to the extent of enhancement in mno2 production the phenomenon was also observed for the oxidation of organics by pm in the presence of excessive humic acids xu et al 2017 that might be due to that the humic acids with carboxylic groups would compete for the complexation sites on the mno2 surface and hinder the catalytic oxidation of pfoa overall the dissolved humic acids slightly improved pfoa degradation in the pm us system 3 3 effects of initial ph it has been reported that ph condition affected the pfoa degradation panchangam et al 2009 and the performance of oxidation by pm han et al 2013 the h ions would influence the redox pathway and redox potential p ε 0 of pm table s3 yan and schwartz 1999 with the initial ph decreased from 7 to 2 the performance of oxidation by pm was expected to increase however the results of pfoa degradation in the pm us system deviated from the expectation pfoa was actually decomposed more effectively under weak acidic conditions ph 3 5 than under a strong acidic ph 2 and a neutral condition ph 7 fig 4 a in the meantime the efficiency of pfoa defluorination increased from 14 4 to 62 4 with the initial ph decreased from 7 to 4 fig 4b further decreasing the initial ph to 2 the defluorination efficiency decreased from 62 4 to 14 7 the solution ph varied gradually with time fig s6 which was resulted from the pm reduction and pfoa degradation with different degradation efficiencies overall both k 1 and k 2 in the ph range from 2 to 7 peaked at initial ph 4 fig 4c the phenomenon was due to the molecular form and vapor pressure of pfoa that changed with phs the pka value of a monomeric pfoa was estimated to be less than 1 0 cheng et al 2009a however the experimental results showed that the pka of pfoa at the mm level was around 3 8 eq s 1 burns et al 2008 which might be due to the aggregation of pfoa in aqueous solvents cheng et al 2009a therefore in this study pfoa would probably transform from anionic species c7f15coo to neutral species c7f15cooh when the ph condition changed from weak acidic ph 3 8 to strong acidic ph 3 8 conditions and more than 98 of the total pfoa existed in the neutral form at ph 2 pfoa as a surfactant initially accumulated at the gas liquid interface of the cavitation bubbles vecitis et al 2008 the acidified aqueous conditions would increase the vapor pressure of pfoa kutsuna and hori 2008 and partition pfoa into the gas phase armitage et al 2009 ultrasonic degradation is more effective for contaminants with higher hydrophobicity and herry s law constant that readily partitioning into the bubbles nanzai et al 2008 as the temperature in the cavitation bubbles 4000 k is higher than that at the gas liquid interfaces 600 1000 k when the bubbles collapse vecitis et al 2008 however pfoa partitioning into the gas phase could not effectively be in contact with the pm dissolved in the bulk solution therefore the rates of pfoa decomposition and defluorination decreased significantly with initial ph decreased from 4 to 2 the results of pfoa degradation under highly acidic conditions indicated the oxidation at the gas liquid interfaces is an important mechanism for pfoa degradation in the pm us system 3 4 effects of the power density of ultrasonication ultrasonic power density is an important operation parameter for pfoa degradation in a pm us system decomposition and defluorination of pfoa in the pm us system were accelerated with power density increased from 60 to 180 w l 1 fig 5 k 1 and k 2 increased gradually from 2 5 10 3 to 13 0 10 3 min 1 and 1 7 10 3 to 7 9 10 3 mm min 1 respectively with the increased power density the facilitating effects of the increased power density were also observed for degradation of hydrophobic organic compounds in different us systems liang et al 2016a in general a higher power density would supply more energy for cavitation and thermal cleavage of water eq 1 destaillats et al 2001 however the maximum size of cavitation bubbles also increases with the power density which would increase the collapse time of cavitation bubbles and result in incomplete collapses during a single compression cycle kang et al 1999 therefore an optimum could occur with regards to the rates of ultrasonic degradation however the optimum was not observed in the power density range applied 60 180 w l 1 in this study that may be due to a power density of 200 w l 1 is optimal for us systems with a frequency around 40 khz liu et al 2009b 3 5 effects of solution temperature the output power of ultrasonication decreased as the temperature rose under a constant pressure raso et al 1999 while a higher temperature could activate the oxidations by permanganate liu et al 2009a thus the effects of temperature on pfoa degradation in the pm us system were investigated as shown in fig 6 k 1 and k 2 values follow the arrhenius law eq 12 12 l n k l n a e a a p p r t where k is k 1 or k 2 a is a pre exponential factor with a unit identical to k e a a p p kj mol 1 represents the apparent activation energy for pfoa decomposition e a 1 a p p or defluorination e a 2 a p p r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 and t k is the liquid temperature e a 1 a p p and e a 2 a p p were calculated to be 8 23 kj mol 1 and 2 66 kj mol 1 respectively the low positive values of e a a p p implied that the pfoa degradation in the pm us system was contributed to both pyrolytic cleavage and chemical oxidation for a cleavage dominated degradation such as the pfoa degradation in a us system lin et al 2015 the increasing solution temperature would decrease the degradation rate that was due to the fact that the increased solution temperature would increase the vapor pressure of water reduce the quantity of the dissolved gas and decrease the extremes of the temperature and pressure generated bhatnagar and cheung 1994 jiang et al 2006 accordingly a negative e a a p p usually occurred in ultrasonic degradation vijayalakshmi and madras 2004 on the other hand chemical oxidation by pm is highly temperature dependent the increasing temperature could promote the oxidation resulting in a positive e a a p p liu et al 2009a 2012 the overall effects of the solution temperature on ultrasonic conditions and chemical oxidation by pm are that the pfoa degradation slightly facilitated by the increasing solution temperature heat dissipation from the ultrasonic probe surface without a temperature control would increase the solution temperature however the temperature control is unpractical during on site remediation or treatment with ultrasonic techniques consequently the adverse effects of rising temperatures would be a problem for real site applications of the us systems decreasing the mineralization efficiency of organic pollutants while using the pm us system the pfoa degradation is relatively insensitive to the solution temperature which increases its feasibility for on site applications 3 6 effects of the solution atmosphere the rate constants of pfoa decomposition and defluorination under argon air and oxygen atmosphere conditions are presented in fig 7 in the 6 mm pm us system k 1 and k 2 under the argon atmosphere increased from 13 0 10 3 to 14 4 10 3 min 1 and 7 9 10 3 to 12 3 10 3 mm min 1 respectively while under the oxygen atmosphere k 1 and k 2 decreased to 72 3 and 71 7 of that under the air atmosphere respectively argon gas has a specific heat ratio γ of 1 67 at 20 c which is higher than that of air 1 40 and oxygen 1 40 a higher γ will result in a higher transient temperature when cavitation bubbles collapse which would promote the cleavage of water and formation of ros therefore the production of mno2 and the oxidation of pfoa by pm could be improved with the favorable cavitation conditions in addition the atmosphere also influences the production rate of ho and h2o2 in the water under ultrasonication in the low frequency us system the formation of h2o2 and sonochemical reduction by h2o2 occurring in the water were less under the oxygen atmosphere than those under the argon or air atmosphere petrier et al 1992 ge and qu 2003 on the contrary more ho radicals were produced and more sonochemical oxidations were affected when the solution was saturated with oxygen ge and qu 2003 overall as the γ values of air and oxygen gas are the same the adverse effects of oxygen atmosphere was mainly contributed to the inhibited sonochemical reduction of pm by h2o2 and the reduced production of mno2 particles on the other hand the pfoa degradation in the pm us system promoted under the argon atmosphere was due to the increased extreme temperature and the enhanced h2o2 formation 3 7 effects of co dissolved transition metal cations various cations present in groundwater and wastewater may influence the pfoa degradation in the pm us system no obvious effects of na ca2 mg2 ions were observed on the pfoa degradation under ultrasonication cheng et al 2009b while in the presence of transition metals such as cu2 fe2 and fe3 ions the pfoa removals via photochemical decomposition wang et al 2008 and foam flotation lee et al 2017 could be enhanced due to the complexation of the transition metal cations with the carboxylate group of pfoa eq 13 therefore the effects of co dissolved cu2 fe2 and fe3 ions on the pfoa degradation in the pm us system were investigated 13 ncf 3 cf 2 6 coo me m cf 3 cf 2 6 coo n me m n the rate constants shown in fig 8 indicate that the cu2 fe2 and fe3 ions would inhibit the pfoa decomposition and defluorination in the pm us system with both the k 1 and k 2 values following the decreasing order control cu2 fe2 fe3 according to the solubility test the concentration of dissolved pfoa decreased with the dosages of the transition metal cations fig s7 in the presence of 0 2 mm cu2 fe2 and fe3 the residual dissolved pfoa decreased to 94 1 94 3 and 33 6 respectively the results were reasonable since the complex stability constant of pfoa with fe3 is higher than that with fe2 or those with other divalent metallic cations lee et al 2017 the complexation of fe3 with pfoa could also be witnessed by the uv vis spectra of the ferric ion solutions in the absence and presence of pfoa liang et al 2016b thus the actual rate constant of pfoa decomposition with the transition metal cations might be lower than the apparent k 1 shown in fig 8 because some pfoa compounds were removed from the aqueous phase via the complexation while the k 2 values could reflect the actual decrements in pfoa degradation with the transition metal cations in the pm us system the complexation of pfoa with transition metal cations would inhibit the coordination of the carboxylic groups of pfoa onto the mno2 surface which might reduce the catalytic effects of mno2 particles it should be noted that fe2 and cu2 affected the pfoa solubility similarly but fe2 inhibited the pfoa degradation in the pm us system more that was because fe2 could be oxidized to fe3 under ultrasonication by ros and form more complexes with pfoa during the degradation 3 8 intermediates and pathways of pfoa degradation in the pm us system concentrations of pfcas in the solution were analyzed to investigate the intermediates of pfoa degradation in the pm us system only pfcas with shorter chains i e pfpra c3 and tfa c2 could be detected during the reactions fig 9 in addition the concentrations of pfpra and tfa increased with reaction time similar to the pfoa degradation in other us systems moriwaki et al 2005 according to the intermediates analysis and the experimental results presented in the previous sections the pathways of pfoa degradation in the pm us system were proposed in eqs 14 19 first the pfoa degradation was initiated via a one electron extraction on the carboxylic group forming an organic free radical eq 14 the organic free radical then underwent a pyrolytic cleavage of the c c bond between the perfluoroalkyl tail and the carboxylate group yielding a perfluoroalkyl free radical and a co2 molecule eq 15 the perfluoroalkyl free radical might be oxidized on the cf2 group to pfhpa c6 releasing fluorine ions eq 16 the steps in eqs 14 16 could repeat similarly to degrade pfhpa to other pfcas with fewer alkyl units c2 c5 pathway i panchangam et al 2009 the perfluoroalkyl free radicals with different chain lengths also could undergo direct cleavage of the c c bonds and produce cf3 and cf2 free radicals eq 17 pathway ii vecitis et al 2008 the cf3 and cf2 free radicals were ultimately oxidized to co2 and fluoride ions eqs 18 and 19 as pfpra and tfa accumulated during the reaction the pathway i could exist in the pm us system however intermediate pfcas with longer chains c4 c6 were not detected which might be due to these intermediate pfcas were quickly decomposed after generation with the maximum concentrations smaller than the detection limits in this study 14 3 cf 3 cf 2 6 coo mno 2 cf 3 cf 2 6 coo e 15 cf 3 cf 2 6 coo mno 2 cf 3 cf 2 6 co 2 16 cf 3 cf 2 6 2

effectiveness of an autocatalytic system the pm us system for pfoa degradation was systematically investigated the synergism between pm and us were significant for both pfoa decomposition and defluorination the rates of pfoa decomposition and defluorination increased proportionally with the production rate of mno2 particles in the pm us system an initial ph of 4 was optimal for the pfoa degradation the power density of ultrasonication solution atmosphere and transition metal cations were also influential on the performance of the pm us system while the increasing solution temperature had an insignificant impact overall this study developed a promising technology for pfoa degradation in the aqueous phase which can be applied in the wastewater treatment plants as a post treatment
