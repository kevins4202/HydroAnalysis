20465,a modified mild slope equation mmse for waves propagation over a porous seabed is derived by using green s second identity the mmse contains both the bottom curvature term and the slope squared term the model is computational inexpensive and capable of describing a rapidly varying porous bed as an example bragg resonant reflection of water waves by a bragg breakwater with an array of porous rectangular bars on a sloping permeable seabed is modeled numerically based on the present mmse at first our numerical solution is validated against the analytical solution for shallow water waves propagation over an impermeable bragg breakwater and excellent agreement is obtained next more computational results show that the primary peak bragg resonance decreases with the increase of the permeability it is also shown by the present results that the peak value of the primary bragg resonance increases with increase of the bar number and the bar height in addition there exists a particular value of the bar width that maximizes the bragg resonant reflection keywords modified mild slope equation bragg resonant reflection bragg breakwater porous rectangular bars permeable seabed 1 introduction when surface waves propagate from deep to shallow water wave transformation such as shoaling reflection refraction and diffraction will take place due to the influence of varying bottom topographies or bottom structures particularly if the seabed topography or underwater structure is periodic the well known phenomenon called bragg resonant reflection may occur originally bragg resonant reflection in crystallography was first observed by bragg and bragg 1913 while performing the experiment of x rays reflection by crystalline solids bragg resonant reflection of surface waves by sinusoidally varying ripple beds was revealed theoretically by davies 1982a b and experimentally by heathershaw 1982 and davies and heathershaw 1984 since then this exceptional phenomenon for water wave propagation over sinusoidal ripple beds has been extensively studied by many researchers see mei 1985 dalrymple and kirby 1986 kirby 1986 yoon and liu 1987 belzons et al 1991 guazzelli et al 1992 rey et al 1992 o hare and davies 1992 1993 madsen et al 2006 seo 2014 liu et al 2012 and liu et al 2019 however in practical coastal and ocean engineering it is infeasible to use natural periodic ripples and sandbars directly to protect coastal structures mei et al 1988 proposed the concept of a bragg breakwater to protect the drilling platform from the attack of storm waves on the oil fields in the ekofisk of the north sea in which the bragg breakwater consists of a series of small size low height and shore parallel submerged artificial bars afterwards various bragg breakwaters with different shapes such as rectangle triangle trapezoid rectified cosinoid paraboloid semi circular and half ellipse have been studied see kirby and anton 1990 cho et al 2001 hsu et al 2001 2002 2007 jeon and cho 2006 wang et al 2006 liu et al 2015a b and liu et al 2020 considering that the practical seabeds in nearshore are not flat zeng et al 2017 studied shallow water wave reflection by an array of rectangular bars over a sloping seabed recently bragg scattering of shallow water waves by an array of submerged rectangular trenches over a sloping seabed was also studied in two dimensions by kar et al 2020 in these two papers optimal collocations of the bar number bar height and bar width to obtain the maximum bragg resonance for three types of artificial bars i e triangular bars trapezoidal bars and rectified cosinoidal bars over a flat seabed initiated by liu et al 2015a and for parabolic bars over a flat seabed established by liu et al 2015b were extended to the optimal collocations for rectangular bars and trenches over a slopping beach it is worth indicating that all the previous studies on bragg resonant reflection are limited to impermeable bragg breakwaters however in practical applications breakwaters and the bottom seabed usually comprise of porous media having the characteristics of permeability able to absorb and dissipate wave energy hence in this paper we are going to study bragg resonant reflection of water waves by a bragg breakwater with porous rectangular bars on a sloping permeable seabed to model wave propagation over such kind of permeable bragg breakwaters a two dimensional modified mild slope equation containing both bottom curvature term and slope squared term is derived in section 2 which is applicable to a rapidly varying topography in section 3 for the case of water waves propagating over a one dimensional permeable seabed the new modified mild slope equation degenerates into an ordinary differential equation and numerically solved by the finite difference method fdm in section 4 wave reflection by a bragg breakwater with porous rectangular bars on a sloping permeable seabed is solved by using the present numerical model and the influence of several important parameters such as the permeability the bar number bar submergence bar width and the slope of sloping permeable seabed on peak bragg resonance is discussed finally for convenience of reader we draw the conclusions of our paper in section 5 2 the new modified mild slope equation waves propagation over an infinite deep porous seabed is considered in this research a cartesian coordinate is defined with the oxy plan on the still water surface and the z axis is measured positively upwards as shown in fig 1 the sea bed is at z h x y and varies gently in the horizontal directions the fluid is assumed as incompressible and inviscid and the fluid motion is irrotational thus a potential function φ x y z t exists which is governed by the laplace equation for harmonic motion the time factor can be separated out and the velocity potential is written as 1 φ x y z t re φ x y z e i ω t where i 1 is imaginary unit ω is the angular frequency of fluid motion and φ x y z is the spatially dependent complex potential satisfying the following laplace s equation within the fluid domain 2 2 φ 2 φ z 2 0 h x y z 0 where x y is the horizontal gradient operation based on the linear wave theory the free surface boundary condition of the complex velocity potential can be written as 3 φ z ω 2 g φ 0 z 0 where g is the acceleration of gravity the normal vector n of the seabed can be computed by the sea bed surface function as 4 n 1 1 h x 2 h y 2 h x i h y j k where i j and k are the unit vectors in the x y and z directions respectively the normal velocity w w of the fluid motion on the upper surface of the interface z h x y can be written as computed 5 w w φ z φ n 1 1 h x 2 h y 2 φ z φ h z h x y the fluid dynamic pressure p w on the upper surface of the interface can be computed by the bernoulli equation as 6 p w i ω ρ φ z h x y where ρ is the fluid density for a fully saturated porous media which is assumed to be incompressible darcy s law relates the interstifial flow velocity u p due to the pressure gradients in the porous media 7 u p k η p p p p z k where k is a constant called the permeability rate representing the characteristic of the porous media η is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and p p is the fluid pressure in the porous media at the interface z h x y the normal velocity of interstifial flow can be obtained as 8 w p k η p p z k p p n k η 1 1 h x 2 h y 2 p p z p p h z h x y for uniform isotropy media the governing equation for the fluid pressure in the porous media can be obtained as 9 2 p p 2 p

written as 10 φ x z i g a ω cosh k z h i ω t sinh k z h cosh k h i ω t sinh k h e i k x and the pressure function in the sea bed can be written as 11 p p ρ g c p e k z h e i k x where a is the incident wave amplitude and c p is an coefficient to be determined t ρ k η is a parameter related to the permeability rate k is the complex wavenumber written as k k r i k i in which k r is the real part of k related to the wavelength while the imaginary component k i determines the spatial damping rate by employing the continuity conditions of the pressure and velocities across the interface z h x y as well as the free surface boundary condition the dispersion relation for wave propagation over an infinite deep porous seabed can be obtained as 12 ω 2 g k tanh k h i ω t g k ω 2 tanh k h as for the two dimensional mild slope bottom dean and dalrymple s solution can be extended to the two dimensional case and the fluid pressure in the porous media can be approximatively written as 13 p p ρ g c p e k z h e i k x cos α y sin α where α is the incident angle of wave relative to the x axis thus we have 14 p p z k p p and 15 p p p p x i p p y j i k cos α p p i i k sin α p p j i k p p cos α i sin α j substituting eqs 14 and 15 into eq 8 we obtain 16 w p λ δ t ρ k p p z h x y where δ 1 h x 2 h y 2 and λ 1 i cos α i sin α j h by matching the continuity conditions of velocity w w w p and pressure p w p p at the interface between the water layer and the porous media it yields that 17 w w w p λ δ t ρ k p p λ δ t ρ k p w i λ δ ω k t φ z h x y to define the mathematical problem in the 2d horizontal plane the spatial velocity potential φ x y z is expressed in term of a weak function ϕ 18 φ x y z ϕ x y z z in which 19 z z cosh k z h i ω t sinh k z h cosh k h i ω t sinh k h applying the green s second identity to z z and φ it yields 20 h 0 z 2 φ z 2 d z h 0 φ 2 z z 2 d z z φ z φ z z h 0 by substituting eqs 2 and 18 in the first term on the left hand side of eq 20 we obtain 21 h 0 z 2

into the second term on the right hand side of eq 20 yields 24 φ z z h 0 φ k tanh k h i ω t k 1 i ω t tanh k h z 0 φ z z z h φ ω 2 g z 0 z ϕ z z z h thus eq 20 can be written as 25 h 0 z 2 ϕ d z h 0 ϕ z 2 z d z h 0 k 2 z 2 ϕ d z i λ ω k t ϕ z 2 z h z ϕ z ϕ z z z h furthermore the leibnitz rule is used to the first term on the left hand side of eq 25 26 h 0 z 2 ϕ d z h 0 z 2 ϕ d z z 2 ϕ h z h h 0 z 2 ϕ d z z 2 ϕ h z h and we get 27 h 0 z 2 ϕ d z h 0 z 2 z ϕ d z h 0 k 2 z 2 ϕ d z ϕ i λ ω k t z 2 z h z z z z z h 0 for convenience let 28 i 1 h 0 z 2 d z 29 i 2 h 0 z 2 z d z 30 a 1 z z h 1 cosh k h

2 k h 2 z k 2 k h 2 d z a 1 z h z k k h z h eqs 28 29 34 and 35 are integrable and the integrated results are given in appendix for a solid sea bed t 0 and eq 33 is simplified as 36 c c g ϕ k 2 c c g f 1 k h g 2 h f 2 k h g h 2 ϕ 0 this equation is just the modified mild slope equation derived by chamberlain and porter in 1995 see appendix in addition if we ignore the bottom curvature and slope

the porous bottom exhibits an arbitrary x directional variation in a region of finite length l p and extends uniformly to in the y direction lying between two regions of permeable bottoms with constant but different depth h h 1 region of incidence and h h 3 region of transmission as shown in fig 2 the wave field is excited by a linear wave propagating in the x direction the general representation of the velocity potential in the regions of incidence and transmission is 38 φ 1 x z ϕ 1 x z 1 z i g a 0 ω e i k 1 x y r 1 e i k 1 x z 1 z and 39 φ 3 x z ϕ 3 x z 3 z y t 3 e i k 3 x l p

4 numerical results for reflection coefficient and discussion in this section we shall calculate the reflection coefficient of water wave propagation over a series of submerged porous rectangular bars which are parallel to the coastline and uniformly located on the sloping permeable seabed as shown in fig 3 the corresponding water depth h x is h x h 1 if x 0 h 2 if x j 1 x x j 2 j 1 2 n h 1 x tan β if x j 2 x x j 1 1 j 1 2 n 1 h 3 if x x n 2 where n stands for the number of bars tan β represents the slope of seabed and h i i 1 2 3 denotes the constant depth of water in addition w and d are the bar width and distance between two adjacent bars respectively we first provide the model validation for the case of impermeable breakwaters and seabed by setting t 0 in the model and then we employ the model to investigate the influence of permeability the bar number the bar submergence the bar width and the slope of the sloping permeable seabed on bragg resonant reflection 4 1 model validation first the present model is validated against the closed form analytical solution given by zeng et al 2017 the slope of the impermeable sloping seabed takes two values tanβ 1 500 and tanβ 1 1000 and other parameters are given as h 1 4 m h 2 3 m w 90 m and d 180 m we calculate the reflection coefficients k r iω g a 0 y r 1 for k 0 h 1 ranging from 0 01 to π 10 that is 2d l 0 ranging from 0 1432 to 4 5 correspondingly where l 0 is incident wavelength and k 0 is the wavenumber using the present model in two cases of n 2 and n 3 respectively and the numerical results are plotted against 2d l 0 by solid line in fig 4 a d respectively along with the analytical solutions red circles obviously our numerical results are in good agreement with the analytical solutions and the peak value of reflection coefficient k r decreases while the slope of seabed tanβ increases next the present model is further validated against the analytical solution zeng et al 2017 for the two cases with n 2 and n 3 respectively together with h 1 4 m h 2 3 m w 120 m d 190 m and tanβ 1 1000 the related reflection coefficients are calculated for 0 1512 2d l 0 5 and the results are plotted in fig 5 a b it is shown in fig 5 that the present solutions solid lines are in good agreement with the analytical solutions red circles as expected the primary peak of bragg resonant reflection happens while incident wavelength is almost twice of the distance between two adjacent bars 2d l 0 1 and the reflection coefficients caused by 3 bars are obviously overall larger than the reflection coefficients caused by 2 bars 4 2 influence of permeability on bragg resonant reflection the real seabed is usually covered with different types of sediments such as gravel coarse sand fine sand and calcareous sand or with the ripped rock structures they have different permeability for examples mizutani and mostafa 1998 gave the permeability of the submerged breakwater and the coarse sandy seabed in their experiment zhou 2018 investigated the permeability of the ripped rock breakwater and the medium coarse sandy seabed in yantai port shandong province of china and ren et al 2018 studied the permeability of the calcareous sand with different diameters in the south china sea the relevant parameters are listed in table 1 in this subsection we will investigate the influence of permeability on bragg resonant reflection similarly we set h 1 4 m h 2 3 m w 90 m d 180 m tanβ 1 500 n 2 and let 2d l 0 vary from 0 1432 to 4 9647 we consider t 0 1 10 4 1 10 3 1 10 2 respectively by referencing table 1 note here the case of t 0 indicates an impermeable bottom the computational results are displayed in fig 6 it is easy to see that the primary peak of bragg resonant reflection happens when incident wavelength is almost twice of the distance between two adjacent bars that is l 0 2d for both impermeable and permeable bottom however the peak amplitude and the bandwidth of resonant zone decreases with the increase in permeability as wave energy is dissipated in permeable seabed and bars furthermore the secondary peaks of bragg resonant reflection happen in higher frequency and with the increase in the incident wave frequency the secondary peak amplitudes decrease and the influence of permeability on secondary peak amplitudes and the bandwidth of resonant zones is more obvious in addition it can be seen from table 2 that the permeability has no effect on the phase of the peak resonance 4 3 influence of the bar number on bragg resonant reflection for impermeable sinusoidal ripples guazzelli et al 1992 and bragg breakwaters such as trapezoidal bars chang and liou 2007 and rectangular bars hsu et al 2003 the results show that the peak amplitude of bragg resonant reflection increases and the bandwidth of resonant zone decreases with increasing the number of ripples or artificial bars for the purpose of studying the influence of the number of bars n on bragg resonant reflection over an array of same height rectangular porous bars located on sloping permeable seabed calculating parameters are given h 1 4 m h 2 3 m w 90 m d 180 m tanβ 1 1000 t 1 10 3 and 1 10 2 we let 2d l 0 vary from 0 1432 to 4 9647 and n vary from 1 to 5 the computational results are plotted in fig 7 similar phenomenon can be observed for the case of permeable breakwaters and seabed the peak amplitudes of bragg resonant reflection increase and the bandwidth of resonant zones decreases with increasing the number of rectangular bar number n 4 4 influence of the bar submergence on bragg resonant reflection the bar submergence is defined by s h 2 h 1 we fix that h 1 4 m w 90 m d 180 m tanβ 1 1000 n 2 t 1 10 3 and 1 10 2 and let 2d l 0 vary from 0 1432 to 4 9647 the bar submergence s takes four values 0 875 0 750 0 625 and 0 500 the reflection coefficients against 2d l 0 are calculated the results are shown in fig 8 from fig 8 it is found that while the bar submergence s decreases or in other words while the bar height increases the magnitude of bragg resonant reflection and the ability of wave energy dissipation increase meanwhile the primary peak bragg reflection shifts slightly toward low frequency in fact in the case of t 1 10 3 when the submergence decreases from s 0 875 to 0 500 the phase of the peak resonance shifts downward from 2d l 0 0 9712 to 2d l 0 0 7764 in the case of t 1 10 2 when the submergence decreases from s 0 875 to 0 500 the phase of the peak resonance also shifts downward from 2d l 0 0 9712 to 2d l 0 0 7764 according to liu et al 2020 this can be explained that the velocity of water waves is slower in shallower water with small submergence than in deeper water with large submergence 4 5 influence of the bar width on bragg resonant reflection in what follows we show the influence of the bar width on bragg resonant reflection let h 1 4 m h 2 3 m d 180 m tanβ 1 1000 and t 1 10 2 and let w d take 9 values 0 1 0 2 0 9 respectively the reflection coefficient k r against 2d l 0 for 2d l 0 varying from 0 1432 to 4 9647 is calculated by the present numerical model the results for n 2 are shown in fig 9 a b and the results for n 3 are shown in fig 9 c d it can be seen that for n 2 when the bar width increases from w d 0 1 to w d 0 5 the maximal peak amplitude of bragg resonance near 2d l 0 1 increases from 0 1 to 0 25 while when the bar width further increases from w d 0 5 to w d 0 9 the maximal peak amplitude of bragg resonance near 2d l 0 1 reversely decreases from 0 25 to 0 15 for n 3 when the bar width increases from w d 0 1 to w d 0 5 the maximal peak amplitude of bragg resonance near 2d l 0 1 increases from 0 12 to 0 31 while when the bar width further increases from w d 0 5 to w d 0 9 the maximal peak amplitude of bragg resonance near 2d l 0 1 reversely decreases from 0 31 to 0 15 this changing trend is totally same to the trend for trapezoidal bars observed by liu et al 2020 in their fig 9 this implies that there exists a particular value of the bar width that the magnitude of bragg resonant reflection will achieve its extreme value 4 6 influence of the slope of seabed on bragg resonant reflection finally we investigate the influence of the slope of seabed tanβ on bragg resonant reflection to this end we set h 1 4 m h 2 3 m w 90 m d 180 m n 2 and 3 t 0 0 005 and 0 01 and let 2d l 0 vary from 0 1432 to 4 9647 five different values 1 300 1 500 1 800 1 1000 and 0 are selected for tanβ when n 2 and four different values 1 500 1 800 1 1000 and 0 are selected for tanβ when n 3 the corresponding results are plotted in fig 10 which show that the peak bragg resonant reflection increases with decreasing the slope of seabed thus the bar height increases in addition as we can see in fig 10 a b in the case with the sea bottom is impermeable i e t 0 when tanβ 0 the sea bottom is flat and therefore symmetrical many zero reflections or complete transmissions occur while when tanβ 0 the sea bottom is sloping and therefore not symmetrical the phenomenon of zero reflection disappears this follows the rule that zero reflection occurs if and only if the sea bottom or the structure is symmetrical this rule was first proposed by xie et al 2011 and was later confirmed by many subsequent results such as xie and liu 2012 liu et al 2013a 2013b chakraborty and mandal 2014 medina rodríguez et al 2016 kar et al 2018 kaur et al 2019 and kar et al 2020 however as we can see in fig 10 c f for cases where the bottom is permeable i e t 0 005 and t 0 01 zero reflection does not exist regardless of the presence or absence of slopes that is regardless of whether the seabed is symmetrical or asymmetric this is due to the leakage of some wave energy from permeable sea bottom 5 conclusions the present model which extends the modified mild slope equation by introducing the permeable bottom boundary condition for waves propagating over porous seabed is derived using green s second identity it is computationally inexpensive and helpful in understanding the physical behavior of the phenomena and contains the bottom curvature and slope squared terms to account for rapidly varying topography the validity of the model is examined by employing the example of bragg resonant reflection by a series of impermeable rectangular bars on an impermeable slope the present solutions give a good agreement with a closed form analytical solution reported by zeng et al 2017 key parameters such as the permeability the bar number the bar height the bar distance and the slope of seabed affecting the amplitude of the peak bragg resonance are analyzed in detail the amplitude of the peak bragg increases with the increase in the bar number and the bar height it achieves the maximum value when the distance between two adjacent bars is a half of the incident wavelength however the peak bragg reflection decreases while the permeability increase in addition when the bottom is permeable zero reflection does not exist regardless of the presence or absence of slopes that is regardless of whether the seabed is symmetrical or asymmetric credit authorship contribution statement yun lin ni conceptualization methodology software

20465,a modified mild slope equation mmse for waves propagation over a porous seabed is derived by using green s second identity the mmse contains both the bottom curvature term and the slope squared term the model is computational inexpensive and capable of describing a rapidly varying porous bed as an example bragg resonant reflection of water waves by a bragg breakwater with an array of porous rectangular bars on a sloping permeable seabed is modeled numerically based on the present mmse at first our numerical solution is validated against the analytical solution for shallow water waves propagation over an impermeable bragg breakwater and excellent agreement is obtained next more computational results show that the primary peak bragg resonance decreases with the increase of the permeability it is also shown by the present results that the peak value of the primary bragg resonance increases with increase of the bar number and the bar height in addition there exists a particular value of the bar width that maximizes the bragg resonant reflection keywords modified mild slope equation bragg resonant reflection bragg breakwater porous rectangular bars permeable seabed 1 introduction when surface waves propagate from deep to shallow water wave transformation such as shoaling reflection refraction and diffraction will take place due to the influence of varying bottom topographies or bottom structures particularly if the seabed topography or underwater structure is periodic the well known phenomenon called bragg resonant reflection may occur originally bragg resonant reflection in crystallography was first observed by bragg and bragg 1913 while performing the experiment of x rays reflection by crystalline solids bragg resonant reflection of surface waves by sinusoidally varying ripple beds was revealed theoretically by davies 1982a b and experimentally by heathershaw 1982 and davies and heathershaw 1984 since then this exceptional phenomenon for water wave propagation over sinusoidal ripple beds has been extensively studied by many researchers see mei 1985 dalrymple and kirby 1986 kirby 1986 yoon and liu 1987 belzons et al 1991 guazzelli et al 1992 rey et al 1992 o hare and davies 1992 1993 madsen et al 2006 seo 2014 liu et al 2012 and liu et al 2019 however in practical coastal and ocean engineering it is infeasible to use natural periodic ripples and sandbars directly to protect coastal structures mei et al 1988 proposed the concept of a bragg breakwater to protect the drilling platform from the attack of storm waves on the oil fields in the ekofisk of the north sea in which the bragg breakwater consists of a series of small size low height and shore parallel submerged artificial bars afterwards various bragg breakwaters with different shapes such as rectangle triangle trapezoid rectified cosinoid paraboloid semi circular and half ellipse have been studied see kirby and anton 1990 cho et al 2001 hsu et al 2001 2002 2007 jeon and cho 2006 wang et al 2006 liu et al 2015a b and liu et al 2020 considering that the practical seabeds in nearshore are not flat zeng et al 2017 studied shallow water wave reflection by an array of rectangular bars over a sloping seabed recently bragg scattering of shallow water waves by an array of submerged rectangular trenches over a sloping seabed was also studied in two dimensions by kar et al 2020 in these two papers optimal collocations of the bar number bar height and bar width to obtain the maximum bragg resonance for three types of artificial bars i e triangular bars trapezoidal bars and rectified cosinoidal bars over a flat seabed initiated by liu et al 2015a and for parabolic bars over a flat seabed established by liu et al 2015b were extended to the optimal collocations for rectangular bars and trenches over a slopping beach it is worth indicating that all the previous studies on bragg resonant reflection are limited to impermeable bragg breakwaters however in practical applications breakwaters and the bottom seabed usually comprise of porous media having the characteristics of permeability able to absorb and dissipate wave energy hence in this paper we are going to study bragg resonant reflection of water waves by a bragg breakwater with porous rectangular bars on a sloping permeable seabed to model wave propagation over such kind of permeable bragg breakwaters a two dimensional modified mild slope equation containing both bottom curvature term and slope squared term is derived in section 2 which is applicable to a rapidly varying topography in section 3 for the case of water waves propagating over a one dimensional permeable seabed the new modified mild slope equation degenerates into an ordinary differential equation and numerically solved by the finite difference method fdm in section 4 wave reflection by a bragg breakwater with porous rectangular bars on a sloping permeable seabed is solved by using the present numerical model and the influence of several important parameters such as the permeability the bar number bar submergence bar width and the slope of sloping permeable seabed on peak bragg resonance is discussed finally for convenience of reader we draw the conclusions of our paper in section 5 2 the new modified mild slope equation waves propagation over an infinite deep porous seabed is considered in this research a cartesian coordinate is defined with the oxy plan on the still water surface and the z axis is measured positively upwards as shown in fig 1 the sea bed is at z h x y and varies gently in the horizontal directions the fluid is assumed as incompressible and inviscid and the fluid motion is irrotational thus a potential function φ x y z t exists which is governed by the laplace equation for harmonic motion the time factor can be separated out and the velocity potential is written as 1 φ x y z t re φ x y z e i ω t where i 1 is imaginary unit ω is the angular frequency of fluid motion and φ x y z is the spatially dependent complex potential satisfying the following laplace s equation within the fluid domain 2 2 φ 2 φ z 2 0 h x y z 0 where x y is the horizontal gradient operation based on the linear wave theory the free surface boundary condition of the complex velocity potential can be written as 3 φ z ω 2 g φ 0 z 0 where g is the acceleration of gravity the normal vector n of the seabed can be computed by the sea bed surface function as 4 n 1 1 h x 2 h y 2 h x i h y j k where i j and k are the unit vectors in the x y and z directions respectively the normal velocity w w of the fluid motion on the upper surface of the interface z h x y can be written as computed 5 w w φ z φ n 1 1 h x 2 h y 2 φ z φ h z h x y the fluid dynamic pressure p w on the upper surface of the interface can be computed by the bernoulli equation as 6 p w i ω ρ φ z h x y where ρ is the fluid density for a fully saturated porous media which is assumed to be incompressible darcy s law relates the interstifial flow velocity u p due to the pressure gradients in the porous media 7 u p k η p p p p z k where k is a constant called the permeability rate representing the characteristic of the porous media η is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and p p is the fluid pressure in the porous media at the interface z h x y the normal velocity of interstifial flow can be obtained as 8 w p k η p p z k p p n k η 1 1 h x 2 h y 2 p p z p p h z h x y for uniform isotropy media the governing equation for the fluid pressure in the porous media can be obtained as 9 2 p p 2 p

written as 10 φ x z i g a ω cosh k z h i ω t sinh k z h cosh k h i ω t sinh k h e i k x and the pressure function in the sea bed can be written as 11 p p ρ g c p e k z h e i k x where a is the incident wave amplitude and c p is an coefficient to be determined t ρ k η is a parameter related to the permeability rate k is the complex wavenumber written as k k r i k i in which k r is the real part of k related to the wavelength while the imaginary component k i determines the spatial damping rate by employing the continuity conditions of the pressure and velocities across the interface z h x y as well as the free surface boundary condition the dispersion relation for wave propagation over an infinite deep porous seabed can be obtained as 12 ω 2 g k tanh k h i ω t g k ω 2 tanh k h as for the two dimensional mild slope bottom dean and dalrymple s solution can be extended to the two dimensional case and the fluid pressure in the porous media can be approximatively written as 13 p p ρ g c p e k z h e i k x cos α y sin α where α is the incident angle of wave relative to the x axis thus we have 14 p p z k p p and 15 p p p p x i p p y j i k cos α p p i i k sin α p p j i k p p cos α i sin α j substituting eqs 14 and 15 into eq 8 we obtain 16 w p λ δ t ρ k p p z h x y where δ 1 h x 2 h y 2 and λ 1 i cos α i sin α j h by matching the continuity conditions of velocity w w w p and pressure p w p p at the interface between the water layer and the porous media it yields that 17 w w w p λ δ t ρ k p p λ δ t ρ k p w i λ δ ω k t φ z h x y to define the mathematical problem in the 2d horizontal plane the spatial velocity potential φ x y z is expressed in term of a weak function ϕ 18 φ x y z ϕ x y z z in which 19 z z cosh k z h i ω t sinh k z h cosh k h i ω t sinh k h applying the green s second identity to z z and φ it yields 20 h 0 z 2 φ z 2 d z h 0 φ 2 z z 2 d z z φ z φ z z h 0 by substituting eqs 2 and 18 in the first term on the left hand side of eq 20 we obtain 21 h 0 z 2 φ z 2 d z h 0 z ϕ z d z h 0 z z 2 ϕ 2 z ϕ ϕ 2 z d z h 0 z 2 ϕ d z h 0 ϕ z 2 z d z the second term on the left hand side of eq 20 can be simplified to 22 h 0 φ 2 z z 2 d z h 0 k 2 z φ d z h 0 k 2 z 2 ϕ

z 2 z d z h 0 k 2 z 2 ϕ d z i λ ω k t ϕ z 2 z h z ϕ z ϕ z z z h furthermore the leibnitz rule is used to the first term on the left hand side of eq 25 26 h 0 z 2 ϕ d z h 0 z 2 ϕ d z z 2 ϕ h z h h 0 z 2 ϕ d z z 2 ϕ h z h and we get 27 h 0 z 2 ϕ d z h 0 z 2 z ϕ d z h 0 k 2 z 2 ϕ d z ϕ i λ ω k t z 2 z h z z z z z h 0 for convenience let 28 i 1 h 0 z 2 d z 29 i 2 h 0 z 2 z d z 30 a 1 z z h 1 cosh k h

2 k h 2 z k 2 k h 2 d z a 1 z h z k k h z h eqs 28 29 34 and 35 are integrable and the integrated results are given in appendix for a solid sea bed t 0 and eq 33 is simplified as 36 c c g ϕ k 2 c c g f 1 k h g 2 h f 2 k h g h 2 ϕ 0 this equation is just the modified mild slope equation derived by chamberlain and porter in 1995 see appendix in addition if we ignore the bottom curvature and slope

the porous bottom exhibits an arbitrary x directional variation in a region of finite length l p and extends uniformly to in the y direction lying between two regions of permeable bottoms with constant but different depth h h 1 region of incidence and h h 3 region of transmission as shown in fig 2 the wave field is excited by a linear wave propagating in the x direction the general representation of the velocity potential in the regions of incidence and transmission is 38 φ 1 x z ϕ 1 x z 1 z i g a 0 ω e i k 1 x y r 1 e i k 1 x z 1 z and 39 φ 3 x z ϕ 3 x z 3 z y t 3 e i k 3 x l p

4 numerical results for reflection coefficient and discussion in this section we shall calculate the reflection coefficient of water wave propagation over a series of submerged porous rectangular bars which are parallel to the coastline and uniformly located on the sloping permeable seabed as shown in fig 3 the corresponding water depth h x is h x h 1 if x 0 h 2 if x j 1 x x j 2 j 1 2 n h 1 x tan β if x j 2 x x j 1 1 j 1 2 n 1 h 3 if x x n 2 where n stands for the number of bars tan β represents the slope of seabed and h i i 1 2 3 denotes the constant depth of water in addition w and d are the bar width and distance between two adjacent bars respectively we first provide the model validation for the case of impermeable breakwaters and seabed by setting t 0 in the model and then we employ the model to investigate the influence of permeability the bar number the bar submergence the bar width and the slope of the sloping permeable seabed on bragg resonant reflection 4 1 model validation first the present model is validated against the closed form analytical solution given by zeng et al 2017 the slope of the impermeable sloping seabed takes two values tanβ 1 500 and tanβ 1 1000 and other parameters are given as h 1 4 m h 2 3 m w 90 m and d 180 m we calculate the reflection coefficients k r iω g a 0 y r 1 for k 0 h 1 ranging from 0 01 to π 10 that is 2d l 0 ranging from 0 1432 to 4 5 correspondingly where l 0 is incident wavelength and k 0 is the wavenumber using the present model in two cases of n 2 and n 3 respectively and the numerical results are plotted against 2d l 0 by solid line in fig 4 a d respectively along with the analytical solutions red circles obviously our numerical results are in good agreement with the analytical solutions and the peak value of reflection coefficient k r decreases while the slope of seabed tanβ increases next the present model is further validated against the analytical solution zeng et al 2017 for the two cases with n 2 and n 3 respectively together with h 1 4 m h 2 3 m w 120 m d 190 m and tanβ 1 1000 the related reflection coefficients are calculated for 0 1512 2d l 0 5 and the results are plotted in fig 5 a b it is shown in fig 5 that the present solutions solid lines are in good agreement with the analytical solutions red circles as expected the primary peak of bragg resonant reflection happens while incident wavelength is almost twice of the distance between two adjacent bars 2d l 0 1 and the reflection coefficients caused by 3 bars are obviously overall larger than the reflection coefficients caused by 2 bars 4 2 influence of permeability on bragg resonant reflection the real seabed is usually covered with different types of sediments such as gravel coarse sand fine sand and calcareous sand or with the ripped rock structures they have different permeability for examples mizutani and mostafa 1998 gave the permeability of the submerged breakwater and the coarse sandy seabed in their experiment zhou 2018 investigated the permeability of the ripped rock breakwater and the medium coarse sandy seabed in yantai port shandong province of china and ren et al 2018 studied the permeability of the calcareous sand with different diameters in the south china sea the relevant parameters are listed in table 1 in this subsection we will investigate the influence of permeability on bragg resonant reflection similarly we set h 1 4 m h 2 3 m w 90 m d 180 m tanβ 1 500 n 2 and let 2d l 0 vary from 0 1432 to 4 9647 we consider t 0 1 10 4 1 10 3 1 10 2 respectively by referencing table 1 note here the case of t 0 indicates an impermeable bottom the computational results are displayed in fig 6 it is easy to see that the primary peak of bragg resonant reflection happens when incident wavelength is almost twice of the distance between two adjacent bars that is l 0 2d for both impermeable and permeable bottom however the peak amplitude and the bandwidth of resonant zone decreases with the increase in permeability as wave energy is dissipated in permeable seabed and bars furthermore the secondary peaks of bragg resonant reflection happen in higher frequency and with the increase in the incident wave frequency the secondary peak amplitudes decrease and the influence of permeability on secondary peak amplitudes and the bandwidth of resonant zones is more obvious in addition it can be seen from table 2 that the permeability has no effect on the phase of the peak resonance 4 3 influence of the bar number on bragg resonant reflection for impermeable sinusoidal ripples guazzelli et al 1992 and bragg breakwaters such as trapezoidal bars chang and liou 2007 and rectangular bars hsu et al 2003 the results show that the peak amplitude of bragg resonant reflection increases and the bandwidth of resonant zone decreases with increasing the number of ripples or artificial bars for the purpose of studying the influence of the number of bars n on bragg resonant reflection over an array of same height rectangular porous bars located on sloping permeable seabed calculating parameters are given h 1 4 m h 2 3 m w 90 m d 180 m tanβ 1 1000 t 1 10 3 and 1 10 2 we let 2d l 0 vary from 0 1432 to 4 9647 and n vary from 1 to 5 the computational results are plotted in fig 7 similar phenomenon can be observed for the case of permeable breakwaters and seabed the peak amplitudes of bragg resonant reflection increase and the bandwidth of resonant zones decreases with increasing the number of rectangular bar number n 4 4 influence of the bar submergence on bragg resonant reflection the bar submergence is defined by s h 2 h 1 we fix that h 1 4 m w 90 m d 180 m tanβ 1 1000 n 2 t 1 10 3 and 1 10 2 and let 2d l 0 vary from 0 1432 to 4 9647 the bar submergence s takes four values 0 875 0 750 0 625 and 0 500 the reflection coefficients against 2d l 0 are calculated the results are shown in fig 8 from fig 8 it is found that while the bar submergence s decreases or in other words while the bar height increases the magnitude of bragg resonant reflection and the ability of wave energy dissipation increase meanwhile the primary peak bragg reflection shifts slightly toward low frequency in fact in the case of t 1 10 3 when the submergence decreases from s 0 875 to 0 500 the phase of the peak resonance shifts downward from 2d l 0 0 9712 to 2d l 0 0 7764 in the case of t 1 10 2 when the submergence decreases from s 0 875 to 0 500 the phase of the peak resonance also shifts downward from 2d l 0 0 9712 to 2d l 0 0 7764 according to liu et al 2020 this can be explained that the velocity of water waves is slower in shallower water with small submergence than in deeper water with large submergence 4 5 influence of the bar width on bragg resonant reflection in what follows we show the influence of the bar width on bragg resonant reflection let h 1 4 m h 2 3 m d 180 m tanβ 1 1000 and t 1 10 2 and let w d take 9 values 0 1 0 2 0 9 respectively the reflection coefficient k r against 2d l 0 for 2d l 0 varying from 0 1432 to 4 9647 is calculated by the present numerical model the results for n 2 are shown in fig 9 a b and the results for n 3 are shown in fig 9 c d it can be seen that for n 2 when the bar width increases from w d 0 1 to w d 0 5 the maximal peak amplitude of bragg resonance near 2d l 0 1 increases from 0 1 to 0 25 while when the bar width further increases from w d 0 5 to w d 0 9 the maximal peak amplitude of bragg resonance near 2d l 0 1 reversely decreases from 0 25 to 0 15 for n 3 when the bar width increases from w d 0 1 to w d 0 5 the maximal peak amplitude of bragg resonance near 2d l 0 1 increases from 0 12 to 0 31 while when the bar width further increases from w d 0 5 to w d 0 9 the maximal peak amplitude of bragg resonance near 2d l 0 1 reversely decreases from 0 31 to 0 15 this changing trend is totally same to the trend for trapezoidal bars observed by liu et al 2020 in their fig 9 this implies that there exists a particular value of the bar width that the magnitude of bragg resonant reflection will achieve its extreme value 4 6 influence of the slope of seabed on bragg resonant reflection finally we investigate the influence of the slope of seabed tanβ on bragg resonant reflection to this end we set h 1 4 m h 2 3 m w 90 m d 180 m n 2 and 3 t 0 0 005 and 0 01 and let 2d l 0 vary from 0 1432 to 4 9647 five different values 1 300 1 500 1 800 1 1000 and 0 are selected for tanβ when n 2 and four different values 1 500 1 800 1 1000 and 0 are selected for tanβ when n 3 the corresponding results are plotted in fig 10 which show that the peak bragg resonant reflection increases with decreasing the slope of seabed thus the bar height increases in addition as we can see in fig 10 a b in the case with the sea bottom is impermeable i e t 0 when tanβ 0 the sea bottom is flat and therefore symmetrical many zero reflections or complete transmissions occur while when tanβ 0 the sea bottom is sloping and therefore not symmetrical the phenomenon of zero reflection disappears this follows the rule that zero reflection occurs if and only if the sea bottom or the structure is symmetrical this rule was first proposed by xie et al 2011 and was later confirmed by many subsequent results such as xie and liu 2012 liu et al 2013a 2013b chakraborty and mandal 2014 medina rodríguez et al 2016 kar et al 2018 kaur et al 2019 and kar et al 2020 however as we can see in fig 10 c f for cases where the bottom is permeable i e t 0 005 and t 0 01 zero reflection does not exist regardless of the presence or absence of slopes that is regardless of whether the seabed is symmetrical or asymmetric this is due to the leakage of some wave energy from permeable sea bottom 5 conclusions the present model which extends the modified mild slope equation by introducing the permeable bottom boundary condition for waves propagating over porous seabed is derived using green s second identity it is computationally inexpensive and helpful in understanding the physical behavior of the phenomena and contains the bottom curvature and slope squared terms to account for rapidly varying topography the validity of the model is examined by employing the example of bragg resonant reflection by a series of impermeable rectangular bars on an impermeable slope the present solutions give a good agreement with a closed form analytical solution reported by zeng et al 2017 key parameters such as the permeability the bar number the bar height the bar distance and the slope of seabed affecting the amplitude of the peak bragg resonance are analyzed in detail the amplitude of the peak bragg increases with the increase in the bar number and the bar height it achieves the maximum value when the distance between two adjacent bars is a half of the incident wavelength however the peak bragg reflection decreases while the permeability increase in addition when the bottom is permeable zero reflection does not exist regardless of the presence or absence of slopes that is regardless of whether the seabed is symmetrical or asymmetric credit authorship contribution statement yun lin ni conceptualization methodology software

20466,in this paper the residual ultimate strength of stiffened box girder with coupled damage of pitting corrosion and a crack subjected to vertical bending moment was numerically investigated influences of the bending mode crack length angle and position as well as pit diameter depth and density on the strength reduction characteristics were discussed according to the finite element results the ultimate strength decreases significantly with the increase of crack length when it is located in the primarily compressed area or destroys the connection of the panel and stiffener corroded volume loss is also a critical factor leading to the linear decline of ultimate strength superimposed strength reduction as a result of the pit and crack as they exist independently almost equals to the reduction induced by the coupled damage indicting their effects can be simply composed four predictions as a function of actual projected crack lengths and corroded volume loss were proposed to assess the residual strength of the girder with coupled damage keywords residual ultimate strength stiffened box girder coupled damage vertical bending moment nonlinear finite element

crack 1 introduction a significant task in the ship design is to accurately predict the ultimate strength characteristics and maximum load carrying capacity of ship hull girder for avoiding catastrophic failure over the past decades the ultimate limit state uls approach has been widely employed in the task which is capable to assess truly the ship s safety vertical ultimate bending moment is usually viewed as one of the most important loads for the general vessel type on the other hand the aging ship may be inevitably suffered from various damages among them pitting corrosion and crack are the most dangerous imperfections significantly reducing the ultimate strength in this respect many scholars have numerically and experimentally dealt with the related behaviors influenced by the pit and crack paik et al 2003 proposed a simple formulation based on the smallest cross sectional area for the pitted plate damage tolerant design and residual strength evaluation by a comparison of various corrosion parameters nakai et al 2006 found the degree of pit intensity is an appropriate factor for evaluating the ultimate strength of plating elements ok et al 2007 analyzed influences of the size and transverse location of the pits and plate slenderness on the residual strength varying local random pits in their study artificial neural network method was used to establish a residual strength prediction it can be seen from huang et al 2010 jiang and soares 2012a 2012b zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017a and feng et al 2020a the corroded volume loss is a dominant parameter affecting the pitted plate s compressive capacity in addition to the slenderness sultana et al 2015 put forward that the ultimate strength reduction of unstiffened slender plate is greater compared to the stiffened for the same corrosion volume the nonlinear analysis result of wang et al 2018 presented a fact that locally amplified deformation occurs in the pitted area due to serious stress concentration and it may determine the failure modes of plating members zhang et al 2017b and shi et al 2018 performed experimental and numerical analyses on the ultimate limit state behaviors of compressive stiffened panel recently cui and wang 2020 carried out an investigation on the load carrying capacity of opening stiffened plate with perforation corrosion subjected to axial compression as for the girder with general corrosion saad eldeen et al 2011 2012 2013a 2013b examined the characteristics of ultimate strength and post collapse deformation of corroded stiffened box girder however there are few researches focusing on the residual strength of pitted hull girder it is indicated that more attentions can be paid to this respect in the future crack defect is commonly found in hull structures which may occur in a form of uncertain length and orientation angle in view of its detrimental effect on the structures some contributions with respect to the crack induced ultimate strength reduction studies have been made by a number of researchers paik et al 2005 and paik 2008 2009 investigated influences of transverse and longitudinal cracks on the residual strength of simply supported plate moreover cui et al 2016 undertook nonlinear finite element analyses to mainly check the plate ultimate compressive strength decreased by an inclined crack it was found that the projected length is an influential index for evaluating the strength babazadeh and khedmati 2019 proposed a concept of ultimate strength reduction rate derived from the strength s decreasing slope on the basic of the length of central transverse crack aspect ratio and slenderness some empirical equations were established by them to predict the cracked plate ultimate strength in the aspect of cracked stiffened panels margaritis and toulios 2012 bayatfar et al 2014 xu et al 2014 rahbar ranji and zarookian 2014 cui et al 2017 yu et al 2018 and shi et al 2019 have numerically dealt with the ultimate strength and collapse laws varying the geometric parameters of crack and panel additionally a test result on the residual strength of stiffened plate subjected to compression was presented in shi et al 2017 for the cracked girder shi and wang 2012a calculated the residual ultimate torsional strength of transversely cracked box girder using finite element method an opening box girder with transverse crack was also taken into account by them in shi and wang 2012b in which compression pure torque bending moment and their combined loads were respectively implemented on the girder they suggested simple strength equations for both kinds of the girders in addition to the above transverse crack hu et al 2018 also revealed the influences of longitudinal and inclined cracks on the ultimate strength of an opening box girder under torsion and bending loads ao and wang 2016 performed numerical analyses to identify the ultimate torsional strength characteristics of opening stiffened box girder with a transverse crack gao et al 2012 derived an equation for assessing the residual ultimate bending moment of cracked container ship it is clear that the mentioned investigations focused on independently pitted or cracked hull structures there is a lack of references accounting for the influence of coupled pitting corrosion and crack damage the crack may be initiated in local corrosion pit and propagated due to stress concentration and repeated loading in such situation the coupled damage has more considerable effect on the safety of hull girder the authors have researched the ultimate strength of ship plate with coupled damage feng et al 2020b the present study is a continuous work in which residual strength of a stiffened box girder subjected to coupled damage was numerically investigated influences of the pit size depth density and corrosion volume bending mode as well as crack length angle and location on the ultimate bending moment were discussed by series of elastic plastic large deformation analyses four empirical formulations as a function of crack s actual projected lengths and corroded volume loss were suggested for evaluating the residual strength of stiffened box girder 2 description of stiffened box girder with coupled damage a symmetrical stiffened box girder namely mst 3 with thickness t 3 05 mm proposed by nishihara 1983 is selected as the investigated model in this paper fig 1 a and b show the dimensions of the panel stiffener and transverse frame as shown that the girder consists of 1 2 1 1 2 bays in longitudinal direction for preventing the boundary effect of the two loading ends the actual pitted hull girder is so complex that leading to there is few researches on its residual strength saad eldeen et al 2011 have conducted an ultimate strength experiment of a box girder in which the deck bottom and side were all severely corroded in accordance with their study the double sided corrosion pits are assumed to be uniformly distributed on all panels for preliminarily addressing the residual strength of stiffened box girder similar to paik et al 2003 huang et al 2010 as well as jiang and soares 2012b the pits are all assumed to be cylindrical with the same depth and diameter through thickness crack initiates in the pit is placed on the bottom and side plates fig 1 c describes the length angle and position of the bottom side crack indexes 2c θ and e 2csinθ represent the crack length angle and projected length in longitudinal direction respectively parameters s and h are individually the transverse vertical and longitudinal distances from crack center to bottom side plate center it should be mentioned that the crack width is taken into account to be 3 mm and its tip shape is considered to be a semicircle with 1 5 mm radius xia et al 2019 suggested that for the same crack length effects of the directly prefabricated crack and that obtained by gradual propagation on the plate ultimate strength are almost identical therefore crack propagation related to fracture mechanics problem is not a considered factor in the study in order to solve this problem the crack length is increased in different degrees the boundary and loading conditions are implemented on the two centers of girder ends using multi point constraints mpc their degrees of freedom are restrained as front center ux uy uz urx 0 back center uy uz urx 0 two opposite rotation displacements ury with a same absolute value are applied on the centers under hogging and sagging bending loads the employed material properties are as follows elastic modulus e 2 11e5 mpa poisson s ratio υ 0 277 yield stress σ y 293 mpa wang et al 2020a 2020b clearly showed that the numerical result of ultimate torsional strength of an ultra large container ship without regarding the hardening effect agrees well with the experiment result for conservatism and achieving better convergence during the fe simulations the material is presumed to be perfectly elastic plastic the studied cases are summarized in table 1 including the bending mode pitting and cracking parameters the sign dop denotes the pit density defined by a corrosion a panel and t r t the relative pit depth as for the crack parameters 2c a and h a respectively denote the relative length and longitudinal position of the bottom and side cracks s b and s d the relative transverse position of the bottom crack and relative vertical position of the side crack according to the model symmetry the values of s b and s d are set to be equal for economizing analysis cost in addition the reason for the selection of h a values is the same with above it should be declared that the crack length is determined according to the girder length 540 mm which is smaller than the depth 720 mm so that the s b or s d values reach a larger optional range three kinds of cracks are investigated in the present study namely longitudinal θ 0 inclined θ 45 and transverse vertical θ 90 when the values of h a and s b or s d both equal to 0 the crack center coincides with the bottom side plate center if the crack moves toward the transverse frame and side deck plate the relative positions will all develop as can be examined in the table and fig 1 c values of h a under various angles are the same and so is the case of s b or s d but for the cracks with different 2c a values which are closest to the side deck the values of s b or s d are varying some examples of the crack s transverse and vertical positions can be seen in fig 2 and fig 3 when s b s d 0 0 25 the crack centers are located at the intersections of the panels and stiffeners when s b s d 0 125 they are positioned at the middle between the two stiffeners when s b or s d values are maximum under various 2c a transverse vertical cracks tips respectively reaches the side and deck panels cracks may appear in the stress concentration areas such as welding joint and corrosion pit paik et al 2005 xu et al 2014 cui et al 2016 the listed crack relative positions in table 1 may provide a comprehensive insight of their influence on the ultimate strength of stiffened box girder 3 initial imperfection modeling initial imperfections tend to be induced in the fabrication process and may significantly decrease the ultimate strength of hull structures in the present study only initial deformation is considered and the welding residual stress is not included because influence of initial deformation is much more considerable according to the references cui et al 2016 cui et al 2017 and hu et al 2018 the presumed initial deflection shapes are taken from zhang and khan 2009 which consist of the local and global modes for the panel and stiffener see eqs 1 and 2 the signs of w p and w w are respectively the total initial deformations amplitudes of the panel and stiffener besides a b and h w are the panel length panel width and stiffener web height the parameter m shown in the equations represents the half wave number of the local deformation in longitudinal direction and n in vertical direction it is well recognized that the value of n is frequently equal to 1 the value of m is a b if it is equal to an integer in other situations m is determined by the minimum integer satisfying eq 3 xu et al 2014 fig 4 shows an example of the initial deformation of coupled damaged box girder which will be introduced into the ultimate strength analysis by editing the model key word the deformation is generated by perpendicularly applying the displacements on all panels and stiffeners which is defined by eqs 1 and 2 using a method of abaqus software s field displacement a noticeable fact should be illustrated is that the above equations are applicable to the bottom plates since the coordinate origin is at the bottom for the deck and side they have to be changed by coordinate conversion 1 w p b 200 cos m π x a sin n π y b a 1000 cos π x a sin π y b 2 w w h w 200 cos m π x a sin n π z h w z a 1000 h w cos π x a 3 a b m m 1 4 sensitivity analysis and model validation there are a number of element types in abaqus software such as s3r s4r c3d8r and so on which can be used to simulate the thin wall structures however due to the constant stress and strain field in the s3r element which is a triangular element it requires very fined grid when employing this element to solve bending deflection problem so that the structure s stress and strain can be accurately calculated as for the c3d8r element although it can precisely deal with the above problem high computational cost and poor convergence due to the complicated finite element model may inevitably appear in comparison the s4r element which is a four node shell element with six degrees for each node can overcome the weaknesses of the above mentioned elements when solving the problem of large bending deformation of structures such as ship hull girder complete integration may result in shear locking phenomenon and unsatisfied accuracy compared to that reduction integration adopted in the s4r element can address this drawback by comprehensive consideration the s4r element is employed in the numerical simulation before series analyses of the ultimate bending moment model validation should be implemented to check the reliability of numerical results nishihara s experimental research on the ultimate strength of three stiffened box girders subjected to sagging bending moment are viewed as the standard for the finite fe model of this paper the cross sectional dimensions of these girders namely mst 3 mst 4 and msd are shown in fig 5 in numerical simulation the lengths of mst 4 and msd are equal to that of mst 3 as demonstrated before in order to achieve precise fe result the girders are meshed by a refined size 10 mm table 2 presents the ultimate bending moment comparison between the present study and nishihara 1983 obviously the small relative errors indicate that the reliability of fe model can be proved the pit density dop and relative pit depth t r t have been selected in the previous section yet its size which may interfere the result has not been chosen in the case of platting elements diameter s influence on the ultimate compressive strength can be ignored the correctness of this conclusion for the girder should be discussed through some numerical results fig 6 demonstrates moment angle curves for three diameters under sagging bending load it is clear the moment under two bending loads should be the same due to the model symmetry as can be seen that their influences on the ultimate bending moment i e the peak value are small and can be neglected apparently the diameter 15 mm may require more computing costs in order to reduce the costs 25 mm is selected as the pit diameter in the following analyses for accurately predicting the residual strength of the damaged girder fine meshes should be employed in the girder especially in the pitting and cracking regions but at the same time too small size undoubtedly and significantly increases the computing cost so a balance between the cost and accuracy have to be determined table 3 gives the ultimate bending moment of the girder with coupled damage under sagging bending varying the mesh sizes of different regions fig 7 describes the girder with three grid densities through a general view and a detail view of the coupled damaged area and the others it is observed in table 3 that with reducing the mesh size the residual strength has converged as can be seen from the relative error s variation considering the mentioned balance middle size is used to mesh the damaged girder 5 results and discussions in this chapter influences of the pit depth density and corroded volume loss bending mode as well as crack length angle and location are discussed based on a larger number of finite element results derived from the analyses of abaqus software in which arc length method is employed to solve the non linear equation series curves of bending moment versus rotation angle and ultimate bending moment reduction factor as well as equivalent stress distributions are demonstrated to identify the limit state behaviors and failure modes of coupled damaged box girder in order to compare the superimposed influence of the pit and crack when they appear independently and their coupled influence when they coexist ultimate bending moment values of the girders with coupled damage and single damage are both studied 5 1 influence of pitting corrosion 5 1 1 pit depth and density in order to analyze the influence mechanism of corrosion pit on the ultimate strength the model with only crack defect is taken as the reference fig 8 illustrates the moment angle curves of the girder with only a bottom crack and coupled damage varying the pit depth under hogging bending load longitudinal and transverse cracks in the case of dop 6 19 2c a 0 35 h a s b 0 are taken into account in the figure as can be seen in the red box besides fig 9 shows the curves for the case of side crack where the girder is subjected to sagging bending moment and the crack center is located at the intersection of the side panel and upper stiffener it is interesting that the regions around the cracks in these models are compressed as the girder is bending from the figures demonstration ultimate bending moment of the coupled damaged girder is declined with increasing the pit depth compared to the girder with only crack defect although the curve peak may be various due to the crack consistent reduction scale can be observed by comparing fig 8 a and b as well as fig 9 a and b furthermore small decreases occur for the initial stiffness and the rotation angle at the ultimate limit state uls indicating the pitting has some influences on the girder s mechanical property fig 10 a and b display the ultimate bending moment reduction factor m u m uc changing with the pitting parameters dop and t r t for the circumstances of longitudinal and transverse vertical cracks respectively decline of the ultimate strength can be clearly observed by these line charts symbols m u and m uc on the ordinate denote the ultimate bending moment values of the girder with coupled damage and the simply cracked one similar to previous analysis effects of the bottom and side cracks on the pitting influence mechanism are included in the charts as can be seen that for the cracks with θ 0 and θ 90 the factor decreases with the developments of dop and t r t moreover a linear relationship between m u m uc and t r t is illustrated for the two pit densities however the crack angle has little effect on the trend of m u m uc these findings are consistent with the results obtained in figs 8 and 9 according to fig 10 it can be also found that the reduction factor as a result of the bottom crack is smaller than the side crack this may be due to the coupled damage of pitting and bottom crack has greater impact on the girder s ultimate strength whereas significant gap does not appear in the two groups fig 11 and fig 12 depict the equivalent stress distributions and failure modes of coupled damaged girder at the uls respectively varying the pit depth and density the former girders in fig 11 collapse due to hogging and the latter in fig 12 failure because of sagging it is observed that with the increases of t r t and dop stress concentration of the pitting areas becomes more and more serious especially for the bottom and deck which are the main parts bearing the bending loading obviously pitting will reduce the girder s cross sectional area and volume leading to the drop of the ultimate strength another phenomenon can be found from the pictures is that the pitting has little effect on the failure of cracking zone which may be able to answer why similar ultimate strength reduction appear in fig 10 5 1 2 influence of corroded volume loss some scholars such as jiang and soares 2012b zhang et al 2016 and shi et al 2018 have suggested that corroded volume loss is a useful parameter employed to calculate the ultimate compressive strength of unstiffened and stiffened pitted panels for the stiffened box girder this variable is also applicable as shown in fig 13 five groups of the ultimate bending moment reduction factor are plotted for the purpose of better comparison result of the girder with only corrosion namely m up m u0 is also presented m up and m u0 are respectively the ultimate bending moment of purely corroded girder and intact one it should be explained that the data points of m u m uc are derived from fig 10 besides the relative corroded volume loss δv v 0 is equal to the product of dop and t r t it is evident that reduction factors m up m u0 and m u m uc both drop linearly negligible difference between corroded and coupled groups proves a fitted regression equation which is shown in the figure can be applied on evaluating the residual ultimate strength of singly pitted girder and coupled damaged one provided m u0 and m uc are previously achieved wang et al 2008 have conducted a statistical investigation with respect to the time variant strength of aging corroded ships and found that it varies from 4 to 20 it is evident that the decrease proportion of ultimate strength of pitted box girder in this paper is consistent with the above characteristic therefore the fitted equation shown in fig 13 may provide some insight to evaluate the residual strength of aging ship hull girder 5 2 influence of bottom crack 5 2 1 bending mode fig 14 a and b separately describe the moment angle curves of singly corroded girder and that with coupled damage under s b 0 and 0 125 in this situation the crack centers are located at the middle stiffener and between the two stiffeners respectively the corroded curves shown in the pictures represent the moment angle relationship of the girder with only pitting defect it is observed that for different crack angles and transverse positions the ultimate bending moment reduction in hogging condition is generally more considerable than the sagging condition comparing the figures it can be also concluded that for hogging condition the ultimate bending moment reduces as the crack angle increases except for the longitudinal crack with s b 0 which also has significant effect although the crack causes the same cross sectional area reduction of the bottom plate stress states around the cracking regions under various bending modes are different buckling failure occurs at the bottom when the girder is subjected to hogging bending on the contrary yield failure occurs when sagging loading is applied on the model it s not difficult to understand the crack which enhances the post bucking has more significant effect on the ultimate strength as the bottom is compressed in order to reveal the effect of bending mode on the ultimate strength in depth fig 15 shows the equivalent stress distributions and failure modes of damaged girder subjected to hogging and sagging as can be observed from fig 15 a larger deformation appears for the longitudinally cracked girder in hogging condition especially in the cracking area longitudinal crack located under the stiffener greatly weakens the connection of the plate and stiffener leading to a sharp decline of bearing capacity in comparison longitudinal crack has no effect on the yield failure of bottom plate in sagging condition see fig 15 b besides as shown in fig 15 c and d stress distributions of the panels at bottom plate are seriously changed by the transverse cracks projected areas of the crack can t effectively resist the compressive or tensile loads however crack s impact on the girder in hogging condition is more serious than the case of sagging this phenomenon is consistent with the above characteristics fig 16 illustrates the ultimate bending moment reduction factor m u m up in which influences of hogging and sagging can be distinctly compared it is obviously observed that in sagging condition the decline of m u m up is much smaller than that of hogging for different crack angles in addition similar descent feature is demonstrated in fig 16 a and b excluding the case of θ 0 in hogging condition in view of the influence of hogging condition is much more remarkable this bending mode is therefore only considered for the bottom crack in the following analyses 5 2 2 crack s longitudinal position for the sake of thoroughly investigating the influence of crack s longitudinal position on the ultimate strength two variables θ and s b are also included in the discussion of this section fig 17 a and b respectively present the reduction factor m u m up varying the relative longitudinal position h a in the case of s b 0 and s b 0 36875 from the figures shown longitudinal position has little effect on the reduction factor fig 18 depicts the membrane stress distributions of damaged girder under hogging bending moment at the uls when the longitudinal crack moves toward the transverse frame stress distribution is hardly changed it can be also found that this kind of crack located between the stiffener and side panel has negligible influence on the failure mode consequently the related ultimate bending moment shown in fig 17 b decreases to a small degree as for the transverse crack when it approaches to the frame although the stress and distribution of the regions around it are influenced the residual cross sectional area is constant so the ultimate strength is also hardly changed in the following discussion for the bottom crack longitudinal position is also neglected and only h a 0 is considered 5 2 3 crack s transverse position fig 19 shows the reduction factor m u m up varying the relative transverse position s b three crack lengths and angles are taken into account for comparatively analyzing the influence of discussed parameter in this section it is observed from fig 19 a that longitudinal cracks under the two stiffeners i e s b 0 and 0 25 have significant influences on the reduction factor declines of m u m up are very close for these transverse positions in the case of other transverse positions effects of the longitudinal cracks can be ignored fig 19 b and c indicate that if the crack is inclined or transverse the reduction factor is changed slightly for different s b values the reason for the fluctuation may be the intersection of the crack and stiffener or side plate if crack crosses below the stiffener or side plate their performance of bearing compression will be degraded resulting in the ultimate strength reduction 5 2 4 crack s length and angle as discussed before influences of transverse and inclined cracks as well as longitudinal ones located under the stiffeners are much more significant and should be taken into account ultimate bending moment characteristics affected by their sizes are analyzed in the present section they are separated into two types namely longitudinal and transverse inclined according to the previously illustrated laws for longitudinal crack the actual length is a key factor influencing the ultimate strength for transverse and inclined cracks the influential factor should be the projected length because it decreases the cross sectional area fig 20 a gives the m u m up characteristic varying the relative actual length 2c a of longitudinal crack two transverse positions s b 0 and s b 0 25 are both included in the figure it is observed that their results are almost the same with increasing the crack length the factor m u m up is significantly declined in the case of small length i e 2c a 0 2 sharp reduction has already occurred in order to better fitting the points a polynomial is selected as the equation the descent behaviors of m u m up affected by the relative projected length e a of transverse or inclined crack are given in fig 20 b as shown in the figure the reduction factor is also declined when developing the value of e a moreover a linear feature is clearly presented in the result it should be pointed out that transverse location of the crack which is closest to the side is varying due to its length for facilitating the investigation a mean value derived from s b values of three crack lengths is given in fig 20 b i e 0 36875 for different transverse positions m u m up value is varying in a small range reduction factors of four groups are averaged by a fitted straight line to reduce the errors 5 3 influence of side crack 5 3 1 bending mode similar to the bottom crack side crack may also affect the stress state resulting in the variation of ultimate strength in order to examine this phenomenon two crack vertical positions i e s d 0 25 and 0 3125 are selected to present the changes of ultimate strength fig 21 shows the moment angle relationship of the girder with only pitting corrosion and the coupled damaged one in the case of 2c a 0 5 dop 6 19 and t r t 0 5 it is seen that the crack alters the loading path of the pitted girder in sagging condition and the ultimate bending moment is reduced on the contrary the crack in hogging condition has little effect on the ultimate strength for sagging mode it can be also known that the ultimate bending moment demonstrates various behaviors for different crack angles specifically the moment decreases with increasing the parameters θ and s d except for the case of θ 0 and s d 0 25 the longitudinal crack coincides with the stiffener weld does greater change for the ultimate strength than the inclined crack fig 22 depicts the failure modes of coupled damaged girders at the uls it should be pointed out that the longitudinal cracks in fig 22 a and b coincide with the stiffener welds as can be observed that the buckling phenomenon in compression areas is much more serious than the yield phenomenon in tensile areas girder failure is featured as the buckling collapse the upper part of side plate makes a contribution to resist the compressive load while the other regions of the side almost have no effect on resisting the tension from fig 22 a shown large deformation is induced around the crack which destroys the connection of the panel and stiffener the ultimate strength is therefore reduced to a noticeable degree a fact can be found in fig 22 c is that the vertical crack which decreases the compressed area also leads to a significant strength reduction value but the cracks have little influence on the failure modes in hogging condition see fig 22 b and d fig 23 illustrates the ultimate bending moment reduction factor m u m up changing with the crack angle under hogging and sagging bending loads in which the characteristic is clearly presented as shown that m u m up of hogging mode is almost equal to 1 for different crack angles and positions indicting influence of this bending mode is very small when the crack is on the upper side for sagging condition the ultimate bending moment is decreased to a greater extent it is not difficult to understand hogging condition s effect can be ignored according to the analyses thus only sagging is accounted for in the subsequent discussions of side crack s influence 5 3 2 crack s longitudinal position fig 24 shows the reduction factor m u m up varying the crack s longitudinal position at 2c a 0 35 different crack angles in the case of s d 0 and s d 0 36875 are taken into account as can be seen that whether for the crack located at the neutral plane or the crack which is close to the deck the m u m up tendency presents no obvious change the reason is consistent with the circumstance of bottom crack although the crack moves in the longitudinal direction the residual cross sectional area remain constant so the ultimate strength is hardly interfered for simplicity influence of longitudinal position is not included in the following analyses and only h a 0 is considered 5 3 3 crack s vertical position fig 25 presents the variations of reduction factor changing with the vertical position under different crack lengths and angles it can be seen from fig 25 a that when the s d value is less than 0 25 no change of m u m up occurs when it is equal to 0 25 m u m up decreases with the crack length when it is greater than 0 25 the change of m u m up is small for the vertical and inclined cracks observation derived from fig 25 b and c indicates that the ultimate bending moment is reduced as increasing the value of s d fig 26 depicts the failure modes at the uls varying the crack s vertical position under θ 0 and θ 90 when the centers of longitudinal and vertical cracks are placed in girder s neutral plane as shown in fig 26 a and c the failure modes of the side plates are little affected leading to quite small changes of the residual strength when the longitudinal crack is located between the deck and top stiffener its influence on the failure mode is also slight see fig 26 b but if the crack is vertical or inclined and also nears the deck the failure mode of side plate is seriously changed as shown in fig 26 d obviously compressive stress is increased with the distance from neutral axis to the deck vertical or inclined cracks within this distance alter the stress and therefore significantly reduce the ultimate strength 5 3 4 crack s length and angle according to previous discussions it is evident that influences of vertical and inclined cracks as well as longitudinal cracks at s d 0 25 on the ultimate strength are more significant whereas other longitudinal cracks can be ignored for simplicity fig 27 a illustrates the m u m up values varying the actual relative length 2c a of longitudinal crack as shown in the figure the reduction factor is decreased with the crack length becomes bigger a linear relationship clearly exists between m u m up and 2c a and the relevant descent slope is 0 1 fig 27 b presents the variation of reduction factor m u m up changing with relative projected length e a of inclined vertical crack for different vertical positions as can be seen that the m u m up value is declined by the relative projected length in the case of s d 0 a linear relationship is also exhibited between m u m up and e a furthermore the descent slope of fitted line increases with the s d value fig 28 gives the fitted curve and corresponding equation of the descent slope a s d which demonstrates a nonlinear characteristic 5 4 joint influence of pitting corrosion and crack effects of the pitting corrosion and crack have been separately analyzed in previous discussions parameters of corroded volume loss and crack length have been found to be the key factors reducing the girder ultimate strength on the contrary their joint influences are investigated in the this section to compare the coupled influence of the two kinds of damages as they coexist and the superimposed influence as they exist independently fig 29 and fig 30 depict the ultimate bending moment reduction rate changing with the relative corroded volume loss for different bottom and side cracks for the purpose of comparison transverse position s b 0 of bottom crack and vertical position s d 0 25 of side crack are taken into account besides all lengths of longitudinal and transverse vertical cracks are included in the analyses the signs δm 1 and δm 2 in the ordinate are respectively the rates which represent the coupled influence and superimposed influence of the pitting and crack as defined in eq 4 and eq 5 where m u0 denotes the ultimate bending moment of intact girder as can be seen from the figures δm 1 and δm 2 increase linearly with δv v 0 in the case of different 2c a values another characteristic is that superimposed influence is generally lager than the coupled influence the authors paper feng et al 2020b has suggested that the superposed influence of pitting corrosion and crack on the plate ultimate compressive strength is more significant than their coupled influence which behavior is consistent with the conclusion of the present study however in the case of transverse crack difference of the superposed influence and coupled influence on the plate is clearly more remarkable the reason may be the crack size relative to the plate width is much larger than that relative to the circumference of box girder s cross section leading to the pits in the crack s projected region have little effect on the ultimate strength it is observed from figs 29 and 30 that for bottom and side cracks under θ 0 and θ 90 relative errors of the two rates are both small indicating their effects and influence of the pitting corrosion can be simply combined in order to further prove the recognition figs 31 and 32 depicts the equivalent stress distributions and failure modes of the girders with single crack or pitting corrosion and their coupled damage the failure mode of the girder with coupled damage can be viewed as the superposition of that with single defect 4 δ m 1 m u 0 m u m u 0 100 5 δ m 2 m u 0 m u c m u 0 m u p m u 0 100 6 empirical formulations for predicting the residual ultimate strength of stiffened box girder with coupled damage 6 1 bottom crack in comparison to sagging condition influence of the bottom crack on the ultimate strength of coupled damaged box girder subjected to hogging bending moment is much more significant as discussed before additionally for hogging condition impacts of transverse inclined crack and longitudinal crack located under the stiffeners i e s b 0 and 0 25 should be paid attention to longitudinal cracks between two stiffeners or stiffener and side panel can be ignored but pitting corrosion in this situation must be taken into account considering the above influential factors two empirical formulas are established for predicting the ultimate bending moment of coupled damaged box girder subjected to hogging bending load see eq 6 and eq 7 they are respectively applicable to transverse inclined and longitudinal bottom cracks it has been pointed out in section 5 4 that independent influences of the crack and pitting corrosion can be simply superposed for the girder therefore these formulations are linearly combined on the basic of the fitted equations shown in figs 13 and 20 it must be declared that for crack s longitudinal position only the case of h a 0 is considered in these predictions because effect of this variable can be ignored 6 m u m u 0 1 0 76 2 c a 0 93 2 c a 2 1 79 δ v v 0 s b 0 0 25 1 1 79 δ v v 0 s b 0 0 25 7 m u m u 0 1 0 346 e a 1 79 δ v v 0 in order to examine the effectiveness of the proposed formulations fig 33 and fig 34 show the ultimate bending moment reduction factor s comparison between the formulas and finite element method as well as the corresponding error distributions as illustrated in figs 33 a and fig 34 a the points are evenly distributed around the symmetrical lines the values of mean and cov indicate the two results both have great agreements in which mean represents the average value of the ratios of formula results to numerical results moreover error distributions shown in figs 33 b and fig 34 b can further prove the formulas can accurately assess the residual strength of stiffened box girder with coupled damage in the case of bottom crack 6 2 side crack unlike the bottom crack influence of the side crack which is above the neutral axis on the ultimate strength of coupled damaged girder under sagging bending load has been identified to be considerable than the case of hogging condition therefore sagging is therefore only considered in the following empirical formulations besides vertical and inclined cracks longitudinal cracks with s d 0 25 have important effects the remaining longitudinal cracks at s d 0 25 are able to be neglected but pitting corrosion must be also taken into account based on the regression equations illustrated in fig 13 and figs 27 and 28 two formulations with respect to the residual ultimate strength of coupled damaged girder are respectively suggested for longitudinal crack and vertical inclined crack it can be observed that influences of the side crack and pitting are also linearly composed in the equations similarly the longitudinal position i e h a 0 is also only taken into account 8 m u m u 0 1 0 1 2 c a 1 79 δ v v 0 s d 0 25 1 1 79 δ v v 0 s d 0 25 9 m u m u 0 1 a s d e a 1 79 δ v v 0 fig 35 a and fig 36 a illustrate the comparison of m u m u0 between the formulas and fem it is evident from the points distribution and the values of mean and cov that the formula and numerical results also presented a good correlation figs 35 b and fig 36 b show the relative error distributions between the two formulas and numerical method it is clear that the differences of these predictions are small indicating their reliability and accuracy can be proved therefore eqs 8 and 9 can also precisely evaluate the residual ultimate strength of stiffened box girder with coupled damage in the case of side crack 7 conclusion series of elastic plastic large deformation analyses were carried out in this paper by using abaqus software to deal with the residual ultimate strength behaviors of a symmetrical stiffened box girder with coupled pitting and crack damage subjected to vertical bending moment effects of the pit size depth density and corrosion volume bending mode as well as crack length angle and location on the strength were discussed according to the finite element results some conclusions which may provide useful insights for the residual ultimate strength evaluation of aging ship hull structures can be drawn 1 for the same pit depth and density diameter of the pitting has little effect on the ultimate strength with increasing the pit depth and density ultimate bending moment is reduced linearly also the existence of bottom or side crack has slight effect on the reduction variation similar to unstiffened and stiffened panels corroded volume loss is a key factor to evaluate the pit s influence on the box girder ultimate strength a linear relationship between the loss and residual strength was proposed 2 for the bottom crack the ultimate bending moment of the girder in hogging condition is much smaller than sagging condition because the buckling of the bottom is enhanced by the crack influences of crack parameters were therefore investigated for the hogging mode it was found that the projected lengths of transverse and inclined cracks as well as the actual length of longitudinal crack located under the stiffener are of importance affecting the ultimate strength but influences of their transverse positions are slight and therefore can be averaged for simplicity besides longitudinal crack between the two stiffeners or stiffener and side shell is negligible even when it is longer crack s longitudinal position almost has no impact on the strength variation for different crack angles 3 for the side crack which is above the neutral plane ultimate strength reduction in the case of sagging condition is much more remarkable than hogging condition so sagging mode was studied in detail to find out the crack s influence characteristics when the crack is vertical or inclined its projected length is a key factor decreasing the strength with a linear feature besides as it moves toward the deck the descent slope becomes greater when the crack is longitudinally coincided with the weld line of the top stiffener the strength is also linearly decreased by the actual length as for the other longitudinal cracks and longitudinal positions of cracks with different angles their influences are so small that can be ignored 4 generally superimposed ultimate strength reduction of the girder with single crack or pitting corrosion is slightly larger than the reduction value induced by the coupled damage but the difference between them can be ignored it is indicated that influence of the crack and pitting can be simply superimposed four empirical formulas were therefore respectively linearly composed based on the fitted equations as a function of crack s actual projected lengths and corroded volume loss they can be used to precisely evaluate the residual ultimate strength of stiffened box girder with coupled damage under vertical

20466,in this paper the residual ultimate strength of stiffened box girder with coupled damage of pitting corrosion and a crack subjected to vertical bending moment was numerically investigated influences of the bending mode crack length angle and position as well as pit diameter depth and density on the strength reduction characteristics were discussed according to the finite element results the ultimate strength decreases significantly with the increase of crack length when it is located in the primarily compressed area or destroys the connection of the panel and stiffener corroded volume loss is also a critical factor leading to the linear decline of ultimate strength superimposed strength reduction as a result of the pit and crack as they exist independently almost equals to the reduction induced by the coupled damage indicting their effects can be simply composed four predictions as a function of actual projected crack lengths and corroded volume loss were proposed to assess the residual strength of the girder with coupled damage keywords residual ultimate strength stiffened box girder coupled damage vertical bending moment nonlinear finite element

crack 1 introduction a significant task in the ship design is to accurately predict the ultimate strength characteristics and maximum load carrying capacity of ship hull girder for avoiding catastrophic failure over the past decades the ultimate limit state uls approach has been widely employed in the task which is capable to assess truly the ship s safety vertical ultimate bending moment is usually viewed as one of the most important loads for the general vessel type on the other hand the aging ship may be inevitably suffered from various damages among them pitting corrosion and crack are the most dangerous imperfections significantly reducing the ultimate strength in this respect many scholars have numerically and experimentally dealt with the related behaviors influenced by the pit and crack paik et al 2003 proposed a simple formulation based on the smallest cross sectional area for the pitted plate damage tolerant design and residual strength evaluation by a comparison of various corrosion parameters nakai et al 2006 found the degree of pit intensity is an appropriate factor for evaluating the ultimate strength of plating elements ok et al 2007 analyzed influences of the size and transverse location of the pits and plate slenderness on the residual strength varying local random pits in their study artificial neural network method was used to establish a residual strength prediction it can be seen from huang et al 2010 jiang and soares 2012a 2012b zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017a and feng et al 2020a the corroded volume loss is a dominant parameter affecting the pitted plate s compressive capacity in addition to the slenderness sultana et al 2015 put forward that the ultimate strength reduction of unstiffened slender plate is greater compared to the stiffened for the same corrosion volume the nonlinear analysis result of wang et al 2018 presented a fact that locally amplified deformation occurs in the pitted area due to serious stress concentration and it may determine the failure modes of plating members zhang et al 2017b and shi et al 2018 performed experimental and numerical analyses on the ultimate limit state behaviors of compressive stiffened panel recently cui and wang 2020 carried out an investigation on the load carrying capacity of opening stiffened plate with perforation corrosion subjected to axial compression as for the girder with general corrosion saad eldeen et al 2011 2012 2013a 2013b examined the characteristics of ultimate strength and post collapse deformation of corroded stiffened box girder however there are few researches focusing on the residual strength of pitted hull girder it is indicated that more attentions can be paid to this respect in the future crack defect is commonly found in hull structures which may occur in a form of uncertain length and orientation angle in view of its detrimental effect on the structures some contributions with respect to the crack induced ultimate strength reduction studies have been made by a number of researchers paik et al 2005 and paik 2008 2009 investigated influences of transverse and longitudinal cracks on the residual strength of simply supported plate moreover cui et al 2016 undertook nonlinear finite element analyses to mainly check the plate ultimate compressive strength decreased by an inclined crack it was found that the projected length is an influential index for evaluating the strength babazadeh and khedmati 2019 proposed a concept of ultimate strength reduction rate derived from the strength s decreasing slope on the basic of the length of central transverse crack aspect ratio and slenderness some empirical equations were established by them to predict the cracked plate ultimate strength in the aspect of cracked stiffened panels margaritis and toulios 2012 bayatfar et al 2014 xu et al 2014 rahbar ranji and zarookian 2014 cui et al 2017 yu et al 2018 and shi et al 2019 have numerically dealt with the ultimate strength and collapse laws varying the geometric parameters of crack and panel additionally a test result on the residual strength of stiffened plate subjected to compression was presented in shi et al 2017 for the cracked girder shi and wang 2012a calculated the residual ultimate torsional strength of transversely cracked box girder using finite element method an opening box girder with transverse crack was also taken into account by them in shi and wang 2012b in which compression pure torque bending moment and their combined loads were respectively implemented on the girder they suggested simple strength equations for both kinds of the girders in addition to the above transverse crack hu et al 2018 also revealed the influences of longitudinal and inclined cracks on the ultimate strength of an opening box girder under torsion and bending loads ao and wang 2016 performed numerical analyses to identify the ultimate torsional strength characteristics of opening stiffened box girder with a transverse crack gao et al 2012 derived an equation for assessing the residual ultimate bending moment of cracked container ship it is clear that the mentioned investigations focused on independently pitted or cracked hull structures there is a lack of references accounting for the influence of coupled pitting corrosion and crack damage the crack may be initiated in local corrosion pit and propagated due to stress concentration and repeated loading in such situation the coupled damage has more considerable effect on the safety of hull girder the authors have researched the ultimate strength of ship plate with coupled damage feng et al 2020b the present study is a continuous work in which residual strength of a stiffened box girder subjected to coupled damage was numerically investigated influences of the pit size depth density and corrosion volume bending mode as well as crack length angle and location on the ultimate bending moment were discussed by series of elastic plastic large deformation analyses four empirical formulations as a function of crack s actual projected lengths and corroded volume loss were suggested for evaluating the residual strength of stiffened box girder 2 description of stiffened box girder with coupled damage a symmetrical stiffened box girder namely mst 3 with thickness t 3 05 mm proposed by nishihara 1983 is selected as the investigated model in this paper fig 1 a and b show the dimensions of the panel stiffener and transverse frame as shown that the girder consists of 1 2 1 1 2 bays in longitudinal direction for preventing the boundary effect of the two loading ends the actual pitted hull girder is so complex that leading to there is few researches on its residual strength saad eldeen et al 2011 have conducted an ultimate strength experiment of a box girder in which the deck bottom and side were all severely corroded in accordance with their study the double sided corrosion pits are assumed to be uniformly distributed on all panels for preliminarily addressing the residual strength of stiffened box girder similar to paik et al 2003 huang et al 2010 as well as jiang and soares 2012b the pits are all assumed to be cylindrical with the same depth and diameter through thickness crack initiates in the pit is placed on the bottom and side plates fig 1 c describes the length angle and position of the bottom side crack indexes 2c θ and e 2csinθ represent the crack length angle and projected length in longitudinal direction respectively parameters s and h are individually the transverse vertical and longitudinal distances from crack center to bottom side plate center it should be mentioned that the crack width is taken into account to be 3 mm and its tip shape is considered to be a semicircle with 1 5 mm radius xia et al 2019 suggested that for the same crack length effects of the directly prefabricated crack and that obtained by gradual propagation on the plate ultimate strength are almost identical therefore crack propagation related to fracture mechanics problem is not a considered factor in the study in order to solve this problem the crack length is increased in different degrees the boundary and loading conditions are implemented on the two centers of girder ends using multi point constraints mpc their degrees of freedom are restrained as front center ux uy uz urx 0 back center uy uz urx 0 two opposite rotation displacements ury with a same absolute value are applied on the centers under hogging and sagging bending loads the employed material properties are as follows elastic modulus e 2 11e5 mpa poisson s ratio υ 0 277 yield stress σ y 293 mpa wang et al 2020a 2020b clearly showed that the numerical result of ultimate torsional strength of an ultra large container ship without regarding the hardening effect agrees well with the experiment result for conservatism and achieving better convergence during the fe simulations the material is presumed to be perfectly elastic plastic the studied cases are summarized in table 1 including the bending mode pitting and cracking parameters the sign dop denotes the pit density defined by a corrosion a panel and t r t the relative pit depth as for the crack parameters 2c a and h a respectively denote the relative length and longitudinal position of the bottom and side cracks s b and s d the relative transverse position of the bottom crack and relative vertical position of the side crack according to the model symmetry the values of s b and s d are set to be equal for economizing analysis cost in addition the reason for the selection of h a values is the same with above it should be declared that the crack length is determined according to the girder length 540 mm which is smaller than the depth 720 mm so that the s b or s d values reach a larger optional range three kinds of cracks are investigated in the present study namely longitudinal θ 0 inclined θ 45 and transverse vertical θ 90 when the values of h a and s b or s d both equal to 0 the crack center coincides with the bottom side plate center if the crack moves toward the transverse frame and side deck plate the relative positions will all develop as can be examined in the table and fig 1 c values of h a under various angles are the same and so is the case of s b or s d but for the cracks with different 2c a values which are closest to the side deck the values of s b or s d are varying some examples of the crack s transverse and vertical positions can be seen in fig 2 and fig 3 when s b s d 0 0 25 the crack centers are located at the intersections of the panels and stiffeners when s b s d 0 125 they are positioned at the middle between the two stiffeners when s b or s d values are maximum under various 2c a transverse vertical cracks tips respectively reaches the side and deck panels cracks may appear in the stress concentration areas such as welding joint and corrosion pit paik et al 2005 xu et al 2014 cui et al 2016 the listed crack relative positions in table 1 may provide a comprehensive insight of their influence on the ultimate strength of stiffened box girder 3 initial imperfection modeling initial imperfections tend to be induced in the fabrication process and may significantly decrease the ultimate strength of hull structures in the present study only initial deformation is considered and the welding residual stress is not included because influence of initial deformation is much more considerable according to the references cui et al 2016 cui et al 2017 and hu et al 2018 the presumed initial deflection shapes are taken from zhang and khan 2009 which consist of the local and global modes for the panel and stiffener see eqs 1 and 2 the signs of w p and w w are respectively the total initial deformations amplitudes of the panel and stiffener besides a b and h w are the panel length panel width and stiffener web height the parameter m shown in the equations represents the half wave number of the local deformation in longitudinal direction and n in vertical direction it is well recognized that the value of n is frequently equal to 1 the value of m is a b if it is equal to an integer in other situations m is determined by the minimum integer satisfying eq 3 xu et al 2014 fig 4 shows an example of the initial deformation of coupled damaged box girder which will be introduced into the ultimate strength analysis by editing the model key word the deformation is generated by perpendicularly applying the displacements on all panels and stiffeners which is defined by eqs 1 and 2 using a method of abaqus software s field displacement a noticeable fact should be illustrated is that the above equations are applicable to the bottom plates since the coordinate origin is at the bottom for the deck and side they have to be changed by coordinate conversion 1 w p b 200 cos m π x a sin n π y b a 1000 cos π x a sin π y b 2 w w h w 200 cos m π x a sin n π z h w z a 1000 h w cos π x a 3 a b m m 1 4 sensitivity analysis and model validation there are a number of element types in abaqus software such as s3r s4r c3d8r and so on which can be used to simulate the thin wall structures however due to the constant stress and strain field in the s3r element which is a triangular element it requires very fined grid when employing this element to solve bending deflection problem so that the structure s stress and strain can be accurately calculated as for the c3d8r element although it can precisely deal with the above problem high computational cost and poor convergence due to the complicated finite element model may inevitably appear in comparison the s4r element which is a four node shell element with six degrees for each node can overcome the weaknesses of the above mentioned elements when solving the problem of large bending deformation of structures such as ship hull girder complete integration may result in shear locking phenomenon and unsatisfied accuracy compared to that reduction integration adopted in the s4r element can address this drawback by comprehensive consideration the s4r element is employed in the numerical simulation before series analyses of the ultimate bending moment model validation should be implemented to check the reliability of numerical results nishihara s experimental research on the ultimate strength of three stiffened box girders subjected to sagging bending moment are viewed as the standard for the finite fe model of this paper the cross sectional dimensions of these girders namely mst 3 mst 4 and msd are shown in fig 5 in numerical simulation the lengths of mst 4 and msd are equal to that of mst 3 as demonstrated before in order to achieve precise fe result the girders are meshed by a refined size 10 mm table 2 presents the ultimate bending moment comparison between the present study and nishihara 1983 obviously the small relative errors indicate that the reliability of fe model can be proved the pit density dop and relative pit depth t r t have been selected in the previous section yet its size which may interfere the result has not been chosen in the case of platting elements diameter s influence on the ultimate compressive strength can be ignored the correctness of this conclusion for the girder should be discussed through some numerical results fig 6 demonstrates moment angle curves for three diameters under sagging bending load it is clear the moment under two bending loads should be the same due to the model symmetry as can be seen that their influences on the ultimate bending moment i e the peak value are small and can be neglected apparently the diameter 15 mm may require more computing costs in order to reduce the costs 25 mm is selected as the pit diameter in the following analyses for accurately predicting the residual strength of the damaged girder fine meshes should be employed in the girder especially in the pitting and cracking regions but at the same time too small size undoubtedly and significantly increases the computing cost so a balance between the cost and accuracy have to be determined table 3 gives the ultimate bending moment of the girder with coupled damage under sagging bending varying the mesh sizes of different regions fig 7 describes the girder with three grid densities through a general view and a detail view of the coupled damaged area and the others it is observed in table 3 that with reducing the mesh size the residual strength has converged as can be seen from the relative error s variation considering the mentioned balance middle size is used to mesh the damaged girder 5 results and discussions in this chapter influences of the pit depth density and corroded volume loss bending mode as well as crack length angle and location are discussed based on a larger number of finite element results derived from the analyses of abaqus software in which arc length method is employed to solve the non linear equation series curves of bending moment versus rotation angle and ultimate bending moment reduction factor as well as equivalent stress distributions are demonstrated to identify the limit state behaviors and failure modes of coupled damaged box girder in order to compare the superimposed influence of the pit and crack when they appear independently and their coupled influence when they coexist ultimate bending moment values of the girders with coupled damage and single damage are both studied 5 1 influence of pitting corrosion 5 1 1 pit depth and density in order to analyze the influence mechanism of corrosion pit on the ultimate strength the model with only crack defect is taken as the reference fig 8 illustrates the moment angle curves of the girder with only a bottom crack and coupled damage varying the pit depth under hogging bending load longitudinal and transverse cracks in the case of dop 6 19 2c a 0 35 h a s b 0 are taken into account in the figure as can be seen in the red box besides fig 9 shows the curves for the case of side crack where the girder is subjected to sagging bending moment and the crack center is located at the intersection of the side panel and upper stiffener it is interesting that the regions around the cracks in these models are compressed as the girder is bending from the figures demonstration ultimate bending moment of the coupled damaged girder is declined with increasing the pit depth compared to the girder with only crack defect although the curve peak may be various due to the crack consistent reduction scale can be observed by comparing fig 8 a and b as well as fig 9 a and b furthermore small decreases occur for the initial stiffness and the rotation angle at the ultimate limit state uls indicating the pitting has some influences on the girder s mechanical property fig 10 a and b display the ultimate bending moment reduction factor m u m uc changing with the pitting parameters dop and t r t for the circumstances of longitudinal and transverse vertical cracks respectively decline of the ultimate strength can be clearly observed by these line charts symbols m u and m uc on the ordinate denote the ultimate bending moment values of the girder with coupled damage and the simply cracked one similar to previous analysis effects of the bottom and side cracks on the pitting influence mechanism are included in the charts as can be seen that for the cracks with θ 0 and θ 90 the factor decreases with the developments of dop and t r t moreover a linear relationship between m u m uc and t r t is illustrated for the two pit densities however the crack angle has little effect on the trend of m u m uc these findings are consistent with the results obtained in figs 8 and 9 according to fig 10 it can be also found that the reduction factor as a result of the bottom crack is smaller than the side crack this may be due to the coupled damage of pitting and bottom crack has greater impact on the girder s ultimate strength whereas significant gap does not appear in the two groups fig 11 and fig 12 depict the equivalent stress distributions and failure modes of coupled damaged girder at the uls respectively varying the pit depth and density the former girders in fig 11 collapse due to hogging and the latter in fig 12 failure because of sagging it is observed that with the increases of t r t and dop stress concentration of the pitting areas becomes more and more serious especially for the bottom and deck which are the main parts bearing the bending loading obviously pitting will reduce the girder s cross sectional area and volume leading to the drop of the ultimate strength another phenomenon can be found from the pictures is that the pitting has little effect on the failure of cracking zone which may be able to answer why similar ultimate strength reduction appear in fig 10 5 1 2 influence of corroded volume loss some scholars such as jiang and soares 2012b zhang et al 2016 and shi et al 2018 have suggested that corroded volume loss is a useful parameter employed to calculate the ultimate compressive strength of unstiffened and stiffened pitted panels for the stiffened box girder this variable is also applicable as shown in fig 13 five groups of the ultimate bending moment reduction factor are plotted for the purpose of better comparison result of the girder with only corrosion namely m up m u0 is also presented m up and m u0 are respectively the ultimate bending moment of purely corroded girder and intact one it should be explained that the data points of m u m uc are derived from fig 10 besides the relative corroded volume loss δv v 0 is equal to the product of dop and t r t it is evident that reduction factors m up m u0 and m u m uc both drop linearly negligible difference between corroded and coupled groups proves a fitted regression equation which is shown in the figure can be applied on evaluating the residual ultimate strength of singly pitted girder and coupled damaged one provided m u0 and m uc are previously achieved wang et al 2008 have conducted a statistical investigation with respect to the time variant strength of aging corroded ships and found that it varies from 4 to 20 it is evident that the decrease proportion of ultimate strength of pitted box girder in this paper is consistent with the above characteristic therefore the fitted equation shown in fig 13 may provide some insight to evaluate the residual strength of aging ship hull girder 5 2 influence of bottom crack 5 2 1 bending mode fig 14 a and b separately describe the moment angle curves of singly corroded girder and that with coupled damage under s b 0 and 0 125 in this situation the crack centers are located at the middle stiffener and between the two stiffeners respectively the corroded curves shown in the pictures represent the moment angle relationship of the girder with only pitting defect it is observed that for different crack angles and transverse positions the ultimate bending moment reduction in hogging condition is generally more considerable than the sagging condition comparing the figures it can be also concluded that for hogging condition the ultimate bending moment reduces as the crack angle increases except for the longitudinal crack with s b 0 which also has significant effect although the crack causes the same cross sectional area reduction of the bottom plate stress states around the cracking regions under various bending modes are different buckling failure occurs at the bottom when the girder is subjected to hogging bending on the contrary yield failure occurs when sagging loading is applied on the model it s not difficult to understand the crack which enhances the post bucking has more significant effect on the ultimate strength as the bottom is compressed in order to reveal the effect of bending mode on the ultimate strength in depth fig 15 shows the equivalent stress distributions and failure modes of damaged girder subjected to hogging and sagging as can be observed from fig 15 a larger deformation appears for the longitudinally cracked girder in hogging condition especially in the cracking area longitudinal crack located under the stiffener greatly weakens the connection of the plate and stiffener leading to a sharp decline of bearing capacity in comparison longitudinal crack has no effect on the yield failure of bottom plate in sagging condition see fig 15 b besides as shown in fig 15 c and d stress distributions of the panels at bottom plate are seriously changed by the transverse cracks projected areas of the crack can t effectively resist the compressive or tensile loads however crack s impact on the girder in hogging condition is more serious than the case of sagging this phenomenon is consistent with the above characteristics fig 16 illustrates the ultimate bending moment reduction factor m u m up in which influences of hogging and sagging can be distinctly compared it is obviously observed that in sagging condition the decline of m u m up is much smaller than that of hogging for different crack angles in addition similar descent feature is demonstrated in fig 16 a and b excluding the case of θ 0 in hogging condition in view of the influence of hogging condition is much more remarkable this bending mode is therefore only considered for the bottom crack in the following analyses 5 2 2 crack s longitudinal position for the sake of thoroughly investigating the influence of crack s longitudinal position on the ultimate strength two variables θ and s b are also included in the discussion of this section fig 17 a and b respectively present the reduction factor m u m up varying the relative longitudinal position h a in the case of s b 0 and s b 0 36875 from the figures shown longitudinal position has little effect on the reduction factor fig 18 depicts the membrane stress distributions of damaged girder under hogging bending moment at the uls when the longitudinal crack moves toward the transverse frame stress distribution is hardly changed it can be also found that this kind of crack located between the stiffener and side panel has negligible influence on the failure mode consequently the related ultimate bending moment shown in fig 17 b decreases to a small degree as for the transverse crack when it approaches to the frame although the stress and distribution of the regions around it are influenced the residual cross sectional area is constant so the ultimate strength is also hardly changed in the following discussion for the bottom crack longitudinal position is also neglected and only h a 0 is considered 5 2 3 crack s transverse position fig 19 shows the reduction factor m u m up varying the relative transverse position s b three crack lengths and angles are taken into account for comparatively analyzing the influence of discussed parameter in this section it is observed from fig 19 a that longitudinal cracks under the two stiffeners i e s b 0 and 0 25 have significant influences on the reduction factor declines of m u m up are very close for these transverse positions in the case of other transverse positions effects of the longitudinal cracks can be ignored fig 19 b and c indicate that if the crack is inclined or transverse the reduction factor is changed slightly for different s b values the reason for the fluctuation may be the intersection of the crack and stiffener or side plate if crack crosses below the stiffener or side plate their performance of bearing compression will be degraded resulting in the ultimate strength reduction 5 2 4 crack s length and angle as discussed before influences of transverse and inclined cracks as well as longitudinal ones located under the stiffeners are much more significant and should be taken into account ultimate bending moment characteristics affected by their sizes are analyzed in the present section they are separated into two types namely longitudinal and transverse inclined according to the previously illustrated laws for longitudinal crack the actual length is a key factor influencing the ultimate strength for transverse and inclined cracks the influential factor should be the projected length because it decreases the cross sectional area fig 20 a gives the m u m up characteristic varying the relative actual length 2c a of longitudinal crack two transverse positions s b 0 and s b 0 25 are both included in the figure it is observed that their results are almost the same with increasing the crack length the factor m u m up is significantly declined in the case of small length i e 2c a 0 2 sharp reduction has already occurred in order to better fitting the points a polynomial is selected as the equation the descent behaviors of m u m up affected by the relative projected length e a of transverse or inclined crack are given in fig 20 b as shown in the figure the reduction factor is also declined when developing the value of e a moreover a linear feature is clearly presented in the result it should be pointed out that transverse location of the crack which is closest to the side is varying due to its length for facilitating the investigation a mean value derived from s b values of three crack lengths is given in fig 20 b i e 0 36875 for different transverse positions m u m up value is varying in a small range reduction factors of four groups are averaged by a fitted straight line to reduce the errors 5 3 influence of side crack 5 3 1 bending mode similar to the bottom crack side crack may also affect the stress state resulting in the variation of ultimate strength in order to examine this phenomenon two crack vertical positions i e s d 0 25 and 0 3125 are selected to present the changes of ultimate strength fig 21 shows the moment angle relationship of the girder with only pitting corrosion and the coupled damaged one in the case of 2c a 0 5 dop 6 19 and t r t 0 5 it is seen that the crack alters the loading path of the pitted girder in sagging condition and the ultimate bending moment is reduced on the contrary the crack in hogging condition has little effect on the ultimate strength for sagging mode it can be also known that the ultimate bending moment demonstrates various behaviors for different crack angles specifically the moment decreases with increasing the parameters θ and s d except for the case of θ 0 and s d 0 25 the longitudinal crack coincides with the stiffener weld does greater change for the ultimate strength than the inclined crack fig 22 depicts the failure modes of coupled damaged girders at the uls it should be pointed out that the longitudinal cracks in fig 22 a and b coincide with the stiffener welds as can be observed that the buckling phenomenon in compression areas is much more serious than the yield phenomenon in tensile areas girder failure is featured as the buckling collapse the upper part of side plate makes a contribution to resist the compressive load while the other regions of the side almost have no effect on resisting the tension from fig 22 a shown large deformation is induced around the crack which destroys the connection of the panel and stiffener the ultimate strength is therefore reduced to a noticeable degree a fact can be found in fig 22 c is that the vertical crack which decreases the compressed area also leads to a significant strength reduction value but the cracks have little influence on the failure modes in hogging condition see fig 22 b and d fig 23 illustrates the ultimate bending moment reduction factor m u m up changing with the crack angle under hogging and sagging bending loads in which the characteristic is clearly presented as shown that m u m up of hogging mode is almost equal to 1 for different crack angles and positions indicting influence of this bending mode is very small when the crack is on the upper side for sagging condition the ultimate bending moment is decreased to a greater extent it is not difficult to understand hogging condition s effect can be ignored according to the analyses thus only sagging is accounted for in the subsequent discussions of side crack s influence 5 3 2 crack s longitudinal position fig 24 shows the reduction factor m u m up varying the crack s longitudinal position at 2c a 0 35 different crack angles in the case of s d 0 and s d 0 36875 are taken into account as can be seen that whether for the crack located at the neutral plane or the crack which is close to the deck the m u m up tendency presents no obvious change the reason is consistent with the circumstance of bottom crack although the crack moves in the longitudinal direction the residual cross sectional area remain constant so the ultimate strength is hardly interfered for simplicity influence of longitudinal position is not included in the following analyses and only h a 0 is considered 5 3 3 crack s vertical position fig 25 presents the variations of reduction factor changing with the vertical position under different crack lengths and angles it can be seen from fig 25 a that when the s d value is less than 0 25 no change of m u m up occurs when it is equal to 0 25 m u m up decreases with the crack length when it is greater than 0 25 the change of m u m up is small for the vertical and inclined cracks observation derived from fig 25 b and c indicates that the ultimate bending moment is reduced as increasing the value of s d fig 26 depicts the failure modes at the uls varying the crack s vertical position under θ 0 and θ 90 when the centers of longitudinal and vertical cracks are placed in girder s neutral plane as shown in fig 26 a and c the failure modes of the side plates are little affected leading to quite small changes of the residual strength when the longitudinal crack is located between the deck and top stiffener its influence on the failure mode is also slight see fig 26 b but if the crack is vertical or inclined and also nears the deck the failure mode of side plate is seriously changed as shown in fig 26 d obviously compressive stress is increased with the distance from neutral axis to the deck vertical or inclined cracks within this distance alter the stress and therefore significantly reduce the ultimate strength 5 3 4 crack s length and angle according to previous discussions it is evident that influences of vertical and inclined cracks as well as longitudinal cracks at s d 0 25 on the ultimate strength are more significant whereas other longitudinal cracks can be ignored for simplicity fig 27 a illustrates the m u m up values varying the actual relative length 2c a of longitudinal crack as shown in the figure the reduction factor is decreased with the crack length becomes bigger a linear relationship clearly exists between m u m up and 2c a and the relevant descent slope is 0 1 fig 27 b presents the variation of reduction factor m u m up changing with relative projected length e a of inclined vertical crack for different vertical positions as can be seen that the m u m up value is declined by the relative projected length in the case of s d 0 a linear relationship is also exhibited between m u m up and e a furthermore the descent slope of fitted line increases with the s d value fig 28 gives the fitted curve and corresponding equation of the descent slope a s d which demonstrates a nonlinear characteristic 5 4 joint influence of pitting corrosion and crack effects of the pitting corrosion and crack have been separately analyzed in previous discussions parameters of corroded volume loss and crack length have been found to be the key factors reducing the girder ultimate strength on the contrary their joint influences are investigated in the this section to compare the coupled influence of the two kinds of damages as they coexist and the superimposed influence as they exist independently fig 29 and fig 30 depict the ultimate bending moment reduction rate changing with the relative corroded volume loss for different bottom and side cracks for the purpose of comparison transverse position s b 0 of bottom crack and vertical position s d 0 25 of side crack are taken into account besides all lengths of longitudinal and transverse vertical cracks are included in the analyses the signs δm 1 and δm 2 in the ordinate are respectively the rates which represent the coupled influence and superimposed influence of the pitting and crack as defined in eq 4 and eq 5 where m u0 denotes the ultimate bending moment of intact girder as can be seen from the figures δm 1 and δm 2 increase linearly with δv v 0 in the case of different 2c a values another characteristic is that superimposed influence is generally lager than the coupled influence the authors paper feng et al 2020b has suggested that the superposed influence of pitting corrosion and crack on the plate ultimate compressive strength is more significant than their coupled influence which behavior is consistent with the conclusion of the present study however in the case of transverse crack difference of the superposed influence and coupled influence on the plate is clearly more remarkable the reason may be the crack size relative to the plate width is much larger than that relative to the circumference of box girder s cross section leading to the pits in the crack s projected region have little effect on the ultimate strength it is observed from figs 29 and 30 that for bottom and side cracks under θ 0 and θ 90 relative errors of the two rates are both small indicating their effects and influence of the pitting corrosion can be simply combined in order to further prove the recognition figs 31 and 32 depicts the equivalent stress distributions and failure modes of the girders with single crack or pitting corrosion and their coupled damage the failure mode of the girder with coupled damage can be viewed as the superposition of that with single defect 4 δ m 1 m u 0 m u m u 0 100 5 δ m 2 m u 0 m u c m u 0 m u p m u 0 100 6 empirical formulations for predicting the residual ultimate strength of stiffened box girder with coupled damage 6 1 bottom crack in comparison to sagging condition influence of the bottom crack on the ultimate strength of coupled damaged box girder subjected to hogging bending moment is much more significant as discussed before additionally for hogging condition impacts of transverse inclined crack and longitudinal crack located under the stiffeners i e s b 0 and 0 25 should be paid attention to longitudinal cracks between two stiffeners or stiffener and side panel can be ignored but pitting corrosion in this situation must be taken into account considering the above influential factors two empirical formulas are established for predicting the ultimate bending moment of coupled damaged box girder subjected to hogging bending load see eq 6 and eq 7 they are respectively applicable to transverse inclined and longitudinal bottom cracks it has been pointed out in section 5 4 that independent influences of the crack and pitting corrosion can be simply superposed for the girder therefore these formulations are linearly combined on the basic of the fitted equations shown in figs 13 and 20 it must be declared that for crack s longitudinal position only the case of h a 0 is considered in these predictions because effect of this variable can be ignored 6 m u m u 0 1 0 76 2 c a 0 93 2 c a 2 1 79 δ v v 0 s b 0 0 25 1 1 79 δ v v 0 s b 0 0 25 7 m u m u 0 1 0 346 e a 1 79 δ v v 0 in order to examine the effectiveness of the proposed formulations fig 33 and fig 34 show the ultimate bending moment reduction factor s comparison between the formulas and finite element method as well as the corresponding error distributions as illustrated in figs 33 a and fig 34 a the points are evenly distributed around the symmetrical lines the values of mean and cov indicate the two results both have great agreements in which mean represents the average value of the ratios of formula results to numerical results moreover error distributions shown in figs 33 b and fig 34 b can further prove the formulas can accurately assess the residual strength of stiffened box girder with coupled damage in the case of bottom crack 6 2 side crack unlike the bottom crack influence of the side crack which is above the neutral axis on the ultimate strength of coupled damaged girder under sagging bending load has been identified to be considerable than the case of hogging condition therefore sagging is therefore only considered in the following empirical formulations besides vertical and inclined cracks longitudinal cracks with s d 0 25 have important effects the remaining longitudinal cracks at s d 0 25 are able to be neglected but pitting corrosion must be also taken into account based on the regression equations illustrated in fig 13 and figs 27 and 28 two formulations with respect to the residual ultimate strength of coupled damaged girder are respectively suggested for longitudinal crack and vertical inclined crack it can be observed that influences of the side crack and pitting are also linearly composed in the equations similarly the longitudinal position i e h a 0 is also only taken into account 8 m u m u 0 1 0 1 2 c a 1 79 δ v v 0 s d 0 25 1 1 79 δ v v 0 s d 0 25 9 m u m u 0 1 a s d e a 1 79 δ v v 0 fig 35 a and fig 36 a illustrate the comparison of m u m u0 between the formulas and fem it is evident from the points distribution and the values of mean and cov that the formula and numerical results also presented a good correlation figs 35 b and fig 36 b show the relative error distributions between the two formulas and numerical method it is clear that the differences of these predictions are small indicating their reliability and accuracy can be proved therefore eqs 8 and 9 can also precisely evaluate the residual ultimate strength of stiffened box girder with coupled damage in the case of side crack 7 conclusion series of elastic plastic large deformation analyses were carried out in this paper by using abaqus software to deal with the residual ultimate strength behaviors of a symmetrical stiffened box girder with coupled pitting and crack damage subjected to vertical bending moment effects of the pit size depth density and corrosion volume bending mode as well as crack length angle and location on the strength were discussed according to the finite element results some conclusions which may provide useful insights for the residual ultimate strength evaluation of aging ship hull structures can be drawn 1 for the same pit depth and density diameter of the pitting has little effect on the ultimate strength with increasing the pit depth and density ultimate bending moment is reduced linearly also the existence of bottom or side crack has slight effect on the reduction variation similar to unstiffened and stiffened panels corroded volume loss is a key factor to evaluate the pit s influence on the box girder ultimate strength a linear relationship between the loss and residual strength was proposed 2 for the bottom crack the ultimate bending moment of the girder in hogging condition is much smaller than sagging condition because the buckling of the bottom is enhanced by the crack influences of crack parameters were therefore investigated for the hogging mode it was found that the projected lengths of transverse and inclined cracks as well as the actual length of longitudinal crack located under the stiffener are of importance affecting the ultimate strength but influences of their transverse positions are slight and therefore can be averaged for simplicity besides longitudinal crack between the two stiffeners or stiffener and side shell is negligible even when it is longer crack s longitudinal position almost has no impact on the strength variation for different crack angles 3 for the side crack which is above the neutral plane ultimate strength reduction in the case of sagging condition is much more remarkable than hogging condition so sagging mode was studied in detail to find out the crack s influence characteristics when the crack is vertical or inclined its projected length is a key factor decreasing the strength with a linear feature besides as it moves toward the deck the descent slope becomes greater when the crack is longitudinally coincided with the weld line of the top stiffener the strength is also linearly decreased by the actual length as for the other longitudinal cracks and longitudinal positions of cracks with different angles their influences are so small that can be ignored 4 generally superimposed ultimate strength reduction of the girder with single crack or pitting corrosion is slightly larger than the reduction value induced by the coupled damage but the difference between them can be ignored it is indicated that influence of the crack and pitting can be simply superimposed four empirical formulas were therefore respectively linearly composed based on the fitted equations as a function of crack s actual projected lengths and corroded volume loss they can be used to precisely evaluate the residual ultimate strength of stiffened box girder with coupled damage under vertical

20467,the present paper introduces a mathematical model capable of simulating the behaviour of a twin propeller twin rudder ship in uncoupled conditions meaning that the portside and starboard propeller and or rudder work at different rates respectively angles such conditions are typically applied while manoeuvring in harbour conditions the mathematical model coefficients are determined based on a captive manoeuvring test program which covers these uncoupled conditions after implementation in the ship manoeuvring simulator fast time simulations have been carried out which were

group onr office of naval research rans reynolds averaged navier stokes simman workshop on verification and validation of ship manoeuvring simulation methods 1 introduction commonly ships are equipped with a single propeller and rudder to provide sufficient performance and respectively manoeuvrability although there are multiple reasons to opt for a more expensive setup of two propellers and two rudders such twin propeller and twin rudder ships can deliver the same performance with two smaller engines actuating smaller propellers and smaller rudders compared to what is needed with a single rudder and single propeller setup a major advantage is added when it is possible to operate each rudder or propeller independently for instance both rudders can be put to portside the portside propeller to half astern and the starboard propeller to half ahead to facilitate a turn to portside of the twin rudder twin propeller ship this is not an unrealistic example but common practice performed by pilots while manoeuvring in harbour areas of course the selected combinations of rudders and or propellers depend on various parameters such as the availability of bow thrusters tugs harbour layout and weather conditions a twin rudder twin propeller setup can be found on several ship types such as ferries cruise ships lng carriers the q flex and q max series and some container ships the maersk triple e series if one wishes to simulate harbour manoeuvres with the above vessels to a high degree of realism an appropriate mathematical model should be available for the uncoupled conditions a first requisite of course is that the coupled conditions are appropriately simulated in harbour areas the manoeuvring behaviour of ships equipped with two rudders and two propellers has lately been given attention by different authors there is even a naval benchmark hull available the onr tumblehome as part of the simman 2021 workshop a field where ships are equipped with multiple propellers and rudders even more than two is inland navigation examples for inland ships can be read in om et al 2013 or by kaidi et al 2018 captive model tests are yet a valuable tool to determine the manoeuvring behaviour of any ship model including one equipped with multiple propellers and rudders examples of such approach are shown by yasukawa et al 2011 who performed captive model tests with a scale model of a twin propeller twin rudder ferry they simplified the multiple propeller rudder modelling problem by creating an equivalent single rudder and apply it to an mmg mathematical modelling group formulation a similar exercise was performed by reichel 2012 who focussed on ahead astern and pure drift motions making the mathematical model applicable to simulate harbour manoeuvres a combined use of captive model tests and free running tests to develop and consequently validate a mathematical model for a twin propeller twin rudder ship is shown by khanfir et al 2011 however limited to coupled conditions only a similar approach will be used in the present paper to cover the uncoupled conditions as well in contrast to the experimental research more attention is being given to rans tools examples of this approach are sadat hosseini et al 2014 who performed rans computations for a twin screw ship in turning motion and sukas et al 2019 who used rans calculations to determine the derivatives of an mmg model of a twin screw twin rudder ship nevertheless none of the above authors considered uncoupled cases for rudders or propellers and the specific interactions between the different rudders and propellers originated from it to the authors best knowledge the latest paper which dealt with this topic was delefortrie et al 2018 who focussed on the interaction between z drives and the effect on the manoeuvring on the other hand the interaction has been studied extensively at inm cnr in italy but from the viewpoint of torque losses when manoeuvring and not deliberately changing the propeller rates of one of the propellers examples of these studies can be consulted in corradu et al 2013 or dubbioso et al 2015 other important fields of interaction are the interaction between the propellers and the skeg see for instance ferrari et al 2019 or piaggio et al 2020 or the interaction between the propellers and the quay wall as discussed by lee et al 2011 or gornicz et al 2019 these topics are however out of the scope of the present research which tries to fill the gap by researching the effects of deliberately interacting rudders and propellers on the manoeuvring behaviour of a twin propeller twin rudder ship in shallow open water 2 experimental research the experimental research considered both captive manoeuvring tests 2017 and free running tests 2019 carried out in the towing tank for manoeuvres in confined water flanders hydraulics research co operation with ghent university see delefortrie et al 2016b for more information with a 1 75 scale model of a q flex lng carrier g01 equipped with twin rudder and twin screw see table 1 fig 1 shows the used ship fixed coordinate system o x y z with origin amidships on the calm water plane in the present paper the rudder angles are considered positive for excursions to portside and inwards turning propellers are used a test program has been carried out at four water depths see table 2 in captive mode a conventional test program has been carried out covering the speeds mentioned in table 3 in addition harmonic forced roll motion tests have been executed and tests with asymmetric propulsion which cover a wide variety of propeller rates one of the propellers is turning astern while the other one is turning ahead in total between 350 and 400 tests have been carried out per water depth the free running test program consisted of self propulsion tests at the following propeller rates 20 40 60 80 and 100 of the maximal propeller rate 91 rpm on full scale the ship was controlled to sail on a straight line using default pid constants 10 0 1 25 see chen et al 2020 for more information on the control algorithms zig zag tests modified 10 2 5 10 2 5 20 5 and 20 5 zigzag tests were carried out at different approach velocities with corresponding self propulsion propeller rates crash stop tests with the following stopping propeller percentages 0 inertia stop 50 100 uncoupled propulsion and steering tests three starting speeds have been considered 0 m s code ka 0 3564 m s 6 knots full scale code kd 0 3564 m s 6 knots full scale code kz the problem with the uncoupled tests is that in many cases the test is stopped due to risk of hitting the tank wall the test codes are mentioned here for ease of reference when discussing the results of these tests the variations of the propeller rates and the rudder angles were as listed in table 4 for tests kd and kz the variations for tests ka are described in table 5 the test numbers 40 to 47 represent manoeuvres carried out to quasi turn on the spot during the free running tests the ship was accelerated in a captive mode and the propellers and rudders were set at their required position for the free running manoeuvre additionally a large amount of autopilot tests have been carried out which are presented in a separate publication chen et al 2020 3 observations from captive program 3 1 description of the propeller and rudder induced forces when using a tabular modular mathematical model the components of the hull propeller and rudder are modelled separately the aim here is to investigate how the propeller and rudder induced components affect the total behaviour of the twin propeller twin rudder ship in uncoupled conditions the modelling of the hull force components of a fully appended scale model is not different from a single rudder single propeller ship this will not be discussed further in the present article but can be consulted in delefortrie et al 2016a the propulsion induced components depend

1 2 ρ a r v r i 2 c l i cos β r i c d i sin β r i these forces depend on the inflow velocity to the rudder which is described in delefortrie et al 2021 however here the simulation model in the present article did not yet consider the uplift of the inflow to the rudder in the fourth quadrant the so called vortex ring state described in delefortrie et al 2021 this explains the insufficient build up of yaw rate when the ship is simulated in the fourth quadrant see section 4 4 which can be traced back to an underestimation of the lateral rudder force which in turn is caused by an insufficient inflow velocity to the rudder in the fourth quadrant predicted by the conventional momentum theory in terms of manoeuvring the sway force y and the yawing moment n are of importance for a single propeller single rudder ship these are presently expressed as 3 6 y p y p t β y p t γ y p t β y p t γ k 1 y p t a ε cos ω ε t ϕ y ε t p ε 3 7 n p n p t β n p t γ n p t β n p t γ k 1 n p t a ε cos ω ε

presented in delefortrie et al 2016a the propulsion induced effect is thus predicted by a constant force or moment which depends on the thrust yaw and drift angle in the even quadrants k 1 1 oscillations occur see fig 2 the characteristics of these oscillations depend on the propeller loading typically a fourier assessment of the time series is performed to find the 1st harmonic k 1 0 for the other quadrants the steering induced force and moment are 3 8 y r 1 a h ε f y 3 9 n r x r a h ε x h ε f y with a h ε f y the additional side force generated by the ship s stern which applies at a position x h ε the goal of the paper is now to find a working model for twin propeller twin rudder ships in uncoupled conditions where each propeller can operate in a different quadrant 3 2 average force and moment in even quadrants an even quadrant occurs as soon as only one of the propellers is working in the opposite direction of the velocity vector of the ship in such case it is always necessary to account for some oscillation in most cases the sign of the averaged force and yawing moment is reversed when the uncoupled propulsion is mirrored moreover the sign of the average lateral force seems to be dependent of the loading condition of both propellers and the under keel clearance this can be seen in fig 3 and fig 4 mind that in these figures the function is made non dimensional with only the thrust of the propellers that are working in an even quadrant in other words coupled operation 1 1 both propellers have the same propeller rate as they are coupled y p t ε t p p s t p s s ss operation 2 2 in the ss operation the starboard side propeller is varied at different constant propeller rates giving varying apparent advance angles ε while the port side propeller is kept at the given constant propeller rate in the ps operation the opposite is chosen y p t ε t p s s ps operation y p t ε t p p s in this first iteration the action of the propeller operating in the 1st or 3rd quadrant is considered void moreover in a symmetric setup the lateral action is considered zero at zero drift angle this important assumption enables to control the number of variables in the present analysis different observations can be made for quadrants 2 and 4 in the fourth quadrant the measurements show significant scatter around a zero value when both propellers are coupled see for instance fig 3a if only one of both propellers is operating in the fourth quadrant the results tend to be grouped towards one side of the horizontal axis the discussion will focus on the starboard propeller operating in the fourth quadrant the average lateral force is negative thus directed towards portside the effect is larger for larger rates of the portside propeller operating in the third quadrant in uncoupled mode the above is valid within the range of 20 100 ukc but at 10 ukc fig 3d a sign reversal is observed for the smaller portside propeller rates the average lateral force increases in magnitude with decreasing under keel clearances the observations can be mirrored in case the portside propeller operates in the fourth quadrant if the starboard propeller operates in the second quadrant fig 4 at large propeller loading angles the dimensionless average lateral force component is more negative thus the lateral force due to propeller action is directed towards starboard side negative thrust in the second quadrant an effect of the rate of the portside propeller on the average lateral force is present but is not clear and will therefore be omitted in the mathematical modelling at smaller propeller loading i e smaller ε angles the trend is reversed and the average lateral force becomes more positive again the observations can be mirrored in case the portside propeller operates in the second quadrant the given trends can be modelled in a tabular way by the suggested mirrored curves respectively in green and red dashed lines for ss and ps operation in fig 4 although the trends can be captured in the second quadrant this is not the case for the fourth quadrant the assumption that the propeller operating in the uneven quadrant has no effect is only valid if that propeller operates in the 1st quadrant if one of the propellers is turning astern while the other one is not turning a significant side force is measured in other words in a combination

i ε s s t s s s a model suggestion is represented in fig 5 the trends are now more like the trends observed for the second quadrant fig 3 portside or starboard action is mirrored around the horizontal axis the deviations from the horizontal axis increase with decreasing under keel clearance and decreasing propeller loadings the new curves were obtained using the values for y p t i i i ε shown in fig 6 3 3 oscillations in even quadrants 3 3 1 oscillation amplitude fig 7 and fig 8 show the effect of the uncoupled operation on the oscillation amplitude respectively in the fourth and in the second quadrant mind that in these figures the function is made non dimensional with only the thrust of the propellers that are working in an even quadrant in other words coupled operation y p t a ε t p p s t p s s ss operation y p t a ε t p s s ps operation y p t a ε t p p s the following observations can be made the oscillation amplitude is relatively larger in uncoupled operation especially at smaller propeller loading angles an exception is the fourth quadrant at 10 ukc the differences seem to be less or even opposite if the adjacent propeller turning in the first or third quadrant has a larger propeller rate as expected there is no significant difference between the starboard side and the portside as for the average force magnitudes the oscillation amplitudes increase with decreasing ukc compared to the oscillation amplitude in coupled operation one could say that if only one propeller is operating in the even quadrant this propeller is responsible for 75 of that oscillation amplitude and when the other propeller starts operating in the same even quadrant another 25 is added 3 3 2 oscillation frequency the dimensionless oscillation frequency has been plotted in fig 9 and fig 10 the values on the graph were limited to dimensionless frequency values below 2 corresponding to an oscillation period of 2 s or above 17 s in full scale in general similar frequencies are observed for the coupled and uncoupled condition this suggests the use of the dominant frequency to predict the oscillations however at large speeds and large propeller rates significant differences occur between the starboard and portside propeller action to put these observations in perspective the time traces of tests g0101a02 cea200 and g0101a02 cea300 35 ukc ε 168 have been plotted in fig 11 one can observe that at large speeds and large propeller rates the signal has higher order harmonics which are not included in the present model the time traces show however a similar behaviour mirrored around the horizontal axis fig 11d indicates that again the oscillation amplitude is almost the same whether a single propeller or the two propellers are operating in the second quadrant 3 4 proposed method 3 4 1 requirements in order to have a symmetric force balance during multiple quadrant operation the following has to be satisfied for the sway force and yawing moment the average force or moment needs to have an equal value but a different sign when operating in portside or starboard side as the sum of both moments and or forces is computed the resulting average force and or moment needs to be zero in coupled propulsion and sailing on a straight track the oscillation amplitude obtained by even quadrant operation with only one propeller seems more than half the oscillation amplitude obtained with two propellers this feature is not considered because based on the observations with free running tests see 4 2 smaller amplitudes are measured and a 50 50 distribution will be assumed the oscillation amplitudes have the same sign and equal value when operating in portside or starboard side the dominant propeller drives the frequency of the oscillations as can be observed in fig 11 the onset of the oscillations has a different sign when operating in portside or starboard side this can be modelled with the introduction of a phase shift the phase shift will be decided based on the sign of the combined drift yaw motion by convention π 2 will be used for positive angles and π 2 for negative angles at zero drift and yaw angle a discontinuity is needed no phase shift 3 4 2 mathematical formulation the equation fulfilling the above requirements is 3 10 f p f p t p s ε f p t a ε cos ω ε t ϕ ε π 2 k 3 t p p s f p t s s ε f p t a ε cos ω ε t ϕ ε π 2 k 3 t p s s with f p t a

the coefficients f p t p s ε and f p t s s ε in uncoupled mode with 3 11 ε m a x ε p s ε s s in the second quadrant the measured force or moment can be entirely ascribed to the propeller in the second

mirror symmetry is then achieved if 3 14 f s s ε f p s ε 3 15 g s s ε g p s ε 3 16 h s s ε h p s ε the latter function requires that the propulsion induced force in the third quadrant becomes a function of ε as well in practice regression analysis revealed that g and h counteracted each other therefore h has to be considered constant 3 17 f p t p s ε p s g p s ε p s t p p s h p s t p s s to achieve mirror symmetry for sway and yaw the following conditions have to be met in the coupled propulsion case the average propulsion induced forces and moments are equal to zero when sailing on a straight line drift and yaw are either 0 or 180 the average propulsion induced forces and moments are equal to zero in the second and fourth quadrant the effect of drift and yaw angle show mirror symmetry for a ship equipped with two rudders and two propellers the model for the total propulsion induced forces has then to be extended as follows the sway force is used as an example 3 18 y p y p

the actual sign of the phase shift is the same as the sign of the combined yaw and drift angle this should be applicable for single propeller ships as well the average values for portside and starboard side have mirror symmetry around the average case of coupled propulsion the situation is more complex for the uncoupled propulsion case the onset of the oscillations has a different sign when operating in portside or starboard side at zero drift and yaw angle a discontinuity can be introduced no phase shift once the phase is fixed it should not further change during the simulation at least while being in an even quadrant with one or both propellers the question is when the phase should be fixed because when entering an even quadrant either the propeller rate or the ship s velocity is infinitesimally small especially the latter makes it complicated to decide on a correct sign of β γ as a compromise the simulation program fixes the phase at 1s after having entered an even quadrant at that point the propeller rate and or the ship s velocity are still small to cause significant oscillatory forces on the ship but already large enough to have a correct decision about the sign of the phase shift based on β γ the mathematical model formulation 3 18 accounts for the separate effect of each propeller on the propulsion induced force an additional steady effect y p t p s ε p s and y p t s s ε s s which occurs in case of uncoupled propulsion but disappears in coupled conditions the expression for the propulsion induced yaw moment is similar the steering induced forces do not seem to require additional coupling terms and can be expressed as follows 3 19 y r i 1 a h ε i f y i 3 20 n r i x r a h ε i x h ε i f y i one problem remains namely the transition at zero speed due to the rapidly varying drift and yaw angles there is no sufficient information in the towing tank tests to cope with this therefore the formulation in the ship simulator needed further adaptations an absolute speed limit v lim u 2 v 2 equal to 0 2 m s full scale has been introduced for the computation of the propulsion and steering induced forces once the speed drops below that limit the drift and yaw angles used to evaluate the manoeuvring models are computed as follows 3 21 β comp arctan v sgn u v lim 2 v 2 3 22 γ comp arctan r l p p 2 sgn u v lim 2 v 2 4 comparisons with free running program 4 1 introduction the tests discussed in this section concern on one hand the uncoupled ones mentioned in table 5 where the manoeuvre starts from rest a selection of tests in this table will be discussed propulsion asymmetry at zero rudder angle 01 02 section 4 2 1 combined rudder and propeller asymmetry positive rudder angles 03 06 negative rudder angles 10 13 section 4 2 2 section 4 3 and 4 4 will discuss the conditions covered in table 4 at the same time the manoeuvres were simulated using the formulations described in section 3 4 2 which take more or less the same time multiplied with 75 75 being the scale factor however possible ship wall interaction phenomena were not included to enhance the comparisons the free running tests were also froude scaled to prototype values and t 0 corresponds to the start of the free running condition after captive acceleration 4 2 conditions at zero start speed 4 2 1 propulsion asymmetry at zero rudder angle fig 12 shows the comparison between the available free running tests and the predicted simulation trajectories the trajectories for 10 ukc are shown based on the simulations but are not available based on the free running tests the lateral deviations have been limited to reasonable values which are the limits of the free running trajectories and in order to avoid the effects of ship tank wall interaction which is not included in the present simulation the most noticeable difference is the trajectory at 100 ukc an open question is if the change of course in the free running tests is caused by the tank wall or that the simulation model wrongly predicts this behaviour the trajectories at 20 and 35 are comparable however the motion in lateral direction seems delayed and the track is subjected to more oscillatory behaviour on the simulator the latter is confirmed by the rate of oscillations of the yaw rate which is governed by the oscillation model in the even quadrants the free running tests indicate that oscillations occur but that these are not so dominant as predicted by the simulations or not so dominant as measured during captive model tests it is clear that the captive model tests quasi steady approach is being challenged in the even quadrants turning off the oscillation model clearly reduces the high frequency oscillations as shown in fig 13 4 2 2 asymmetry of both propellers and rudders the comparison between the free running tests and the simulation runs is shown on figs 14 16 for different under keel clearances these tests have not been carried out at 10 ukc the following observations can be made 100 ukc fig 14 during free running tests the ship has a larger tendency to yawing in the positive direction on the simulator the mathematical model is symmetric the low frequency oscillations during the simulations are due to the oscillation model it takes more time on the simulator for tests ka03 ka13 to go in the same direction as in the tank a dead zone of zero yaw rate appears during simulations 35 ukc figs 15 and 20 ukc fig 16 the simulator predicts qualitatively the same tracks but the response is relatively faster in the towing tank the latter seems ascribable to the slow decrease in average yaw rate on the simulator which is not observed in the tank 4 3 conditions at positive start speed 4 3 1 introduction these conditions concern the ones mentioned in table 4 the tests in this table can be further subdivided as coupled propulsion with rudder asymmetry 01 04 propulsion asymmetry at zero rudder angle 05 08 simulations have been carried out in the same way as for the conditions at zero speed 4 3 2 coupled propulsion with rudder asymmetry the tests considered are turning circles executed with only one of the rudders at 35 the motions start in the second quadrant and finish in the third quadrant the results are shown for two water depths in fig 17 and fig 18 3 tracks overlap each other although the mathematical model uses a mirror symmetry assumption the free running tests are characterized by chaotic trajectories partially because the ship sails in its own wake no trend is found in the direction the ship model follows when sailing astern the oscillation amplitudes that occur in the yaw rate are similar in magnitude for both the simulation runs and free running model tests 4 3 3 propulsion asymmetry at zero rudder angle these tests consider the following cases when sailing ahead twisting of the propulsion one propeller operates in the first quadrant the other one in the second quadrant kd05 06 only one propeller works in the first quadrant the other one is stopped kd07 08 such manoeuvres are quite often applied when uncoupled steering on the simulator is used the comparison between the free running tests and the simulation runs is shown in figs 19 22 for each water depth the following observations can be formulated 100 ukc the ship turns in the direction dictated by the moment generated by the positive thrust for free running tests the turning is stronger when the other propeller is stopped the reason seems to be a strongly fluctuating rudder force when both propellers operate in a twisted mode this seems counterintuitive and is not included in the manoeuvring model the manoeuvre is thus well predicted when only one propeller is working however the simulation predicts an even faster turn for the twisted case 35 ukc during free running model tests the ship starts to turn in the opposite direction in the twisted case this is caused by large oscillations of the yaw rate this turning reversal is not included in the simulation model but the initial yaw rates agree well when only one propeller is working the turning direction of the ship is opposite to the direction of the free running tests the turning of the vessel in a direction opposite to what could be expected is a comment which has been mentioned a couple of times during simulation here this process seems to be confirmed during free running tests and should be attributed to extreme shallow water conditions 20 and 10 ukc opposite turns also occur for the free running tests when only one propeller is operated the simulation model and free running tests seem to be more compliant with lower ukc 4 4 conditions at negative start speed coupled propulsion with rudder asymmetry these conditions concern the ones marked by 01 04 mentioned in table 4 or coupled propulsion with rudder asymmetry 01 04 in this case the turning motions start in the fourth quadrant and finish in the first quadrant from figs 23 26 it is clear that the turning behaviour in the 4th quadrant is underpredicted on the simulator the consequence is that the banana shape trajectory from the free running tests is not reproduced on the simulator nevertheless once the ship sails in the first quadrant the yaw rates between the simulations and the free running tests agree in the free running tests however an oscillatory behaviour is observed which is worse with decreasing water depth this is to be ascribed to the fact that the ship model is sailing in its own wake disturbing the manoeuvre but the tracks are less chaotic compared to the runs that started in the second quadrant a peculiar simulation result occurs at 20 ukc fig 25 where all trajectories start in the same direction this is caused by the fact that a small predicted rudder force is overruled by a strong propulsion induced oscillation amplitude which start maximally due to the predicted phase shift 5 conclusions and recommendations both conventional and unconventional captive model tests and free running manoeuvres have been carried out with a twin rudder twin propeller ship where the captive model tests were mainly used to provide input to a new mathematical model which is capable to simulate uncoupled conditions of the propellers and rudders of the vessel the free running tests where then used as a validation for the simulations the observations can be summarized as follows most uncoupled tests considered here the operation of one or both propellers in the even quadrants opposite sign for motion and propeller action which according to the captive model tests and the subsequent simulation model lead to vortex shedding and oscillatory behaviour of the propeller induced forces and moments this oscillatory behaviour is also noticeable on the free running model tests results but in general to a lesser extent in terms of amplitude and periodicity especially for small velocities or in the fourth quadrant in the second quadrant a better prediction capability is noted the turning of the vessel in a direction opposite to what could be expected is a comment which has been mentioned by pilots a couple of times during simulation here this process seems to be confirmed during free running tests and should be attributed to extreme shallow water conditions the average yaw rate in the fourth quadrant is underpredicted due to an underprediction of the rudder forces this issue is solved by considering the vortex ring state effect to the inflow of the rudder in the fourth quadrant nevertheless the correct mathematical modelling of the behaviour of the ship in this quadrant remains a point of attention for further research a correct definition of the phase shifts and the onset of the oscillations is crucial to achieve mirror symmetry in uncoupled conditions covering different quadrants at the same time the oscillation model based on captive model tests should be carefully considered and possibly softened in general it seems that the simulation model tends to overpredict the amplitude and the periodicity of the oscillations that occur this is most probably due to the fact that the quasi steady approach does not work for captive tests in these quadrants future free running tests will repeat tests in the second and fourth quadrant but for a ship equipped with a single rudder and propeller in order to minimize the number of parameters and to confirm the present observations at the same time tests will be reproduced with computational fluid dynamics to investigate specific flow phenomena credit

20467,the present paper introduces a mathematical model capable of simulating the behaviour of a twin propeller twin rudder ship in uncoupled conditions meaning that the portside and starboard propeller and or rudder work at different rates respectively angles such conditions are typically applied while manoeuvring in harbour conditions the mathematical model coefficients are determined based on a captive manoeuvring test program which covers these uncoupled conditions after implementation in the ship manoeuvring simulator fast time simulations have been carried out which were

group onr office of naval research rans reynolds averaged navier stokes simman workshop on verification and validation of ship manoeuvring simulation methods 1 introduction commonly ships are equipped with a single propeller and rudder to provide sufficient performance and respectively manoeuvrability although there are multiple reasons to opt for a more expensive setup of two propellers and two rudders such twin propeller and twin rudder ships can deliver the same performance with two smaller engines actuating smaller propellers and smaller rudders compared to what is needed with a single rudder and single propeller setup a major advantage is added when it is possible to operate each rudder or propeller independently for instance both rudders can be put to portside the portside propeller to half astern and the starboard propeller to half ahead to facilitate a turn to portside of the twin rudder twin propeller ship this is not an unrealistic example but common practice performed by pilots while manoeuvring in harbour areas of course the selected combinations of rudders and or propellers depend on various parameters such as the availability of bow thrusters tugs harbour layout and weather conditions a twin rudder twin propeller setup can be found on several ship types such as ferries cruise ships lng carriers the q flex and q max series and some container ships the maersk triple e series if one wishes to simulate harbour manoeuvres with the above vessels to a high degree of realism an appropriate mathematical model should be available for the uncoupled conditions a first requisite of course is that the coupled conditions are appropriately simulated in harbour areas the manoeuvring behaviour of ships equipped with two rudders and two propellers has lately been given attention by different authors there is even a naval benchmark hull available the onr tumblehome as part of the simman 2021 workshop a field where ships are equipped with multiple propellers and rudders even more than two is inland navigation examples for inland ships can be read in om et al 2013 or by kaidi et al 2018 captive model tests are yet a valuable tool to determine the manoeuvring behaviour of any ship model including one equipped with multiple propellers and rudders examples of such approach are shown by yasukawa et al 2011 who performed captive model tests with a scale model of a twin propeller twin rudder ferry they simplified the multiple propeller rudder modelling problem by creating an equivalent single rudder and apply it to an mmg mathematical modelling group formulation a similar exercise was performed by reichel 2012 who focussed on ahead astern and pure drift motions making the mathematical model applicable to simulate harbour manoeuvres a combined use of captive model tests and free running tests to develop and consequently validate a mathematical model for a twin propeller twin rudder ship is shown by khanfir et al 2011 however limited to coupled conditions only a similar approach will be used in the present paper to cover the uncoupled conditions as well in contrast to the experimental research more attention is being given to rans tools examples of this approach are sadat hosseini et al 2014 who performed rans computations for a twin screw ship in turning motion and sukas et al 2019 who used rans calculations to determine the derivatives of an mmg model of a twin screw twin rudder ship nevertheless none of the above authors considered uncoupled cases for rudders or propellers and the specific interactions between the different rudders and propellers originated from it to the authors best knowledge the latest paper which dealt with this topic was delefortrie et al 2018 who focussed on the interaction between z drives and the effect on the manoeuvring on the other hand the interaction has been studied extensively at inm cnr in italy but from the viewpoint of torque losses when manoeuvring and not deliberately changing the propeller rates of one of the propellers examples of these studies can be consulted in corradu et al 2013 or dubbioso et al 2015 other important fields of interaction are the interaction between the propellers and the skeg see for instance ferrari et al 2019 or piaggio et al 2020 or the interaction between the propellers and the quay wall as discussed by lee et al 2011 or gornicz et al 2019 these topics are however out of the scope of the present research which tries to fill the gap by researching the effects of deliberately interacting rudders and propellers on the manoeuvring behaviour of a twin propeller twin rudder ship in shallow open water 2 experimental research the experimental research considered both captive manoeuvring tests 2017 and free running tests 2019 carried out in the towing tank for manoeuvres in confined water flanders hydraulics research co operation with ghent university see delefortrie et al 2016b for more information with a 1 75 scale model of a q flex lng carrier g01 equipped with twin rudder and twin screw see table 1 fig 1 shows the used ship fixed coordinate system o x y z with origin amidships on the calm water plane in the present paper the rudder angles are considered positive for excursions to portside and inwards turning propellers are used a test program has been carried out at four water depths see table 2 in captive mode a conventional test program has been carried out covering the speeds mentioned in table 3 in addition harmonic forced roll motion tests have been executed and tests with asymmetric propulsion which cover a wide variety of propeller rates one of the propellers is turning astern while the other one is turning ahead in total between 350 and 400 tests have been carried out per water depth the free running test program consisted of self propulsion tests at the following propeller rates 20 40 60 80 and 100 of the maximal propeller rate 91 rpm on full scale the ship was controlled to sail on a straight line using default pid constants 10 0 1 25 see chen et al 2020 for more information on the control algorithms zig zag tests modified 10 2 5 10 2 5 20 5 and 20 5 zigzag tests were carried out at different approach velocities with corresponding self propulsion propeller rates crash stop tests with the following stopping propeller percentages 0 inertia stop 50 100 uncoupled propulsion and steering tests three starting speeds have been considered 0 m s code ka 0 3564 m s 6 knots full scale code kd 0 3564 m s 6 knots full scale code kz the problem with the uncoupled tests is that in many cases the test is stopped due to risk of hitting the tank wall the test codes are mentioned here for ease of reference when discussing the results of these tests the variations of the propeller rates and the rudder angles were as listed in table 4 for tests kd and kz the variations for tests ka are described in table 5 the test numbers 40 to 47 represent manoeuvres carried out to quasi turn on the spot during the free running tests the ship was accelerated in a captive mode and the propellers and rudders were set at their required position for the free running manoeuvre additionally a large amount of autopilot tests have been carried out which are presented in a separate publication chen et al 2020 3 observations from captive program 3 1 description of the propeller and rudder induced forces when using a tabular modular mathematical model the components of the hull propeller and rudder are modelled separately the aim here is to investigate how the propeller and rudder induced components affect the total behaviour of the twin propeller twin rudder ship in uncoupled conditions the modelling of the hull force components of a fully appended scale model is not different from a single rudder single propeller ship this will not be discussed further in the present article but can be consulted in delefortrie et al 2016a the propulsion induced components depend on the propeller thrust of each propeller i expressed as follows and using c t and ε to avoid infinite values while crossing quadrants 3 1 t p i 0 7 2 8 π 3 ρ n ² d p 4 c t ε i 1 tan 2 ε i with the

follows quadrant 1 u 0 n 0 quadrant 2 u 0 n 0 quadrant 3 u 0 n 0 quadrant 4 u 0 n 0 the forces on the rudder i can be expressed as 3 4 f x i 1 2 ρ a r v r i 2 c l i sin β r i c d i cos β r i 3 5 f y i 1 2 ρ a r v r i 2 c l i cos β r i c d i sin β r i these forces depend on the inflow velocity to the rudder which is described in delefortrie et al 2021 however here the simulation model in the present article did not yet consider the uplift of the inflow to the rudder in the fourth quadrant the so called vortex ring state described in delefortrie et al 2021 this explains the insufficient build up of yaw rate when the ship is simulated in the fourth quadrant see section 4 4 which can be traced back to an underestimation of the lateral rudder force which in turn is caused by an insufficient inflow velocity to the rudder in the fourth quadrant predicted by the conventional momentum theory in terms of manoeuvring the sway force y and the yawing moment n are of importance for a single propeller single rudder ship these are presently expressed as 3 6 y p y p t β y p t γ y p t β y p t γ k 1 y p t a ε cos ω ε t ϕ y ε t p ε 3 7 n p n p t β n p t γ n p t β n p t γ k 1 n p t a ε cos ω ε t ϕ n ε l t p ε for positive thrust f p t β f p t γ is used while for negative thrust f p t β f p t γ is used with f representing either y or n mind that this is different from the previous model presented in delefortrie et al 2016a the propulsion induced effect is thus predicted by a constant force or moment which depends on the thrust yaw and drift angle in the even quadrants k 1 1 oscillations occur see fig 2 the characteristics of these oscillations depend on the propeller loading typically a fourier assessment of the time series is performed to find the 1st harmonic k 1 0 for the other quadrants the steering induced force and moment are 3 8 y r 1 a h ε f y 3 9 n r x r a h ε x h ε f y with a h ε f y the additional side force generated by the ship s stern which applies at a position x h ε the goal of the paper is now to find a working model for twin propeller twin rudder ships in uncoupled conditions where each propeller can operate in a different quadrant 3 2 average force and moment in even quadrants an even quadrant occurs as soon as only one of the propellers is working in the opposite direction of the velocity vector of the ship in such case it is always necessary to account for some oscillation in most cases the sign of the averaged force and yawing moment is reversed when the uncoupled propulsion is mirrored moreover the sign of the average lateral force seems to be dependent of the loading condition of both propellers and the under keel clearance this can be seen in fig 3 and fig 4 mind that in these figures the function is made non dimensional with only the thrust of the propellers that are working in an even quadrant in other words coupled operation 1 1 both propellers have the same propeller rate as they are coupled y p t ε t p p s t p s s ss operation 2 2 in the ss operation the starboard side propeller is varied at different constant propeller rates giving varying apparent advance angles ε while the port side propeller is kept at the given constant propeller rate in the ps operation the opposite is chosen y p t ε t p s s ps operation y p t ε t p p s in this first iteration the action of the propeller operating in the 1st or 3rd quadrant is considered void moreover in a symmetric setup the lateral action is considered zero at zero drift angle this important assumption enables to control the number of variables in the present analysis different observations can be made for quadrants 2 and 4 in the fourth quadrant the measurements show significant scatter around a zero value when both propellers are coupled see for instance fig 3a if only one of both propellers is operating in the fourth quadrant the results tend to be grouped towards one side of the horizontal axis the discussion will focus on the starboard propeller operating in the fourth quadrant the average lateral force is negative thus directed towards portside the effect is larger for larger rates of the portside propeller operating in the third quadrant in uncoupled mode the above is valid within the range of 20 100 ukc but at 10 ukc fig 3d a sign reversal is observed for the smaller portside propeller rates the average lateral force increases in magnitude with decreasing under keel clearances the observations can be mirrored in case the portside propeller operates in the fourth quadrant if the starboard propeller operates in the second quadrant fig 4 at large propeller loading angles the dimensionless average lateral force component is more negative thus the lateral force due to propeller action is directed towards starboard side negative thrust in the second quadrant an effect of the rate of the portside propeller on the average lateral force is present but is not clear and will therefore be omitted in the mathematical modelling at smaller propeller loading i e smaller ε angles the trend is reversed and the average lateral force becomes more positive again the observations can be mirrored in case the portside propeller operates in the second quadrant the given trends can be modelled in a tabular way by the suggested mirrored curves respectively in green and red dashed lines for ss and ps operation in fig 4 although the trends can be captured in the second quadrant this is not the case for the fourth quadrant the assumption that the propeller operating in the uneven quadrant has no effect is only valid if that propeller operates in the 1st quadrant if one of the propellers is turning astern while the other one is not turning a significant side force is measured in other words in a combination

i ε s s t s s s a model suggestion is represented in fig 5 the trends are now more like the trends observed for the second quadrant fig 3 portside or starboard action is mirrored around the horizontal axis the deviations from the horizontal axis increase with decreasing under keel clearance and decreasing propeller loadings the new curves were obtained using the values for y p t i i i ε shown in fig 6 3 3 oscillations in even quadrants 3 3 1 oscillation amplitude fig 7 and fig 8 show the effect of the uncoupled operation on the oscillation amplitude respectively in the fourth and in the second quadrant mind that in these figures the function is made non dimensional with only the thrust of the propellers that are working in an even quadrant in other words coupled operation y p t a ε t p p s t p s s ss operation y p t a ε t p s s ps operation y p t a ε t p p s the following observations can be made the oscillation amplitude is relatively larger in uncoupled operation especially at smaller propeller loading angles an exception is the fourth quadrant at 10 ukc the differences seem to be less or even opposite if the adjacent propeller turning in the first or third quadrant has a larger propeller rate as expected there is no significant difference between the starboard side and the portside as for the average force magnitudes the oscillation amplitudes increase with decreasing ukc compared to the oscillation amplitude in coupled operation one could say that if only one propeller is operating in the even quadrant this propeller is responsible for 75 of that oscillation amplitude and when the other propeller starts operating in the same even quadrant another 25 is added 3 3 2 oscillation frequency the dimensionless oscillation frequency has been plotted in fig 9 and fig 10 the values on the graph were limited to dimensionless frequency values below 2 corresponding to an oscillation period of 2 s or above 17 s in full scale in general similar frequencies are observed for the coupled and uncoupled condition this suggests the use of the dominant frequency to predict the oscillations however at large speeds and large propeller rates significant differences occur between the starboard and portside propeller action to put these observations in perspective the time traces of tests g0101a02 cea200 and g0101a02 cea300 35 ukc ε 168 have been plotted in fig 11 one can observe that at large speeds and large propeller rates the signal has higher order harmonics which are not included in the present model the time traces show however a similar behaviour mirrored around the horizontal axis fig 11d indicates that again the oscillation amplitude is almost the same whether a single propeller or the two propellers are operating in the second quadrant 3 4 proposed method 3 4 1 requirements in order to have a symmetric force balance during multiple quadrant operation the following has to be satisfied for the sway force and yawing moment the average force or moment needs to have an equal value but a different sign when operating in portside or starboard side as the sum of both moments and or forces is computed the resulting average force and or moment needs to be zero in coupled propulsion and sailing on a straight track the oscillation amplitude obtained by even quadrant operation with only one propeller seems more than half the oscillation amplitude obtained with two propellers this feature is not considered because based on the observations with free running tests see 4 2 smaller amplitudes are measured and a 50 50 distribution will be assumed the oscillation amplitudes have the same sign and equal value when operating in portside or starboard side the dominant propeller drives the frequency of the oscillations as can be observed in fig 11 the onset of the oscillations has a different sign when operating in portside or starboard side this can be modelled with the introduction of a phase shift the phase shift will be decided based on the sign of the combined drift yaw motion by convention π 2 will be used for positive angles and π 2 for negative angles at zero drift and yaw angle a discontinuity is needed no phase shift 3 4 2 mathematical formulation the equation fulfilling the above requirements is 3 10 f p f p t p s ε f p t a ε cos ω ε t ϕ ε π 2 k 3 t p p s f p t s s ε f p t a ε cos ω ε t ϕ ε π 2 k 3 t p s s with f p t a ε determined based on coupled operation and k 3 an appropriate value depending on whether a moment and or an even quadrant is considered an appropriate regression methodology is needed to determine the coefficients f p t p s ε and f p t s s ε in uncoupled mode with 3 11 ε m a x ε p s ε s s in the second quadrant the measured force or moment can be entirely ascribed to the propeller in the second quadrant 3 12 f p t p s ε f p s ε t p p s 0 t p s s in the fourth quadrant the measured force or moment is dependent of the other propeller 3 13 f p t p s ε p s g p s ε p s t p p s h p s ε s s t p s s mirror symmetry is then achieved if 3 14 f s s ε f p s ε 3 15 g s s ε g p s ε 3 16 h s s ε h p s ε the latter function requires that the propulsion induced force in the third quadrant becomes a function of ε as well in practice regression analysis revealed that g and h counteracted each other therefore h has to be considered constant 3 17 f p t p s ε p s g p s ε p s t p p s h p s t p s s to achieve mirror symmetry for sway and yaw the following conditions have to be met in the coupled propulsion case the average propulsion induced forces and moments are equal to zero when sailing on a straight line drift and yaw are either 0 or 180 the average propulsion induced forces and moments are equal to zero in the second and fourth quadrant the effect of drift and yaw angle show mirror symmetry for a ship equipped with two rudders and two propellers the model for the total propulsion induced forces has then to be extended as follows the sway force is used as an example 3 18 y p y p

the actual sign of the phase shift is the same as the sign of the combined yaw and drift angle this should be applicable for single propeller ships as well the average values for portside and starboard side have mirror symmetry around the average case of coupled propulsion the situation is more complex for the uncoupled propulsion case the onset of the oscillations has a different sign when operating in portside or starboard side at zero drift and yaw angle a discontinuity can be introduced no phase shift once the phase is fixed it should not further change during the simulation at least while being in an even quadrant with one or both propellers the question is when the phase should be fixed because when entering an even quadrant either the propeller rate or the ship s velocity is infinitesimally small especially the latter makes it complicated to decide on a correct sign of β γ as a compromise the simulation program fixes the phase at 1s after having entered an even quadrant at that point the propeller rate and or the ship s velocity are still small to cause significant oscillatory forces on the ship but already large enough to have a correct decision about the sign of the phase shift based on β γ the mathematical model formulation 3 18 accounts for the separate effect of each propeller on the propulsion induced force an additional steady effect y p t p s ε p s and y p t s s ε s s which occurs in case of uncoupled propulsion but disappears in coupled conditions the expression for the propulsion induced yaw moment is similar the steering induced forces do not seem to require additional coupling terms and can be expressed as follows 3 19 y r i 1 a h ε i f y i 3 20 n r i x r a h ε i x h ε i f y i one problem remains namely the transition at zero speed due to the rapidly varying drift and yaw angles there is no sufficient information in the towing tank tests to cope with this therefore the formulation in the ship simulator needed further adaptations an absolute speed limit v lim u 2 v 2 equal to 0 2 m s full scale has been introduced for the computation of the propulsion and steering induced forces once the speed drops below that limit the drift and yaw angles used to evaluate the manoeuvring models are computed as follows 3 21 β comp arctan v sgn u v lim 2 v 2 3 22 γ comp arctan r l p p 2 sgn u v lim 2 v 2 4 comparisons with free running program 4 1 introduction the tests discussed in this section concern on one hand the uncoupled ones mentioned in table 5 where the manoeuvre starts from rest a selection of tests in this table will be discussed propulsion asymmetry at zero rudder angle 01 02 section 4 2 1 combined rudder and propeller asymmetry positive rudder angles 03 06 negative rudder angles 10 13 section 4 2 2 section 4 3 and 4 4 will discuss the conditions covered in table 4 at the same time the manoeuvres were simulated using the formulations described in section 3 4 2 which take more or less the same time multiplied with 75 75 being the scale factor however possible ship wall interaction phenomena were not included to enhance the comparisons the free running tests were also froude scaled to prototype values and t 0 corresponds to the start of the free running condition after captive acceleration 4 2 conditions at zero start speed 4 2 1 propulsion asymmetry at zero rudder angle fig 12 shows the comparison between the available free running tests and the predicted simulation trajectories the trajectories for 10 ukc are shown based on the simulations but are not available based on the free running tests the lateral deviations have been limited to reasonable values which are the limits of the free running trajectories and in order to avoid the effects of ship tank wall interaction which is not included in the present simulation the most noticeable difference is the trajectory at 100 ukc an open question is if the change of course in the free running tests is caused by the tank wall or that the simulation model wrongly predicts this behaviour the trajectories at 20 and 35 are comparable however the motion in lateral direction seems delayed and the track is subjected to more oscillatory behaviour on the simulator the latter is confirmed by the rate of oscillations of the yaw rate which is governed by the oscillation model in the even quadrants the free running tests indicate that oscillations occur but that these are not so dominant as predicted by the simulations or not so dominant as measured during captive model tests it is clear that the captive model tests quasi steady approach is being challenged in the even quadrants turning off the oscillation model clearly reduces the high frequency oscillations as shown in fig 13 4 2 2 asymmetry of both propellers and rudders the comparison between the free running tests and the simulation runs is shown on figs 14 16 for different under keel clearances these tests have not been carried out at 10 ukc the following observations can be made 100 ukc fig 14 during free running tests the ship has a larger tendency to yawing in the positive direction on the simulator the mathematical model is symmetric the low frequency oscillations during the simulations are due to the oscillation model it takes more time on the simulator for tests ka03 ka13 to go in the same direction as in the tank a dead zone of zero yaw rate appears during simulations 35 ukc figs 15 and 20 ukc fig 16 the simulator predicts qualitatively the same tracks but the response is relatively faster in the towing tank the latter seems ascribable to the slow decrease in average yaw rate on the simulator which is not observed in the tank 4 3 conditions at positive start speed 4 3 1 introduction these conditions concern the ones mentioned in table 4 the tests in this table can be further subdivided as coupled propulsion with rudder asymmetry 01 04 propulsion asymmetry at zero rudder angle 05 08 simulations have been carried out in the same way as for the conditions at zero speed 4 3 2 coupled propulsion with rudder asymmetry the tests considered are turning circles executed with only one of the rudders at 35 the motions start in the second quadrant and finish in the third quadrant the results are shown for two water depths in fig 17 and fig 18 3 tracks overlap each other although the mathematical model uses a mirror symmetry assumption the free running tests are characterized by chaotic trajectories partially because the ship sails in its own wake no trend is found in the direction the ship model follows when sailing astern the oscillation amplitudes that occur in the yaw rate are similar in magnitude for both the simulation runs and free running model tests 4 3 3 propulsion asymmetry at zero rudder angle these tests consider the following cases when sailing ahead twisting of the propulsion one propeller operates in the first quadrant the other one in the second quadrant kd05 06 only one propeller works in the first quadrant the other one is stopped kd07 08 such manoeuvres are quite often applied when uncoupled steering on the simulator is used the comparison between the free running tests and the simulation runs is shown in figs 19 22 for each water depth the following observations can be formulated 100 ukc the ship turns in the direction dictated by the moment generated by the positive thrust for free running tests the turning is stronger when the other propeller is stopped the reason seems to be a strongly fluctuating rudder force when both propellers operate in a twisted mode this seems counterintuitive and is not included in the manoeuvring model the manoeuvre is thus well predicted when only one propeller is working however the simulation predicts an even faster turn for the twisted case 35 ukc during free running model tests the ship starts to turn in the opposite direction in the twisted case this is caused by large oscillations of the yaw rate this turning reversal is not included in the simulation model but the initial yaw rates agree well when only one propeller is working the turning direction of the ship is opposite to the direction of the free running tests the turning of the vessel in a direction opposite to what could be expected is a comment which has been mentioned a couple of times during simulation here this process seems to be confirmed during free running tests and should be attributed to extreme shallow water conditions 20 and 10 ukc opposite turns also occur for the free running tests when only one propeller is operated the simulation model and free running tests seem to be more compliant with lower ukc 4 4 conditions at negative start speed coupled propulsion with rudder asymmetry these conditions concern the ones marked by 01 04 mentioned in table 4 or coupled propulsion with rudder asymmetry 01 04 in this case the turning motions start in the fourth quadrant and finish in the first quadrant from figs 23 26 it is clear that the turning behaviour in the 4th quadrant is underpredicted on the simulator the consequence is that the banana shape trajectory from the free running tests is not reproduced on the simulator nevertheless once the ship sails in the first quadrant the yaw rates between the simulations and the free running tests agree in the free running tests however an oscillatory behaviour is observed which is worse with decreasing water depth this is to be ascribed to the fact that the ship model is sailing in its own wake disturbing the manoeuvre but the tracks are less chaotic compared to the runs that started in the second quadrant a peculiar simulation result occurs at 20 ukc fig 25 where all trajectories start in the same direction this is caused by the fact that a small predicted rudder force is overruled by a strong propulsion induced oscillation amplitude which start maximally due to the predicted phase shift 5 conclusions and recommendations both conventional and unconventional captive model tests and free running manoeuvres have been carried out with a twin rudder twin propeller ship where the captive model tests were mainly used to provide input to a new mathematical model which is capable to simulate uncoupled conditions of the propellers and rudders of the vessel the free running tests where then used as a validation for the simulations the observations can be summarized as follows most uncoupled tests considered here the operation of one or both propellers in the even quadrants opposite sign for motion and propeller action which according to the captive model tests and the subsequent simulation model lead to vortex shedding and oscillatory behaviour of the propeller induced forces and moments this oscillatory behaviour is also noticeable on the free running model tests results but in general to a lesser extent in terms of amplitude and periodicity especially for small velocities or in the fourth quadrant in the second quadrant a better prediction capability is noted the turning of the vessel in a direction opposite to what could be expected is a comment which has been mentioned by pilots a couple of times during simulation here this process seems to be confirmed during free running tests and should be attributed to extreme shallow water conditions the average yaw rate in the fourth quadrant is underpredicted due to an underprediction of the rudder forces this issue is solved by considering the vortex ring state effect to the inflow of the rudder in the fourth quadrant nevertheless the correct mathematical modelling of the behaviour of the ship in this quadrant remains a point of attention for further research a correct definition of the phase shifts and the onset of the oscillations is crucial to achieve mirror symmetry in uncoupled conditions covering different quadrants at the same time the oscillation model based on captive model tests should be carefully considered and possibly softened in general it seems that the simulation model tends to overpredict the amplitude and the periodicity of the oscillations that occur this is most probably due to the fact that the quasi steady approach does not work for captive tests in these quadrants future free running tests will repeat tests in the second and fourth quadrant but for a ship equipped with a single rudder and propeller in order to minimize the number of parameters and to confirm the present observations at the same time tests will be reproduced with computational fluid dynamics to investigate specific flow phenomena credit

20468,the sediment transport phenomenon is considered to be an important factor in improving coastline hydraulic performance this research studied the effects of long waves as simulated solitary waves on the sediment transport to estimate the sediment transport rate in different coastal forest cover cfc densities to examine how trees altered the wave characteristics artificial trees were used experimentally to simulate the aligned and staggered configurations in totally 32 cover densities and 3 different wave heights results revealed that the cfc could averagely reduce the total sediment transport rate by up to 41 18 in the densest case by 54 and 45 in staggered and aligned configurations respectively compared with the no cfc case the optimum density limit with maximum reduction effect was determined as 40 50 for the staggered and 70 80 for the aligned pattern the configuration effects on the cfc efficiency were also investigated and showed the superiority of the zigzag configuration over the aligned arrangement this study also used the laboratory data to develop two equations for calculating the sediment transport rate in the presence of coastal cover keywords coast long wave sediment solitary forest 1 introduction ecosystem and environment protection of the coasts have been of great importance due to the growing number of human populations living in coastal areas the sediment transport phenomenon caused by coastal long waves can affect many hydraulic systems and coastal structures the erosion and scouring resulted from coastal waves even with relatively low heights can seriously damage the foundations of buildings roads and highways and coastal structures such as embankments coastal protection has evolved from structural methods to coastal enhancement approaches different mechanisms include preventing of waves entering the area by redirecting them to the sea and damping of wave energy by breaking waves and creating turbulence in porous structures aid of the nature in coastal protection from natural disasters has attracted the attention of researchers because of economical biological and esthetical reasons thuy et al 2009 coastal forest is a nature based solution with effective roles in trapping the sediment and reducing its transport vastila and jarvela 2018 it dampens the wave intensity morris et al 2018 moller et al 2014 sundar et al 2011 and reduces waves destructive impacts on natural shores and coastal defense structures leonardi et al 2018 moller et al 2014 yin et al 2017 temmerman et al 2013 the nature based coastal defense strategies have been approved to be more effective than only conventional structures zhu et al 2020 the results of a laboratory study by igarashi and tanaka 2018 showed that combination of embankments and coastal forest could reduce the wave force by up to 80 compared with only structural methods several field studies have confirmed the reducing effect of mangrove pine and pandanus odoratissimus trees in emergent or submerge condition on see waves energy tanaka et al 2014 thuy et al 2009 danielsen et al 2005 the cfc in rigid or flexible forms affects the flow dynamic and the sediment transport chen et al 2020 västilä and järvelä 2018 wang et al 2015 and consequently reduces the coastal bed erosion chen et al 2012 results of the experimental studies esteban et al 2020 fathi moghadam et al 2018 romdhane et al 2018 lou et al 2018 field studies chen et al 2018 fan et al 2006 mazda et al 2006 and numerical studies nardin et al 2018 tang et al 2017 vu et al 2017 maza et al 2015 show that the vegetation cover creates a drag and a resisting force against the flow passage leading to wave damping and sediment accumulation trapping and settling the coastal forest controls the sediment by changing flow hydrodynamic properties understanding of which is important for examining how the coastal forest affects the drag force and turbulence severity nepf 1999 2000 the coastal forest induced drag force reduces the average flow velocity and thus increases the sedimentation as well as the flow depth and the residence time in cfc rashedunnabi and tanaka 2020 husrin et al 2012 and post cfc rashedunnabi and tanaka 2020 augustin et al 2009 these findings were confirmed by romdhane et al 2018 västilä and järvelä 2018 tanaka and onai 2017 yin et al 2017 demonstrated that a more compacted vegetation generates more resistance against the wave flow to the coast and thus reduces the flow rate significantly a study on submerged vegetation by ros et al 2014 and zhang et al 2020 also showed more reduction in sediment transport in high density vegetation covers the literature review shows the increased trapping efficiency in the presence of coastal forest however the conducted studies have mainly focused on subtidal or submerged vegetation neglecting the effects of terrestrial forest cover the current study aims to fill this gap by examining the effects of terrestrial forest cover characteristics such as configuration density and height on waves structure and hence on sediment transport rate since a correct estimation of sediment transport rate enables a good prediction of the coast morphological variations and their effects on the structure of littoral zones this study first examines how the sediment transport rate is influenced by cfc and then applies the acquired data to propose two equations for calculating it in the presence of forest cover to avoid additional coastal protection costs achieving the maximum forest cover effectiveness is also considered 2 materials and methods 2 1 dimensional analysis important physical variables in coastal sediment transport rate are presented in table 1 the dimensionless parameters were extracted as eq 1 by using buckingham π theory and eliminating constant and no effect parameters during the experiments 1 f 1 ρ w h v μ w v h g ρ w v 2 h σ τ v ρ w v 2 ξ e ρ w v 2 q l s v h 2 f ρ

considered to be independent of the re reynolds number kouwen and fathi moghadam 2000 fathi moghadam and kouwen 1997 the froude number is not considered for the unsteady case in this study the weber number is insignificant here due to the flow depth two dimensionless parameters τ v ρ w v 2 and ξ e ρ w v 2 were simplified together to eliminate the overlapping effect of the velocity in analysis dividing the seventh by the eighth parameter the drag coefficient cd was achieved f ρ w a p v 2 c d but was neglected because of the presence of d v and its overlapping effect the dimensionless parameter h v h was also neglected due to repeated effect on τ v the dimensionless ratio m v m s is the sediment transported in the presence of cover which is equal to sediment transport rate reduction and therefore was not investigated separately finally eq 2 was obtained as follows by neglecting no less effect parameters and simplifying their combination 2 q l s v h 2 f 2 τ v ξ e d 50 h

and scale of 1 50 heller 2011 the cfc flexibility was obtained using the formula of ξ e n f 1 2 m s h v proposed by fathi moghadam 1996 where n f 1 2 is the square of the first mode frequency resonance t 2 and m s is the tree mass m in this study the average of ξ e was 6 5 n m2 to determine the force absorption area a p the cfc was photographed fig 1 a drawn as a polygon and divided proportionally into 25 equal parts along the vertical axis of the cover using the tree diameter and the height of the wave reaching the trees in each row a 0 force absorption area of each tree fig 1 c was calculated and multiplied by the number of trees in each row to obtain the total area a p was then determined by adding the total areas of all rows together cover density was calculated using the average shading area fig 1 b a total number of 32 different tree layouts was designed to study staggered s and aligned a configurations table 2 experiments were performed first in the absence of cfc and then with different configurations of cfc table 2 as seen in fig 2 to estimate the shear stress due to cfc τ v eq 3 presented by nardin et al 2016 was used as follows 3 τ v 1 2 ρ c d d s d h v v v 2 where c d is the drag coefficient d s is the stem density number of stems per unit area d is the diameter of trees h v is the cover height and v v is the forest internal velocity considering the test types and the flexible cover laying method used here d s was replaced with d v forest density and multiplied by c s a coefficient called stem number for forests with various cover densities resulting in eq 4 for finding the cover caused shear stress as follows 4 τ v 1 2 ρ c d c s d v h v v v 2 c s l g l x 1 w g l y 1 w g l g d where lg is the forest length parallel to wave direction and wg is the forest width perpendicular to wave direction 2 3 experiment steps and measurement equipment 2 3 1 experiment steps as detailed in fig 3 a flume with a metal floor and plexiglas walls was applied for performing the experimental model the model consisted of a 2 m wave tank 2 m coastal sediments and 1 m coast area the term shallow water or long waves refer to waves with very long wavelengths even in very deep waters according to the small amplitude wave theory the wave velocity in shallow waters depends only on the water depth dean and dalrymple 1991 hence long waves are often modeled as solitary waves either physically or theoretically as a good approximation of long nearshore waves guyenne and grilli 2006 here the solitary wave is generated by creating a height difference on both sides of the wave generating gate of supply tank followed by its sudden opening this method of wave generating has also been used in some experimental studies ratnasooriya et al 2008 fathi moghadam et al 2018 depending on the wave height water depth near the coastline and coast slope a wave either breaks before reaching or on the coastline or passes without breaking sorensen 2006 this study attempts to ensure experimentally that when waves advance in shallow water areas they break in front of the flat coast using the froude number similarity wave heights generated in this study were 6 9 and 12 cm 1 50 scale to model the sediment transport the floor of the flume was covered with erodible sedimentary materials sand particles with average diameter of 300 μm close to the sediment size used by mu et al 2019 sediment layer thickness of 7 cm and geometric standard deviation of less than 1 3 for particles gradation distribution σ g the sediments were transported to the sediment discharge valve on the floor of the flume end and collected in a certain time after the wave peak samples were immediately kept at 25 c for 36 h to dry under similar conditions and then weighed with a laboratory balance 0 01 gr precision 2 3 2 measurement equipment to study the interactions between waves cfc and sediment the measurement equipment was set up as fig 4 experiment videos were recorded by a high frame rate camera and converted into images which were then analyzed to extract the wave height at each point in the coast area the term of solitary breaking waves used in this study explains waves that break on slope in front of the flat coast the height of the solitary wave should be considered large so that breaking occurs early in front of the coast to measure the wave velocity at the breaking moment the vectrino 3d audio velocimeter acoustic doppler velocimeter adv was applied with a measurement accuracy of 0 5 the waves breaking point was estimated in preliminary experiments section 2 3 and the velocimeter was installed at the flat coast entrance to enable the wave velocity to be recorded at the breaking moment parameters used in this research and their range of changes are listed in table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of cfc densities on sediment transport rate in the littoral zone and determining the optimum density 3 1 1 effects of cfc densities on sediment transport rate here the objective was to determine how density number as an important dimensionless parameter affects the sediment transport status quantitatively fig 5 table 4 shows the ratio of the average sediment transport rate in the presence of cover to that in the absence of cover α q l s for different inflow wave heights in cases a1 a16 and s1 s16 in fact α q l s shows the cover effect on reducing the sediment transport rate compared with the no cfc in percent table 5 compares the sediment transport rate for different cfc models and generally evaluates the efficiency of different cases β q l s shows the densest state efficiency of each configuration compared with its equivalent in terms of the number of different density rows of trees against the flow in other words it shows how different configurations function in relation to each other it can be concluded that different cover densities have considerable roles in sediment transport prevention according to fig 5 when the force increased the lowest rate belonged to the highest density in other words for the same wave height following the increase in density and thus in the drag force and cover resistance against the flow the wave caused sediment transport rate was reduced in general an increase in the inflow wave height and hence in the passing wave velocity and force reduced the rate by 5 81 and 49 74 in respectively the lowest and highest densities compared with the no cover case this means that at the highest studied wave height the cfc model reduced the sediment transport rate by up to 49 74 which reasonably justifies the cover execution in coastal areas the reducing effect of cover density on sediment transport rate is clearly demonstrated in fig 6 and in tables 4 and 5 an increase in density and in number of cover rows and hence in cover resistance against the flow increased the sediment entrapment efficiency of the cfc averagely the recorded values of sediment entrapment efficiency for cases s13 and s4 were 34 45 and 53 61 and for cases a13 and a4 were 26 66 and 50 63 respectively which equal the reduction in the sediment transport rate cover modes with cases a1 a4 and s1 s4 were generally more efficient than other corresponding modes hence they passed the lowest amount of sediment to the post cfc zone due to a higher cover density which increased the force resisting area as an important parameter in the drag force and an inhibitory factor that prevents sediments to move inside the flow 3 1 2 optimal cfc density studying the optimal cover density or in other words achieving the optimal cover performance in reducing sediment transport rate will prevent additional coast protection stabilization costs increased wave energy dissipation and increased drag force following the increased density will raise the sediment entrapment efficiency and thus reduce sediment transport rate here however the sediment transport did not decrease at the same rate as the density increased results suggest that there may be a certain upper limit for density beyond which the reduction rate will be small or negligible in other words since the effects of the front cover rows on sediment transport reduction rate for each density are more than those of the back ones the increased cover density and number of rows can be justified up to a certain limit in the present study adding each tree row reduced the sediment transport rate by 5 25 and 7 39 in s1 s16 and a1 a16 configurations respectively more precisely the sediment transport rate was averagely reduced by 16 88 in the a1 a4 configuration for a density increase of maximum 60 from 40 to 100 results showed that only the first two rows reduced the sediment transport rate by 83 12 and addition of the next three reduced it by 16 88 similarly for a maximum density increase from 40 to 100 in the s1 s4 configuration the sediment transport rate was averagely reduced by 17 86 the first four rows alone reduced the total sediment transport rate by 82 14 while the next six rows reduced it by only 17 86 according to table 6 which shows a summary of sediment transport rate changes following the increasing of row numbers the average reduction of sediment transport rate in the first three rows of a1 a16 was more than that in the next rows the reduction rate from row 3 to 4 was about 5 50 and from 4 to 5 was nearly 6 67 in fact the reduction rate between rows 3 and 5 was about 12 17 but the first three rows alone prevented 87 83 of the total sediment transport this confirms the maximum increase of up to 4 rows and the optimal cover density of 60 80 in these experiments considering one row as the end protection in s1 s16 configuration the average sediment transport rate decreased by 6 70 7 96 8 92 and 4 11 from row 3 to 4 5 to 6 7 to 8 and 9 to 10 respectively however it increased from 4 to 5 6 to 7 and 8 to 9 indicating that the reduction effect alternates between the rows being in the wake zone of the front zone each alternate row allows the next row to have a smaller share in reducing sediment transport rate and this pattern is repeated throughout the cover while the sediment transport reduction rate was only 20 99 between rows 4 and 10 the first four rows alone accounted for 79 01 of the mentioned rate confirming that the maximum increase occurred in up to row 5 considering one as the end protection and that the optimal cover density in the flow situation was 40 50 3 2 extracting the formula to study the mutual effects of the extracted dimensionless parameters on the sediment transport rate and propose a mathematical formula for its estimation parameters with significant effects on the sediment transport rate were determined and finally led to equations 5 and 6 after different dimensional and statistical analyses of the laboratory data 5 q l s v h 2 2 613 10 6 τ v ξ e 0 726 d 50 h 0 5 1000 q l s v h 2 1 6 1000 6 l n q l s v h 2 6 96 2 5 l n

stress due to the cfc drag force ξ e is the vegetation index flexibility and d 50 h is the dimensionless ratio of the average diameter of the sediment particles to the wave height table 7 presents the results of statistical analyses of these equations fig 6 compares the dimensionless sediment transport rate q ls measured by laboratory data with the one calculated by eqs 5 and 6 the correlation between experimental observations and computational data remains very high r 0 80 as the relationship data fall very close to the straight line 45 the existing differences are mainly attributed to laboratory errors and modeling simplifications but since errors lie within an acceptable range according to table 7 they do not question the results accuracy considering laboratory limitations the obtained relations are applicable to a certain sediment size future experiments are required to apply the results to any sediment particle size this study examined the cfc effect on the transport rate of sediments of only one particle size and ignored different sized particles to avoid experiencing difficulties in eroded coasts by inserting different cover densities in the formula the sediment transport rate to the post cfc zone can be obtained and by comparing the figures the appropriate density can be determined for different coastal areas 4 conclusion previous findings have identified the use of tree cover as a prevention method for sediment transport and its destructive effects induced by long waves the current study applied a cfc model and showed that the reducing effect of cfc which justifies its implementation in coastal areas depends largely on its characteristics including configuration density and height based on the experiments performed this study introduced the optimum density a certain increased level of density to which the maximum decrease in sediment transport rate occurs this research finally proposed two parametric equations for estimating the sediment transport rate in the presence of cover using the laboratory results more experimental studies however are needed to formulate the reducing effects of the coastal forest cover on transport rate of sediments with different particle sizes comparing the obtained relationships with real recorded data over an acceptable time period can be a useful guide for coastal management and conservation plans

20468,the sediment transport phenomenon is considered to be an important factor in improving coastline hydraulic performance this research studied the effects of long waves as simulated solitary waves on the sediment transport to estimate the sediment transport rate in different coastal forest cover cfc densities to examine how trees altered the wave characteristics artificial trees were used experimentally to simulate the aligned and staggered configurations in totally 32 cover densities and 3 different wave heights results revealed that the cfc could averagely reduce the total sediment transport rate by up to 41 18 in the densest case by 54 and 45 in staggered and aligned configurations respectively compared with the no cfc case the optimum density limit with maximum reduction effect was determined as 40 50 for the staggered and 70 80 for the aligned pattern the configuration effects on the cfc efficiency were also investigated and showed the superiority of the zigzag configuration over the aligned arrangement this study also used the laboratory data to develop two equations for calculating the sediment transport rate in the presence of coastal cover keywords coast long wave sediment solitary forest 1 introduction ecosystem and environment protection of the coasts have been of great importance due to the growing number of human populations living in coastal areas the sediment transport phenomenon caused by coastal long waves can affect many hydraulic systems and coastal structures the erosion and scouring resulted from coastal waves even with relatively low heights can seriously damage the foundations of buildings roads and highways and coastal structures such as embankments coastal protection has evolved from structural methods to coastal enhancement approaches different mechanisms include preventing of waves entering the area by redirecting them to the sea and damping of wave energy by breaking waves and creating turbulence in porous structures aid of the nature in coastal protection from natural disasters has attracted the attention of researchers because of economical biological and esthetical reasons thuy et al 2009 coastal forest is a nature based solution with effective roles in trapping the sediment and reducing its transport vastila and jarvela 2018 it dampens the wave intensity morris et al 2018 moller et al 2014 sundar et al 2011 and reduces waves destructive impacts on natural shores and coastal defense structures leonardi et al 2018 moller et al 2014 yin et al 2017 temmerman et al 2013 the nature based coastal defense strategies have been approved to be more effective than only conventional structures zhu et al 2020 the results of a laboratory study by igarashi and tanaka 2018 showed that combination of embankments and coastal forest could reduce the wave force by up to 80 compared with only structural methods several field studies have confirmed the reducing effect of mangrove pine and pandanus odoratissimus trees in emergent or submerge condition on see waves energy tanaka et al 2014 thuy et al 2009 danielsen et al 2005 the cfc in rigid or flexible forms affects the flow dynamic and the sediment transport chen et al 2020 västilä and järvelä 2018 wang et al 2015 and consequently reduces the coastal bed erosion chen et al 2012 results of the experimental studies esteban et al 2020 fathi moghadam et al 2018 romdhane et al 2018 lou et al 2018 field studies chen et al 2018 fan et al 2006 mazda et al 2006 and numerical studies nardin et al 2018 tang et al 2017 vu et al 2017 maza et al 2015 show that the vegetation cover creates a drag and a resisting force against the flow passage leading to wave damping and sediment accumulation trapping and settling the coastal forest controls the sediment by changing flow hydrodynamic properties understanding of which is important for examining how the coastal forest affects the drag force and turbulence severity nepf 1999 2000 the coastal forest induced drag force reduces the average flow velocity and thus increases the sedimentation as well as the flow depth and the residence time in cfc rashedunnabi and tanaka 2020 husrin et al 2012 and post cfc rashedunnabi and tanaka 2020 augustin et al 2009 these findings were confirmed by romdhane et al 2018 västilä and järvelä 2018 tanaka and onai 2017 yin et al 2017 demonstrated that a more compacted vegetation generates more resistance against the wave flow to the coast and thus reduces the flow rate significantly a study on submerged vegetation by ros et al 2014 and zhang et al 2020 also showed more reduction in sediment transport in high density vegetation covers the literature review shows the increased trapping efficiency in the presence of coastal forest however the conducted studies have mainly focused on subtidal or submerged vegetation neglecting the effects of terrestrial forest cover the current study aims to fill this gap by examining the effects of terrestrial forest cover characteristics such as configuration density and height on waves structure and hence on sediment transport rate since a correct estimation of sediment transport rate enables a good prediction of the coast morphological variations and their effects on the structure of littoral zones this study first examines how the sediment transport rate is influenced by cfc and then applies the acquired data to propose two equations for calculating it in the presence of forest cover to avoid additional coastal protection costs achieving the maximum forest cover effectiveness is also considered 2 materials and methods 2 1 dimensional analysis important physical variables in coastal sediment transport rate are presented in table 1 the dimensionless parameters were extracted as eq 1 by using buckingham π theory and eliminating constant and no effect parameters during the experiments 1 f 1 ρ w h v μ w v h g ρ w v 2 h σ τ v ρ w v 2 ξ e ρ w v 2 q l s v h 2 f ρ w h 2 v 2 a p h 2 h v h d 50 h d v m v m s 0 the first three parameters in eq 1 are the reynolds froude and weber numbers respectively the flow which through cfc is in the fully turbulent zone is considered to be independent of the re reynolds number kouwen and fathi moghadam 2000 fathi moghadam and kouwen 1997 the froude number is not considered for the unsteady case in this study the weber number is insignificant here due to the flow depth two dimensionless parameters τ v ρ w v 2 and ξ e ρ w v 2 were simplified together to eliminate the overlapping effect of the velocity in analysis dividing the seventh by the eighth parameter the drag coefficient cd was achieved f ρ w a p v 2 c d but was neglected because of the presence of d v and its overlapping effect the dimensionless parameter h v h was also neglected due to repeated effect on τ v the dimensionless ratio m v m s is the sediment transported in the presence of cover which is equal to sediment transport rate reduction and therefore was not investigated separately finally eq 2 was obtained as follows by neglecting no less effect parameters and simplifying their combination 2 q l s v h 2 f 2 τ v ξ e d 50 h d v 2 2 coastal forest cover related calculations to model the cfc a flexible artificial polyethylene structure was applied to simulate the black pine tree pinaceae species with the height of 25 cm and scale of 1 50 heller 2011 the cfc flexibility was obtained using the formula of ξ e n f 1 2 m s h v proposed by fathi moghadam 1996 where n f 1 2 is the square of the first mode frequency resonance t 2 and m s is the tree mass m in this study the average of ξ e was 6 5 n m2 to determine the force absorption area a p the cfc was photographed fig 1 a drawn as a polygon and divided proportionally into 25 equal parts along the vertical axis of the cover using the tree diameter and the height of the wave reaching the trees in each row a 0 force absorption area of each tree fig 1 c was calculated and multiplied by the number of trees in each row to obtain the total area a p was then determined by adding the total areas of all rows together cover density was calculated using the average shading area fig 1 b a total number of 32 different tree layouts was designed to study staggered s and aligned a configurations table 2 experiments were performed first in the absence of cfc and then with different configurations of cfc table 2 as seen in fig 2 to estimate the shear stress due to cfc τ v eq 3 presented by nardin et al 2016 was used as follows 3 τ v 1 2 ρ c d d s d h v v v 2 where c d is the drag coefficient d s is the stem density number of stems per unit area d is the diameter of trees h v is the cover height and v v is the forest internal velocity considering the test types and the flexible cover laying method used here d s was replaced with d v forest density and multiplied by c s a coefficient called stem number for forests with various cover densities resulting in eq 4 for finding the cover caused shear stress as follows 4 τ v 1 2 ρ c d c s d v h v v v 2 c s l g l x 1 w g l y 1 w g l g d where lg is the forest length parallel to wave direction and wg is the forest width perpendicular to wave direction 2 3 experiment steps and measurement equipment 2 3 1 experiment steps as detailed in fig 3 a flume with a metal floor and plexiglas walls was applied for performing the experimental model the model consisted of a 2 m wave tank 2 m coastal sediments and 1 m coast area the term shallow water or long waves refer to waves with very long wavelengths even in very deep waters according to the small amplitude wave theory the wave velocity in shallow waters depends only on the water depth dean and dalrymple 1991 hence long waves are often modeled as solitary waves either physically or theoretically as a good approximation of long nearshore waves guyenne and grilli 2006 here the solitary wave is generated by creating a height difference on both sides of the wave generating gate of supply tank followed by its sudden opening this method of wave generating has also been used in some experimental studies ratnasooriya et al 2008 fathi moghadam et al 2018 depending on the wave height water depth near the coastline and coast slope a wave either breaks before reaching or on the coastline or passes without breaking sorensen 2006 this study attempts to ensure experimentally that when waves advance in shallow water areas they break in front of the flat coast using the froude number similarity wave heights generated in this study were 6 9 and 12 cm 1 50 scale to model the sediment transport the floor of the flume was covered with erodible sedimentary materials sand particles with average diameter of 300 μm close to the sediment size used by mu et al 2019 sediment layer thickness of 7 cm and geometric standard deviation of less than 1 3 for particles gradation distribution σ g the sediments were transported to the sediment discharge valve on the floor of the flume end and collected in a certain time after the wave peak samples were immediately kept at 25 c for 36 h to dry under similar conditions and then weighed with a laboratory balance 0 01 gr precision 2 3 2 measurement equipment to study the interactions between waves cfc and sediment the measurement equipment was set up as fig 4 experiment videos were recorded by a high frame rate camera and converted into images which were then analyzed to extract the wave height at each point in the coast area the term of solitary breaking waves used in this study explains waves that break on slope in front of the flat coast the height of the solitary wave should be considered large so that breaking occurs early in front of the coast to measure the wave velocity at the breaking moment the vectrino 3d audio velocimeter acoustic doppler velocimeter adv was applied with a measurement accuracy of 0 5 the waves breaking point was estimated in preliminary experiments section 2 3 and the velocimeter was installed at the flat coast entrance to enable the wave velocity to be recorded at the breaking moment parameters used in this research and their range of changes are listed in table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of cfc densities on sediment transport rate in the littoral zone and determining the optimum density 3 1 1 effects of cfc densities on sediment transport rate here the objective was to determine how density number as an important dimensionless parameter affects the sediment transport status quantitatively fig 5 table 4 shows the ratio of the average sediment transport rate in the presence of cover to that in the absence of cover α q l s for different inflow wave heights in cases a1 a16 and s1 s16 in fact α q l s

by 5 81 and 49 74 in respectively the lowest and highest densities compared with the no cover case this means that at the highest studied wave height the cfc model reduced the sediment transport rate by up to 49 74 which reasonably justifies the cover execution in coastal areas the reducing effect of cover density on sediment transport rate is clearly demonstrated in fig 6 and in tables 4 and 5 an increase in density and in number of cover rows and hence in cover resistance against the flow increased the sediment entrapment efficiency of the cfc averagely the recorded values of sediment entrapment efficiency for cases s13 and s4 were 34 45 and 53 61 and for cases a13 and a4 were 26 66 and 50 63 respectively which equal the reduction in the sediment transport rate cover modes with cases a1 a4 and s1 s4 were generally more efficient than other corresponding modes hence they passed the lowest amount of sediment to the post cfc zone due to a higher cover density which increased the force resisting area as an important parameter in the drag force and an inhibitory factor that prevents sediments to move inside the flow 3 1 2 optimal cfc density studying the optimal cover density or in other words achieving the optimal cover performance in reducing sediment transport rate will prevent additional coast protection stabilization costs increased wave energy dissipation and increased drag force following the increased density will raise the sediment entrapment efficiency and thus reduce sediment transport rate here however the sediment transport did not decrease at the

increase of up to 4 rows and the optimal cover density of 60 80 in these experiments considering one row as the end protection in s1 s16 configuration the average sediment transport rate decreased by 6 70 7 96 8 92 and 4 11 from row 3 to 4 5 to 6 7 to 8 and 9 to 10 respectively however it increased from 4 to 5 6 to 7 and 8 to 9 indicating that the reduction effect alternates between the rows being

20469,quantitative investigation of wave attenuation by flexible vegetation is an increasingly prominent area in wave mechanics given that the existing xbeach non hydrostatic wave model can only simulate wave attenuation by rigid vegetation a mechanical model for simulating submerged flexible vegetation dynamics driven by waves and a coupling simulation method between the flexible vegetation dynamic model and the xbeach non hydrostatic wave model were proposed to assess the performance of the proposed coupled model a wave flume experiment was conducted this study demonstrates the validity of the new flexible vegetation dynamic model in simulating forces and motions of a single submerged flexible stem the validation between modeled results and experimental data shown that the coupled model is capable of reproducing the wave attenuation in the presence of flexible vegetation the above results further indicate that the coupling implementation is valid and reliable besides this study further confirms that flexible vegetation is able to attenuate wave height and the elasticity modulus of flexible vegetation plays a vital role in wave attenuation when all the other variables are invariant this study can broaden the application of the xbeach model and provide technical support for the engineering practice of coastal nature based solutions keywords wave attenuation flexible vegetation xbeach numerical simulation 1 introduction coastal vegetation such as spartina alterniflora and seagrass are being increasingly recognized as unique and crucial for coastal protection it can attenuate wave energy thus decreasing wave height barbier et al 2008 lashley et al 2020 möller et al 2014 tang et al 2019 as well as wave setup dean and bender 2006 van rooijen et al 2016 and is also capable of mitigating storm surge hazard guannel et al 2015 narayan et al 2017 and enhancing the ability to resist coastal erosion and sea level rise duarte et al 2013 kirwan and megonigal 2013 vu et al 2017 thus protecting coastal zone moreover coastal vegetation has several ecological functions such as conservation and restoration of the ecological environment and biodiversity ecological nature based solutions have prominent ecological benefits compared to conventional coastal engineering narayan et al 2016 sutton grier et al 2015 temmerman et al 2013 wave attenuation is the best known capability of vegetation among the above many coastal protection and ecological benefits with the increasingly prominent risk of coastal hazards along with the continuous promotion of sustainable development yin et al 2017 2020 wave attenuation by vegetation has propelled to the forefront in investigations of wave mechanics to support the utilization of nature based solutions as natural or hybrid solutions for coastal protection extensive research has been conducted worldwide by field measurement laboratory flume experiment and numerical simulation as the most direct and convincible research approach field measurement conducted in china cao et al 2016 yang et al 2012 thailand horstman et al 2014 united kingdom möller et al 1999 netherlands vuik et al 2016 willemsen et al 2020 sweden lövstedt and larson 2010 colombia vanegas g et al 2019 and the united states garzon et al 2019 jadhav et al 2013 have demonstrated and quantified the wave attenuating capacity of spartina alterniflora phragmites australis mangrove etc meanwhile considerable variability of wave attenuation has also been revealed in these field studies owing to disparate vegetation characteristics as well as wave conditions for instance vanegas g et al 2019 recorded a wave height reduction of 7 14 per meter while yang et al 2012 documented values of 4 2 55 and 1 55 per meter across the first 7 5 m 20 m and 51 m of the marsh although field measurement studies have enormously improved the understanding of wave attenuating capacity of vegetation it is still limited by the wide variation of wave and vegetation conditions as well as the difficulties and the costs of continuous measurements the advantage of laboratory research is that under controlled conditions physical phenomena and test results are reliable compared with field studies it is more convenient to investigate the influence of a single variable on wave attenuation through laboratory research numerous laboratory studies have demonstrated that vegetation properties flexibility height distribution density etc wave conditions water depth wave height wave period etc together with wave and current condition play a vital role in vegetation induced wave attenuation chen et al 2018 he et al 2019 hu et al 2014 losada et al 2016 luhar et al 2017 paul et al 2016 rupprecht et al 2017 tan et al 2019 van veelen et al 2020 wang et al 2019 nevertheless this method did not eliminate of the constraints from the limited water depth and wave generation as well as it did not dismiss the scale effects especially the scale effect of the elastic modulus of vegetation the above researches have laid a solid foundation for numerical studies as both field and laboratory research are constantly developing and providing key verification data numerical simulation has become an essential method for investigating the interaction mechanism between vegetation and waves previous numerical studies have focused more on rigid rather than flexible vegetation under the assumption of rigid vegetation the formulas derived from dalrymple et al 1984 and mendez and losada 2004 have been incorporated in several phase resolving e g boussinesq equations swash nonlinear shallow water equations xbeach nonhydrostatic cao et al 2015 huang et al 2011 suzuki et al 2019 tang et al 2017 van rooijen et al 2016 and phase averaged wave models e g swan cms wave xbeach surfbeat chen and zhao 2012 suzuki et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 thus determining vegetation force and wave energy dissipation by vegetation respectively nonetheless flexible vegetation may move like a cantilever or a whip driven by waves which is entirely different from the rigid vegetation the bending motion of flexible vegetation leads to a more complex wave attenuation mechanism than rigid vegetation the wave attenuation capacity of flexible vegetation has been proven considerably weaker than that of rigid vegetation by some studies riffe et al 2011 van veelen et al 2020 van veelen et al 2020 demonstrated that flexible vegetation can even attenuate wave up to 70 less than rigid vegetation inadequate representation of vegetation properties in wave models may undermine their capability in predicting wave attenuation process hence it ought to simulate wave attenuation based on reproducing the forces and the motion of flexible vegetation several numerical studies have been carried out on solving the motion of a single submerged flexible stem based on different physical assumptions for the convenience and feasibility of the calculation simplification and generalization of the existing flexible vegetation have been generally conducted flexible vegetation such as spartina alterniflora and seagrass are generally considered to be an idealized material the damped oscillatory dynamic equation has been commonly utilized to solve horizontal deflection of a single stem denny et al 1998 ikeda et al 2001 maza et al 2013 zhu and chen 2015 this method assumes the stem deflection to be so small that the vertical motion is ignored so it follows that this approach does not apply to extreme deflection of a stem such as the nonlinear whip like motion observed repeatedly in seagrass under realistic waves to represent the nonlinear bending deflection during the bending process of a single flexible stem the following researches generally consider a single flexible stem as a series of continuous uniform and small scale cylinders or rectangular thin plate elements coupled with the elastic cantilever beam theory the wave forced motion of a submerged flexible stem can be numerically calculated four kinematic regimes of elastic blades in oscillatory flow have been introduced by leclercq and de langre 2018 with a systematic numerical investigation dynamic characteristics of a single flexible stem driven by waves are a function of vegetation properties as well as wave induced forces such as the drag force the skin friction and the inertial force although several studies disregarded certain forces for simplification jacobsen et al 2019 mullarney and henderson 2010 to consider large stem deflection recent numerical studies tend to solve physically intuitive dynamic equation directly with finite element chen and zou 2019 o connor and revell 2019 and finite difference dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 leclercq and de langre 2018 luhar and nepf 2016 methods in the models developed by dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 zeller et al 2014 luhar and nepf 2016 and zhu et al 2020 a single flexible stem was discretized into a series of rigid segments stem dynamic was then determined through solving a system of ordinary differential equations which was derived from local force and moment balances for each stem segment wave forced bending deflection characteristic of a single flexible stem has been appropriately reproduced by the above studies thus laying a foundation for simulating wave attenuation by flexible vegetation wave attenuation by flexible vegetation stems from the interaction between wave and flexible vegetation bending effect of flexible vegetation is the dominating factor for wave attenuation by vegetation several attempts have been made on simple simulation of wave attenuation by flexible vegetation such as increasing bottom friction in wave models möller et al 1999 smith et al 2016 and utilizing rigid vegetation models with modified drag coefficient or effective length beudin et al 2017 houser et al 2014 luhar et al 2017 although these approaches are generally simpler notable differences exist between these modified empirical formulas based on different sample data compared with these methods coupled modeling of flexible vegetation and waves describes the physical phenomena more realistically based on the damped oscillatory movement equation maza et al 2013 incorporated the drag force by flexible vegetation into the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations for modeling wave attenuation zhu and chen 2015 also utilized the damped oscillatory movement equation to calculate vegetation induced drag and inertia which were introduced into the nonhydrostatic wave model chen and zou 2019 extended the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with the drag force the inertia force and the added mass by solving a linear momentum conservation equation based on the euler bernoulli beam theory a new work factor and a drag coefficient formula van veelen et al 2021 successfully predicted wave damping by quasi flexible coastal vegetation bending effects of flexible vegetation were all taken into consideration in these modeling studies nonetheless the ordinary differential equation method based on all local force and moment balances a relatively new method for simulating flexible vegetation motion directly has not been applied in coupled modeling of flexible vegetation and waves although limitations exist in the flexible dynamic models employed they are useful attempts to numerically deal with wave attenuation caused by flexible vegetation despite the effective insight has been gained in the above mentioned studies the understanding of wave attenuation mechanisms involving flexible vegetation dynamic is still far from complete wave attenuation by flexible vegetation can not be simulated with the widely used xbeach wave model this wave model is selected for coupled modeling owing to its advantage in built in vegetation module along with potential application in simulating ship wave attenuation induced by vegetation meanwhile the ordinary differential equation method based on local force and moment balances has not been applied in the coupled modeling of flexible vegetation and waves in this investigation a simulation algorithm and theory are proposed to model the interaction between waves and flexible vegetation to capture the range of physical mechanisms controlling wave attenuation induced by flexible vegetation a flexible vegetation dynamic model fvdm driven by waves was established first this model was then incorporated in xbeach non hydrostatic wave modes to simulate wave propagation and attenuation through flexible vegetation areas additionally a new flume experiment on wave attenuation by flexible vegetation was conducted for mathematical model validation the results from this study will optimize the simulation theory and method of wave attenuation by vegetation enrich the basic theoretical system of wave propagation and deformation in coastal dynamics and provide scientific basis for new disaster prevention and mitigation engineering methods in the coastal zone 2 methods 2 1 numerical methods 2 1 1 fvdm model under the influence of numerous factors such as climatology flow waves and human activities the forces and motion of flexible vegetation in natural groups are complex natural physical processes containing some law of certainty and uncertainty for the convenience and feasibility of the simulation simplification and generalization of flexible vegetation such as spartina alterniflora and seagrass have been conducted when developing fvdm in this study only the submerged scenarios are considered meanwhile a flexible stem is generalized to be an idealized material which is conformed to continuity assumption homogenization assumption and isotropy assumption simultaneously following some assumptions and calculation methods utilized in previous studies dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 li and xie 2011 luhar and nepf 2016 maza et al 2013 zhu and chen 2015 the established fvdm also has the following assumptions vegetation is assumed to perform a two dimensional planar motion in the direction of wave propagation and vertical plane vegetation is assumed to only bend not fold twist or elongate the effect of shadowing and interference as well as twining scenarios are not considered the physical characteristics force and motion of all vegetation around one grid point are considered to be the same therefore numerous vegetation is represented by a single stem fvdm utilizes a two dimensional coordinate system where the computational x axis is of the direction of wave propagation and the z axis is vertical the corresponding coordinate origin is at the crossing point between the stem axis and bed level the basic physical parameters to describe a single flexible stem in fvdm include stem height l v m the projected area of stem per unit length perpendicular to the wave propagation direction b v m which equals to the diameter of the circular cylinder or the width of the rectangular column thickness d v m elastic modulus e pa and density of stem ρ v kg m3 only l v and b v are considered to describe a traditional rigid stem given the above generalized and idealized stem the force analysis of one stem segment with a length of d s m in the horizontal vertical plane is conducted as illustrated in fig 1 the distance from this segment to the base along the principal axis of the stem is s m and the bending angle of this stem segment relative to the vertical is θ rad on each stem segment act some internal forces and externally distributed forces the internal forces comprise tensile force f t n shearing force f q m and bending moment m nm meanwhile each unit length withstands external forces of gravity buoyancy and wave forces the gravity and buoyancy can be united into the net buoyancy force f b n m which acts in the vertical direction in the meantime combining the effects of wave velocity and acceleration on the stem the wave force is determined using the well known morison equation morison et al 1950 which is a combination of an inertial term caused by wave acceleration and a drag term induced by wave velocity the inertial term f i n m involves the froude krylov force introduced by the unsteady pressure field generated by undisturbed waves and the added mass force arising from an accelerating or decelerating stem move a certain amount of volume of surrounding fluid as it flows through it the stem is considered to be bending when calculating the wave forces on the vegetation under such circumstances the drag term can be divided into the drag force f d n m normal to the axis of the stem and the skin friction f f n m parallel to the stem the internal forces and externally distributed forces acting on one stem with a length of ds are presented in fig 2 through using the morison equation the above mentioned external forces per unit length at the coordinate point of x z are given by 1 f b ρ ρ v g v 1 2 f d 1 2 ρ c d b v u w cos θ w w sin θ x cos θ z sin θ u w cos θ w w sin θ x cos θ z sin θ 3 f f 1 2 ρ c f b v u w sin θ w w cos θ x sin θ z cos θ u w sin θ w w cos θ x sin θ z cos θ 4 f i x ρ v 1 u

skin friction the horizontal and vertical inertial force respectively besides ρ is density of water kg m3 g denotes the acceleration due to gravity m s2 v 1 represents the displacement volume per unit stem length m2 c d is the dimensionless drag coefficient u w and w w represent horizontal and vertical wave velocity m s u w and w w represent horizontal and vertical wave acceleration m s2 x and z

mass coefficient v 2 denotes the reference volume of stem per unit length related to added mass coefficient m2 v 2 equals to v 1 if the cross section of simulated stem is circular while it can be expressed in π b v 2 4 if the cross section is rectangular in compliance with previous studies keulegan and carpenter 1958 luhar and nepf 2016 the governing motion equations in x and z direction which describe the relationship between a stem segment and the forces acting upon it and its motion in response to those forces are given by 6 f x s d s f d cos θ f f sin θ f i x d s ρ v v 1 d s x 7 f z s d s f b f d sin θ f f cos θ f i z d s ρ v v 1 d s z in which f x and f z are the horizontal and vertical internal forces f x f t sin θ f q cos θ n f z f t cos θ f q sin θ n considering ds is closing to zero the moment balance equation is given by f x cos θ m s f z sin θ in which the bending moment can be expressed as the bending angle as m e i θ s follows the differential equation of the deflection curve therefore the shearing force can be written as f q e i 2 θ s 2 substituting the above equations with the expressions of horizontal and vertical internal forces into equation 6 as well as equation 7 together with performing some calculation and arrangement yield the following partial differential equations in x and z direction of fvdm 8 f t s e i 2 θ s 2 θ s f f ρ v v 1 x sin θ z cos θ f i x sin θ f i z cos θ f b cos θ 9 f t θ s e i 3 θ s 3 f d ρ v v 1 x cos θ z sin θ f i x cos θ f i z sin θ f b sin θ the derived mathematical formulations of fvdm are numerically solved by utilizing the well known finite difference method by setting a one dimensional s axis aligned along the stem the solution domain can be discretized in constant computational space and time steps h m and τ s respectively there are a total of m 1 and n 1 nodes in the corresponding directions so h l v m τ t n as t represents the entire computational time s therefore the discrete spatial and temporal coordinates of any node are given by s i i 1 h and t k k 1 τ the index i and k indicate the spatial and temporal location of any grid node and are also used to annotate the discrete variables referring to fig 1 spatial coordinates of a stem in x z plane at the specified time t k can be expressed as x i k h j 1 i 1 sin θ j k and z i k h j 1 i 1 cos θ j k consequently spatial coordinates of a stem in x z plane follow directly from a given bending angle only bending angle θ and tensile force f t are unknown in the governing equations of fvdm in the approximation process the time derivatives in the governing equations are replaced by second order central difference meanwhile for the sake of transforming the nonlinear finite difference scheme to linear scheme a time delay approach is adopted to implement local linearization the time derivatives in the absolute value and quadratic terms are estimated with values at the known time steps as for the approximation of spatial derivative the third order spatial derivative is calculated with values at k 1 instead of k time step the reason for this processing is to avoid a singular coefficient matrix in solving the system of linear algebraic equations substituting the time and spatial derivatives into equation 8 as well as equation 9 and collecting terms yield the following system of linear algebraic equations

bending angle at k 1 time step is influenced by the bending angle at the time steps from 1 to k as well as the tensile force at the k time step it is required to solve the system of linear algebraic equations as a y b when calculating the bending angle at each time step a is a 2m order coefficient matrix b is a 2m 1 right hand side matrix and y is the 2m 1 solution matrix f t 1 k f t 2 k f t m k θ 1 k 1 θ 2 k 1 θ m k 1 this solution matrix is solved by the matrix left division with matlab meanwhile it is necessary to prescribe initial and boundary conditions in the process of solving

flexible stem are obtained subsequently temporal variation of spatial posture can be acquired and the stem velocity and acceleration can be calculated eventually horizontal and vertical total external force at k time step of a single flexible stem are given by 22 f v x sin g l e k i 1 m f d i k cos θ i k f f i k sin θ i k f i x i k h 23 f v z sin g l e k i 1 m f b i k f d i k sin θ i k f f i k cos

segments stem dynamic is then determined through solving a system of ordinary differential equations which is derived from local force and moment balances for each stem segment this method is similar to the approaches applied in dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 zeller et al 2014 luhar and nepf 2016 and zhu et al 2020 besides same external forces were considered in luhar and nepf 2016 zhu et al 2020 and this study however different stem cross sections calculated coordinate system governing equations and calculation methods were applied in these studies compared with existing models this new model is more convenient for incorporation because this model can only use velocities and accelerations simulated by the non hydrostatic wave model there is no need to calculate a series of wave parameters such as the wave radian frequency cauchy number buoyancy parameter and keulegan carpenter number besides since the governing equations and related calculation method of this model do not depend on wave parameters it can be more convenient for simulating vegetation force and motion under combined wave and current it should be noted that flexible vegetation such as spartina alterniflora grows in communities under natural conditions following the assumptions of fvdm along with previous successful studies about rigid mendez and losada 2004 méndez et al 1999 suzuki et al 2011 van rooijen et al 2016 and flexible vegetation li and xie 2011 maza et al 2013 zhu and chen 2015 the time varying total external force of group flexible vegetation f v x g r o u p k f v z g r o u p k n m2 is calculated

xbeach non hydrostatic model xbeach is a two dimensional hydrodynamic and morphodynamic model which calculates wave propagation long waves mean flow sediment transport and morphological changes on curvilinear grids although the non hydrostatic mode of xbeach is capable of simulating two dimensional wave propagation this study focuses on one dimensional wave propagation in cross shore direction this is because flexible vegetation is assumed to perform a two dimensional planar motion in x z plane thus providing only horizontal forces from fvdm to xbeach accordingly governing equations for xbeach non hydrostatic mode are considered one dimensional equivalent as a phase resolving wave model the xbeach non hydrostatic mode solves the depth averaged non linear shallow water equations combined with a non hydrostatic pressure correction term similar to a one layer version of the swash model zijlema et al 2011 the depth averaged dynamic pressure is computed from the mean of the dynamic pressure at the surface and the bed by assuming the dynamic pressure at the surface to be zero and a linear change over depth corresponding one dimensional depth averaged momentum and continuity equations are given by van rooijen et al 2016 26 η t h u x 0 27 u t u u x ν h 2 u x 2 g η x q x τ b x ρ h f v ρ h where t and x are the temporal and horizontal coordinates respectively η is the water level m h represents the local water depth m u denotes depth averaged velocity m s ν h is the horizontal viscosity m2 s q represents the depth averaged dynamic pressure kg m s2 τ b x is the bed shear stresses n m2 f v denotes the stress induced by vegetation n m2 the existing xbeach version 1 23 5387 regards simulated vegetation as rigid objects in this way the depth averaged vegetation force adopted in the above shallow water equations is determined by dalrymple et al 1984 van rooijen et al 2016 28 f v r i g i d 1 2 ρ c d b v l v n v u w u w 2 1 3 coupling between fvdm and xbeach although the force as well as dissipation term caused by rigid vegetation in xbeach has been widely applied and successfully incorporated in several other models cao et al 2015 chen and zhao 2012 suzuki et al 2011 2019 there exists an obvious deficiency in ignoring vegetation bending motion as well as inertial forces to make up for this deficiency and to improve and redevelop the xbeach wave model the fvdm and the xbeach wave model were integrated in this way the formulations of flexible vegetation forces were implemented in the xbeach phase resolving model considering the depth averaged flow velocity and acceleration caused by waves are fully resolved with the non linear shallow water equations fvdm can be forced with information from xbeach non hydrostatic mode meanwhile the time varying total external force of group flexible vegetation computed by fvdm can be directly added to the momentum equations in xbeach non hydrostatic mode however it should be noted that xbeach is depth averaged therefore this model cannot compute vertical profiles of the velocity which are required for fvdm simulations referring to previous studies anderson and smith 2014 dalrymple et al 1984 kobayashi et al 1993 luhar et al 2017 peruzzo et al 2018 it has been assumed that the linear wave theory is valid to calculate the vertical distribution of wave velocity and acceleration in this study however it should be noted that real velocity profiles may greatly differ from linear wave theory aside from the notable inapplicability of linear wave theory for the cases of wave nonlinearity and wave current interactions several studies have also demonstrated that vegetation can alter the velocity structure luhar et al 2010 pujol et al 2013 van rooijen et al 2020 van veelen et al 2020 therefore linear wave theory may not be suitable for the cases of notable wave nonlinearity strong wave current interactions or wave vegetation interactions the above inapplicability was not considered in the coupled model presented in this study similar to all assumptions utilized in fvdm the velocity and acceleration assumption will inevitably result in computational deviation in spite of this this simplifying assumption is still feasible and constructive for calculating velocity field thus providing a feasible approach in simulating wave attenuation by coupled fvdm and xbeach wave model based on this assumption the horizontal velocity is in accordance with cosh k w z distribution while the vertical velocity fits sinh k w z distribution in which k w represents wave number and z denotes the vertical coordinate measured upwards from the seafloor combining the above vertical distribution and time series of depth averaged velocity and acceleration the flow field that varies in time as well as the vertical direction was computed before being passed to fvdm where it was utilized to simulate motion and external force of flexible vegetation meanwhile the xbeach non hydrostatic mode calculates depth averaged momentum equations and vertical vegetation force is not considered in these momentum equations therefore only horizontal vegetation force is provided by fvdm to the xbeach non hydrostatic mode time series of external force in the direction of wave propagation at each grid point calculated by fvdm equation 24 were then adopted to drive xbeach non hydrostatic mode simulations based on the above coupling idea the original vegetation mode in xbeach vegetation f90 is redeveloped to read and use vegetation force file generated by fvdm instead of calculating rigid vegetation drag force the redeveloped xbeach model is then simulated first without vegetation force afterwards parameter input file params txt and simulation output file xboutput nc of xbeach model are utilized to force fvdm simulations vegetation force file calculated by fvdm is then used to drive xbeach model simulations executable program files of both models are called in order by a batch file for execution coupled simulations between fvdm and xbeach non hydrostatic mode can be realized by this method thus simulating wave propagation under the influence of flexible vegetation 2 2 experimental methods to test the performance of the coupled fvdm xbeach model in terms of wave propagation through flexible vegetation on a flat bed this study was carried out in conjunction with a flume experiment on wave attenuation by flexible vegetation the experiment was conducted in an 80 m long 1 m wide and 1 2 m deep wave flume at hohai university the side walls of wave flume are made of glass and the bottom of concrete the effective width of the experiment section is 0 5 m during the experimental stage the flume experimental section is divided by a piece of glass into two 0 5 m wide sections proofreading of incident wave and all experiment tests are conducted in one side of the flume with a width of 0 5 m a piston type wavemaker equipped at the start position of the wave flume can generate both regular waves and irregular waves the motions of the wavemaker paddle are controlled by the wave signal input from a computer additionally a wave absorber is installed at the end of the flume as shown in fig 3 the test section begins at 2 m from the upstream edge of the vegetation field and starting from the upstream edge of the vegetation field 7 wave gages are utilized for measuring wave height distribution the measured wave heights are continuously derived and recorded with a time interval of 9 7 m s each experiment case was repeated at least twice and the averaged data was taken as the representative value to represent the idealized vegetation applied in the fvdm the artificial flexible vegetation model in the experiment was constructed out of polyurethane cylinders with a diameter of 4 mm and a length of 25 cm artificial flexible vegetation has been widely utilized in some previous experimental studies paul et al 2016 van veelen et al 2020 the artificial polyurethane stem has a material density of 1193 kg m3 and an elastic modulus of 0 16 gpa each stem was glued into the holes of a 3 mm thick perforated iron plate which was attached to the flume floor following the alternate distribution mode which has been widely applied hu et al 2014 peruzzo et al 2018 van veelen et al 2020 wu et al 2012 as shown in fig 4 a total number of 1568 artificial flexible vegetation were placed in the 1 5484 square meters vegetation field and the vegetation distribution density is 1012 stems m2 the distance between the wavemaker and the upstream edge of the vegetation field is 37 m and the length of the vegetation field is 3 16 m 2 3 model validation to investigate the reliability of the developed fvdm and the coupled xbeach fvdm model several sets of measurement data of the above new wave flume experiment and some supplementary laboratory data obtained from literature were applied through analyzing the similarity between the numerical results and the physical phenomena the performance of the developed models in simulating the motion and the force of a single submerged flexible stem as well as the wave propagation through flexible vegetation was evaluated the developed fvdm was first tested for the motion and the force of a single submerged flexible stem induced by wave exploiting the flume experiments by luhar and nepf 2016 subsequently using the measurement data of the above mentioned new wave flume experiment the propagation process of waves in the flexible vegetation on the flat river bed in the coupled xbeach fvdm model was verified finally the experiment data of wu et al 2012 was utilized to further verify the coupled model for flexible vegetation effects on wave propagation over a flat bed 2 3 1 modeling a single submerged flexible stem dynamic by fvdm the first validation test is intended to assess the ability of the developed fvdm to simulate the motion and the force of a single submerged flexible stem to achieve this goal the dynamic blade laboratory experiments conducted by luhar and nepf 2016 in the environmental fluid mechanics laboratory at massachusetts institute of technology were used these experiments were carried out in a 24 m long 38 cm wide and 60 cm deep wave flume fitted with a paddle wavemaker a fixed total water depth of 38 cm was adopted the model stem was attached to the load cell via a stainless steel blade holder thus measuring the hydrodynamic force generated by a single submerged flexible stem over a wave cycle moreover the imaging blade motion captured at 60 frames per second was provided by a monochrome charge coupled device ccd camera with the particle image velocimetry the local velocity field was simultaneously measured high density polyethylene and silicon foam were made into model stems with a uniform rectangular cross section the silicon foam stem is 20 cm long 1 9 mm thick and 2 cm wide with an elastic modulus of 500 kpa and a material density equals to 670 kg m3 the three lengths of the high density polyethylene stems are 5 cm 10 cm and 20 cm with a thickness of 0 4 mm a width of 2 cm a material density of 950 kg m3 and an elastic modulus of 0 93 gpa additionally the experimental wave used for model validation has an amplitude of 3 9 cm a period of 2 s and a wave excursion ratio of 6 6 cm the cauchy number for the high density polyethylene stems are from 0 5 to 36 while the cauchy number is 1200 for the 20 cm silicon foam stem the computational grid spacing of fvdm is set as 0 02 s and 0 2 mm in the time and space directions respectively the simulation duration is 60 s and the results are extracted from the data during a stable period based on the horizontal velocity at the base of the stem as illustrated in luhar and nepf 2016 along with linear wave theory a spatial and temporal varying flow field is obtained to force fvdm four corresponding fvdms were set up with the physical parameters of the four stem scenarios 2 3 2 modeling wave propagation through flexible vegetation group by coupled fvdm xbeach the second validation test aims to assess the ability of the coupled fvdm xbeach model to simulate the wave propagation through flexible vegetation group measurement data of the conducted wave flume experiment in this study were utilized first to test the developed model specifically the ability of coupled model was quantitatively assessed by calculating scatter index sci and relative bias scores rel bias these two dimensionless statistical indexes have been utilized to investigate the predictive ability of wave models in previous studies van der westhuysen 2010 van rooijen et al 2016 given the wave flume experiment conditions a one dimensional numerical xbeach non hydrostatic wave model was established this wave model utilizes an evenly spaced mesh with a grid resolution of 0 02 m the computational domain is 10 m long starting from 4 m upstream of the vegetation field the origin of the coordinates is at the upstream edge of the vegetation field the total number of computational nodes is 501 while 159 nodes are corresponding to the vegetation field from 0 m to 3 16 m the simulation total time and time step are 400 s and 0 05 s respectively the manning coefficient adopted in the models is prescribed with a constant value of 0 01 with or without vegetation additionally the computational space and time steps applied in fvdm are 1 mm and 0 02 s there are six wave boundary and depth conditions for validation including two wave heights 8 cm and 12 cm three wave periods 1 4s 1 6s and 1 8s and three depths 35 cm 40 cm and 50 cm the skin friction coefficient and the added mass coefficient are 0 1 and 1 14 respectively to further evaluate the capacity of the developed model to simulate wave propagation through flexible vegetation on a flat bed supplementary data collected from an experiment conducted at the usda ars national sedimentation laboratory in oxford mississippi were utilized this experiment has also been used by some previous studies chen et al 2019 marsooli et al 2017 marsooli and wu 2014 mattis et al 2019 to test the wave model of flexible vegetation meanwhile estimated drag coefficients for different cases are available in this experiment these values are useful to assess the selected drag coefficients in the developed models to a certain extent this experiment was performed in a 20 6 m long 0 69 m wide and 1 22 m deep wave flume as shown in fig 5 the upstream end of the flume was equipped with a piston type wavemaker while a porous parabolic wave absorber was constructed at the downstream end of the flume the vegetation field was placed 11 5 m away from the wavemaker and was 3 66 m long only the flexible vegetation model applied in the experiment was employed in this study this flexible vegetation model was constructed out of a polyurethane pipe strip with a diameter of 3 1 mm and a length of 0 2 m the elastic modulus and distribution density were 0 04 gpa and 3182 stems m2 more details of this experiment including the discussion and treatment about wave reflection can be found in wu et al 2012 there are six wave boundary and depth conditions for validation against the above wave flume experiment a one dimensional uniform grid with a resolution of 0 02 m was applied in the xbeach non hydrostatic model the model domain is 19 4 m with 971 grid nodes the origin of coordinates is located at the wavemaker the vegetation field ranges from 11 5 m to 15 16 m with computational nodes of 184 simulation total time and time step were set to 400 s and 0 05 s respectively meanwhile a uniform manning coefficient was specified as 0 01 furthermore the computational grid spacing of fvdm is 0 8 mm in the spatial and 0 02 s in the time direction the skin friction coefficient and the added mass coefficient are 0 1 and 1 14 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of fvdm in simulating a single submerged flexible stem dynamic comparisons between the simulated and observed posture of four different stem scenarios at multi moments over one wave period are presented in fig 6 to fig 9 in addition the simulated and observed time series of horizontal external forces for four stems are compared in fig 10 the drag coefficients for each stem scenario were set to 2 20 cm silicon foam 4 5 cm high density polyethylene and 6 10 cm and 20 cm high density polyethylene respectively the skin friction coefficient and the added mass coefficient are 0 1 and 1 14 respectively this study aims to propose a mechanical model for simulating wave attenuation induced by flexible vegetation and reveal the feasibility of established models in simulating vegetation motion and the resulting wave attenuation there are some coefficients in the established model including the drag coefficient the skin friction coefficient and the added mass coefficient numerous rigid vegetation studies and several flexible vegetation studies have indicated that these coefficients depend on wave conditions although numerous empirical formulas have been established for calculating these coefficients especially the drag coefficient validity of a broadly applicable formula for the drag coefficient has not been found documented in the literature therefore the model coefficients are determined through model validation in this study this method for determining coefficients is also utilized in some studies li and xie 2011 marsooli and wu 2014 maza et al 2013 suzuki et al 2011 zhu and chen 2015 meanwhile the skin friction coefficient and the added mass coefficient are given constant values based on their relatively minor role and some existing studies luhar and nepf 2016 it is tempting to propose an empirical formula for model coefficients based on wave conditions and the vegetation properties which requires significant additional validations and analytical work most existing empirical formulas are based on rigid vegetation scenarios and only calculated under wave conditions therefore direct application of these formulas in the new established model is difficult it is necessary to evaluate the validity of each existing empirical formula in the new mathematic model meanwhile establishing a new empirical formula based on numerous model validations is a better approach afterwards it is straightforward to incorporate the selected or established empirical formula of the coefficient in the present model in the future under the 5 cm high density polyethylene stem scenario both the measured and the simulated results indicate that there is no significant motion for this stem fig 6 the measured horizontal bending amplitude of the stem tip is approximately 0 5 cm while the modeled horizontal bending is from 0 23 cm to 0 59 cm additionally model predictions show an acceptable agreement with the observed time series of horizontal external forces for this stem scenario fig 10a the correlation coefficient between the observed and the predicted forces is 0 98 and the correlated error of maximum force is 5 26 forced by a similar flow field the 10 cm high density polyethylene stem bends obviously compared to the 5 cm scenario fig 7 these observations are also reproduced by the numerical model the result of the simulation matches well with the observation in bending trend the corresponding predicted and measured maximum bending position at the selected moments are 4 14 cm and 5 09 cm simultaneously through a comparison between the simulated and the observed horizontal force fig 10b the maximum and minimum force as well as the phase are in reasonable agreement with the measurements the correlation coefficient between the simulation and the observation is 0 97 and the correlated error of maximum force is 5 52 although the bending amplitude of 20 cm high density polyethylene stem is larger than the above two scenarios the vegetation postures simulated by fvdm show valid agreement with the observations fig 8 the observed horizontal bending amplitude of the stem tip is about 16 37 cm while the simulated value is 13 68 cm meanwhile the observed time series of horizontal force is also reproduced well by the numerical model fig 10c with the correlation coefficient of 0 97 and the correlated error of maximum force equals to 4 77 as for the 20 cm silicon foam stem scenario the fvdm reproduces both the bending amplitude and bending degree at different moments closely fig 9 the measured and the simulated horizontal bending amplitude of the stem tip are 17 cm and 15 cm respectively concurrently comparisons of time series observations to model predictions of horizontal force are in reasonable agreement as shown in fig 10d the corresponding correlation coefficient and correlated error of maximum force are 0 95 and 21 98 respectively the above validation results indicate that the motion and the force of a single submerged flexible stem can be reasonably simulated by the developed fvdm therefore this model can be further applied in investigating wave propagation through flexible vegetation 3 2 performance of fvdm xbeach in simulating wave propagation through flexible vegetation group fig 11 compares the wave height results obtained from the measurements and the simulation without and with vegetation in the non hydrostatic mode of xbeach the drag coefficient is 0 8 under the 0 12 m wave height 1 6 s wave period and 0 4 m water depth scenario while this parameter is 1 for other five cases as highlighted in table 1 the model results are quantitatively assessed with sci and rel bias firstly the good agreement in the absence of vegetation indicates that the established wave models can correctly predict the wave propagation on a flat bed without vegetation under different wave and depth conditions the sci between the non hydrostatic modeled results and the observation ranges from 0 019 to 0 072 with a mean of 0 048 the range of rel bias between the measured and the simulated wave heights of 7 wave gages is from 0 021 to 0 036 with a mean of 0 002 subsequently the cases with flexible vegetation are validated against the measurements on the basis of validated models under the non vegetation scenario as can be seen from fig 11 wave height attenuates significantly through flexible vegetation and these observations are reproduced well by the xbeach non hydrostatic models under different wave and depth conditions the averaged sci of non hydrostatic models is 0 046 and the rel bias ranges from 0 04 to 0 004 the above validation results demonstrate that the coupled fvdm xbeach model is capable of efficiently simulating wave propagation on a flat bed regarding the validation results for the wu et al 2012 cases the drag coefficients for each scenario were set to 1 9 a 1 2 b 1 2 c 1 3 d 0 5 e and 1 f respectively these values are comparable to 2 3 1 55 1 58 0 861 0 762 and 1 04 given by wu et al 2012 besides fig 12 also demonstrates a good agreement between the measured and the calculated wave height distribution through flexible vegetation the measured and calculated wave height of the 7 wave gages around the vegetation field were statistically analyzed it can be seen from the data in table 1 the sci of mean wave height for the wave model are within 0 07 to be specific the sci between the observation and the non hydrostatic modeled results ranges from 0 031 to 0 066 with a mean of 0 052 the rel bias of the mean wave height are in a range from 0 041 to 0 008 all the simulated values versus the observed values of wave heights at the wave gages in the above two experiments are plotted in fig 13 the correlation coefficient and the rmse between the simulated and the observed values are 0 99 and 0 451 cm the estimated sci and rel bias are 0 058 and 0 013 the calculated statistical indexes indicate the validity of the developed fvdm xbeach model nevertheless ideally demonstration of the validity and the reliability of a new model requires as many validations as possible more effective validations can provide more confidence in the quality of the model in this study only 18 cases were utilized to test the fvdm xbeach model the estimated reynolds number ranges from 180 to 1085 for the selected cases meanwhile for the wave conditions tested here the cauchy numbers are from 0 19 to 2 29 and the wave excursion ratios are from 0 90 to 7 77 cm to a certain extent these validations indicate that the developed fvdm xbeach model can efficiently simulate wave propagation through flexible vegetation on a flat bed however limited model validations can only provide limited confidence and are far from completely satisfactory further validation studies on both the stem motion and vegetation induced wave attenuation are required in the future moreover at the early stages of model development the drag coefficients in this study are determined based on model validation nevertheless with increasing number of validation data samples calibrated values of drag coefficients can be then fitted by reynolds number or the keulegan carpenter number kc currently numerous empirical formulas have been established for calculating the drag coefficient the calibrated drag coefficients in this study are fitted by the values calculated by formulas in luhar and nepf 2016 van veelen et al 2020 and some formulas collected in wang et al 2020 the fitting results indicate that the formula in van veelen et al 2020 cd 81 kc 0 36 fits best with the used coefficient the mean absolute deviation between validated drag coefficients and calculated values is 0 21 nevertheless owing to the limited sample data the reliability of results needs to be further investigated research is needed to further evaluate the validity of each existing empirical formula for model coefficients in the new mathematic model or propose empirical formulas for model coefficients on the base of significant additional validations and analytical work 3 3 effect of elastic modulus on wave attenuation to clarify the influence of elastic modulus on wave attenuation by flexible vegetation the established four xbeach non hydrostatic wave models which had been validated with flume experiments fig 3 were implemented in the numerical model only one parameter the elastic modulus of flexible vegetation was updated while the other parameters remained consistent aside from the original elastic modulus of 0 16 gpa two more values 1 6 10 3 gpa 1 6 10 5 gpa were applied as illustrated in fig 14 under the selected four conditions of different water depths and waves elasticity modulus plays a vital role in wave attenuation with all the other variables being invariant as elasticity modulus decreases the simulated wave attenuation also decreases through analyzing the statistics of wave height from 4 m to 6 m under the conditions where the wave height wave period and water depth are 0 08 m 1 4 s and 0 35 m respectively flexible vegetation with an elasticity modulus of 1 6 10 1gpa results in a wave attenuation of 16 31 compared with the no vegetation scenario as elasticity modulus decreases to 1 6 10 3 gpa and 1 6 10 5 gpa the corresponding wave attenuation decreases to 8 05 and 2 84 respectively results of the other three water depth and wave scenarios further substantiate the effect of elastic modulus when all the other parameters remain constant the bending amplitude of a flexible stem decreases with enlarging elasticity modulus in that case as the stem bends with an oscillatory flow with an invariant period the stem velocity and acceleration decrease from equations 2 5 it can be seen that the absolute value of the wave force increases as the stem velocity and acceleration decrease thereby the interaction force between wave and stem enhances with increasing elasticity modulus since the interaction force attenuates the wave while driving the stem motion the greater interaction force induced by higher elasticity modulus generates more wave attenuation the above conclusion is of crucial meaning for understanding the effects of elastic modulus in theory and the different wave attenuation by rigid and flexible vegetation 4 conclusions in this investigation the aim is to extend the capacity of the open source xbeach non hydrostatic model to simulate wave attenuation by flexible vegetation a new fvdm driven by waves is presented first and a coupling simulation method between the fvdm and the xbeach non hydrostatic wave model is then proposed subsequently the developed fvdm is incorporated in the open source xbeach non hydrostatic wave model thus improving and re developing this phase resolving wave model meanwhile a flume experiment on wave attenuation by flexible vegetation is conducted to assess the performance of the coupled fvdm xbeach model validation results with measured data from flume experiments demonstrated that the developed fvdm can reproduce forces and motions with sufficient fidelity to satisfy analysis goals the performance of the coupled fvdm xbeach model in simulating wave attenuation through group flexible vegetation has been confirmed reynolds number ranges from 180 to 1085 cauchy number ranges from 0 19 to 2 29 wave excursion ratio ranges from 0 9 to 7 77 cm the above results further indicate that the coupling implementation is valid and reliable besides wave flume experiment and numerical simulation studies all indicate that flexible vegetation is able to attenuate wave height numerical investigations also demonstrate that elasticity modulus of flexible vegetation plays a vital role in wave attenuation when all the other variables are invariant this study establishes a quantitative framework for detecting wave attenuation by flexible vegetation which may also be applied to other wave models the results of this research improve our understanding of the performance of flexible vegetation in wave attenuation understanding the effects of flexible vegetation will provide further technical support for engineering practice of coastal ecological nature based solutions although nature based solutions can play an auxiliary role in coastal protection it should be noted that the purpose of investigating wave attenuation ability induced by flexible vegetation is not to completely replace hard coastal structures actually aside from the strengths of nature based solutions there are also a series of weaknesses for this solution it is still unrealistic to completely replace hard coastal structures meanwhile it is worth noting that there are still some limitations in this study the established fvdm is just a simple generalization model for describing the highly complex natural process a series of assumptions are applied some of which are inconsistent with reality for instance the physical characteristics of one single flexible stem may vary along the axis of the stem and real vegetation may fold and twine further research should focus on breaking through restrictions of certain assumptions additionally this study focuses on flexible vegetation which can bend forced by wave field and does not deliberately pursue flexible vegetation with highly low flexural rigidity in the case of highly low flexural rigidity and high distribution density the interference between flexible vegetation will increase there could even be twining flattening and breaking of vegetation model applicability under highly low flexural rigidity conditions requires more verifications moreover further validations are required to confirm the developed models regarding the stem motion and vegetation induced wave attenuation especially under natural flow and vegetation conditions finally the model coefficients are determined through model validation in this study which limits the direct application of the developed model under different wave and vegetation conditions research is needed to evaluate the validity of each existing empirical formula for model coefficients in the new mathematic model or propose empirical formulas for model coefficients on the base of significant additional validations and analytical work incorporating the selected or established empirical formula of the coefficient in the present model will further

20469,quantitative investigation of wave attenuation by flexible vegetation is an increasingly prominent area in wave mechanics given that the existing xbeach non hydrostatic wave model can only simulate wave attenuation by rigid vegetation a mechanical model for simulating submerged flexible vegetation dynamics driven by waves and a coupling simulation method between the flexible vegetation dynamic model and the xbeach non hydrostatic wave model were proposed to assess the performance of the proposed coupled model a wave flume experiment was conducted this study demonstrates the validity of the new flexible vegetation dynamic model in simulating forces and motions of a single submerged flexible stem the validation between modeled results and experimental data shown that the coupled model is capable of reproducing the wave attenuation in the presence of flexible vegetation the above results further indicate that the coupling implementation is valid and reliable besides this study further confirms that flexible vegetation is able to attenuate wave height and the elasticity modulus of flexible vegetation plays a vital role in wave attenuation when all the other variables are invariant this study can broaden the application of the xbeach model and provide technical support for the engineering practice of coastal nature based solutions keywords wave attenuation flexible vegetation xbeach numerical simulation 1 introduction coastal vegetation such as spartina alterniflora and seagrass are being increasingly recognized as unique and crucial for coastal protection it can attenuate wave energy thus decreasing wave height barbier et al 2008 lashley et al 2020 möller et al 2014 tang et al 2019 as well as wave setup dean and bender 2006 van rooijen et al 2016 and is also capable of mitigating storm surge hazard guannel et al 2015 narayan et al 2017 and enhancing the ability to resist coastal erosion and sea level rise duarte et al 2013 kirwan and megonigal 2013 vu et al 2017 thus protecting coastal zone moreover coastal vegetation has several ecological functions such as conservation and restoration of the ecological environment and biodiversity ecological nature based solutions have prominent ecological benefits compared to conventional coastal engineering narayan et al 2016 sutton grier et al 2015 temmerman et al 2013 wave attenuation is the best known capability of vegetation among the above many coastal protection and ecological benefits with the increasingly prominent risk of coastal hazards along with the continuous promotion of sustainable development yin et al 2017 2020 wave attenuation by vegetation has propelled to the forefront in investigations of wave mechanics to support the utilization of nature based solutions as natural or hybrid solutions for coastal protection extensive research has been conducted worldwide by field measurement laboratory flume experiment and numerical simulation as the most direct and convincible research approach field measurement conducted in china cao et al 2016 yang et al 2012 thailand horstman et al 2014 united kingdom möller et al 1999 netherlands vuik et al 2016 willemsen et al 2020 sweden lövstedt and larson 2010 colombia vanegas g et al 2019 and the united states garzon et al 2019 jadhav et al 2013 have demonstrated and quantified the wave attenuating capacity of spartina alterniflora phragmites australis mangrove etc meanwhile considerable variability of wave attenuation has also been revealed in these field studies owing to disparate vegetation characteristics as well as wave conditions for instance vanegas g et al 2019 recorded a wave height reduction of 7 14 per meter while yang et al 2012 documented values of 4 2 55 and 1 55 per meter across the first 7 5 m 20 m and 51 m of the marsh although field measurement studies have enormously improved the understanding of wave attenuating capacity of vegetation it is still limited by the wide variation of wave and vegetation conditions as well as the difficulties and the costs of continuous measurements the advantage of laboratory research is that under controlled conditions physical phenomena and test results are reliable compared with field studies it is more convenient to investigate the influence of a single variable on wave attenuation through laboratory research numerous laboratory studies have demonstrated that vegetation properties flexibility height distribution density etc wave conditions water depth wave height wave period etc together with wave and current condition play a vital role in vegetation induced wave attenuation chen et al 2018 he et al 2019 hu et al 2014 losada et al 2016 luhar et al 2017 paul et al 2016 rupprecht et al 2017 tan et al 2019 van veelen et al 2020 wang et al 2019 nevertheless this method did not eliminate of the constraints from the limited water depth and wave generation as well as it did not dismiss the scale effects especially the scale effect of the elastic modulus of vegetation the above researches have laid a solid foundation for numerical studies as both field and laboratory research are constantly developing and providing key verification data numerical simulation has become an essential method for investigating the interaction mechanism between vegetation and waves previous numerical studies have focused more on rigid rather than flexible vegetation under the assumption of rigid vegetation the formulas derived from dalrymple et al 1984 and mendez and losada 2004 have been incorporated in several phase resolving e g boussinesq equations swash nonlinear shallow water equations xbeach nonhydrostatic cao et al 2015 huang et al 2011 suzuki et al 2019 tang et al 2017 van rooijen et al 2016 and phase averaged wave models e g swan cms wave xbeach surfbeat chen and zhao 2012 suzuki et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 thus determining vegetation force and wave energy dissipation by vegetation respectively nonetheless flexible vegetation may move like a cantilever or a whip driven by waves which is entirely different from the rigid vegetation the bending motion of flexible vegetation leads to a more complex wave attenuation mechanism than rigid vegetation the wave attenuation capacity of flexible vegetation has been proven considerably weaker than that of rigid vegetation by some studies riffe et al 2011 van veelen et al 2020 van veelen et al 2020 demonstrated that flexible vegetation can even attenuate wave up to 70 less than rigid vegetation inadequate representation of vegetation properties in wave models may undermine their capability in predicting wave attenuation process hence it ought to simulate wave attenuation based on reproducing the forces and the motion of flexible vegetation several numerical studies have been carried out on solving the motion of a single submerged flexible stem based on different physical assumptions for the convenience and feasibility of the calculation simplification and generalization of the existing flexible vegetation have been generally conducted flexible vegetation such as spartina alterniflora and seagrass are generally considered to be an idealized material the damped oscillatory dynamic equation has been commonly utilized to solve horizontal deflection of a single stem denny et al 1998 ikeda et al 2001 maza et al 2013 zhu and chen 2015 this method assumes the stem deflection to be so small that the vertical motion is ignored so it follows that this approach does not apply to extreme deflection of a stem such as the nonlinear whip like motion observed repeatedly in seagrass under realistic waves to represent the nonlinear bending deflection during the bending process of a single flexible stem the following researches generally consider a single flexible stem as a series of continuous uniform and small scale cylinders or rectangular thin plate elements coupled with the elastic cantilever beam theory the wave forced motion of a submerged flexible stem can be numerically calculated four kinematic regimes of elastic blades in oscillatory flow have been introduced by leclercq and de langre 2018 with a systematic numerical investigation dynamic characteristics of a single flexible stem driven by waves are a function of vegetation properties as well as wave induced forces such as the drag force the skin friction and the inertial force although several studies disregarded certain forces for simplification jacobsen et al 2019 mullarney and henderson 2010 to consider large stem deflection recent numerical studies tend to solve physically intuitive dynamic equation directly with finite element chen and zou 2019 o connor and revell 2019 and finite difference dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 leclercq and de langre 2018 luhar and nepf 2016 methods in the models developed by dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 zeller et al 2014 luhar and nepf 2016 and zhu et al 2020 a single flexible stem was discretized into a series of rigid segments stem dynamic was then determined through solving a system of ordinary differential equations which was derived from local force and moment balances for each stem segment wave forced bending deflection characteristic of a single flexible stem has been appropriately reproduced by the above studies thus laying a foundation for simulating wave attenuation by flexible vegetation wave attenuation by flexible vegetation stems from the interaction between wave and flexible vegetation bending effect of flexible vegetation is the dominating factor for wave attenuation by vegetation several attempts have been made on simple simulation of wave attenuation by flexible vegetation such as increasing bottom friction in wave models möller et al 1999 smith et al 2016 and utilizing rigid vegetation models with modified drag coefficient or effective length beudin et al 2017 houser et al 2014 luhar et al 2017 although these approaches are generally simpler notable differences exist between these modified empirical formulas based on different sample data compared with these methods coupled modeling of flexible vegetation and waves describes the physical phenomena more realistically based on the damped oscillatory movement equation maza et al 2013 incorporated the drag force by flexible vegetation into the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations for modeling wave attenuation zhu and chen 2015 also utilized the damped oscillatory movement equation to calculate vegetation induced drag and inertia which were introduced into the nonhydrostatic wave model chen and zou 2019 extended the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with the drag force the inertia force and the added mass by solving a linear momentum conservation equation based on the euler bernoulli beam theory a new work factor and a drag coefficient formula van veelen et al 2021 successfully predicted wave damping by quasi flexible coastal vegetation bending effects of flexible vegetation were all taken into consideration in these modeling studies nonetheless the ordinary differential equation method based on all local force and moment balances a relatively new method for simulating flexible vegetation motion directly has not been applied in coupled modeling of flexible vegetation and waves although limitations exist in the flexible dynamic models employed they are useful attempts to numerically deal with wave attenuation caused by flexible vegetation despite the effective insight has been gained in the above mentioned studies the understanding of wave attenuation mechanisms involving flexible vegetation dynamic is still far from complete wave attenuation by flexible vegetation can not be simulated with the widely used xbeach wave model this wave model is selected for coupled modeling owing to its advantage in built in vegetation module along with potential application in simulating ship wave attenuation induced by vegetation meanwhile the ordinary differential equation method based on local force and moment balances has not been applied in the coupled modeling of flexible vegetation and waves in this investigation a simulation algorithm and theory are proposed to model the interaction between waves and flexible vegetation to capture the range of physical mechanisms controlling wave attenuation induced by flexible vegetation a flexible vegetation dynamic model fvdm driven by waves was established first this model was then incorporated in xbeach non hydrostatic wave modes to simulate wave propagation and attenuation through flexible vegetation areas additionally a new flume experiment on wave attenuation by flexible vegetation was conducted for mathematical model validation the results from this study will optimize the simulation theory and method of wave attenuation by vegetation enrich the basic theoretical system of wave propagation and deformation in coastal dynamics and provide scientific basis for new disaster prevention and mitigation engineering methods in the coastal zone 2 methods 2 1 numerical methods 2 1 1 fvdm model under the influence of numerous factors such as climatology flow waves and human activities the forces and motion of flexible vegetation in natural groups are complex natural physical processes containing some law of certainty and uncertainty for the convenience and feasibility of the simulation simplification and generalization of flexible vegetation such as spartina alterniflora and seagrass have been conducted when developing fvdm in this study only the submerged scenarios are considered meanwhile a flexible stem is generalized to be an idealized material which is conformed to continuity assumption homogenization assumption and isotropy assumption simultaneously following some assumptions and calculation methods utilized in previous studies dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 li and xie 2011 luhar and nepf 2016 maza et al 2013 zhu and chen 2015 the established fvdm also has the following assumptions vegetation is assumed to perform a two dimensional planar motion in the direction of wave propagation and vertical plane vegetation is assumed to only bend not fold twist or elongate the effect of shadowing and interference as well as twining scenarios are not considered the physical characteristics force and motion of all vegetation around one grid point are considered to be the same therefore numerous vegetation is represented by a single stem fvdm utilizes a two dimensional coordinate system where the computational x axis is of the direction of wave propagation and the z axis is vertical the corresponding coordinate origin is at the crossing point between the stem axis and bed level the basic physical parameters to describe a single flexible stem in fvdm include stem height l v m the projected area of stem per unit length perpendicular to the wave propagation direction b v m which equals to the diameter of the circular cylinder or the width of the rectangular column thickness d v m elastic modulus e pa and density of stem ρ v kg m3 only l v and b v are considered to describe a traditional rigid stem given the above generalized and idealized stem the force analysis of one stem segment with a length of d s m in the horizontal vertical plane is conducted as illustrated in fig 1 the distance from this segment to the base along the principal axis of the stem is s m and the bending angle of this stem segment relative to the vertical is θ rad on each stem segment act some internal forces and externally distributed forces the internal forces comprise tensile force f t n shearing force f q m and bending moment m nm meanwhile each unit length withstands external forces of gravity buoyancy and wave forces the gravity and buoyancy can be united into the net buoyancy force f b n m which acts in the vertical direction in the meantime combining the effects of wave velocity and acceleration on the stem the wave force is determined using the well known morison equation morison et al 1950 which is a combination of an inertial term caused by wave acceleration and a drag term induced by wave velocity the inertial term f i n m involves the froude krylov force introduced by the unsteady pressure field generated by undisturbed waves and the added mass force arising from an accelerating or decelerating stem move a certain amount of volume of surrounding fluid as it flows through it the stem is considered to be bending when calculating the wave forces on the vegetation under such circumstances the drag term can be divided into the drag force f d n m normal to the axis of the stem and the skin friction f f n m parallel to the stem the internal forces and externally distributed forces acting on one stem with a length of ds are presented in fig 2 through using the morison equation the above mentioned external forces per unit length at the coordinate point of x z are given by 1 f b ρ ρ v g v 1 2 f d 1 2 ρ c d b v u w cos θ w w sin θ x cos θ z sin θ u w cos θ w w sin θ x cos θ z sin θ 3 f f 1 2 ρ c f b v u w sin θ w w cos θ x sin θ z cos θ u w sin θ w w cos θ x sin θ z cos θ 4 f i x ρ v 1 u

skin friction the horizontal and vertical inertial force respectively besides ρ is density of water kg m3 g denotes the acceleration due to gravity m s2 v 1 represents the displacement volume per unit stem length m2 c d is the dimensionless drag coefficient u w and w w represent horizontal and vertical wave velocity m s u w and w w represent horizontal and vertical wave acceleration m s2 x and z

mass coefficient v 2 denotes the reference volume of stem per unit length related to added mass coefficient m2 v 2 equals to v 1 if the cross section of simulated stem is circular while it can be expressed in π b v 2 4 if the cross section is rectangular in compliance with previous studies keulegan and carpenter 1958 luhar and nepf 2016 the governing motion equations in x and z direction which describe the relationship between a stem segment and the forces acting upon it and its motion in response to those forces are given by 6 f x s d s f d cos θ f f sin θ f i x d s ρ v v 1 d s x 7 f z s d s f b f d sin θ f f cos θ f i z d s ρ v v 1 d s z in which f x and f z are the horizontal and vertical internal forces f x f t sin θ f q cos θ n f z f t cos θ f q sin θ n considering ds is closing to zero the moment balance equation is given by f x cos θ m s f z sin θ in which the bending moment can be expressed as the bending angle as m e i θ s follows the differential equation of the deflection curve therefore the shearing force can be written as f q e i 2 θ s 2 substituting the above equations with the expressions of horizontal and vertical internal forces into equation 6 as well as equation 7 together with performing some calculation and arrangement yield the following partial differential equations in x and z direction of fvdm 8 f t s e i 2 θ s 2 θ s f f ρ v v 1 x sin θ z cos θ f i x sin θ f i z cos θ f b cos θ 9 f t θ s e i 3 θ s 3 f d ρ v v 1 x cos θ z sin θ f i x cos θ f i z sin θ f b sin θ the derived mathematical formulations of fvdm are numerically solved by utilizing the well known finite difference method by setting a one dimensional s axis aligned along the stem the solution domain can be discretized in constant computational space and time steps h m and τ s respectively there are a total of m 1 and n 1 nodes in the corresponding directions so h l v m τ t n as t represents the entire computational time s therefore the discrete spatial and temporal coordinates of any node are given by s i i 1 h and t k k 1 τ the index i and k indicate the spatial and temporal location of any grid node and are also used to annotate the discrete variables referring to fig 1 spatial coordinates of a stem in x z plane at the specified time t k can be expressed as x i k h j 1 i 1 sin θ j k and z i k h j 1 i 1 cos θ j k consequently spatial coordinates of a stem in x z plane follow directly from a given bending angle only bending angle θ and tensile force f t are unknown in the governing equations of fvdm in the approximation process the time derivatives in the governing equations are replaced by second order central difference meanwhile for the sake of transforming the nonlinear finite difference scheme to linear scheme a time delay approach is adopted to implement local linearization the time derivatives in the absolute value and quadratic terms are estimated with values at the known time steps as for the approximation of spatial derivative the third order spatial derivative is calculated with values at k 1 instead of k time step the reason for this processing is to avoid a singular coefficient matrix in solving the system of linear algebraic equations substituting the time and spatial derivatives into equation 8 as well as equation 9 and collecting terms yield the following system of linear algebraic equations

bending angle at k 1 time step is influenced by the bending angle at the time steps from 1 to k as well as the tensile force at the k time step it is required to solve the system of linear algebraic

θ 1 k 1 θ 2 k 1 θ m k 1 this solution matrix is solved by the matrix left division with matlab meanwhile it is necessary to prescribe initial and boundary conditions in the process of solving

flexible stem are obtained subsequently temporal variation of spatial posture can be acquired and the stem velocity and acceleration can be calculated eventually horizontal and vertical total external

segments stem dynamic is then determined through solving a system of ordinary differential equations which is derived from local force and moment balances for each stem segment this method is similar to the approaches applied in dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 zeller et al 2014 luhar and nepf 2016 and zhu et al 2020 besides same external forces were considered in luhar and nepf 2016 zhu et al 2020 and this study however different stem cross sections calculated coordinate system governing equations and calculation methods were applied in these studies compared with existing models this new model is more convenient for incorporation because this model can only use velocities and accelerations simulated by the non hydrostatic wave model there is no need to calculate a series of wave parameters such as the wave radian frequency cauchy number buoyancy parameter and keulegan carpenter number besides since the governing equations and related calculation method of this model do not depend on wave parameters it can be more convenient for simulating vegetation force and motion under combined wave and current it should be noted that flexible vegetation such as spartina alterniflora grows in communities under natural conditions following the assumptions of fvdm along with previous successful studies about rigid mendez and losada 2004 méndez et al 1999 suzuki et al 2011 van rooijen et al 2016 and flexible vegetation li and xie 2011 maza et al 2013 zhu and chen 2015 the time varying total external force of group flexible vegetation f v x g r o u p k f v z g r o u p k n m2 is calculated

xbeach non hydrostatic model xbeach is a two dimensional hydrodynamic and morphodynamic model which calculates wave propagation long waves mean flow sediment transport and morphological changes on curvilinear grids although the non hydrostatic mode of xbeach is capable of simulating two dimensional wave propagation this study focuses on one dimensional wave propagation in cross shore direction this is because flexible vegetation is assumed to perform a two dimensional planar motion in x z plane thus providing only horizontal forces from fvdm to xbeach accordingly governing equations for xbeach non hydrostatic mode are considered one dimensional equivalent as a phase resolving wave model the xbeach non hydrostatic mode solves the depth averaged non linear shallow water equations combined with a non hydrostatic pressure correction term similar to a one layer version of the swash model zijlema et al 2011 the depth averaged dynamic pressure is computed from the mean of the dynamic pressure at the surface and the bed by assuming the dynamic pressure at the surface to be zero and a linear change over depth corresponding one dimensional depth averaged momentum and continuity equations are given by van rooijen et al 2016 26 η t h u x 0 27 u t u u x ν h 2 u x 2 g η x q x τ b x ρ h f v ρ h where t and x are the temporal and horizontal coordinates respectively η is the water level m h represents the local water depth m u denotes depth averaged velocity m s ν h is the horizontal viscosity m2 s q represents the depth averaged dynamic pressure kg m s2 τ b x is the bed shear stresses n m2 f v denotes the stress induced by vegetation n m2 the existing xbeach version 1 23 5387 regards simulated vegetation as rigid objects in this way the depth averaged vegetation force adopted in the above shallow water equations is determined by dalrymple et al 1984 van rooijen et al 2016 28 f v r i g i d 1 2 ρ c d b v l v n v u w u w 2 1 3 coupling between fvdm and xbeach although the force as well as dissipation term caused by rigid vegetation in xbeach has been widely applied and successfully incorporated in several other models cao et al 2015 chen and zhao 2012 suzuki et al 2011 2019 there exists an obvious deficiency in ignoring vegetation bending motion as well as inertial forces to make up for this deficiency and to improve and redevelop the xbeach wave model the fvdm and the xbeach wave model were integrated in this way the formulations of flexible vegetation forces were implemented in the xbeach phase resolving model considering the depth averaged flow velocity and acceleration caused by waves are fully resolved with the non linear shallow water equations fvdm can be forced with information from xbeach non hydrostatic mode meanwhile the time varying total external force of group flexible vegetation computed by fvdm can be directly added to the momentum equations in xbeach non hydrostatic mode however it should be noted that xbeach is depth averaged therefore this model cannot compute vertical profiles of the velocity which are required for fvdm simulations referring to previous studies anderson and smith 2014 dalrymple et al 1984 kobayashi et al 1993 luhar et al 2017 peruzzo et al 2018 it has been assumed that the linear wave theory is valid to calculate the vertical distribution of wave velocity and acceleration in this study however it should be noted that real velocity profiles may greatly differ from linear wave theory aside from the notable inapplicability of linear wave theory for the cases of wave nonlinearity and wave current interactions several studies have also demonstrated that vegetation can alter the velocity structure luhar et al 2010 pujol et al 2013 van rooijen et al 2020 van veelen et al 2020 therefore linear wave theory may not be suitable for the cases of notable wave nonlinearity strong wave current interactions or wave vegetation interactions the above inapplicability was not considered in the coupled model presented in this study similar to all assumptions utilized in fvdm the velocity and acceleration assumption will inevitably result in computational deviation in spite of this this simplifying assumption is still feasible and constructive for calculating velocity field thus providing a feasible approach in simulating wave attenuation by coupled fvdm and xbeach wave model based on this assumption the horizontal velocity is in accordance with cosh k w z distribution while the vertical velocity fits sinh k w z distribution in which k w represents wave number and z denotes the vertical coordinate measured upwards from the seafloor combining the above vertical distribution and time series of depth averaged velocity and acceleration the flow field that varies in time as well as the vertical direction was computed before being passed to fvdm where it was utilized to simulate motion and external force of flexible vegetation meanwhile the xbeach non hydrostatic mode calculates depth averaged momentum equations and vertical vegetation force is not considered in these momentum equations therefore only horizontal vegetation force is provided by fvdm to the xbeach non hydrostatic mode time series of external force in the direction of wave propagation at each grid point calculated by fvdm equation 24 were then adopted to drive xbeach non hydrostatic mode simulations based on the above coupling idea the original vegetation mode in xbeach vegetation f90 is redeveloped to read and use vegetation force file generated by fvdm instead of calculating rigid vegetation drag force the redeveloped xbeach model is then simulated first without vegetation force afterwards parameter input file params txt and simulation output file xboutput nc of xbeach model are utilized to force fvdm simulations vegetation force file calculated by fvdm is then used to drive xbeach model simulations executable program files of both models are called in order by a batch file for execution coupled simulations between fvdm and xbeach non hydrostatic mode can be realized by this method thus simulating wave propagation under the influence of flexible vegetation 2 2 experimental methods to test the performance of the coupled fvdm xbeach model in terms of wave propagation through flexible vegetation on a flat bed this study was carried out in conjunction with a flume experiment on wave attenuation by flexible vegetation the experiment was conducted in an 80 m long 1 m wide and 1 2 m deep wave flume at hohai university the side walls of wave flume are made of glass and the bottom of concrete the effective width of the experiment section is 0 5 m during the experimental stage the flume experimental section is divided by a piece of glass into two 0 5 m wide sections proofreading of incident wave and all experiment tests are conducted in one side of the flume with a width of 0 5 m a piston type wavemaker equipped at the start position of the wave flume can generate both regular waves and irregular waves the motions of the wavemaker paddle are controlled by the wave signal input from a computer additionally a wave absorber is installed at the end of the flume as shown in fig 3 the test section begins at 2 m from the upstream edge of the vegetation field and starting from the upstream edge of the vegetation field 7 wave gages are utilized for measuring wave height distribution the measured wave heights are continuously derived and recorded with a time interval of 9 7 m s each experiment case was repeated at least twice and the averaged data was taken as the representative value to represent the idealized vegetation applied in the fvdm the artificial flexible vegetation model in the experiment was constructed out of polyurethane cylinders with a diameter of 4 mm and a length of 25 cm artificial flexible vegetation has been widely utilized in some previous experimental studies paul et al 2016 van veelen et al 2020 the artificial polyurethane stem has a material density of 1193 kg m3 and an elastic modulus of 0 16 gpa each stem was glued into the holes of a 3 mm thick perforated iron plate which was attached to the flume floor following the alternate distribution mode which has been widely applied hu et al 2014 peruzzo et al 2018 van veelen et al 2020 wu et al 2012 as shown in fig 4 a total number of 1568 artificial flexible vegetation were placed in the 1 5484 square meters vegetation field and the vegetation distribution density is 1012 stems m2 the distance between the wavemaker and the upstream edge of the vegetation field is 37 m and the length of the vegetation field is 3 16 m 2 3 model validation to investigate the reliability of the developed fvdm and the coupled xbeach fvdm model several sets of measurement data of the above new wave flume experiment and some supplementary laboratory data obtained from literature were applied through analyzing the similarity between the numerical results and the physical phenomena the performance of the developed models in simulating the motion and the force of a single submerged flexible stem as well as the wave propagation through flexible vegetation was evaluated the developed fvdm was first tested for the motion and the force of a single submerged flexible stem induced by wave exploiting the flume experiments by luhar and nepf 2016 subsequently using the measurement data of the above mentioned new wave flume experiment the propagation process of waves in the flexible vegetation on the flat river bed in the coupled xbeach fvdm model was verified finally the experiment data of wu et al 2012 was utilized to further verify the coupled model for flexible vegetation effects on wave propagation over a flat bed 2 3 1 modeling a single submerged flexible stem dynamic by fvdm the first validation test is intended to assess the ability of the developed fvdm to simulate the motion and the force of a single submerged flexible stem to achieve this goal the dynamic blade laboratory experiments conducted by luhar and nepf 2016 in the environmental fluid mechanics laboratory at massachusetts institute of technology were used these experiments were carried out in a 24 m long 38 cm wide and 60 cm deep wave flume fitted with a paddle wavemaker a fixed total water depth of 38 cm was adopted the model stem was attached to the load cell via a stainless steel blade holder thus measuring the hydrodynamic force generated by a single submerged flexible stem over a wave cycle moreover the imaging blade motion captured at 60 frames per second was provided by a monochrome charge coupled device ccd camera with the particle image velocimetry the local velocity field was simultaneously measured high density polyethylene and silicon foam were made into model stems with a uniform rectangular cross section the silicon foam stem is 20 cm long 1 9 mm thick and 2 cm wide with an elastic modulus of 500 kpa and a material density equals to 670 kg m3 the three lengths of the high density polyethylene stems are 5 cm 10 cm and 20 cm with a thickness of 0 4 mm a width of 2 cm a material density of 950 kg m3 and an elastic modulus of 0 93 gpa additionally the experimental wave used for model validation has an amplitude of 3 9 cm a period of 2 s and a wave excursion ratio of 6 6 cm the cauchy number for the high density polyethylene stems are from 0 5 to 36 while the cauchy number is 1200 for the 20 cm silicon foam stem the computational grid spacing of fvdm is set as 0 02 s and 0 2 mm in the time and space directions respectively the simulation duration is 60 s and the results are extracted from the data during a stable period based on the horizontal velocity at the base of the stem as illustrated in luhar and nepf 2016 along with linear wave theory a spatial and temporal varying flow field is obtained to force fvdm four corresponding fvdms were set up with the physical parameters of the four stem scenarios 2 3 2 modeling wave propagation through flexible vegetation group by coupled fvdm xbeach the second validation test aims to assess the ability of the coupled fvdm xbeach model to simulate the wave propagation through flexible vegetation group measurement data of the conducted wave flume experiment in this study were utilized first to test the developed model specifically the ability of coupled model was quantitatively assessed by calculating scatter index sci and relative bias scores rel bias these two dimensionless statistical indexes have been utilized to investigate the predictive ability of wave models in previous studies van der westhuysen 2010 van rooijen et al 2016 given the wave flume experiment conditions a one dimensional numerical xbeach non hydrostatic wave model was established this wave model utilizes an evenly spaced mesh with a grid resolution of 0 02 m the computational domain is 10 m long starting from 4 m upstream of the vegetation field the origin of the coordinates is at the upstream edge of the vegetation field the total number of computational nodes is 501 while 159 nodes are corresponding to the vegetation field from 0 m to 3 16 m the simulation total time and time step are 400 s and 0 05 s respectively the manning coefficient adopted in the models is prescribed with a constant value of 0 01 with or without vegetation additionally the computational space and time steps applied in fvdm are 1 mm and 0 02 s there are six wave boundary and depth conditions for validation including two wave heights 8 cm and 12 cm three wave periods 1 4s 1 6s and 1 8s and three depths 35 cm 40 cm and 50 cm the skin friction coefficient and the added mass coefficient are 0 1 and 1 14 respectively to further evaluate the capacity of the developed model to simulate wave propagation through flexible vegetation on a flat bed supplementary data collected from an experiment conducted at the usda ars national sedimentation laboratory in oxford mississippi were utilized this experiment has also been used by some previous studies chen et al 2019 marsooli et al 2017 marsooli and wu 2014 mattis et al 2019 to test the wave model of flexible vegetation meanwhile estimated drag coefficients for different cases are available in this experiment these values are useful to assess the selected drag coefficients in the developed models to a certain extent this experiment was performed in a 20 6 m long 0 69 m wide and 1 22 m deep wave flume as shown in fig 5 the upstream end of the flume was equipped with a piston type wavemaker while a porous parabolic wave absorber was constructed at the downstream end of the flume the vegetation field was placed 11 5 m away from the wavemaker and was 3 66 m long only the flexible vegetation model applied in the experiment was employed in this study this flexible vegetation model was constructed out of a polyurethane pipe strip with a diameter of 3 1 mm and a length of 0 2 m the elastic modulus and distribution density were 0 04 gpa and 3182 stems m2 more details of this experiment including the discussion and treatment about wave reflection can be found in wu et al 2012 there are six wave boundary and depth conditions for validation against the above wave flume experiment a one dimensional uniform grid with a resolution of 0 02 m was applied in the xbeach non hydrostatic model the model domain is 19 4 m with 971 grid nodes the origin of coordinates is located at the wavemaker the vegetation field ranges from 11 5 m to 15 16 m with computational nodes of 184 simulation total time and time step were set to 400 s and 0 05 s respectively meanwhile a uniform manning coefficient was specified as 0 01 furthermore the computational grid spacing of fvdm is 0 8 mm in the spatial and 0 02 s in the time direction the skin friction coefficient and the added mass coefficient are 0 1 and 1 14 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of fvdm in simulating a single submerged flexible stem dynamic comparisons between the simulated and observed posture of four different stem scenarios at multi moments over one wave period are presented in fig 6 to fig 9 in addition the simulated and observed time series of horizontal external forces for four stems are compared in fig 10 the drag coefficients for each stem scenario were set to 2 20 cm silicon foam 4 5 cm high density polyethylene and 6 10 cm and 20 cm high density polyethylene respectively the skin friction coefficient and the added mass coefficient are 0 1 and 1 14 respectively this study aims to propose a mechanical model for simulating wave attenuation induced by flexible vegetation and reveal the feasibility of established models in simulating vegetation motion and the resulting wave attenuation there are some coefficients in the established model including the drag coefficient the skin friction coefficient and the added mass coefficient numerous rigid vegetation studies and several flexible vegetation studies have indicated that these coefficients depend on wave conditions although numerous empirical formulas have been established for calculating these coefficients especially the drag coefficient validity of a broadly applicable formula for the drag coefficient has not been found documented in the literature therefore the model coefficients are determined through model validation in this study this method for determining coefficients is also utilized in some studies li and xie 2011 marsooli and wu 2014 maza et al 2013 suzuki et al 2011 zhu and chen 2015 meanwhile the skin friction coefficient and the added mass coefficient are given constant values based on their relatively minor role and some existing studies luhar and nepf 2016 it is tempting to propose an empirical formula for model coefficients based on wave conditions and the vegetation properties which requires significant additional validations and analytical work most existing empirical formulas are based on rigid vegetation scenarios and only calculated under wave conditions therefore direct application of these formulas in the new established model is difficult it is necessary to evaluate the validity of each existing empirical formula in the new mathematic model meanwhile establishing a new empirical formula based on numerous model validations is a better approach afterwards it is straightforward to incorporate the selected or established empirical formula of the coefficient in the present model in the future under the 5 cm high density polyethylene stem scenario both the measured and the simulated results indicate that there is no significant motion for this stem fig 6 the measured horizontal bending amplitude of the stem tip is approximately 0 5 cm while the modeled horizontal bending is from 0 23 cm to 0 59 cm additionally model predictions show an acceptable agreement with the observed time series of horizontal external forces for this stem scenario fig 10a the correlation coefficient between the observed and the predicted forces is 0 98 and the correlated error of maximum force is 5 26 forced by a similar flow field the 10 cm high density polyethylene stem bends obviously compared to the 5 cm scenario fig 7 these observations are also reproduced by the numerical model the result of the simulation matches well with the observation in bending trend the corresponding predicted and measured maximum bending position at the selected moments are 4 14 cm and 5 09 cm simultaneously through a comparison between the simulated and the observed horizontal force fig 10b the maximum and minimum force as well as the phase are in reasonable agreement with the measurements the correlation coefficient between the simulation and the observation is 0 97 and the correlated error of maximum force is 5 52 although the bending amplitude of 20 cm high density polyethylene stem is larger than the above two scenarios the vegetation postures simulated by fvdm show valid agreement with the observations fig 8 the observed horizontal bending amplitude of the stem tip is about 16 37 cm while the simulated value is 13 68 cm meanwhile the observed time series of horizontal force is also reproduced well by the numerical model fig 10c with the correlation coefficient of 0 97 and the correlated error of maximum force equals to 4 77 as for the 20 cm silicon foam stem scenario the fvdm reproduces both the bending amplitude and bending degree at different moments closely fig 9 the measured and the simulated horizontal bending amplitude of the stem tip are 17 cm and 15 cm respectively concurrently comparisons of time series observations to model predictions of horizontal force are in reasonable agreement as shown in fig 10d the corresponding correlation coefficient and correlated error of maximum force are 0 95 and 21 98 respectively the above validation results indicate that the motion and the force of a single submerged flexible stem can be reasonably simulated by the developed fvdm therefore this model can be further applied in investigating wave propagation through flexible vegetation 3 2 performance of fvdm xbeach in simulating wave propagation through flexible vegetation group fig 11 compares the wave height results obtained from the measurements and the simulation without and with vegetation in the non hydrostatic mode of xbeach the drag coefficient is 0 8 under the 0 12 m wave height 1 6 s wave period and 0 4 m water depth scenario while this parameter is 1 for other five cases as highlighted in table 1 the model results are quantitatively assessed with sci and rel bias firstly the good agreement in the absence of vegetation indicates that the established wave models can correctly predict the wave propagation on a flat bed without vegetation under different wave and depth conditions the sci between the non hydrostatic modeled results and the observation ranges from 0 019 to 0 072 with a mean of 0 048 the range of rel bias between the measured and the simulated wave heights of 7 wave gages is from 0 021 to 0 036 with a mean of 0 002 subsequently the cases with flexible vegetation are validated against the measurements on the basis of validated models under the non vegetation scenario as can be seen from fig 11 wave height attenuates significantly through flexible vegetation and these observations are reproduced well by the xbeach non hydrostatic models under different wave and depth conditions the averaged sci of non hydrostatic models is 0 046 and the rel bias ranges from 0 04 to 0 004 the above validation results demonstrate that the coupled fvdm xbeach model is capable of efficiently simulating wave propagation on a flat bed regarding the validation results for the wu et al 2012 cases the drag coefficients for each scenario were set to 1 9 a 1 2 b 1 2 c 1 3 d 0 5 e and 1 f respectively these values are comparable to 2 3 1 55 1 58 0 861 0 762 and 1 04 given by wu et al 2012 besides fig 12 also demonstrates a good agreement between the measured and the calculated wave height distribution through flexible vegetation the measured and calculated wave height of the 7 wave gages around the vegetation field were statistically analyzed it can be seen from the data in table 1 the sci of mean wave height for the wave model are within 0 07 to be specific the sci between the observation and the non hydrostatic modeled results ranges from 0 031 to 0 066 with a mean of 0 052 the rel bias of the mean wave height are in a range from 0 041 to 0 008 all the simulated values versus the observed values of wave heights at the wave gages in the above two experiments are plotted in fig 13 the correlation coefficient and the rmse between the simulated and the observed values are 0 99 and 0 451 cm the estimated sci and rel bias are 0 058 and 0 013 the calculated statistical indexes indicate the validity of the developed fvdm xbeach model nevertheless ideally demonstration of the validity and the reliability of a new model requires as many validations as possible more effective validations can provide more confidence in the quality of the model in this study only 18 cases were utilized to test the fvdm xbeach model the estimated reynolds number ranges from 180 to 1085 for the selected cases meanwhile for the wave conditions tested here the cauchy numbers are from 0 19 to 2 29 and the wave excursion ratios are from 0 90 to 7 77 cm to a certain extent these validations indicate that the developed fvdm xbeach model can efficiently simulate wave propagation through flexible vegetation on a flat bed however limited model validations can only provide limited confidence and are far from completely satisfactory further validation studies on both the stem motion and vegetation induced wave attenuation are required in the future moreover at the early stages of model development the drag coefficients in this study are determined based on model validation nevertheless with increasing number of validation data samples calibrated values of drag coefficients can be then fitted by reynolds number or the keulegan carpenter number kc currently numerous empirical formulas have been established for calculating the drag coefficient the calibrated drag coefficients in this study are fitted by the values calculated by formulas in luhar and nepf 2016 van veelen et al 2020 and some formulas collected in wang et al 2020 the fitting results indicate that the formula in van veelen et al 2020 cd 81 kc 0 36 fits best with the used coefficient the mean absolute deviation between validated drag coefficients and calculated values is 0 21 nevertheless owing to the limited sample data the reliability of results needs to be further investigated research is needed to further evaluate the validity of each existing empirical formula for model coefficients in the new mathematic model or propose empirical formulas for model coefficients on the base of significant additional validations and analytical work 3 3 effect of elastic modulus on wave attenuation to clarify the influence of elastic modulus on wave attenuation by flexible vegetation the established four xbeach non hydrostatic wave models which had been validated with flume experiments fig 3 were implemented in the numerical model only one parameter the elastic modulus of flexible vegetation was updated while the other parameters remained consistent aside from the original elastic modulus of 0 16 gpa two more values 1 6 10 3 gpa 1 6 10 5 gpa were applied as illustrated in fig 14 under the selected four conditions of different water depths and waves elasticity modulus plays a vital role in wave attenuation with all the other variables being invariant as elasticity modulus decreases the simulated wave attenuation also decreases through analyzing the statistics of wave height from 4 m to 6 m under the conditions where the wave height wave period and water depth are 0 08 m 1 4 s and 0 35 m respectively flexible vegetation with an elasticity modulus of 1 6 10 1gpa results in a wave attenuation of 16 31 compared with the no vegetation scenario as elasticity modulus decreases to 1 6 10 3 gpa and 1 6 10 5 gpa the corresponding wave attenuation decreases to 8 05 and 2 84 respectively results of the other three water depth and wave scenarios further substantiate the effect of elastic modulus when all the other parameters remain constant the bending amplitude of a flexible stem decreases with enlarging elasticity modulus in that case as the stem bends with an oscillatory flow with an invariant period the stem velocity and acceleration decrease from equations 2 5 it can be seen that the absolute value of the wave force increases as the stem velocity and acceleration decrease thereby the interaction force between wave and stem enhances with increasing elasticity modulus since the interaction force attenuates the wave while driving the stem motion the greater interaction force induced by higher elasticity modulus generates more wave attenuation the above conclusion is of crucial meaning for understanding the effects of elastic modulus in theory and the different wave attenuation by rigid and flexible vegetation 4 conclusions in this investigation the aim is to extend the capacity of the open source xbeach non hydrostatic model to simulate wave attenuation by flexible vegetation a new fvdm driven by waves is presented first and a coupling simulation method between the fvdm and the xbeach non hydrostatic wave model is then proposed subsequently the developed fvdm is incorporated in the open source xbeach non hydrostatic wave model thus improving and re developing this phase resolving wave model meanwhile a flume experiment on wave attenuation by flexible vegetation is conducted to assess the performance of the coupled fvdm xbeach model validation results with measured data from flume experiments demonstrated that the developed fvdm can reproduce forces and motions with sufficient fidelity to satisfy analysis goals the performance of the coupled fvdm xbeach model in simulating wave attenuation through group flexible vegetation has been confirmed reynolds number ranges from 180 to 1085 cauchy number ranges from 0 19 to 2 29 wave excursion ratio ranges from 0 9 to 7 77 cm the above results further indicate that the coupling implementation is valid and reliable besides wave flume experiment and numerical simulation studies all indicate that flexible vegetation is able to attenuate wave height numerical investigations also demonstrate that elasticity modulus of flexible vegetation plays a vital role in wave attenuation when all the other variables are invariant this study establishes a quantitative framework for detecting wave attenuation by flexible vegetation which may also be applied to other wave models the results of this research improve our understanding of the performance of flexible vegetation in wave attenuation understanding the effects of flexible vegetation will provide further technical support for engineering practice of coastal ecological nature based solutions although nature based solutions can play an auxiliary role in coastal protection it should be noted that the purpose of investigating wave attenuation ability induced by flexible vegetation is not to completely replace hard coastal structures actually aside from the strengths of nature based solutions there are also a series of weaknesses for this solution it is still unrealistic to completely replace hard coastal structures meanwhile it is worth noting that there are still some limitations in this study the established fvdm is just a simple generalization model for describing the highly complex natural process a series of assumptions are applied some of which are inconsistent with reality for instance the physical characteristics of one single flexible stem may vary along the axis of the stem and real vegetation may fold and twine further research should focus on breaking through restrictions of certain assumptions additionally this study focuses on flexible vegetation which can bend forced by wave field and does not deliberately pursue flexible vegetation with highly low flexural rigidity in the case of highly low flexural rigidity and high distribution density the interference between flexible vegetation will increase there could even be twining flattening and breaking of vegetation model applicability under highly low flexural rigidity conditions requires more verifications moreover further validations are required to confirm the developed models regarding the stem motion and vegetation induced wave attenuation especially under natural flow and vegetation conditions finally the model coefficients are determined through model validation in this study which limits the direct application of the developed model under different wave and vegetation conditions research is needed to evaluate the validity of each existing empirical formula for model coefficients in the new mathematic model or propose empirical formulas for model coefficients on the base of significant additional validations and analytical work incorporating the selected or established empirical formula of the coefficient in the present model will further improve the feasibility of the developed models credit authorship contribution statement kai yin methodology formal analysis validation writing original draft writing review editing visualization
