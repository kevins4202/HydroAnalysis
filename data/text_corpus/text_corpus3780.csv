18900,polyhydroxyalkanoates phas polyphosphate poly p and polysulfide or elemental sulfur poly s are the key functionally relevant polymers involved in the recently reported denitrifying sulfur conversion associated enhanced biological phosphorus removal ds ebpr process however little is known about the structural dynamics and storage states of these polymers in particular investigating the poly s generated in this process is quite a superior challenge this study was thus aimed at simultaneously qualitative quantitative investigating poly s and associated poly p and phas through the integrated chemical analysis and raman micro spectroscopy coupled with multiple microscopic methods i e optical microscopy confocal laser scanning microscopy and differential interference contrast microscopy the chemical analytical results displayed a stable ds ebpr phenotype in terms of sulfur conversion p release uptake and the dynamics of relevant polymers the multiple microscopic images and raman spectrum profiles further clearly demonstrated the existence of the polymers and their dynamic changes under alternating anaerobic anoxic conditions consistent with the chemical analytical results in particular raman analysis for the first time unraveled the co existence of s0 sn 2 species stored either intracellularly or extracellularly and the dynamic conversions between s0 sn 2 and other sulfur species suggest that there might be a universal pool of bioavailable sulfur the results reveal the mechanisms underlying the structural dynamics and changes in storage states of the relevant polymers that are functionally relevant to the carbon phosphorus sulfur cycles during different metabolic phases these mechanisms would otherwise not be obtained only using a traditional chemical analysis based approach graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfur conversion enhanced biological phosphorus removal multiple polymers raman micro spectroscopy differential interference contrast microscopy 1 introduction the recently developed denitrifying sulfur conversion associated enhanced biological phosphorus removal ds ebpr process likely employs two key microbial agents sulfate reducing bacteria srb and sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob for simultaneous removal of carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p from saline brackish sewage with high sulfate levels approximately 150 200 mgs l in tropical and subtropical coastal cities e g hong kong wu et al 2014 key biochemical mechanisms are shown in fig 1 and are described by guo et al 2016a and zhang et al 2018 the storage polymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates phas including poly β hydroxybutyrate phb and polyhydroxyvalerate phv polyphosphate poly p and polysulfide sn 2 or elemental sulfur s0 i e poly s play important roles in the metabolic dynamics guo et al 2016a this is especially the case for poly s which is involved as an intermediate in poly p accumulating metabolism in the ds ebpr process indeed the storage of poly s in bacteria has been reported since the 19th century the formation of poly s both biologically and chemically has been recognized as important in several areas dahl et al 2005 berg et al 2014 for example sulfur compounds e g poly s are important components of many bacterial molecules including proteins amino acids hormones and enzymes eckert et al 2003 berg et al 2014 reported that poly s is stored in diverse microorganisms either internally e g beggiatoaceae or externally e g thiobacillus and acts as an intermediary product during the biological oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds the formation of poly s was also found to cause serious odor and corrosion problem in a sewer system liang et al 2016 meanwhile poly s formation can enhance hydrogen sulfide removal from gas streams kleinjan 2005 however despite more than 200 years of research on sulfur species our understanding of the chemical nature e g composition structure and storage states of biogenic poly s is still limited eckert et al 2003 lin et al 2015 the main reasons are as follows 1 poly s often differs ecologically and physiologically across distinct groups of bacteria moreover the sulfur conversions are always undergoing a dynamic process even within the same bacterial species resulting in the speciation varying under different ecophysiological conditions 2 poly s is often extremely sensitive to ph and redox changes and 3 the conventional methods of extraction and analysis always cause variations in the characteristics of poly s eckert et al 2003 berg et al 2014 exploring optimal analytical techniques to measure poly s in a dynamic system with various metabolic phases is key to elucidating the structural dynamics and storage states of poly s as well as other associated polymers i e poly p and phas in the ds ebpr process previous studies relied heavily on either in situ staining and conventional microscopic methods usually optical or fluorescence microscopes for qualitative visualization or ex situ chemical measurements for quantitative determination to determine the abovementioned functional polymers for instance intracellular poly p was determined through analyzing the fractions of phosphate according to the cold perchloric acid extraction method de haas et al 2000 or through confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm with staining methods such as neisser and 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi stains mullan et al 2006 moreover phas were measured by gas chromatography gc oehmen et al 2005 and by sudan black b staining jenkins et al 2004 on the other hand poly s was determined through the sulfite method with ion chromatography ic jiang et al 2009 or through differential interference contrast dic microscope imaging brock and schulz vogt 2011 however a systematic qualitative quantitative approach for investigating these polymers simultaneously in one system e g ds ebpr in particular their composition storage states and location stored intracellularly or extracellularly remains missing raman spectroscopy relies on inelastic light scattering between a photon and a molecule which leads to the excitation of molecular vibrations the technique can offer a wide range of information including chemical composition bonding symmetry structure and physical factors valeur and berberan santos 2012 if coupled to a microscope the raman spectrometer can reveal the nature of substrates at submicrometer spatial resolution and is currently widely applied in microbiology research ivleva et al 2009 majed et al 2009 raman spectroscopy combined with optical microscopy as a useful technique has been applied by majed and gu 2010 to assess and image the biochemical composition and structure of several intracellular polymers e g poly p phas in the conventional ebpr process raman spectroscopy was also used to analyze sulfur species in the single cells of living sob garcía meza et al 2012 hervy et al 2018 applying these new analytical methods may offer clues for overcoming the aforementioned challenges therefore in this study chemical analysis and raman micro spectroscopy were coupled with multiple microscopic methods to simultaneously identify multiple functionally relevant polymers stored in cells in a ds ebpr system this new raman integrated analytical method was further used to evaluate the structural dynamics and storage states of these polymers during different metabolic phases of the ds ebpr system the results would improve our understanding of the c p and s conversions of the functional ds ebpr bacteria and provide new insights into the formation and fate of these polymers during the various bacterial metabolic states 2 materials and methods 2 1 lab scale study of ds ebpr system a 30 l lab scale sequencing batch reactor sbr with a 20 l working volume was operated for a long period of around 500 days to enrich the responsible ds ebpr functional bacteria for details see guo et al 2017 the sludge samples from this system were collected and used for the analysis of relevant polymers poly p phas and poly s the sbr was operated under alternating anaerobic 120 min and anoxic 90 min conditions and fed at the beginning of the anaerobic phase at 0 min in each cycle at the beginning of the anoxic phase at 120 min approximately 550 ml of 2 g nitrate n l solution was added corresponding to 55 mg nitrate n l in the sbr the sludge retention time srt of the system was maintained at 30 days by periodically withdrawing about 6 4 g total suspend solid tss each day the temperature was maintained at 30 1 c using a water bath and the ph was controlled at 7 0 7 9 by adding a 0 5 m hcl and or a 0 5 m naoh solution using an automatic ph controller following our previous study guo et al 2017 the synthetic saline wastewater was made by a mixture of 20 seawater and 80 freshwater and contained 60 mg of nh4 n l 20 mg of po4 3 p l 150 200 mg s l of sulfate total 400 mg chemical oxygen demand cod l equivalent to 150 mg toc l with a 67 33 acetate to propionate ratio the influent exchange volume ratio was kept at 0 5 i e the reactor was fed 10 l per cycle to study the relevant polymers in ds ebpr a cyclic test was carried out during two cycles on day 406 and the results averaged on this day mixed liquor samples were collected throughout the p release anaerobic and p uptake anoxic phases at intervals of 15 30 min each sample 15 ml was filtered through 0 45 μm pore size filters and the filtrate was analyzed for the key anions in the liquid e g acetate propionate nitrite nitrate p sulfate sulfide thiosulfate and chloride the residual solids were tested for phas glycogen and poly s through chemical methods see section 2 2 for details the remainder of the unfiltered sample was subjected to microbial community analysis which was determined using illumina high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene for details see in hao et al 2015 the detailed analysis of community examination and results are provided in the supplemental information si to study the dynamics of relevant polymers in the sludge additional mixed liquor samples 15 ml were collected at the beginning of the anaerobic phase 0 min the end of the anaerobic phase 120 min and the end of the anoxic phase 210 min in the cyclic tests for microscopic examination and analysis using raman spectroscopy coupled with microscopes see sections 2 3 and 2 4 for details finally the correlation between the chemical measurements and the raman coupled with microscopic identification of relevant polymers was assessed at the end of each cycle another 10 ml mixed sample was subjected to mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss analyses 2 2 analytical methods mlss and mlvss were analyzed according to the standard methods apha 2005 the key anions in the liquid were analyzed by ic lc super 20a shimadzu phas were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms agilent 7890a 5975c according to the protocol given by oehmen et al 2005 glycogen was analyzed by the anthrone method following the procedures published by jenkins et al 2004 2 3 microscopic examination of relevant polymers the relevant polymers stored in the bacteria i e phas poly p and poly s were examined by various microscopic methods phas in the biomass were observed under an optical microscope olympus tokyo japan with neisser and sudan black b staining jenkins et al 2004 poly p was identified using dapi staining as described by mullan et al 2006 images were collected under a clsm lsm7 duo 710 live zeiss poly s was examined using a dic microscope nikon niu as reported by brock and schulz vogt 2011 2 4 raman analysis of relevant polymers at least 20 30 raman spectra were examined for each sample raman analysis was performed in a renishaw rm 3000 micro raman system renishaw plc uk with argon laser excitation of 514 nm and laser power of 25 mw the micro raman system was equipped with a leica dmlm microscope with 10 20 50 100 objectives raman spectra were obtained using a leica 50 n plan 0 75 aperture objective for sample visualization and focusing the spectra were recorded between 100 and 2000 cm 1 with a laser power on sample at 5 mw and a spectral resolution of 1 cm 1 which is useful for control purpose raman spectra for poly p standards were determined using commercial chemical sodium phosphate monobasic nah2po4 h2o sigma aldrich purity 99 and sodium hexa meta phosphate napo3 6 sigma aldrich purity 96 raman spectra for pha standards were identified using a weight mixture of 12 phv and 88 phb sigma aldrich raman spectra for several sulfur species were determined using the following analytical grade compounds elemental sulfur sigma aldrich purity 99 sodium sulfate sigma aldrich purity 99 sodium sulfide sigma aldrich purity 99 and potassium poly sulfide sn 2 sigma aldrich purity 42 the vibrational range analyzed for poly s was 100 600 cm 1 as the s0 sn 2 species display their main active modes within this range berg et al 2014 although the bacteria likely contain glycogen in their cells raman analysis of glycogen was not considered in this study due to the low abundance of glycogen accumulating organisms gaos in the reactor see section 3 1 for details and its lower significance than other polymers in the ds ebpr process however raman analysis of glycogen in this process is deem necessary in future study since the glycogen dynamics may also significantly impact ds ebpr performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance and microbial community of ds ebpr after 370 days of operation the ds ebpr sbr reached steady state conditions see guo et al 2017 for details chemical analysis revealed that a good p removal performance of 82 7 16 5 mgp l and an average sulfur conversion of 34 6 mg s l were obtained in the tests on day 406 see table 1 the key anaerobic stoichiometric factors such as the p released and the amount of polymers produced e g phas and poly s are summarized in table 1 the chemical measurements clearly show shifts in the amount of functionally relevant polymers present during the anaerobic and anoxic phases see table 1 which correlate well with the metabolisms of ds ebpr described by guo et al 2017 2018 at the same time through the methods of raman spectroscopy coupled with microscopes the dynamics of relevant polymers was examined see section 3 3 below fig 2 displays the abundance of the bacterial community at the genus level in the ds ebpr system on day 406 the microbial community results are described in detail in si no conventional polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos e g known accumulibacter and tetrasphaera were found in the reactor consistent with wu et al 2014 guo et al 2016b and zhang et al 2018 however this system was found to be enriched by a complex bacterial community containing 16 2 srb and 19 1 sob see fig 2 in details srb genera were dominated by 6 6 desulfobacter 6 4 desulfobulbus and 3 2 desulfuromonas of the total bacterial community while sob consisted of 10 2 thiobacillus 7 2 thiohalomonas and 1 7 sedimenticola a small abundance of gaos e g 3 1 candidatus competibacter were found in the reactor which further explains the good p removal performance observed in the reactor the high enrichments of srb 16 2 and sob 19 1 in the present study are consistent with the findings described by guo et al 2016b and zhang et al 2018 that srb and sob may have synergistic effects on p release and uptake the uncultured thiotrichaceae accounted for 8 3 of the total bacterial community this family possibly includes a host of sulfur bacteria such as the genera beggiatoa thioploca thiomargarita and thiothrix the genera beggiatoa thioploca and thiomargarita are found to live at marine surfaces in upwelling areas associated with phosphorite formation and in phosphorite rocks similar to paos they can perform p release and p uptake under alternating anaerobic and anoxic aerobic conditions alsenz et al 2015 in conventional ebpr the most common sob observed to behave like paos for p removal were recognized as belonging to the genus thiothrix gonzalez gil and holliger 2011 in which thiothrix caldifontis encoded by the ppk2 gene was found to have the capability for poly p metabolism martín et al 2006 rubio rincón et al 2017 successfully cultivated thiothrix caldifontis in an ebpr system for p removal the genus thauera a common denitrifier but also a denitrifying p removing agent was observed to account for 7 0 of the total bacterial community in ds ebpr systems and assumed to be the functional bacteria responsible for denitrifying p removal and sulfide oxidation zhang et al 2017 2018 however this genus has been found in only a small number of s ebpr systems in low abundance up to 13 6 of the total bacterial community zhang et al 2017 further detailed investigation is necessary to determine the abundance and roles of the thiotrichaceae and the genus thauera in this system fig 3 shows the p and s conversion profiles of the ds ebpr system in the cyclic tests on day 406 at the anaerobic stage vfa uptake 6 2 mmol c l equivalent to 74 5 mgc l and sulfate reduction 32 5 mgs l or 11 3 10 4 mol s mol c occurred simultaneously to form intracellular polymers i e phas 1 04 mol c mol c and poly s 11 3 10 4 mol s mol c accompanied by the p released 18 7 mgp l from the cleavage of poly p and the glycolysis of glycogen 0 56 mol c mol c at the subsequent anoxic stage excessive p 27 9 mgp l was taken up to synthesize poly p when nitrate 55 mgn l was offered as the electron acceptor for oxidizing stored phas 0 94 mol c mol c and poly s 11 8 10 4 mol s mol c to produce energy meanwhile biomass growth glycogen replenishment 0 72 mol c mol c and sulfate generation 36 5 mgs l occurred concurrently 3 2 microscopic examination of relevant polymers the distributed states of the relevant polymers observed in the bacteria in different metabolic phases can reveal more information about the ds ebpr system microscopic examination indicated that these polymers existed in sludge at different intensities with alternating anaerobic and anoxic conditions pha granules after sudan black staining of sludge fig 4 a and b subcellular fractions of organelles rich in poly p after dapi staining fig 4c and d sulfur inclusions analyzed by dic microscopy with different shape rules and uneven distribution fig 4e and f the microscopic examination of relevant polymers confirmed the existence of the phas and poly p for conventional ebpr and a new polymer poly s for ds ebpr it is widely accepted that bacteria store pha and poly p inclusions in cells oehmen et al 2007 but the images clearly show the uneven distribution of phas and poly p in bacteria see fig 4b and d furthermore the images reveal the spatial distribution of poly s forming smaller or larger aggregates see fig 4f pha and poly s globules increased during the anaerobic stage fig 4a b and e f suggesting the accumulation of phas and poly s poly p globules decreased during the anaerobic phase but increased during the anoxic phase fig 4c d the results confirm the ability of the functional bacteria to take up carbon anaerobically for sulfate reduction to form poly s and synthesize phas which are then used for anoxic p uptake for poly p synthesis these changes in the relevant polymers stored in bacteria were consistent with changes in metabolism arising from the alternating anaerobic anoxic phases of this process 3 3 characteristic raman spectra of polymers 3 3 1 characteristic polymer standards fig 5 a displays the raman spectrum of phas with phb co phv copolymer as the standards this spectrum was mostly dominated by the peaks at around 430 905 and 1750 cm 1 which are assigned to the bands of δ cc skeletal deformations ν cc skeletal stretches and ν co stretching vibrations respectively majed and gu 2010 the peak at 905 cm 1 representing ν cc skeletal stretches was selected for the phb co phv copolymer while the peak at 1750 cm 1 representing ν co stretching vibrations was selected for the phb according to majed and gu 2010 in fig 5b raman spectra of the sn 2 standard was mainly dominated by three peaks at 155 217 and 470 cm 1 respectively the two peaks at 155 217 cm 1 are assigned to the bending and stretching modes of the s8 belonging to the most thermodynamically stable form of s0 orthorhombic α sulfur the third peak at 470 cm 1 is assigned to the vibration of the s s bond since the ν ss region ranges from 450 to 550 cm 1 berg et al 2014 van wart and scheraga 1976 fig 5c displays the spectra of hexa meta phosphate napo3 6 which is characterized by the pop stretching at 740 cm 1 and the po2 stretches at around 1163 cm 1 respectively this is almost consistent with pop and po2 bands peaking at 690 and 1157 cm 1 respectively reported by majed et al 2009 fig 5d shows the raman spectrum of elemental sulfur which is characterized by supplementary signals at 155 217 373 470 and 489 cm 1 these peaks show similar positions to those of polysulfide sn 2 except that the signal at 373 cm 1 likely corresponds to pyrite garcía meza et al 2012 and the signals at 470 and 489 cm 1 match the s s band van wart and scheraga 1976 the raman spectra for identification of the relevant polymers are summarized in table 2 3 3 2 simultaneous identification of multiple functionally relevant polymers the absolute positions of raman peaks represent specific bands but the signals of the raman spectrum generated by biomolecules with several bands in sludge may overlap therefore it is crucial to select one unique and representative peak without any or with minimal interference from the others for each polymer besides the band positions of the raman spectrum of the polymer standards and samples may have different wavenumbers i e raman red shift or blue shift due to the different physicochemical state of the polymers and or various microbial communities majed and gu 2010 ivleva et al 2017 it is also significant to find the optimal peaks for the raman spectra for analyzing samples as compared to the polymer standards fig 6 shows three types of raman spectra in terms of the diverse combinations of the relevant polymers in samples obtained at the beginning of the anaerobic phase t 0 min the beginning of the anoxic phase t 120 min and the end of the anoxic phase t 210 min of the ds ebpr process by comparing raman spectra of standards and samples see figs 5 and 6 it was found that the peaks near 905 1010 cm 1 could be selected to indicate phb co phv copolymer while the best indicator for phb is near the 1750 1760 cm 1 peak because of the absence of the raman band of pop vibrations peaking near 740 cm 1 raman spectrum of standard in the samples po2 1 vibrations peaking near 1130 1163 cm 1 were considered for representing poly p the raman spectrum of bacterial cells for poly s was characterized by five peaks at 152 216 320 470 and 495 cm 1 of which the peaks at 152 and 216 cm 1 match those of s0 and the peaks at 470 and 495 cm 1 could be considered as indicators for polysulfide sn 2 fig 5b and d the peak at 320 cm 1 newly observed at the end of the anoxic stage 210 min likely corresponds to monosulfide s garcía meza et al 2012 the band position at 1520 cm 1 corresponds to cc stretching which may indicate carotenoids that are found in many different complex matrixes such as animals plants fungi and algae schulte et al 2009 the relative heights or areas of specific raman peaks can reflect the relative polymer contents in cells to a certain extent majed and gu 2010 berg et al 2014 as shown in fig 6 the peaks near 1010 cm 1 representing phb co phv copolymer and the peaks near 1760 cm 1 representing phb were found at 120 min fig 6b but are much weaker they are almost nonexistent at 210 min fig 6c which is consistent with the anaerobic storage of phb and phv and the anoxic utilization of phb and phv as the primary pha fraction in ds ebpr systems fig 3b besides the phb co phv and phv band intensities show a difference indicating they have different fractions of pha stored see fig 6b this can be attributed to the substrate types and metabolism of the functional bacteria which when fed with a mixed carbon sources with acetate and propionate at a molar ratio of 2 1 produce more phb than phv in ds ebpr guo et al 2016a as well as in a conventional ebpr system oehmen et al 2007 the presence of s0 sn 2 species in samples taken at 120 min is confirmed by two s8 ring vibration peaks at 150 and 217 cm 1 and the dominant ss peak at 470 cm 1 revealed by raman spectroscopy see fig 6a and b the intensity of these three peaks calculated as the area of peaks increased by 1 7 2 1 times in the anaerobic phase from 0 to 120 min indicating the increase of s0 sn 2 inclusion production in cells meanwhile the ratio of the 150 and 217 cm 1 s8 peaks relative to the 470 cm 1 ss peak calculated as the area of peaks was 2 8 for the 120 min sample but only 2 3 for the initial sample at 0 min which indicates the increase of s0 fraction in the mixture of s0 sn 2 species at 210 min fig 6c raman results suggest that the bacteria had performed s0 sn 2 oxidization because s0 peaks at 150 and 217 cm 1 was almost depleted and sn 2 peaks at 470 and 495 cm 1 was reduced see fig 6c while a small amount of pyrite peaking at 320 cm 1 was produced the total intracellular poly p intensity po2 1 vibrations occurring near 1130 1163 cm 1 of the raman spectra of samples taken at 120 min was obviously reduced compared with that of the samples taken at 210 min fig 6a and c confirming that poly p was used and released as ortho p into the bulk liquid see fig 3a the subsequent anoxic p uptake phase was confirmed by the increase in the poly p content with an increase in the raman intensity of the peak at 1130 cm 1 see fig 6b and c the intensities of raman signals for phb co phv and phb displayed an increase with pha forming at the anaerobic stage the intensities subsequently decreased to almost zero indicating that phb co phv and phb were consumed at the subsequent anoxic stage similarly the intensities of raman signals for poly s peaks at 155 217 and 470 cm 1 showed a clear increase due to sulfate reduction to form poly s at the anaerobic stage then the limited s0 sn 2 was consumed during the s0 sn 2 oxidation at the anoxic stage as evidenced by the depletion of s0 sn 2 species see fig 6c suggesting the functional bacteria were performing dynamic sulfur oxidation activities the above results show that the raman intensity profiles for the relevant polymers are correlated with the chemical analysis and are consistent and reflective of different metabolic phases of this process see figs 3 and 6 this outcome demonstrates that raman micro spectroscopy is a tool that can be used to investigate in depth the composition and storage states of these polymers which is currently not possible through chemical analysis alone particularly the changes in the raman spectra for poly s peaks at 155 217 and 470 cm 1 reflect the formation and consumption of s0 sn 2 species at different metabolic phases strongly indicating that these species represent a universal pool of bioavailable sulfur for sulfur conversion driven p removal in ds ebpr process these findings further enhance our understanding of the mechanism and significance of sulfur conversion in ds ebpr promoting us to take measures to maintain a proper poly s storage in cells 3 4 species and roles of poly s raman results indicate the existence and changes of s0 sn 2 species depending on the alternating anaerobic anoxic conditions see figs 5c and 6 with dic and raman spectroscopy it is not possible to determine the exact amounts of poly s that could be secreted and stored intracellularly or extracellularly because the sulfur conversions are assumed to be conducted by a mixed culture of srb and sob the sulfur species could be transferred between intermolecular or interspecies furthermore the sulfur bioreactions are in a dynamic process together with sulfur having a broad range of chemical valences from 2 completely reduced to 6 completely oxidized muyzer and stams 2008 which may produce either soluble sulfur species e g sulfide sulfate and partial polysulfide dissolved in bulk liquid or relatively insoluble sulfur species e g elemental sulfur stored in sludge all of these findings further suggest that poly s is stored intracellularly and or extracellularly the formation of poly s at the anaerobic phase is attributed to both srb and sob see fig 1 in general srb can use sulfate as a final electron acceptor for the degradation of carbon substrates generating the end product of s2 however wu et al 2013 guo et al 2016a and this study have found that sulfide and thiosulfate are basically absent from the bulk fluid and nearly all of the reduced form of sulfur is stored as s0 sn 2 inclusions in sludge which is contrary to the observation of free s2 in the bulk fluid by yu et al 2016 and zhang et al 2017 thus a question arises why is sulfate reduction limited to s0 sn 2 inclusions and not to hs h2s this may be attributed to the anaerobic biooxidation of sulfide by srb or sob following the sulfate reduction by srb it has been reported that s0 could be an intermediate of s2 oxidation with oxygen by certain srb such as desulfobulbus propionicus fuseler and cypionka 1995 besides the high diversity of srb and sob was detected in the ds ebpr system see section 3 1 and both of them were involved in sulfur conversion sulfate reduction and sulfide sulfur oxidization in detail srb reduce sulfate directly to sulfide with carbon substrates as the electron donor then sob possibly oxidize sulfide to generate intermediate elemental sulfur with oxygen or ferrous as the electron acceptor a small amount of oxygen could originate from the oxygen dissolved in the seeding and escaping into the 10 l headspace of the reactor besides 20 seawater was added to the influent in which ferric iron dissolved li et al 2017 ferric iron can serve as an oxidizing agent converting sulfide to s0 chemically or biologically steudel 1996 tang et al 2009 as follows s2 fe3 s0 fe2 h2so4 some species e g acidithiobacillus ferroxidans that are physiologically close to the genus thiobacillus detected in the present study may be involved in this bioreaction in ambient conditions sn 2 can be produced by the enzymatic cleavage of ss bonds in s8 with the attack of hs in the presence of s2 see eq 2 n 8 s8 hs sn 1 2 h rabus et al 2013 sn 2 are also strong nucleophiles and could be formed by an autocatalytic cleavage of ss bond in comparison sn 2 as linear sulfur molecules and a carrier of zero valent sulfur atoms are much more bioavailable to cells than s0 as reported s0 is characterized by its water insolubility 5 mg l at 25 c liang et al 2016 which could lead to low bioavailability di capua et al 2015 thus soluble sn 2 can freely pass through the cell membrane on the other hand it is both energy intensive and time consuming to transport s0 through the cell membrane liang et al 2016 the chain length n of sn 2 in the present study typically varies from two to nine with multiple chain lengths occurring in equilibrium with each other gun et al 2004 the chain length is ph dependent at alkaline ph the sn 2 with shorter chain lengths dominate and at neutral ph the polysulfide with longer chains ultimately forming s8 i e s0 account for a greater fraction the ph was kept in a neutral range 7 0 7 9 in the present study which may have resulted in the sn 2 having the common average chain length of 5 5 van den bosch et al 2007 indeed this length is favorable for the oxidation of sn 2 as a longer chain e g after forming s0 will decrease the oxidation rate when nitrate is offered as the electron acceptor sn 2 will first be oxidized to s0 according to sn 2 no3 s0 so4 2 no2 before the s0 is further oxidized to sulfate the oxidation of s0 coupled with denitrification follows the reaction s0 1 2no3 0 4h2o so4 2 0 6n2 0 8h in general sob such as thiobacillus denitrificans which could secrete and release sulfur inclusions prefer to oxidize stored sulfur i e s0 sn 2 after other reduced sulfur compounds such as sulfide and thiosulfate have been depleted xu et al 2016 this is consistent with the findings that sob would first oxidize sulfide and store it as poly s and then continue to utilize poly s to generate part of the energy needed for p uptake guo et al 2016a based on the different characteristics of s0 and sn 2 and their dynamics it s recommended to produce more soluble sn 2 than s0 during anaerobic phase for the subsequent anoxic p uptake in ds ebpr process 3 5 overall understanding and implications the key relevant polymers including pha poly p and poly s play significant roles in the basic ds ebpr mechanism and therefore the ability to investigate their structural dynamics and storage states is crucial for fundamental understanding of the ds ebpr process however current ds ebpr studies still lack a systematic qualitative quantitative analysis of these polymers in particular although poly s was initially defined by wu et al 2014 as the compounds of polysulfide and elemental sulfur in ds ebpr process its composition was under speculation according to the investigations reported in this work the simultaneously qualitative identification and quantitation of relevant polymers have been achieved by raman micro spectroscopy coupled with multiple microscopic techniques raman analysis for the first time unraveled s0 sn 2 species as the poly s in ds ebpr besides the potential dynamics of poly s and its roles involved in sulfur conversion driven p removal were also clarified all of these would allow further study to gain more fundamental understanding of the metabolic pathways involving the various polymers for improving the ds ebpr performance furthermore as discussed in the introduction section it s a big challenge to investigate the composition structure and storage states of biogenic poly s this study demonstrated the potential application of raman microscopy to quantitatively investigate the dynamics of poly s under different metabolic states which provides us with the opportunity to elucidate more detailed behavior of srb and or sob microbial communities in sulfate laden wastewater treatment process 4 conclusions this study has applied the integrated chemical analysis and raman micro spectroscopy coupled with multiple microscopes to simultaneously qualitative quantitative investigate the key relevant polymers involved in ds ebpr process i e poly s and associated poly p and phas the microscopic images and raman intensity profiles support the existence of these polymers and clearly demonstrated their dynamic conversions during different metabolic phases which are consistent with the chemical analytical results in particular raman analysis displays the co existence s0

18900,polyhydroxyalkanoates phas polyphosphate poly p and polysulfide or elemental sulfur poly s are the key functionally relevant polymers involved in the recently reported denitrifying sulfur conversion associated enhanced biological phosphorus removal ds ebpr process however little is known about the structural dynamics and storage states of these polymers in particular investigating the poly s generated in this process is quite a superior challenge this study was thus aimed at simultaneously qualitative quantitative investigating poly s and associated poly p and phas through the integrated chemical analysis and raman micro spectroscopy coupled with multiple microscopic methods i e optical microscopy confocal laser scanning microscopy and differential interference contrast microscopy the chemical analytical results displayed a stable ds ebpr phenotype in terms of sulfur conversion p release uptake and the dynamics of relevant polymers the multiple microscopic images and raman spectrum profiles further clearly demonstrated the existence of the polymers and their dynamic changes under alternating anaerobic anoxic conditions consistent with the chemical analytical results in particular raman analysis for the first time unraveled the co existence of s0 sn 2 species stored either intracellularly or extracellularly and the dynamic conversions between s0 sn 2 and other sulfur species suggest that there might be a universal pool of bioavailable sulfur the results reveal the mechanisms underlying the structural dynamics and changes in storage states of the relevant polymers that are functionally relevant to the carbon phosphorus sulfur cycles during different metabolic phases these mechanisms would otherwise not be obtained only using a traditional chemical analysis based approach graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfur conversion enhanced biological phosphorus removal multiple polymers raman micro spectroscopy differential interference contrast microscopy 1 introduction the recently developed denitrifying sulfur conversion associated enhanced biological phosphorus removal ds ebpr process likely employs two key microbial agents sulfate reducing bacteria srb and sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob for simultaneous removal of carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p from saline brackish sewage with high sulfate levels approximately 150 200 mgs l in tropical and subtropical coastal cities e g hong kong wu et al 2014 key biochemical mechanisms are shown in fig 1 and are described by guo et al 2016a and zhang et al 2018 the storage polymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates phas including poly β hydroxybutyrate phb and polyhydroxyvalerate phv polyphosphate poly p and polysulfide sn 2 or elemental sulfur s0 i e poly s play important roles in the metabolic dynamics guo et al 2016a this is especially the case for poly s which is involved as an intermediate in poly p accumulating metabolism in the ds ebpr process indeed the storage of poly s in bacteria has been reported since the 19th century the formation of poly s both biologically and chemically has been recognized as important in several areas dahl et al 2005 berg et al 2014 for example sulfur compounds e g poly s are important components of many bacterial molecules including proteins amino acids hormones and enzymes eckert et al 2003 berg et al 2014 reported that poly s is stored in diverse microorganisms either internally e g beggiatoaceae or externally e g thiobacillus and acts as an intermediary product during the biological oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds the formation of poly s was also found to cause serious odor and corrosion problem in a sewer system liang et al 2016 meanwhile poly s formation can enhance hydrogen sulfide removal from gas streams kleinjan 2005 however despite more than 200 years of research on sulfur species our understanding of the chemical nature e g composition structure and storage states of biogenic poly s is still limited eckert et al 2003 lin et al 2015 the main reasons are as follows 1 poly s often differs ecologically and physiologically across distinct groups of bacteria moreover the sulfur conversions are always undergoing a dynamic process even within the same bacterial species resulting in the speciation varying under different ecophysiological conditions 2 poly s is often extremely sensitive to ph and redox changes and 3 the conventional methods of extraction and analysis always cause variations in the characteristics of poly s eckert et al 2003 berg et al 2014 exploring optimal analytical techniques to measure poly s in a dynamic system with various metabolic phases is key to elucidating the structural dynamics and storage states of poly s as well as other associated polymers i e poly p and phas in the ds ebpr process previous studies relied heavily on either in situ staining and conventional microscopic methods usually optical or fluorescence microscopes for qualitative visualization or ex situ chemical measurements for quantitative determination to determine the abovementioned functional polymers for instance intracellular poly p was determined through analyzing the fractions of phosphate according to the cold perchloric acid extraction method de haas et al 2000 or through confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm with staining methods such as neisser and 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi stains mullan et al 2006 moreover phas were measured by gas chromatography gc oehmen et al 2005 and by sudan black b staining jenkins et al 2004 on the other hand poly s was determined through the sulfite method with ion chromatography ic jiang et al 2009 or through differential interference contrast dic microscope imaging brock and schulz vogt 2011 however a systematic qualitative quantitative approach for investigating these polymers simultaneously in one system e g ds ebpr in particular their composition storage states and location stored intracellularly or extracellularly remains missing raman spectroscopy relies on inelastic light scattering between a photon and a molecule which leads to the excitation of molecular vibrations the technique can offer a wide range of information including chemical composition bonding symmetry structure and physical factors valeur and berberan santos 2012 if coupled to a microscope the raman spectrometer can reveal the nature of substrates at submicrometer spatial resolution and is currently widely applied in microbiology research ivleva et al 2009 majed et al 2009 raman spectroscopy combined with optical microscopy as a useful technique has been applied by majed and gu 2010 to assess and image the biochemical composition and structure of several intracellular polymers e g poly p phas in the conventional ebpr process raman spectroscopy was also used to analyze sulfur species in the single cells of living sob garcía meza et al 2012 hervy et al 2018 applying these new analytical methods may offer clues for overcoming the aforementioned challenges therefore in this study chemical analysis and raman micro spectroscopy were coupled with multiple microscopic methods to simultaneously identify multiple functionally relevant polymers stored in cells in a ds ebpr system this new raman integrated analytical method was further used to evaluate the structural dynamics and storage states of these polymers during different metabolic phases of the ds ebpr system the results would improve our understanding of the c p and s conversions of the functional ds ebpr bacteria and provide new insights into the formation and fate of these polymers during the various bacterial metabolic states 2 materials and methods 2 1 lab scale study of ds ebpr system a 30 l lab scale sequencing batch reactor sbr with a 20 l working volume was operated for a long period of around 500 days to enrich the responsible ds ebpr functional bacteria for details see guo et al 2017 the sludge samples from this system were collected and used for the analysis of relevant polymers poly p phas and poly s the sbr was operated under alternating anaerobic 120 min and anoxic 90 min conditions and fed at the beginning of the anaerobic phase at 0 min in each cycle at the beginning of the anoxic phase at 120 min approximately 550 ml of 2 g nitrate n l solution was added corresponding to 55 mg nitrate n l in the sbr the sludge retention time srt of the system was maintained at 30 days by periodically withdrawing about 6 4 g total suspend solid tss each day the temperature was maintained at 30 1 c using a water bath and the ph was controlled at 7 0 7 9 by adding a 0 5 m hcl and or a 0 5 m naoh solution using an automatic ph controller following our previous study guo et al 2017 the synthetic saline wastewater was made by a mixture of 20 seawater and 80 freshwater and contained 60 mg of nh4 n l 20 mg of po4 3 p l 150 200 mg s l of sulfate total 400 mg chemical oxygen demand cod l equivalent to 150 mg toc l with a 67 33 acetate to propionate ratio the influent exchange volume ratio was kept at 0 5 i e the reactor was fed 10 l per cycle to study the relevant polymers in ds ebpr a cyclic test was carried out during two cycles on day 406 and the results averaged on this day mixed liquor samples were collected throughout the p release anaerobic and p uptake anoxic phases at intervals of 15 30 min each sample 15 ml was filtered through 0 45 μm pore size filters and the filtrate was analyzed for the key anions in the liquid e g acetate propionate nitrite nitrate p sulfate sulfide thiosulfate and chloride the residual solids were tested for phas glycogen and poly s through chemical methods see section 2 2 for details the remainder of the unfiltered sample was subjected to microbial community analysis which was determined using illumina high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene for details see in hao et al 2015 the detailed analysis of community examination and results are provided in the supplemental information si to study the dynamics of relevant polymers in the sludge additional mixed liquor samples 15 ml were collected at the beginning of the anaerobic phase 0 min the end of the anaerobic phase 120 min and the end of the anoxic phase 210 min in the cyclic tests for microscopic examination and analysis using raman spectroscopy coupled with microscopes see sections 2 3 and 2 4 for details finally the correlation between the chemical measurements and the raman coupled with microscopic identification of relevant polymers was assessed at the end of each cycle another 10 ml mixed sample was subjected to mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss analyses 2 2 analytical methods mlss and mlvss were analyzed according to the standard methods apha 2005 the key anions in the liquid were analyzed by ic lc super 20a shimadzu phas were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms agilent 7890a 5975c according to the protocol given by oehmen et al 2005 glycogen was analyzed by the anthrone method following the procedures published by jenkins et al 2004 2 3 microscopic examination of relevant polymers the relevant polymers stored in the bacteria i e phas poly p and poly s were examined by various microscopic methods phas in the biomass were observed under an optical microscope olympus tokyo japan with neisser and sudan black b staining jenkins et al 2004 poly p was identified using dapi staining as described by mullan et al 2006 images were collected under a clsm lsm7 duo 710 live zeiss poly s was examined using a dic microscope nikon niu as reported by brock and schulz vogt 2011 2 4 raman analysis of relevant polymers at least 20 30 raman spectra were examined for each sample raman analysis was performed in a renishaw rm 3000 micro raman system renishaw plc uk with argon laser excitation of 514 nm and laser power of 25 mw the micro raman system was equipped with a leica dmlm microscope with 10 20 50 100 objectives raman spectra were obtained using a leica 50 n plan 0 75 aperture objective for sample visualization and focusing the spectra were recorded between 100 and 2000 cm 1 with a laser power on sample at 5 mw and a spectral resolution of 1 cm 1 which is useful for control purpose raman spectra for poly p standards were determined using commercial chemical sodium phosphate monobasic nah2po4 h2o sigma aldrich purity 99 and sodium hexa meta phosphate napo3 6 sigma aldrich purity 96 raman spectra for pha standards were identified using a weight mixture of 12 phv and 88 phb sigma aldrich raman spectra for several sulfur species were determined using the following analytical grade compounds elemental sulfur sigma aldrich purity 99 sodium sulfate sigma aldrich purity 99 sodium sulfide sigma aldrich purity 99 and potassium poly sulfide sn 2 sigma aldrich purity 42 the vibrational range analyzed for poly s was 100 600 cm 1 as the s0 sn 2 species display their main active modes within this range berg et al 2014 although the bacteria likely contain glycogen in their cells raman analysis of glycogen was not considered in this study due to the low abundance of glycogen accumulating organisms gaos in the reactor see section 3 1 for details and its lower significance than other polymers in the ds ebpr process however raman analysis of glycogen in this process is deem necessary in future study since the glycogen dynamics may also significantly impact ds ebpr performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance and microbial community of ds ebpr after 370 days of operation the ds ebpr sbr reached steady state conditions see guo et al 2017 for details chemical analysis revealed that a good p removal performance of 82 7 16 5 mgp l and an average sulfur conversion of 34 6 mg s l were obtained in the tests on day 406 see table 1 the key anaerobic stoichiometric factors such as the p released and the amount of polymers produced e g phas and poly s are summarized in table 1 the chemical measurements clearly show shifts in the amount of functionally relevant polymers present during the anaerobic and anoxic phases see table 1 which correlate well with the metabolisms of ds ebpr described by guo et al 2017 2018 at the same time through the methods of raman spectroscopy coupled with microscopes the dynamics of relevant polymers was examined see section 3 3 below fig 2 displays the abundance of the bacterial community at the genus level in the ds ebpr system on day 406 the microbial community results are described in detail in si no conventional polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos e g known accumulibacter and tetrasphaera were found in the reactor consistent with wu et al 2014 guo et al 2016b and zhang et al 2018 however this system was found to be enriched by a complex bacterial community containing 16 2 srb and 19 1 sob see fig 2 in details srb genera were dominated by 6 6 desulfobacter 6 4 desulfobulbus and 3 2 desulfuromonas of the total bacterial community while sob consisted of 10 2 thiobacillus 7 2 thiohalomonas and 1 7 sedimenticola a small abundance of gaos e g 3 1 candidatus competibacter were found in the reactor which further explains the good p removal performance observed in the reactor the high enrichments of srb 16 2 and sob 19 1 in the present study are consistent with the findings described by guo et al 2016b and zhang et al 2018 that srb and sob may have synergistic effects on p release and uptake the uncultured thiotrichaceae accounted for 8 3 of the total bacterial community this family possibly includes a host of sulfur bacteria such as the genera beggiatoa thioploca thiomargarita and thiothrix the genera beggiatoa thioploca and thiomargarita are found to live at marine surfaces in upwelling areas associated with phosphorite formation and in phosphorite rocks similar to paos they can perform p release and p uptake under alternating anaerobic and anoxic aerobic conditions alsenz et al 2015 in conventional ebpr the most common sob observed to behave like paos for p removal were recognized as belonging to the genus thiothrix gonzalez gil and holliger 2011 in which thiothrix caldifontis encoded by the ppk2 gene was found to have the capability for poly p metabolism martín et al 2006 rubio rincón et al 2017 successfully cultivated thiothrix caldifontis in an ebpr system for p removal the genus thauera a common denitrifier but also a denitrifying p removing agent was observed to account for 7 0 of the total bacterial community in ds ebpr systems and assumed to be the functional bacteria responsible for denitrifying p removal and sulfide oxidation zhang et al 2017 2018 however this genus has been found in only a small number of s ebpr systems in low abundance up to 13 6 of the total bacterial community zhang et al 2017 further detailed investigation is necessary to determine the abundance and roles of the thiotrichaceae and the genus thauera in this system fig 3 shows the p and s conversion profiles of the ds ebpr system in the cyclic tests on day 406 at the anaerobic stage vfa uptake 6 2 mmol c l equivalent to 74 5 mgc l and sulfate reduction 32 5 mgs l or 11 3 10 4 mol s mol c occurred simultaneously to form intracellular polymers i e phas 1 04 mol c mol c and poly s 11 3 10 4 mol s mol c accompanied by the p released 18 7 mgp l from the cleavage of poly p and the glycolysis of glycogen 0 56 mol c mol c at the subsequent anoxic stage excessive p 27 9 mgp l was taken up to synthesize poly p when nitrate 55 mgn l was offered as the electron acceptor for oxidizing stored phas 0 94 mol c mol c and poly s 11 8 10 4 mol s mol c to produce energy meanwhile biomass growth glycogen replenishment 0 72 mol c mol c and sulfate generation 36 5 mgs l occurred concurrently 3 2 microscopic examination of relevant polymers the distributed states of the relevant polymers observed in the bacteria in different metabolic phases can reveal more information about the ds ebpr system microscopic examination indicated that these polymers existed in sludge at different intensities with alternating anaerobic and anoxic conditions pha granules after sudan black staining of sludge fig 4 a and b subcellular fractions of organelles rich in poly p after dapi staining fig 4c and d sulfur inclusions analyzed by dic microscopy with different shape rules and uneven distribution fig 4e and f the microscopic examination of relevant polymers confirmed the existence of the phas and poly p for conventional ebpr and a new polymer poly s for ds ebpr it is widely accepted that bacteria store pha and poly p inclusions in cells oehmen et al 2007 but the images clearly show the uneven distribution of phas and poly p in bacteria see fig 4b and d furthermore the images reveal the spatial distribution of poly s forming smaller or larger aggregates see fig 4f pha and poly s globules increased during the anaerobic stage fig 4a b and e f suggesting the accumulation of phas and poly s poly p globules decreased during the anaerobic phase but increased during the anoxic phase fig 4c d the results confirm the ability of the functional bacteria to take up carbon anaerobically for sulfate reduction to form poly s and synthesize phas which are then used for anoxic p uptake for poly p synthesis these changes in the relevant polymers stored in bacteria were consistent with changes in metabolism arising from the alternating anaerobic anoxic phases of this process 3 3 characteristic raman spectra of polymers 3 3 1 characteristic polymer standards fig 5 a displays the raman spectrum of phas with phb co phv copolymer as the standards this spectrum was mostly dominated by the peaks at around 430 905 and 1750 cm 1 which are assigned to the bands of δ cc skeletal deformations ν cc skeletal stretches and ν co stretching vibrations respectively majed and gu 2010 the peak at 905 cm 1 representing ν cc skeletal stretches was selected for the phb co phv copolymer while the peak at 1750 cm 1 representing ν co stretching vibrations was selected for the phb according to majed and gu 2010 in fig 5b raman spectra of the sn 2 standard was mainly dominated by three peaks at 155 217 and 470 cm 1 respectively the two peaks at 155 217 cm 1 are assigned to the bending and stretching modes of the s8 belonging to the most thermodynamically stable form of s0 orthorhombic α sulfur the third peak at 470 cm 1 is assigned to the vibration of the s s bond since the ν ss region ranges from 450 to 550 cm 1 berg et al 2014 van wart and scheraga 1976 fig 5c displays the spectra of hexa meta phosphate napo3 6 which is characterized by the pop stretching at 740 cm 1 and the po2 stretches at around 1163 cm 1 respectively this is almost consistent with pop and po2 bands peaking at 690 and 1157 cm 1 respectively reported by majed et al 2009 fig 5d shows the raman spectrum of elemental sulfur which is characterized by supplementary signals at 155 217 373 470 and 489 cm 1 these peaks show similar positions to those of polysulfide sn 2 except that the signal at 373 cm 1 likely corresponds to pyrite garcía meza et al 2012 and the signals at 470 and 489 cm 1 match the s s band van wart and scheraga 1976 the raman spectra for identification of the relevant polymers are summarized in table 2 3 3 2 simultaneous identification of multiple functionally relevant polymers the absolute positions of raman peaks represent specific bands but the signals of the raman spectrum generated by biomolecules with several bands in sludge may overlap therefore it is crucial to select one unique and representative peak without any or with minimal interference from the others for each polymer besides the band positions of the raman spectrum of the polymer standards and samples may have different wavenumbers i e raman red shift or blue shift due to the different physicochemical state of the polymers and or various microbial communities majed and gu 2010 ivleva et al 2017 it is also significant to find the optimal peaks for the raman spectra for analyzing samples as compared to the polymer standards fig 6 shows three types of raman spectra in terms of the diverse combinations of the relevant polymers in samples obtained at the beginning of the anaerobic phase t 0 min the beginning of the anoxic phase t 120 min and the end of the anoxic phase t 210 min of the ds ebpr process by comparing raman spectra of standards and samples see figs 5 and 6 it was found that the peaks near 905 1010 cm 1 could be selected to indicate phb co phv copolymer while the best indicator for phb is near the 1750 1760 cm 1 peak because of the absence of the raman band of pop vibrations peaking near 740 cm 1 raman spectrum of standard in the samples po2 1 vibrations peaking near 1130 1163 cm 1 were considered for representing poly p the raman spectrum of bacterial cells for poly s was characterized by five peaks at 152 216 320 470 and 495 cm 1 of which the peaks at 152 and 216 cm 1 match those of s0 and the peaks at 470 and 495 cm 1 could be considered as indicators for polysulfide sn 2 fig 5b and d the peak at 320 cm 1 newly observed at the end of the anoxic stage 210 min likely corresponds to monosulfide s garcía meza et al 2012 the band position at 1520 cm 1 corresponds to cc stretching which may indicate carotenoids that are found in many different complex matrixes such as animals plants fungi and algae schulte et al 2009 the relative heights or areas of specific raman peaks can reflect the relative polymer contents in cells to a certain extent majed and gu 2010 berg et al 2014 as shown in fig 6 the peaks near 1010 cm 1 representing phb co phv copolymer and the peaks near 1760 cm 1 representing phb were found at 120 min fig 6b but are much weaker they are almost nonexistent at 210 min fig 6c which is consistent with the anaerobic storage of phb and phv and the anoxic utilization of phb and phv as the primary pha fraction in ds ebpr systems fig 3b besides the phb co phv and phv band intensities show a difference indicating they have different fractions of pha stored see fig 6b this can be attributed to the substrate types and metabolism of the functional bacteria which when fed with a mixed carbon sources with acetate and propionate at a molar ratio of 2 1 produce more phb than phv in ds ebpr guo et al 2016a as well as in a conventional ebpr system oehmen et al 2007 the presence of s0 sn 2 species in samples taken at 120 min is confirmed by two s8 ring vibration peaks at 150 and 217 cm 1 and the dominant ss peak at 470 cm 1 revealed by raman spectroscopy see fig 6a and b the intensity of these three peaks calculated as the area of peaks increased by 1 7 2 1 times in the anaerobic phase from 0 to 120 min indicating the increase of s0 sn 2 inclusion production in cells meanwhile the ratio of the 150 and 217 cm 1 s8 peaks relative to the 470 cm 1 ss peak calculated as the area of peaks was 2 8 for the 120 min sample but only 2 3 for the initial sample at 0 min which indicates the increase of s0 fraction in the mixture of s0 sn 2 species at 210 min fig 6c raman results suggest that the bacteria had performed s0 sn 2 oxidization because s0 peaks at 150 and 217 cm 1 was almost depleted and sn 2 peaks at 470 and 495 cm 1 was reduced see fig 6c while a small amount of pyrite peaking at 320 cm 1 was produced the total intracellular poly p intensity po2 1 vibrations occurring near 1130 1163 cm 1 of the raman spectra of samples taken at 120 min was obviously reduced compared with that of the samples taken at 210 min fig 6a and c confirming that poly p was used and released as ortho p into the bulk liquid see fig 3a the subsequent anoxic p uptake phase was confirmed by the increase in the poly p content with an increase in the raman intensity of the peak at 1130 cm 1 see fig 6b and c the intensities of raman signals for phb co phv and phb displayed an increase with pha forming at the anaerobic stage the intensities subsequently decreased to almost zero indicating that phb co phv and phb were consumed at the subsequent anoxic stage similarly the intensities of raman signals for poly s peaks at 155 217 and 470 cm 1 showed a clear increase due to sulfate reduction to form poly s at the anaerobic stage then the limited s0 sn 2 was consumed during the s0 sn 2 oxidation at the anoxic stage as evidenced by the depletion of s0 sn 2 species see fig 6c suggesting the functional bacteria were performing dynamic sulfur oxidation activities the above results show that the raman intensity profiles for the relevant polymers are correlated with the chemical analysis and are consistent and reflective of different metabolic phases of this process see figs 3 and 6 this outcome demonstrates that raman micro spectroscopy is a tool that can be used to investigate in depth the composition and storage states of these polymers which is currently not possible through chemical analysis alone particularly the changes in the raman spectra for poly s peaks at 155 217 and 470 cm 1 reflect the formation and consumption of s0 sn 2 species at different metabolic phases strongly indicating that these species represent a universal pool of bioavailable sulfur for sulfur conversion driven p removal in ds ebpr process these findings further enhance our understanding of the mechanism and significance of sulfur conversion in ds ebpr promoting us to take measures to maintain a proper poly s storage in cells 3 4 species and roles of poly s raman results indicate the existence and changes of s0 sn 2 species depending on the alternating anaerobic anoxic conditions see figs 5c and 6 with dic and raman spectroscopy it is not possible to determine the exact amounts of poly s that could be secreted and stored intracellularly or extracellularly because the sulfur conversions are assumed to be conducted by a mixed culture of srb and sob the sulfur species could be transferred between intermolecular or interspecies furthermore the sulfur bioreactions are in a dynamic process together with sulfur having a broad range of chemical valences from 2 completely reduced to 6 completely oxidized muyzer and stams 2008 which may produce either soluble sulfur species e g sulfide sulfate and partial polysulfide dissolved in bulk liquid or relatively insoluble sulfur species e g elemental sulfur stored in sludge all of these findings further suggest that poly s is stored intracellularly and or extracellularly the formation of poly s at the anaerobic phase is attributed to both srb and sob see fig 1 in general srb can use sulfate as a final electron acceptor for the degradation of carbon substrates generating the end product of s2 however wu et al 2013 guo et al 2016a and this study have found that sulfide and thiosulfate are basically absent from the bulk fluid and nearly all of the reduced form of sulfur is stored as s0 sn 2 inclusions in sludge which is contrary to the observation of free s2 in the bulk fluid by yu et al 2016 and zhang et al 2017 thus a question arises why is sulfate reduction limited to s0 sn 2 inclusions and not to hs h2s this may be attributed to the anaerobic biooxidation of sulfide by srb or sob following the sulfate reduction by srb it has been reported that s0 could be an intermediate of s2 oxidation with oxygen by certain srb such as desulfobulbus propionicus fuseler and cypionka 1995 besides the high diversity of srb and sob was detected in the ds ebpr system see section 3 1 and both of them were involved in sulfur conversion sulfate reduction and sulfide sulfur oxidization in detail srb reduce sulfate directly to sulfide with carbon substrates as the electron donor then sob possibly oxidize sulfide to generate intermediate elemental sulfur with oxygen or ferrous as the electron acceptor a small amount of oxygen could originate from the oxygen dissolved in the seeding and escaping into the 10 l headspace of the reactor besides 20 seawater was added to the influent in which ferric iron dissolved li et al 2017 ferric iron can serve as an oxidizing agent converting sulfide to s0 chemically or biologically steudel 1996 tang et al 2009 as follows s2 fe3 s0 fe2 h2so4 some species e g acidithiobacillus ferroxidans that are physiologically close to the genus thiobacillus detected in the present study may be involved in this bioreaction in ambient conditions sn 2 can be produced by the enzymatic cleavage of ss bonds in s8 with the attack of hs in the presence of s2 see eq 2 n 8 s8 hs sn 1 2 h rabus et al 2013 sn 2 are also strong nucleophiles and could be formed by an autocatalytic cleavage of ss bond in comparison sn 2 as linear sulfur molecules and a carrier of zero valent sulfur atoms are much more bioavailable to cells than s0 as reported s0 is characterized by its water insolubility 5 mg l at 25 c liang et al 2016 which could lead to low bioavailability di capua et al 2015 thus soluble sn 2 can freely pass through the cell membrane on the other hand it is both energy intensive and time consuming to transport s0 through the cell membrane liang et al 2016 the chain length n of sn 2 in the present study typically varies from two to nine with multiple chain lengths occurring in equilibrium with each other gun et al 2004 the chain length is ph dependent at alkaline ph the sn 2 with shorter chain lengths dominate and at neutral ph the polysulfide with longer chains ultimately forming s8 i e s0 account for a greater fraction the ph was kept in a neutral range 7 0 7 9 in the present study which may have resulted in the sn 2 having the common average chain length of 5 5 van den bosch et al 2007 indeed this length is favorable for the oxidation of sn 2 as a longer chain e g after forming s0 will decrease the oxidation rate when nitrate is offered as the electron acceptor sn 2 will first be oxidized to s0 according to sn 2 no3 s0 so4 2 no2 before the s0 is further oxidized to sulfate the oxidation of s0 coupled with denitrification follows the reaction s0 1 2no3 0 4h2o so4 2 0 6n2 0 8h in general sob such as thiobacillus denitrificans which could secrete and release sulfur inclusions prefer to oxidize stored sulfur i e s0 sn 2 after other reduced sulfur compounds such as sulfide and thiosulfate have been depleted xu et al 2016 this is consistent with the findings that sob would first oxidize sulfide and store it as poly s and then continue to utilize poly s to generate part of the energy needed for p uptake guo et al 2016a based on the different characteristics of s0 and sn 2 and their dynamics it s recommended to produce more soluble sn 2 than s0 during anaerobic phase for the subsequent anoxic p uptake in ds ebpr process 3 5 overall understanding and implications the key relevant polymers including pha poly p and poly s play significant roles in the basic ds ebpr mechanism and therefore the ability to investigate their structural dynamics and storage states is crucial for fundamental understanding of the ds ebpr process however current ds ebpr studies still lack a systematic qualitative quantitative analysis of these polymers in particular although poly s was initially defined by wu et al 2014 as the compounds of polysulfide and elemental sulfur in ds ebpr process its composition was under speculation according to the investigations reported in this work the simultaneously qualitative identification and quantitation of relevant polymers have been achieved by raman micro spectroscopy coupled with multiple microscopic techniques raman analysis for the first time unraveled s0 sn 2 species as the poly s in ds ebpr besides the potential dynamics of poly s and its roles involved in sulfur conversion driven p removal were also clarified all of these would allow further study to gain more fundamental understanding of the metabolic pathways involving the various polymers for improving the ds ebpr performance furthermore as discussed in the introduction section it s a big challenge to investigate the composition structure and storage states of biogenic poly s this study demonstrated the potential application of raman microscopy to quantitatively investigate the dynamics of poly s under different metabolic states which provides us with the opportunity to elucidate more detailed behavior of srb and or sob microbial communities in sulfate laden wastewater treatment process 4 conclusions this study has applied the integrated chemical analysis and raman micro spectroscopy coupled with multiple microscopes to simultaneously qualitative quantitative investigate the key relevant polymers involved in ds ebpr process i e poly s and associated poly p and phas the microscopic images and raman intensity profiles support the existence of these polymers and clearly demonstrated their dynamic conversions during different metabolic phases which are consistent with the chemical analytical results in particular raman analysis displays the co existence s0 sn 2 species in bacteria stored either intracellularly or extracellularly and their dynamic conversions to other sulfur species suggest that there might be a universal pool of bioavailable sulfur

18901,while the predicted or observed concentrations of ag nps in wastewater treatment plants wwtps have ranged from μg l to ng l there is still uncertainty with regards to the realistic concentration range of ag nps in wwtps in addition the persistence removal and size of ag nps throughout wwtp process is also not well investigated particularly in real operating conditions in this study the incidence and persistence of ag nps in the wastewater process were studied by using single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry sp icp ms the incidence of ag nps was determined in samples collected at the influent and effluent of the conventional process as well as reclaimed and backwash waters of the ultrafiltration uf system in a wwtp santa barbara ca showing a concentration of 13 5 3 2 0 5 and 9 8 ng l respectively with relative standard deviations rsds 5 total ag concentration ag np and ag ranged from 40 to 70 ng l in line with lower predicted values most of the ag nps detected were below 100 nm with a few above 100 nm in the conventional effluent biological and physical processes in the secondary treatment removed 76 3 of the colloidal ag fraction while with the tertiary treatment uf the wwtp achieved a removal of 96 3 of the colloidal fraction persistence of ag nps in various water matrixes including a synthetic wastewater sww was determined by spiking 300 ng l of ag nps 40 nm and monitoring the concentrations and size change for 15 days the persistence of ag nps in suspension was influent effluent reclaimed sww partial dissolution of nps in all waters was observed from time 0 h although the current concentrations in the outlet flows from wwtp effluent and reclaimed waters were low the presence of small and stable ag nps may raise ecotoxicological concerns via bioaccumulation graphical abstract image 1 keywords ag nps single particle icp ms dissolution stability fate of nanomaterials mass flow of nanoparticles 1 introduction the growing use of nanoparticles nps in consumer products has raised concerns about their potential impacts in the environment the incidence of silver ag nps in wastewater is expected due to their incorporation and release from several product categories gottschalk et al 2013 hendren et al 2013 lazareva and keller 2014 ag nps are found in clothes impellitteri et al 2009 tulve et al 2015 drinking water filters lalley et al 2014 health care products and medical devices zhang et al 2016b personal care products echavarri bravo et al 2017 and printable electronics shen et al 2014 a certain amount of ag nps and ag are released from consumable products into wastewater and can arrive to the wastewater treatment plant wwtp impellitteri et al 2009 li et al 2013 which is an important pathway for ag nps arriving to aquatic ecosystems lazareva and keller 2014 liu et al 2014 musee 2017 a fraction of singly dispersed ag nps with high colloidal stability may persist through the wwtp process and be released into the environment chinnapongse et al 2011 hence detection and quantification of persistent ag nps in wastewater streams is key for evaluating their ecotoxicological implications e g due to their antibacterial activity azimzada et al 2017 maurer jones et al 2013 at environmentally realistic concentrations holden et al 2016 several studies have investigated the fate and effects of ag nps in wwtps by spiking pristine nps with concentrations from μg l to mg l in lab scale experiments cao et al 2018 gottschalk et al 2013 kaegi et al 2011 ma et al 2013a the main receptor of ag nps in wwtps is the waste sludge and later the biosolids from the removal of more than 90 of nps from the water column kaegi et al 2013 ma et al 2013b wang et al 2016 negative effects of ag nps in biological reactors have been observed at 0 05 mg l ag nps choi and hu 2008 and include the inhibition of both the nitrification process at 0 1 mg l ag nps hou et al 2012 and the denitrification processes at 2 and 5 mg l ag nps zheng et al 2018 it should be noted that these experimental concentrations were higher than those predicted for domestic wastewater lazareva and keller 2014 sun et al 2016 the fate and ecological implication of ag nps have a close relationship with the concentrations of nps and dissolved silver ions in wastewater time of exposure and transformation of silver species e g agcl ag2s ago in the wwtp zhang et al 2016b in wastewater some of the soluble constituents have been shown to influence ag np stability doolette et al 2013 the transformation of ag nps into ag2s in a sewer channel was studied by using extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs techniques kaegi et al 2013 results showed the crystallization of ag2s and coarsening of an ag2s shell on the surface of the ag nps kaegi et al 2013 making them less toxic that pristine ag nps clement levard et al 2013a the interaction between cl and ag nps in water results in the precipitation of agcl s with a strong dependence on cl ag molar ratios clément levard et al 2013b other potential transformations in the wastewater are the oxidation of ag nps to release ag and the reduction of ag to form new ag nps by dissolved organic matter dom which could both happen in sunlit dom rich water yu et al 2014 based on earlier modeling the concentration of silver arriving at the wwtp was predicted to be in the 2 18 μg l range blaser et al 2008 in other studies ag nps and their transformation products in the effluent of wwtps have been predicted to be in the 3 260 ng l range lazareva and keller 2014 sun et al 2016 thus there is a substantial difference in estimates of 3 4 orders of magnitude the half maximal effective concentration ec50 of ag nps in toxicological experiments ranges from 0 1 to 26 mg l where the most sensitive organism to ag nps was d magna followed by algae p subcapitata bacteria e coli and p fluorescens yeast s cerevisiae and finally mammalian fibroblasts in vitro ivask et al 2014 choi and hu 2008 observed that the ec50 for nitrifying bacteria was 0 14 mg l ag nps since ec50 concentrations are determined in spiked and controlled experiments realistic concentrations of ag nps in wwtp effluent need to be determined in order to close the uncertainty in predictions and evaluate the ecotoxicological risk to aquatic ecosystems knowledge of the real influent concentrations is also needed to determine whether there is a risk to the microbial processes within the wwtp since previous studies have focused on the detection and quantification of ag nps in the effluent of wwtps mitrano et al 2012 telgmann et al 2014 tuoriniemi et al 2012 observed data on ag np concentrations in wwtp influent is still scarce given the substantial differences in concentrations of the water constituents e g organic matter suspended solids dissolved salts etc between influent and effluent there could be some interference on the detection and quantification of ag nps hence determining the incidence of ag nps in the influent and later persistence in the wastewater flow throughout the wwtp may pose a challenge the current direct methods for measuring np concentrations in complex media include imaging and spectroscopy techniques which have some limitations such as detection limits matrix interferences and speciation laborda et al 2016 these issues have led researchers to measure the concentrations using different techniques and approaches mcgillicuddy et al 2017 scanning and transmission electron microscopy sem and tem respectively have been used to confirm the presence of nps in wastewater as well as characterize their morphology cervantes avilés et al 2017 doolette et al 2013 however image acquisition of nps in wwtp and environmental samples is labor intense and may be biased particularly at environmentally realistic concentrations since it may be difficult to locate a truly representative region sem or tem in tandem with element selective detection techniques such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms icp optical emission spectrometry icp oes or icp atomic emission spectrometry icp aes are the most commonly employed techniques for elemental quantification of inorganic nps in wastewater choi et al 2017 kaegi et al 2013 laborda et al 2016 park et al 2013 however the information is generally limited to only total concentration combining the concentrations of both nps and dissolved ions kaegi et al 2013 ma et al 2013a in order to use icp to measure the concentration of nps only pretreatments for example ultrafiltration choi et al 2017 laborda et al 2016 cloud point extraction cpe and ionic exchange resin ier chao et al 2011 hadioui et al 2014 li et al 2013 have been applied to remove the metal ions nonetheless np recovery efficiency depends on water characteristics and np coating li et al 2012 another approach to detect ag nps has been surface enhanced raman scattering sers in this technique raman signals are enhanced by indicator molecules bound to the ag nps the signals exhibit a linear relation at mg l concentrations guo et al 2016 however at the predicted concentrations of ag nps μg l and below there are interferences in the raman signal due to matrix components guo et al 2016 therefore emerging analytical techniques that can quantify nps in wastewater at realistic concentrations with low detection limits are needed single particle icp ms sp icp ms is a novel technique able to quantify the number concentration of nps in suspension as well as the elemental mass per nanoparticle by measuring particle by particle laborda et al 2016 2014 montaño et al 2014 sp icp ms has been applied to quantify and characterize tio2 nps in cosmetics de la calle et al 2017 ag nps in antimicrobial products cascio et al 2015 tio2 au and ag nps in drinking water donovan et al 2016 and cu nps in biological tissues keller et al 2018 sp icp ms has also been used to determine ag np concentration in spiked mesocosms tuoriniemi et al 2017 and in lake samples aznar et al 2017 wimmer et al 2018 in another study ag nps were spiked into two wastewater samples with no background ag at concentrations of 100 ng l influent and 200 ng l effluent to evaluate the performance of an sp icp ms mitrano et al 2012 however the study did not provide information on the presence of ag nps in an operating wwtp their size distribution their persistence or the removal efficiency at various stages of the treatment this information is important for modeling studies other studies have evaluated the size of spiked ag nps in wastewater influent and effluent using sp icp ms telgmann et al 2014 tuoriniemi et al 2012 but the incidental mass concentrations and removal of ag nps in wwtps were not determined hence research is needed to determine realistic influent and effluent concentrations of ag nps in wwtps as well as their size distribution and persistence in these complex media as stated above the key advantages of sp icp ms include elemental selectivity low detection limits direct and simultaneous measurement of ionic and np concentrations and nps size distribution aznar et al 2017 laborda et al 2016 making it a suitable method for the analysis of environmental samples including different locations within the wwtp in this work we first calibrated the sp icp ms to quantify and size the ag nps in di water citrate buffer and synthetic wastewater sww this serves to determine the importance of the matrix in the calibration process then we investigated the incidence and persistence of ag nps at different locations within an operating wwtp including influent secondary effluent tertiary reclaimed water and backwash water the persistence of ag nps was studied over time in the different stages of wastewater treatment and in sww understanding the influent and effluent concentrations of ag nps as well as their persistence can help to better assess their risk to the wwtp processes and the environment 2 methods and materials 2 1 sampling and characterization of wastewater wastewater samples were collected in el estero wwtp at santa barbara california sampling points were primary clarifier influent pipe port top of the secondary clarifier tertiary ultrafiltration uf system with 0 1 μm of pore size pipe port and the retentate of the uf pipe port samples were labeled as influent effluent reclaimed and backwash water respectively sampling points are indicated in the diagram presented in the supplementary material fig s1 polyethylene containers 1 l with polypropylene caps were submerged in nitric acid 10 overnight before the sampling day on site containers were rinsed three times with the respective wastewater samples before they were filled and samples were stored 20 h at 4 c until the next day for analysis by sp icp ms and physicochemical characterization characterization of wastewater samples consisted of determining per triplicate the concentration of organic matter

determined by scanning the uv vis peak uv 1800 shimadzu and it corresponded to 414 nm fig s3 the zeta potential zp of ag nps was 14 7 1 6 and it was determined in di water at a ph of 6 75 by laser doppler velocimetry zetasizer nano zs90 malvern panalytical ltd 2 3 sp icp ms measurement the concentration and size of the ag nps were determined using an agilent 7900 icp ms santa clara ca usa with an sp icp ms module the instrument was equipped with an autosampler and a standard peristaltic pump standard glass concentric nebulizer quartz spray chamber and quartz torch standard nickel sampling and skimmer cones analyses were performed in time resolved analysis tra mode using an integration time dwell time of 100 μs per point with no settling time between measurements similar to a previous study tuoriniemi et al 2017 the instrument settings used for the sp icp ms analysis are summarized in table 1 table 1 agilent 7900 sp icp ms operating conditions the sp icp ms method setup data collection and analysis were controlled via the single nanoparticle application module method wizard in the agilent icp ms masshunter software version c 01 03 build 505 16 patch 3 ag nps 60 nm in diameter in 2 mm sodium citrate nanocomposix inc were used as reference particles an aliquot of these particles was diluted from 500 to 1 ng l with di water in metal free polypropylene tubes to evaluate the nebulization efficiency and to be used for data conversion from raw signal to np size to ensure that the samples were fully homogenized they were placed in an ultrasonic bath bransonic emerson for 15 min at 280 w and a frequency of 40 khz an ag ionic standard of 1 μg l was prepared with 1 nitric acid and was used to determine the elemental response factor the monitored analyte mass was 107ag silver particle density was set to 10 5 g cm3 collected water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm pore size to avoid the sampler cone blockage caused by suspended solids tuoriniemi et al 2017 nitrocellulose filters were used due to high affinity with microorganisms and large debris present in wastewater filtrates were analyzed in triplicate without dilution 2 4 persistence of ag nps in wastewater experiments to study the persistence of ag nps and ag in wastewater ag nps were spiked into influent effluent reclaimed water and sww sww was included in the experiment since it is frequently used for np ecotoxicological studies in wastewater gartiser et al 2014 tan et al 2015 sww was prepared based on a previous study cuevas rodríguez et al 2015 in brief sww contained 380 4 mg l of d glucose 45 1 mg l nh4oh 14 4 mg l k2hpo4 14 2 mg l nacl 8 8 mg l mgso4 7h2o and 3 8 mg l cacl2 2h2o all wastewater matrixes were filtered with 0 45 μm nitrocellulose filter papers before being spiked with ag nps to prevent blockage of the sampler cone due to the suspended solids tuoriniemi et al 2017 after filtration aliquots 0 5 l of each wastewater were transferred to borosilicate bottles the wastewater samples were spiked with ag nps 40 nm to achieve a nominal 300 ng l and then vortexed 5 s at 3200 rpm the bottles were covered with aluminum foil and left to stand for 15 days samples were collected 3 cm below the surface after the first 14 h samples were then collected from the same position every 24 h up to 374 h samples were stored at 4 c in metal free polypropylene tubes until analysis by sp icp ms size and concentration of ag nps as well as ag concentration in wastewater were determined by sp icp ms analysis in all collected samples zp of the ag nps in wastewater matrixes was measured zetasizer nano zs90 at initial and final time 0 and 374 h in order to study their stability bottles were vortexed 5 s at 3200 rpm at the end of the experiment to resuspend the particles for zp determination additionally the surface charge at different ph and isoelectric point iep of ag nps 100 μg l was determined zetasizer nano zs90 in all wastewaters by auto titration with 0 1 m hno3 and 0 1 m naoh mpt 2 malvern panalytical ltd 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater characteristics the results indicated a significant removal of soluble carbon and soluble forms of nitrogen such as nh4 no2 and no3 during the wastewater treatment process table 2 going from influent to secondary effluent and then tertiary reclaimed water fig s1 note that the sum of nh4 n no3 n and no2 n are often significantly larger than the tn concentrations in the backwash water from the filtration process the concentrations of both c and n were similar to the secondary effluent po4 p in the effluent decreased significantly after the anoxic aerobic conditions in the secondary treatment due to the accumulation of po4 p in organisms present in the biological processes chan et al 2017 the concentration of po4 p remained almost constant from the effluent to reclaimed water as well as in the backwash water sww had the highest dissolved carbon while tn and po4 p were close to el estero effluent values previous studies have indicated that ph and is can affect the stability of ag nps in suspension zhang et al 2016a both parameters remained relatively constant in the water streams of the wwtp with a ph slightly above 7 and is near 0 04 equiv l table 2 the main characteristic that varied between the various water matrixes was the c n p ratios which were calculated according to the elemental fraction of the measured parameters dissolved c nh4 no3 no2 and po4 3 c n p ratios were 100 81 5 for influent 100 69 3 for secondary effluent 100 97 4 for tertiary reclaimed 100 62 4 for backwash and 100 5 1 for sww this reflects the high removal of organic matter from influent to effluent the c n ratio in reclaimed water decreased due to the removal of organic colloids these colloids led to the increase of the c n ratio in the backwash water 3 2 calibration of sp icp ms with ag nps in different water matrixes the calibration curves of ag nps 60 nm in different water matrixes including 1 mm citrate buffer sww and di water were obtained by analyzing from 1 to 500 ng l using sp icp ms fig 1 the calibration curves in all three water matrixes exhibited excellent linearity with r2 0 99 across the entire concentration range however the measured concentrations of ag nps in di water were around 25 lower than nominal values fig 1c particularly at the higher concentration range e g 200 and 500 ng l the lack of organic matter and dissolved ions in di water may reduce the physical e g electrostatic and chemical e g chelating binding interactions between ag nps and water constituents wang et al 2015 decreasing the stability of the ag nps even though all ag nps suspensions were prepared freshly daily before the measurement the potential dissolution and higher sedimentation of ag nps in di water may decrease the availability of ag nps liu and hurt 2010 misra et al 2012 simply adding a 1 mm citrate buffer to the suspension resulted in ag nps concentrations much closer to the nominal values fig 1a citrate buffers or coatings are commonly used to stabilize ag nps in suspension peters et al 2014 this should be considered when designing an sp icp ms analysis protocol for higher accuracy similar precision was observed in the sww matrix fig 1b the presence of organic compounds e g glucose and other cations e g na mg2 ca2 and anions e g cl so4 2 hpo4 2 within the sww do not result in significant interference on the detection and quantification of ag nps via sp icp ms sp icp ms also provided a size distribution of ag nps in these three water matrixes as shown in fig s4 generally the measured sizes by sp icp ms exhibited a peak at around 60 nm fig s4 which agreed with the information provided by the manufacturer however the peak of the ag np size distribution in di water was slightly shifted to a smaller range fig s4 indicating some possible dissolution of ag nps in di even in a short time as inferred from the calibration curve measurements 3 3 incidence of ag nps in wastewater the concentrations of ag nps and ag in wastewater samples were quantified using sp icp ms fig 2 ag np concentrations were 13 5 3 2 0 5 and 9 8 ng l in the influent secondary effluent tertiary reclaimed and backwash water respectively these concentrations do not reflect ag nps potentially associated with suspended solids since they would be removed by the nitrocellulose filters 0 45 μm silver based nanomaterials in the wwtp and the environment can include ag0 ag2o ag2s and agcl which are stable forms of silver kaegi et al 2013 lowry et al 2012 to calculate the size distribution of the ag nps in the samples we assumed a 100 silver content and a spherical shape the size distribution as determined by sp icp ms varied significantly at the various stages of treatment the most frequent particle diameter of ag nps in all types of wastewater was between 20 and 24 nm fig 3 however the 20 nm cut off influences the distribution ag nps detected in the influent were mostly below 100 nm in diameter with a substantial fraction above 50 nm and few particles up to nearly 200 nm in the effluent most of the ag nps were below 50 nm with very few above 100 nm after ultrafiltration 100 nm pore size only nps between 20 and 45 nm were observed and at a much lower frequency the backwash water from the ultrafiltration process did have particles larger than 100 nm reflecting the difference between the effluent and reclaimed water the determination of ag np particle size by sp icp ms showed a clear limit of detection around 20 nm in diameter the trend in fig 3 strongly suggests that ag nps smaller than 20 nm could be present at high numbers in the samples but this could not be determined with the current analytical protocol lee et al 2014 this limitation has also been observed for other types of np and aqueous media such as the cases of rare earth oxides in water fréchette viens et al 2017 ag au and tio2 nps in drinking water donovan et al 2016 and ag ceo2 and tio2 nps surface water peters et al 2018 the biological process at el estero wwtp removed 76 3 of the incidental ag nps and combined with ultrafiltration the wwtp removed 96 3 of the influent load in the ultrafiltration system the particulate matter including the nps retained by the membrane is returned to the influent of the wastewater process therefore 9 8 ng l of ag nps in the backwash water re enter the biological process where there can be a significant accumulation depending on the sludge retention time the presence of ag nps in the biological wastewater treatment process can damage the microbial community and this in turn can impact the treated water quality sun et al 2013 ag nps concentrations found in the influent effluent and reclaimed water of el estero wwtp 13 5 3 2 and 0 5 ng l respectively are within the range measured for effluent 1 12 ng l of nine wwtps in germany determined via extraction by cpe and ier li et al 2013 compared to techniques based on separation and elemental quantification li et al 2012 2013 sp icp ms is a simpler and more direct method to determine ag nps concentration in wastewater streams using sp icp ms peters et al found between 0 3 and 2 5 ng l of ag nps in dutch surface waters peters et al 2018 where they considered the discharge of municipal wastewater effluent as a possible source of ag nps to surface water ionic concentrations of silver ag were 62 2 37 9 50 1 and 55 2 ng l in the influent effluent reclaimed and backwash water respectively the ratio of ag to ag nps observed in the influent was 4 99 and it increased as the treatment progressed fig 2 the potential accumulation of ag nps in the flocs of activated sludge can explain the increase in the ratio then ag np can dissolve during the 8 h hydraulic retention time which is the typical period in the aerobic reactor of a wwtp metcalf and eddy 2014 the coexistence of ag and ag nps had a negligible effect on the determination of the ag np concentrations using sp icp ms in simpler aqueous media laborda et al 2011 although in our study the various wastewater matrices are complex we did not observe a noticeable effect due to the coexistence of ag and ag nps in contrast high ag content significantly interferes with ag np quantification using ier followed by analytical graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry gfaas li et al 2013 the interference was attributed to simultaneous extraction of ag and ag np which can be falsely quantified as ag np by the gfaas analysis several studies have predicted the range of ag np and released ag concentrations present in the effluent of wwtps or receiving waters at different geographic scales from cities to continental regions for wwtp effluent in cities the range is 9 120 ng l in the san francisco bay keller and lazareva 2013 and 4 26 ng l 8 130 ng l and 3 110 ng l in new york shanghai and london respectively lazareva and keller 2014 for the us the range is 1 1 240 ng l hendren et al 2013 and for europe the predicted range is 50 100 ng l gottschalk et al 2013 the concentration of ag nps found in effluent at el estero wwtp is closer to the lower bound of predicted concentrations and when ag is taken into consideration there is a very good correspondence with the predicted range these concentrations were measured in the water column only and represent the colloidal and ionic silver fractions in the various steps of the wastewater treatment processes but may not account for silver in larger particles which were removed by the 0 45 μm nitrocellulose filter given the high removal from influent to secondary and tertiary effluents observed here the majority of ag nps are in the sludge polesel et al 2018 tuoriniemi et al 2017 3 4 persistence of ag nps in the water column ag nps are well known to dissolve and aggregate in suspension knowing how long they can persist in various waters is important for understanding their risk to study the persistence of ag nps in various wastewaters 300 ng l of ag nps 40 nm were spiked in influent effluent reclaimed water and sww samples all wastewater matrixes were filtered with 0 45 μm nitrocellulose filter papers before being spiked with ag nps the ag nps and ag concentration before and after spiking were measured over time the total ag concentration at time 0 h for all wastewater matrixes includes the 300 ng l spiked and the background concentration pre spiking for each water matrix fig 4 ag remarkably increased in real wastewater matrixes at time 0 h indicating rapid dissolution of a fraction of the spiked ag nps in these waters over the monitoring time the concentration of ag np exhibited a remarkable decrease especially in sww and influent the pattern for the influent water was quite predictable with a regular decrease over time for both ag nps and ag since sww and the influent have a greater amount of organic matter nitrogen phosphorus chlorine and sulfur the decrease of free ag in wastewater could be due to the formation of organic complexes zhang et al 2016a or inorganic salts with low solubility such as agcl and ag2s kaegi et al 2013 lombi et al 2013 in contrast the concentrations of ag nps and ag in secondary effluent and tertiary reclaimed water remained relatively constant between 14 h and 300 h fig 4 after 374 h there was a significant amount of precipitate in all wastewater samples the results indicate that the persistence in suspension of ag nps followed influent secondary effluent tertiary reclaimed sww the size distribution of the ag nps over time 0 374 h was also determined by sp icp ms and represented in violin plots fig 5 the shape of each violin plot represents the frequency of ag nps size that occurs 95 of the time blue region and the inner box represents the sizes that occur 50 of the time the central dash line inside the white box represents the median value of the ag nps size based on the median size dash line the results indicate that only ag nps in the influent maintained their original nominal size distribution during the entire study time which was 42 5 nm fig 5a ag nps in sww had a median size of 39 4 nm fig 5c which remained relatively constant for the entire monitored time however after 206 h the detection of ag nps in sww was limited to a few counts fig 4 indicating significant settling and resulting in distorted plots at 231 and 278 h in secondary effluent the size distribution of ag nps varied with time with the median value oscillating from 40 to 43 nm fig 5b despite the variations of the median the frequency of ag nps size that occurs 95 of the time in the effluent showed a peak blue region around 36 nm in all measurements although the ag nps concentrations measured in reclaimed water along the experiment were the lowest fig 4 the size distribution had the same pattern at 374 h fig 5d with higher frequency in the size range of 34 36 nm the analysis of ag np size occurring 95 of the time confirms that most of the dissolution of ag nps happened before 14 h in the effluent and reclaimed water based on the decrease in nominal ag np size the size distribution of ag nps in various waters at 14 h and 374 h are presented in the supplementary material fig s5 analysis of ag np size in all wastewater matrices indicates that the frequency of particles larger than 50 nm decreased between 14 h and 374 h of retention time fig s5 in the case of the influent only 3 3 of the particles were 100 nm at 14 h and at 374 h there were no particles 100 nm the relatively constant size of ag nps in the influent can be attributed to the organic matter content present which stabilizes np suspensions by the physical and chemical interactions mentioned before kaegi et al 2013 wang et al 2015 for the effluent 85 8 of the particles were below 50 nm at 374 h of exposure the fraction of larger particles in reclaimed water also decreased at 374 h with 88 2 of the particles smaller than 50 nm and 11 8 between 50 and 100 nm results indicate that the spiked ag nps 40 nm in contact with the outlet streams of the wwtp effluent and reclaimed water are mainly dissolved and between 85 and 89 of the remaining ag nps are below 50 nm the bottles containing the ag nps were vortexed at the end of the experiment to determine the recovery of ag nps relative to the mass spiked in as well as the ag concentration fig 6 consideration of the ag particulate and ionic concentrations can serve to determine the extent of dissolution and precipitation the recovered concentration of ag nps spiked in sww was higher 92 72 ng l than in the other types of wastewater such as influent 51 34 ng l effluent 23 98 ng l and reclaimed 8 17 ng l while ag nps were almost totally dissolved in reclaimed water 97 28 in sww only 69 09 were dissolved with the balanced in the colloidal fraction 30 91 given that there were no colloidal particles in sww at 204 h fig 4 the balance was indeed precipitated ag ionic concentration in wastewater samples were 85 8 70 4 95 5 and 87 9 ng l for sww influent effluent and reclaimed water these values reflect that a fraction of initial ag nps precipitated as transformation products non detectable in suspension the stability of ag nps in various wastewaters was studied further by determining the iep and zp of the particles immediately after spiking and at 374 h the zp of the ag nps decreased during the study period for sww influent and effluent fig s6 although the change was more significant for sww the opposite behavior was found for ag nps in reclaimed water where the zp increased slightly minor changes in zp were observed for effluent and reclaimed water which is consistent with the persistence of ag nps in suspension at 374 h the iep of the spiked ag nps was between ph 2 and 3 in all wastewaters fig s7 which means the ag nps are negatively charged in the typical range of wwtp operating conditions the iep provides valuable information about the layer composition on the particle surface such as the acid or basic surface functional groups the iep curves for influent effluent reclaimed water and sww suggest that the ag nps have anionic compounds on the surface fig s7 the constant negative charge on the surface of the particles in the range of ph 4 10 suggests that those compounds present in the wastewater streams are tightly bound the zp in the influent and in the reclaimed water remained between 13 and 15 mv for the typical ph range of 5 9 in wastewater van loosdrecht et al 2016 while the zp in the effluent was near 10 mv for sww the zp was more negative as ph increased enhancing the stability of ag nps hence the settling of ag nps in sww was due to the rapid initial formation of larger aggregates fig s5 and not due to the decreasing zp of the nps remaining in suspension fig s6 aggregates formation can be attributed to the presence of cations such as ca2 and mg2 hotze et al 2010 which are components of the sww 4 conclusions sp icp ms was applied to determine the concentration number and mass and size of ag nps in different water matrixes as well as to investigate the incidence and persistence of ag nps in wastewater through the treatment process ag nps were detected and quantified in influent secondary effluent tertiary reclaimed and backwash waters with a concentration of 13 5 3 2 0 5 and 9 8 ng l respectively which correspond well with previously predicted wastewater effluent concentrations a conventional wwtp process followed by ultrafiltration removed more than 96 of the colloidal silver fraction however since the uf backwash water is returned to the secondary treatment the accumulation of nps in the activated sludge increases both the concentration in a bioreactor and their residence time in the process which may eventually affect the biological process most of the incidental ag nps detected in the influent were below 100 nm in diameter although some nps were nearly 200 nm in the effluent almost all particles were below 50 nm with few above 100 nm reclaimed water contained particles between 20 and 45 nm and backwash water had the larger particles retained by the uf membrane the persistence in suspension of ag nps in wastewater streams revealed that although ag nps dissolved in wastewater the remaining nps tended to precipitate due to their lower stability in sww influent and effluent respectively the persistence in suspension of ag nps followed influent effluent reclaimed sww dissolution of ag nps was observed in all wwtp waters mainly at time 0 h spiked ag nps remain near their original size in the influent and in the sww for effluent and reclaimed water 95 of the nps were between 34 and 36 nm although the measured concentrations in the wastewater flows in the wwtp influent effluent and reclaimed waters were very low 13 5 3 2 and 0 5 ng l respectively and only reflect the colloidal fractions in the effluents the sampling regime performed may mask the

18901,while the predicted or observed concentrations of ag nps in wastewater treatment plants wwtps have ranged from μg l to ng l there is still uncertainty with regards to the realistic concentration range of ag nps in wwtps in addition the persistence removal and size of ag nps throughout wwtp process is also not well investigated particularly in real operating conditions in this study the incidence and persistence of ag nps in the wastewater process were studied by using single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry sp icp ms the incidence of ag nps was determined in samples collected at the influent and effluent of the conventional process as well as reclaimed and backwash waters of the ultrafiltration uf system in a wwtp santa barbara ca showing a concentration of 13 5 3 2 0 5 and 9 8 ng l respectively with relative standard deviations rsds 5 total ag concentration ag np and ag ranged from 40 to 70 ng l in line with lower predicted values most of the ag nps detected were below 100 nm with a few above 100 nm in the conventional effluent biological and physical processes in the secondary treatment removed 76 3 of the colloidal ag fraction while with the tertiary treatment uf the wwtp achieved a removal of 96 3 of the colloidal fraction persistence of ag nps in various water matrixes including a synthetic wastewater sww was determined by spiking 300 ng l of ag nps 40 nm and monitoring the concentrations and size change for 15 days the persistence of ag nps in suspension was influent effluent reclaimed sww partial dissolution of nps in all waters was observed from time 0 h although the current concentrations in the outlet flows from wwtp effluent and reclaimed waters were low the presence of small and stable ag nps may raise ecotoxicological concerns via bioaccumulation graphical abstract image 1 keywords ag nps single particle icp ms dissolution stability fate of nanomaterials mass flow of nanoparticles 1 introduction the growing use of nanoparticles nps in consumer products has raised concerns about their potential impacts in the environment the incidence of silver ag nps in wastewater is expected due to their incorporation and release from several product categories gottschalk et al 2013 hendren et al 2013 lazareva and keller 2014 ag nps are found in clothes impellitteri et al 2009 tulve et al 2015 drinking water filters lalley et al 2014 health care products and medical devices zhang et al 2016b personal care products echavarri bravo et al 2017 and printable electronics shen et al 2014 a certain amount of ag nps and

the environment chinnapongse et al 2011 hence detection and quantification of persistent ag nps in wastewater streams is key for evaluating their ecotoxicological implications e g due to their antibacterial activity azimzada et al 2017 maurer jones et al 2013 at environmentally realistic concentrations holden et al 2016 several studies have investigated the fate and effects of ag nps in wwtps by spiking pristine nps with concentrations from μg l to mg l in lab scale experiments cao et al 2018 gottschalk et al 2013 kaegi et al 2011 ma et al 2013a the main receptor of ag nps in wwtps is the waste sludge and later the biosolids from the removal of more than 90 of nps from the water column kaegi et al 2013 ma et al 2013b wang et al 2016 negative effects of ag nps in biological reactors have been observed at 0 05 mg l ag nps choi and hu 2008 and include the inhibition of both the nitrification process at 0 1 mg l ag nps hou et al 2012 and the denitrification processes at 2 and 5 mg l ag nps zheng et al 2018 it should be noted that these experimental concentrations were higher than those predicted for domestic wastewater lazareva and keller 2014 sun et al 2016 the fate and ecological implication of ag nps have a close relationship with the concentrations of nps and dissolved silver ions in wastewater time of exposure and transformation of silver species e g agcl ag2s ago in the wwtp zhang et al 2016b in wastewater some of the soluble constituents have been shown to influence ag np stability doolette et al 2013 the transformation of ag nps into ag2s in a sewer channel was studied by using extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs techniques kaegi et al 2013 results showed the crystallization of ag2s and coarsening of an ag2s shell on the surface of the ag nps kaegi et al 2013 making them less toxic that pristine ag nps clement levard et al 2013a the interaction between cl and ag nps in water results in the precipitation of agcl s with a strong dependence on cl ag molar ratios clément levard et al 2013b other potential transformations in the wastewater are the oxidation of ag nps to release ag and the reduction of ag to form new ag nps by dissolved organic matter dom which could both happen in sunlit dom rich water yu et al 2014 based on earlier modeling the concentration of silver arriving at the wwtp was predicted to be in the 2 18 μg l range blaser et al 2008 in other studies ag nps and their transformation products in the effluent of wwtps have been predicted to be in the 3 260 ng l range lazareva and keller 2014 sun et al 2016 thus there is a substantial difference in estimates of 3 4 orders of magnitude the half maximal effective concentration ec50 of ag nps in toxicological experiments ranges from 0 1 to 26 mg l where the most sensitive organism to ag nps was d magna followed by algae p subcapitata bacteria e coli and p fluorescens yeast s cerevisiae and finally mammalian fibroblasts in vitro ivask et al 2014 choi and hu 2008 observed that the ec50 for nitrifying bacteria was 0 14 mg l ag nps since ec50 concentrations are determined in spiked and controlled experiments realistic concentrations of ag nps in wwtp effluent need to be determined in order to close the uncertainty in predictions and evaluate the ecotoxicological risk to aquatic ecosystems knowledge of the real influent concentrations is also needed to determine whether there is a risk to the microbial processes within the wwtp since previous studies have focused on the detection and quantification of ag nps in the effluent of wwtps mitrano et al 2012 telgmann et al 2014 tuoriniemi et al 2012 observed data on ag np concentrations in wwtp influent is still scarce given the substantial differences in concentrations of the water constituents e g organic matter suspended solids dissolved salts etc between influent and effluent there could be some interference on the detection and quantification of ag nps hence determining the incidence of ag nps in the influent and later persistence in the wastewater flow throughout the wwtp may pose a challenge the current direct methods for measuring np concentrations in complex media include imaging and spectroscopy techniques which have some limitations such as detection limits matrix interferences and speciation laborda et al 2016 these issues have led researchers to measure the concentrations using different techniques and approaches mcgillicuddy et al 2017 scanning and transmission electron microscopy sem and tem respectively have been used to confirm the presence of nps in wastewater as well as characterize their morphology cervantes avilés et al 2017 doolette et al 2013 however image acquisition of nps in wwtp and environmental samples is labor intense and may be biased particularly at environmentally realistic concentrations since it may be difficult to locate a truly representative region sem or tem in tandem with element selective detection techniques such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms icp optical emission spectrometry icp oes or icp atomic emission spectrometry icp aes are the most commonly employed techniques for elemental quantification of inorganic nps in wastewater choi et al 2017 kaegi et al 2013 laborda et al 2016 park et al 2013 however the information is generally limited to only total concentration combining the concentrations of both nps and dissolved ions kaegi et al 2013 ma et al 2013a in order to use icp to measure the concentration of nps only pretreatments for example ultrafiltration choi et al 2017 laborda et al 2016 cloud point extraction cpe and ionic exchange resin ier chao et al 2011 hadioui et al 2014 li et al 2013 have been applied to remove the metal ions nonetheless np recovery efficiency depends on water characteristics and np coating li et al 2012 another approach to detect ag nps has been surface enhanced raman scattering sers in this technique raman signals are enhanced by indicator molecules bound to the ag nps the signals exhibit a linear relation at mg l concentrations guo et al 2016 however at the predicted concentrations of ag nps μg l and below there are interferences in the raman signal due to matrix components guo et al 2016 therefore emerging analytical techniques that can quantify nps in wastewater at realistic concentrations with low detection limits are needed single particle icp ms sp icp ms is a novel technique able to quantify the number concentration of nps in suspension as well as the elemental mass per nanoparticle by measuring particle by particle laborda et al 2016 2014 montaño et al 2014 sp icp ms has been applied to quantify and characterize tio2 nps in cosmetics de la calle et al 2017 ag nps in antimicrobial products cascio et al 2015 tio2 au and ag nps in drinking water donovan et al 2016 and cu nps in biological tissues keller et al 2018 sp icp ms has also been used to determine ag np concentration in spiked mesocosms tuoriniemi et al 2017 and in lake samples aznar et al 2017 wimmer et al 2018 in another study ag nps were spiked into two wastewater samples with no background ag at concentrations of 100 ng l influent and 200 ng l effluent to evaluate the performance of an sp icp ms mitrano et al 2012 however the study did not provide information on the presence of ag nps in an operating wwtp their size distribution their persistence or the removal efficiency at various stages of the treatment this information is important for modeling studies other studies have evaluated the size of spiked ag nps in wastewater influent and effluent using sp icp ms telgmann et al 2014 tuoriniemi et al 2012 but the incidental mass concentrations and removal of ag nps in wwtps were not determined hence research is needed to determine realistic influent and effluent concentrations of ag nps in wwtps as well as their size distribution and persistence in these complex media as stated above the key advantages of sp icp ms include elemental selectivity low detection limits direct and simultaneous measurement of ionic and np concentrations and nps size distribution aznar et al 2017 laborda et al 2016 making it a suitable method for the analysis of environmental samples including different locations within the wwtp in this work we first calibrated the sp icp ms to quantify and size the ag nps in di water citrate buffer and synthetic wastewater sww this serves to determine the importance of the matrix in the calibration process then we investigated the incidence and persistence of ag nps at different locations within an operating wwtp including influent secondary effluent tertiary reclaimed water and backwash water the persistence of ag nps was studied over time in the different stages of wastewater treatment and in sww understanding the influent and effluent concentrations of ag nps as well as their persistence can help to better assess their risk to the wwtp processes and the environment 2 methods and materials 2 1 sampling and characterization of wastewater wastewater samples were collected in el estero wwtp at santa barbara california sampling points were primary clarifier influent pipe port top of the secondary clarifier tertiary ultrafiltration uf system with 0 1 μm of pore size pipe port and the retentate of the uf pipe port samples were labeled as influent effluent reclaimed and backwash water respectively sampling points are indicated in the diagram presented in the supplementary material fig s1 polyethylene containers 1 l with polypropylene caps were submerged in nitric acid 10 overnight before the sampling day on site containers were rinsed three times with the respective wastewater samples before they were filled and samples were stored 20 h at 4 c until the next day for analysis by sp icp ms and physicochemical characterization characterization of wastewater samples consisted of determining per triplicate the concentration of organic matter

determined by scanning the uv vis peak uv 1800 shimadzu and it corresponded to 414 nm fig s3 the zeta potential zp of ag nps was 14 7 1 6 and it was determined in di water at a ph of 6 75 by laser doppler velocimetry zetasizer nano zs90 malvern panalytical ltd 2 3 sp icp ms measurement the concentration and size of the ag nps were determined using an agilent 7900 icp ms santa clara ca usa with an sp icp ms module the instrument was equipped with an autosampler and a standard peristaltic pump standard glass concentric nebulizer quartz spray chamber and quartz torch standard nickel sampling and skimmer cones analyses were performed in time resolved analysis tra mode using an integration time dwell time of 100 μs per point with no settling time between measurements similar to a previous study tuoriniemi et al 2017 the instrument settings used for the sp icp ms analysis are summarized in table 1 table 1 agilent 7900 sp icp ms operating conditions the sp icp ms method setup data collection and analysis were controlled via the single nanoparticle application module method wizard in the agilent icp ms masshunter software version c 01 03 build 505 16 patch 3 ag nps 60 nm in diameter in 2 mm sodium citrate nanocomposix inc were used as reference particles an aliquot of these particles was diluted from 500 to 1 ng l with di water in metal free polypropylene tubes to evaluate the nebulization efficiency and to be used for data conversion from raw signal to np size to ensure that the samples were fully homogenized they were placed in an ultrasonic bath bransonic emerson for 15 min at 280 w and a frequency of 40 khz an ag ionic standard of 1 μg l was prepared with 1 nitric acid and was used to determine the elemental response factor the monitored analyte mass was 107ag silver particle density was set to 10 5 g cm3 collected water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm pore size to avoid the sampler cone blockage caused by suspended solids tuoriniemi et al 2017 nitrocellulose filters were used due to high affinity with microorganisms and large debris present in wastewater filtrates were analyzed in triplicate without dilution 2 4 persistence of ag nps in wastewater experiments to study the persistence of ag nps and ag in wastewater ag nps were spiked into influent effluent reclaimed water and sww sww was included in the experiment since it is frequently used for np ecotoxicological studies in wastewater gartiser et al 2014 tan et al 2015 sww was prepared based on a previous study cuevas rodríguez et al 2015 in brief sww contained 380 4 mg l of d glucose 45 1 mg l nh4oh 14 4 mg l k2hpo4 14 2 mg l nacl 8 8 mg l mgso4 7h2o and 3 8 mg l cacl2 2h2o all wastewater matrixes were filtered with 0 45 μm nitrocellulose filter papers before being spiked with ag nps to prevent blockage of the sampler cone due to the suspended solids tuoriniemi et al 2017 after filtration aliquots 0 5 l of each wastewater were transferred to borosilicate bottles the wastewater samples were spiked with ag nps 40 nm to achieve a nominal 300 ng l and then vortexed 5 s at 3200 rpm the bottles were covered with aluminum foil and left to stand for 15 days samples were collected 3 cm below the surface after the first 14 h samples were then collected from the same position every 24 h up to 374 h samples were stored at 4 c in metal free polypropylene tubes until analysis by sp icp ms size and concentration of ag nps as well as ag concentration in wastewater were determined by sp icp ms analysis in all collected samples zp of the ag nps in wastewater matrixes was measured zetasizer nano zs90 at initial and final time 0 and 374 h in order to study their stability bottles were vortexed 5 s at 3200 rpm at the end of the experiment to resuspend the particles for zp determination additionally the surface charge at different ph and isoelectric point iep of ag nps 100 μg l was determined zetasizer nano zs90 in all wastewaters by auto titration with 0 1 m hno3 and 0 1 m naoh mpt 2 malvern panalytical ltd 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater characteristics the results indicated a significant removal of soluble carbon and soluble forms of nitrogen such as nh4 no2 and no3 during the wastewater treatment process table 2 going from influent to secondary effluent and then tertiary reclaimed water fig s1 note that the sum of nh4 n no3 n and no2 n are often significantly larger than the tn concentrations in the backwash water from the filtration process the concentrations of both c and n were similar to the secondary effluent po4 p in the effluent decreased significantly after the anoxic aerobic conditions in the secondary treatment due to the accumulation of po4 p in organisms present in the biological processes chan et al 2017 the concentration of po4 p remained almost constant from the effluent to reclaimed water as well as in the backwash water sww had the highest dissolved carbon while tn and po4 p were close to el estero effluent values previous studies have indicated that ph and is can affect the stability of ag nps in suspension zhang et al 2016a both parameters remained relatively constant in the water streams of the wwtp with a ph slightly above 7 and is near 0 04 equiv l table 2 the main characteristic that varied between the various water matrixes was the c n p ratios which were calculated according to the elemental fraction of the measured parameters dissolved c nh4 no3 no2 and po4 3 c n p ratios were 100 81 5 for influent 100 69 3 for secondary effluent 100 97 4 for tertiary reclaimed 100 62 4 for backwash and 100 5 1 for sww this reflects the high removal of organic matter from influent to effluent the c n ratio in reclaimed water decreased due to the removal of organic colloids these colloids led to the increase of the c n ratio in the backwash water 3 2 calibration of sp icp ms with ag nps in different water matrixes the calibration curves of ag nps 60 nm in different water matrixes including 1 mm citrate buffer sww and di water were obtained by analyzing from 1 to 500 ng l using sp icp ms fig 1 the calibration curves in all three water matrixes exhibited excellent linearity with r2 0 99 across the entire concentration range however the measured concentrations of ag nps in di water were around 25 lower than nominal values fig 1c particularly at the higher concentration range e g 200 and 500 ng l the lack of organic matter and dissolved ions in di water may reduce the physical e g electrostatic and chemical e g chelating binding interactions between ag nps and water constituents wang et al 2015 decreasing the stability of the ag nps even though all ag nps suspensions were prepared freshly daily before the measurement the potential dissolution and higher sedimentation of ag nps in di water may decrease the availability of ag nps liu and hurt 2010 misra et al 2012 simply adding a 1 mm citrate buffer to the suspension resulted in ag nps concentrations much closer to the nominal values fig 1a citrate buffers or coatings are commonly used to stabilize ag nps in suspension peters et al 2014 this should be considered when designing an sp icp ms analysis protocol for higher accuracy similar precision was observed in the sww matrix fig 1b the presence of organic compounds e g glucose and other cations e g na mg2 ca2 and anions e g cl so4 2 hpo4 2 within the sww do not result in significant interference on the detection and quantification of ag nps via sp icp ms sp icp ms also provided a size distribution of ag nps in these three water matrixes as shown in fig s4 generally the measured sizes by sp icp ms exhibited a peak at around 60 nm fig s4 which agreed with the information provided by the manufacturer however the peak of the ag np size distribution in di water was slightly shifted to a smaller range fig s4 indicating some possible dissolution of ag nps in di even in a short time as inferred from the calibration curve measurements 3 3 incidence of ag nps in wastewater the concentrations of ag nps and ag in wastewater samples were quantified using sp icp ms fig 2 ag np concentrations were 13 5 3 2 0 5 and 9 8 ng l in the influent secondary effluent tertiary reclaimed and backwash water respectively these concentrations do not reflect ag nps potentially associated with suspended solids since they would be removed by the nitrocellulose filters 0 45 μm silver based nanomaterials in the wwtp and the environment can include ag0 ag2o ag2s and agcl which are stable forms of silver kaegi et al 2013 lowry et al 2012 to calculate the size distribution of the ag nps in the samples we assumed a 100 silver content and a spherical shape the size distribution as determined by sp icp ms varied significantly at the various stages of treatment the most frequent particle diameter of ag nps in all types of wastewater was between 20 and 24 nm fig 3 however the 20 nm cut off influences the distribution ag nps detected in the influent were mostly below 100 nm in diameter with a substantial fraction above 50 nm and few particles up to nearly 200 nm in the effluent most of the ag nps were below 50 nm with very few above 100 nm after ultrafiltration 100 nm pore size only nps between 20 and 45 nm were observed and at a much lower frequency the backwash water from the ultrafiltration process did have particles larger than 100 nm reflecting the difference between the effluent and reclaimed water the determination of ag np particle size by sp icp ms showed a clear limit of detection around 20 nm in diameter the trend in fig 3 strongly suggests that ag nps smaller than 20 nm could be present at high numbers in the samples but this could not be determined with the current analytical protocol lee et al 2014 this limitation has also been observed for other types of np and aqueous media such as the cases of rare earth oxides in water fréchette viens et al 2017 ag au and tio2 nps in drinking water donovan et al 2016 and ag ceo2 and tio2 nps surface water peters et al 2018 the biological process at el estero wwtp removed 76 3 of the incidental ag nps and combined with ultrafiltration the wwtp removed 96 3 of the influent load in the ultrafiltration system the particulate matter including the nps retained by the membrane is returned to the influent of the wastewater process therefore 9 8 ng l of ag nps in the backwash water re enter the biological process where there can be a significant accumulation depending on the sludge retention time the presence of ag nps in the biological wastewater treatment process can damage the microbial community and this in turn can impact the treated water quality sun et al 2013 ag nps concentrations found in the influent effluent and reclaimed water of el estero wwtp 13 5 3 2 and 0 5 ng l respectively are within the range measured for effluent 1 12 ng l of nine wwtps in germany determined via extraction by cpe and ier li et al 2013 compared to techniques based on separation and elemental quantification li et al 2012 2013 sp icp ms is a simpler and more direct method to determine ag nps concentration in wastewater streams using sp icp ms peters et al found between 0 3 and 2 5 ng l of ag nps in dutch surface waters peters et al 2018 where they considered the discharge of municipal wastewater effluent as a possible source of ag nps to surface water ionic concentrations of silver ag were 62 2 37 9 50 1 and 55 2 ng l in the influent effluent reclaimed and backwash water respectively the ratio of ag to ag nps observed in the influent was 4 99 and it increased as the treatment progressed fig 2 the potential accumulation of ag nps in the flocs of activated sludge can explain the increase in the ratio then ag np can dissolve during the 8 h hydraulic retention time which is the typical period in the aerobic reactor of a wwtp metcalf and eddy 2014 the coexistence of ag and ag nps had a negligible effect on the determination of the ag np concentrations using sp icp ms in simpler aqueous media laborda et al 2011 although in our study the various wastewater matrices are complex we did not observe a noticeable effect due to the coexistence of ag and ag nps in contrast high ag content significantly interferes with ag np quantification using ier followed by analytical graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry gfaas li et al 2013 the interference was attributed to simultaneous extraction of ag and ag np which can be falsely quantified as ag np by the gfaas analysis several studies have predicted the range of ag np and released ag concentrations present in the effluent of wwtps or receiving waters at different geographic scales from cities to continental regions for wwtp effluent in cities the range is 9 120 ng l in the san francisco bay keller and lazareva 2013 and 4 26 ng l 8 130 ng l and 3 110 ng l in new york shanghai and london respectively lazareva and keller 2014 for the us the range is 1 1 240 ng l hendren et al 2013 and for europe the predicted range is 50 100 ng l gottschalk et al 2013 the concentration of ag nps found in effluent at el estero wwtp is closer to the lower bound of predicted concentrations and when ag is taken into consideration there is a very good correspondence with the predicted range these concentrations were measured in the water column only and represent the colloidal and ionic silver fractions in the various steps of the wastewater treatment processes but may not account for silver in larger particles which were removed by the 0 45 μm nitrocellulose filter given the high removal from influent to secondary and tertiary effluents observed here the majority of ag nps are in the sludge polesel et al 2018 tuoriniemi et al 2017 3 4 persistence of ag nps in the water column ag nps are well known to dissolve and aggregate in suspension knowing how long they can persist in various waters is important for understanding their risk to study the persistence of ag nps in various wastewaters 300 ng l of ag nps 40 nm were spiked in influent effluent reclaimed water and sww samples all wastewater matrixes were filtered with 0 45 μm nitrocellulose filter papers before being spiked with ag nps the ag nps and ag concentration before and after spiking were measured over time the total ag concentration at time 0 h for all wastewater matrixes includes the 300 ng l spiked and the background concentration pre spiking for each water matrix fig 4 ag remarkably increased in real wastewater matrixes at time 0 h indicating rapid dissolution of a fraction of the spiked ag nps in these waters over the monitoring time the concentration of ag np exhibited a remarkable decrease especially in sww and influent the pattern for the influent water was quite predictable with a regular decrease over time for both ag nps and ag since sww and the influent have a greater amount of organic matter nitrogen phosphorus chlorine and sulfur the decrease of free ag in wastewater could be due to the formation of organic complexes zhang et al 2016a or inorganic salts with low solubility such as agcl and ag2s kaegi et al 2013 lombi et al 2013 in contrast the concentrations of ag nps and ag in secondary effluent and tertiary reclaimed water remained relatively constant between 14 h and 300 h fig 4 after 374 h there was a significant amount of precipitate in all wastewater samples the results indicate that the persistence in suspension of ag nps followed influent secondary effluent tertiary reclaimed sww the size distribution of the ag nps over time 0 374 h was also determined by sp icp ms and represented in violin plots fig 5 the shape of each violin plot represents the frequency of ag nps size that occurs 95 of the time blue region and the inner box represents the sizes that occur 50 of the time the central dash line inside the white box represents the median value of the ag nps size based on the median size dash line the results indicate that only ag nps in the influent maintained their original nominal size distribution during the entire study time which was 42 5 nm fig 5a ag nps in sww had a median size of 39 4 nm fig 5c which remained relatively constant for the entire monitored time however after 206 h the detection of ag nps in sww was limited to a few counts fig 4 indicating significant settling and resulting in distorted plots at 231 and 278 h in secondary effluent the size distribution of ag nps varied with time with the median value oscillating from 40 to 43 nm fig 5b despite the variations of the median the frequency of ag nps size that occurs 95 of the time in the effluent showed a peak blue region around 36 nm in all measurements although the ag nps concentrations measured in reclaimed water along the experiment were the lowest fig 4 the size distribution had the same pattern at 374 h fig 5d with higher frequency in the size range of 34 36 nm the analysis of ag np size occurring 95 of the time confirms that most of the dissolution of ag nps happened before 14 h in the effluent and reclaimed water based on the decrease in nominal ag np size the size distribution of ag nps in various waters at 14 h and 374 h are presented in the supplementary material fig s5 analysis of ag np size in all wastewater matrices indicates that the frequency of particles larger than 50 nm decreased between 14 h and 374 h of retention time fig s5 in the case of the influent only 3 3 of the particles were 100 nm at 14 h and at 374 h there were no particles 100 nm the relatively constant size of ag nps in the influent can be attributed to the organic matter content present which stabilizes np suspensions by the physical and chemical interactions mentioned before kaegi et al 2013 wang et al 2015 for the effluent 85 8 of the particles were below 50 nm at 374 h of exposure the fraction of larger particles in reclaimed water also decreased at 374 h with 88 2 of the particles smaller than 50 nm and 11 8 between 50 and 100 nm results indicate that the spiked ag nps 40 nm in contact with the outlet streams of the wwtp effluent and reclaimed water are mainly dissolved and between 85 and 89 of the remaining ag nps are below 50 nm the bottles containing the ag nps were vortexed at the end of the experiment to determine the recovery of ag nps relative to the mass spiked in as well as the ag concentration fig 6 consideration of the ag particulate and ionic concentrations can serve to determine the extent of dissolution and precipitation the recovered concentration of ag nps spiked in sww was higher 92 72 ng l than in the other types of wastewater such as influent 51 34 ng l effluent 23 98 ng l and reclaimed 8 17 ng l while ag nps were almost totally dissolved in reclaimed water 97 28 in sww only 69 09 were dissolved with the balanced in the colloidal fraction 30 91 given that there were no colloidal particles in sww at 204 h fig 4 the balance was indeed precipitated ag ionic concentration in wastewater samples were 85 8 70 4 95 5 and 87 9 ng l for sww influent effluent and reclaimed water these values reflect that a fraction of initial ag nps precipitated as transformation products non detectable in suspension the stability of ag nps in various wastewaters was studied further by determining the iep and zp of the particles immediately after spiking and at 374 h the zp of the ag nps decreased during the study period for sww influent and effluent fig s6 although the change was more significant for sww the opposite behavior was found for ag nps in reclaimed water where the zp increased slightly minor changes in zp were observed for effluent and reclaimed water which is consistent with the persistence of ag nps in suspension at 374 h the iep of the spiked ag nps was between ph 2 and 3 in all wastewaters fig s7 which means the ag nps are negatively charged in the typical range of wwtp operating conditions the iep provides valuable information about the layer composition on the particle surface such as the acid or basic surface functional groups the iep curves for influent effluent reclaimed water and sww suggest that the ag nps have anionic compounds on the surface fig s7 the constant negative charge on the surface of the particles in the range of ph 4 10 suggests that those compounds present in the wastewater streams are tightly bound the zp in the influent and in the reclaimed water remained between 13 and 15 mv for the typical ph range of 5 9 in wastewater van loosdrecht et al 2016 while the zp in the effluent was near 10 mv for sww the zp was more negative as ph increased enhancing the stability of ag nps hence the settling of ag nps in sww was due to the rapid initial formation of larger aggregates fig s5 and not due to the decreasing zp of the nps remaining in suspension fig s6 aggregates formation can be attributed to the presence of cations such as ca2 and mg2 hotze et al 2010 which are components of the sww 4 conclusions sp icp ms was applied to determine the concentration number and mass and size of ag nps in different water matrixes as well as to investigate the incidence and persistence of ag nps in wastewater through the treatment process ag nps were detected and quantified in influent secondary effluent tertiary reclaimed and backwash waters with a concentration of 13 5 3 2 0 5 and 9 8 ng l respectively which correspond well with previously predicted wastewater effluent concentrations a conventional wwtp process followed by ultrafiltration removed more than 96 of the colloidal silver fraction however since the uf backwash water is returned to the secondary treatment the accumulation of nps in the activated sludge increases both the concentration in a bioreactor and their residence time in the process which may eventually affect the biological process most of the incidental ag nps detected in the influent were below 100 nm in diameter although some nps were nearly 200 nm in the effluent almost all particles were below 50 nm with few above 100 nm reclaimed water contained particles between 20 and 45 nm and backwash water had the larger particles retained by the uf membrane the persistence in suspension of ag nps in wastewater streams revealed that although ag nps dissolved in wastewater the remaining nps tended to precipitate due to their lower stability in sww influent and effluent respectively the persistence in suspension of ag nps followed influent effluent reclaimed sww dissolution of ag nps was observed in all wwtp waters mainly at time 0 h spiked ag nps remain near their original size in the influent and in the sww for effluent and reclaimed water 95 of the nps were between 34 and 36 nm although the measured concentrations in the wastewater flows in the wwtp influent effluent and reclaimed waters were very low 13 5 3 2 and 0 5 ng l respectively and only reflect the colloidal fractions in the effluents the sampling regime performed may mask the

18902,the anaerobic process is a favorable alternative for the treatment of antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater the electrically assisted anaerobic process can be used to accelerate contaminant removal especially for persistent organic pollutants such as antibiotics in this study an electrically assisted anaerobic system for chloramphenicol cap wastewater treatment was developed the system performance and the underlying metabolic mechanisms were evaluated under different applied voltages with the increase of applied voltage from 0 to 2 v the cap removal efficiencies increased from 53 3 to 89 7 while the methane production increased more than three times the microbial community structure and correlation analysis showed that electrical stimulation selected the dominant functional bacteria and increased antibiotic resistance in dominant functional bacteria both of which enhanced cap removal and methane production the improved cap removal was a result of the presence of dechlorination related bacteria acidovorax sedimentibacter thauera and flavobacterium and potential electroactive bacteria shewanella and comamonas both of which carried args and therefore could survive the biotoxicity of cap the enhanced methane production could be partly attributed to the surviving fermentative related bacteria paludibacter proteiniclasticum and macellibacteroides in the anaerobic bioreactor the increased abundances of methanogenic genes mcra and acas genes under high voltage further confirmed the enhanced methane production of this electrically assisted anaerobic system the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms underlying metabolic performance enhancement is critical for the further development of anaerobic wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic treatment chloramphenicol wastewater methane production functional bacteria antibiotic resistant bacteria 1 introduction antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewaters have led to widespread environmental pollutants of antibiotic residues antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes args which threaten human health aydin et al 2015b ng et al 2015 rysz et al 2013 chloramphenicol cap is an effective broad spectrum antibiotic that is relatively recalcitrant in the aquatic environment due to its biorefractory nitro and chlorine substituents kong et al 2015 liang et al 2013 anaerobic wastewater treatment is a traditional technique for mitigating the toxicity of nitro and chlorine substituents donlon et al 1996 zhu et al 2012 however the low degradation efficiency and the poor stability limited the application of the traditional anaerobic technique for cap degradation shen et al 2013 previous studies have reported that the application of electrical stimulation to anaerobic systems can improve the mineralization of recalcitrant pollutants with nitro and chlorine substituents such as chloronitrobenzenes and nitrophenols jiang et al 2016 shen et al 2014 and also can enhance energy recovery zhao et al 2014 by enhancing bioelectrochemical reduction therefore an electrically assisted anaerobic system can be a promising alternative for cap degradation by improving electron transfer from electron donors such as organic substrates to cap via microbial activities shen et al 2014 shi et al 2014 previous studies have demonstrated that both dominant functional bacteria reduction related species fermentative related species and potential electroactive species and methanogens under electrical stimulation play an indispensable role in the enhancement of chlorinated organic pollutant removal and methane production feng et al 2015 jiang et al 2016 liu et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 however the contribution of specific bacteria for both cap removal and methane production remains unclear it has also been reported that the application of electrical stimulation can promote the proliferation of args guo et al 2018 yuan et al 2016 furthermore args can spread among bacteria via horizontal and vertical gene transfer jia et al 2015 su et al 2015 thus dominant functional bacteria in the electrically assisted anaerobic system can acquire args and thus can resist the toxicity of antibiotics and further affect system performance aydin et al 2015a katipoglu yazan et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to investigate the contribution of functional bacteria and args to both cap removal and methane production however the available information about the role of functional bacteria and args for the enhancement of the system performance during electrically assisted anaerobic treatment of cap wastewater is very limited in this study an electrically assisted anaerobic system was developed for both cap wastewater treatment and biogas production the effects of both voltage and initial cap concentration on the metabolic performance of the anaerobic system including cap removal and biogas production were evaluated and discussed the abundances of anaerobic functional genes and args in the system were determined the functional bacteria were determined via microbial community analysis a correlation analysis between functional bacteria and args was conducted to determine the functional bacteria potentially carrying args the aims of this study were 1 to evaluate the capacity for cap removal and methane production in the electrically assisted anaerobic system 2 to identify the functional bacteria carrying args and 3 to determine the mechanisms underlying metabolic performance variations 2 materials and methods 2 1 system setup the schematic diagram of the electrically assisted anaerobic system is shown in fig s1 the column reactor was made of plexiglass and had a volume of 900 ml with the dimension of 50 mm inner diameter and 120 mm height a pair of graphite plate electrodes were used as cathode and anode a regulated direct current power source lw3j3d2 shanghai liyou china was used to supply different voltages across the electrodes and a data acquisition system 34970a agilent usa was connected to detect the voltage across an external resistor rex 10 ω to calculate the current during the experiments water jackets and a water bath heating system were used to ensure that the temperature remained at 30 2 c the biogas produced from each reactor was collected into gasbags the influent was synthetic wastewater with the following composition in g l 1 glucose 0 7 nh4cl 0 057 kh2po4 3h2o 0 022 mgso4 0 012 and cacl2 0 0115 trace element solution 10 ml l 1 was also added and the details of its composition are provided in the supporting information the cap concentrations varied depending on reactor operational conditions and were selected to stimulate antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater amin et al 2006 before pumping into the reactor the influent was deoxygenated by flushing n2 for 20 min the inoculum was collected from a batch anaerobic bioreactor that treated cap wastewater the raw sludge of the bioreactor was taken from a sedimentation tank of the guangda municipal sewage plant in jinan china glucose 1 g l was used as substrate for the bioreactor cap 20 mg l could be removed by 70 after 96 h in the bioreactor the inoculum of 300 ml was taken from the bioreactor at the end of the batch experiment to ensure the same initial concentration of args and anaerobic functional genes the concentration of the mixed liquor suspended solids of the inoculum was 3000 mg l 2 2 experimental design and operation methods since both the applied voltage and cap concentration exert important influences on the metabolic performance of the system the effects of both variables on cap removal and methane production were investigated during operation the experiments were conducted in a reactor designated r1 under different conditions another reactor without electrodes acted as control designated r2 first the effect of different voltages 0 5 1 and 2 v on cap removal and biogas production was investigated and the abundances of args and anaerobic functional genes were determined in these experiments the initial cap concentration was retained at 50 mg l second the effects of different cap concentrations 20 50 and 80 mg l on both cap removal and biogas production were studied in these experiments the voltage was maintained at 1 v three sets of experiments were repeated under identical conditions each set of experiments included three batch experiments and each batch experiment lasted for 3 d before starting a new set of experiments with a freshly added inoculum three batch tests were run to ensure the stable performance of both cap removal efficiency and biofilm enrichment sludge samples were taken at the end of each set of experiments for dna and rna extraction details are given in section 2 3 water samples were collected at the end of each batch experiment for the subsequent analysis simultaneously the biogas in the gasbag was drawn out by a syringe for volume measurement the component of biogas was detected by a gas chromatograph agilent usa 7890b equipped with flame ionization detection between repetitions of batch experiments the effluent was discharged then deoxygenized phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 4 was pumped into the reactor to wash the biomass and to remove residual cap afterwards pbs was discharged this operation was repeated twice then fresh influent was pumped into the reactor 2 3 dna and rna extraction and cdna synthesis to investigate the contribution of both suspended and attached biomass to functional bacteria sludge samples of 100 mg containing a mixture of suspended and attached biomass were taken from r1 and r2 at the end of each set of experiments dna sample was extracted from 50 mg sludge using a powersoil dna isolation kit mobio usa to evaluate the abundances of args anaerobic functional genes as well as microbial community structures rna sample was extracted from 50 mg sludge using a powersoil rna isolation kit mobio usa to evaluate the expression of anaerobic functional genes three replicates were conducted for dna and rna isolation the quality and quantity of the dna and rna were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis and nucleic acid analysis nano 200 allsheng china respectively on the day of extraction cdna was synthesized from rna extracts for analysis using a primerscript rt reagent kit with gdna eraser takara usa the reverse transcription process was conducted in two steps first gdna was removed using a gdna eraser the volume for the first step was 10 μl containing 2 μl of 5 gdna eraser buffer 1 μl of gdna eraser 0 6 μg of rna sample and the remaining volume of rnase free dh2o to reach 10 μl the 10 μl mixture was placed in a pcr instrument t100 bio rad usa at 42 c for 2 min then cdna was synthesized in a second step here the volume of the mixture was 20 μl including 10 μl of mixture from the first step 1 μl of primescript rt enzyme mix i 1 μl of rt primer mix 4 μl of 5 primescript buffer 2 and 4 μl of rnase free dh2o the reverse transcription was conducted at 37 c for 15 min followed by 85 c for 5 s both cdna and dna were stored at 20 c until they were required for qpcr 2 4 quantification of anaerobic functional genes and args the efflux of antibiotics by efflux pump coding genes has been recognized as the main mechanism of antibiotic resistance therefore three efflux pump genes cmla flor and tetc were selected the integrase of class 1 integrons inti1 was chosen as indicator for horizontal gene transfer carey et al 2016 in particular the sul1 gene was selected because it is generally associated with inti1 chen and zhang 2013 to further investigate the metabolic performance in the system three anaerobic functional genes fthfs mcra and acas were detected the fthfs gene encodes formyltetrahydrofolate synthesis which is unique to homoacetogen and represents the capacity for acetate production leaphart and lovell 2001 the mcra gene encoding methyl com reductase of the methanogenic pathway is universal in methanogens luton et al 2002 the acas gene encodes a key enzyme that stimulates the conversion of acetate to acetyl coa which represents the capacity for acetoclastic methanogenesis smith and ingram smith 2007 the information of the primers used in this study as well as the annealing temperature can be found in table s1 the qpcr assays were conducted using the lightcycler 480 system roche switzerland standard curves were generated by using plasmids containing the sequences for each of the targeted genes the abundances of these target genes were analyzed using the standard curves to avoid bias in the qpcr experiments the args and anaerobic functional genes were normalized to the 16s rrna gene the relative expression of anaerobic functional genes was calculated as described in our previous study guo et al 2017 all samples were run in triplicates in qpcr reactions pcr inhibition was tested in cdna and dna samples by using undiluted and 10 fold dilutions of each sample as qpcr templates no reverse transcription controls undiluted and 10 fold diluted rna samples were used to confirm the absence of gdna in rna samples 2 5 illumina sequencing and statistical analysis to investigate the shifts in bacterial communities the v4v5 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified with primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 907r 5 ccgtcaattcctttgagttt 3 purified and sequenced the pcrs were run with the following parameters one cycle at 94 c for 3 min 30 cycles at 94 c for 30 s 53 c for 40 s 72 c for 1 min and finally 72 c for 5 min the subsequent sequencing was conducted at the novogene institute beijing china on the illumina hiseq 2500 platform the qiime pipeline software version 1 7 0 was used to analyze the sequences chimera sequences were removed using the uchime algorithm sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus using a 97 similarity as cutoff and using uparse software taxonomic assignation was performed using the greengene database with the rdp classifier algorithm guo et al 2018 to determine the functional bacteria carrying args under different conditions quantitative correlation between args and the bacterial genera was conducted based on the spearman analysis to identify the contribution of horizontal gene transfer to the args variations spearman correlation analyses between args and inti1 were performed under different conditions the spearman indices r and significant correlation p of the correlations among genera inti1 and args were determined using spss software ibm usa the significant difference p of args under different conditions was determined using the independent samples t test p and p values below 0 05 were regarded as statistically significant 2 6 analytical methods cap concentrations were determined by a shimadzu lc 20at hplc system shimadzu japan equipped with a uv detector a shimadzu column c18 5 μm 4 250 mm was applied to isolate cap the injection volume was 20 μl and the uv detector detection was set to 275 nm the mobile phases were methanol h2o 55 45 v v at a flow rate of 0 8 ml min all effluent samples were filtered through 0 22 μm filters prior to use 3 results 3 1 performance of the electrically assisted anaerobic system under different conditions the efficiencies of cap removal and methane production were evaluated under different voltages and initial cap concentrations the results are shown in fig 1 with the increase of applied voltage from 0 to 2 v the cap removal efficiency significantly increased from 53 3 to 89 7 fig 1a this clearly indicates that the enhanced electrical stimulation improved cap removal although the cap removal efficiency decreased with increasing cap concentration fig 1b it was noteworthy that the removal efficiency exceeded 90 even under a high initial cap concentration of 80 mg l indicating that cap could still be efficiently removed biogas production was significantly influenced by the applied voltage and initial cap concentration fig 1c and d the methane yield was 40 6 ml at a voltage of 0 v but increased to 173 2 ml at a voltage of 2 v this demonstrated that higher voltage enhanced biogas production however the methane yield significantly decreased from 140 8 to 98 2 ml when the initial cap concentration increased from 20 to 80 mg l indicating that the higher initial cap concentration inhibited the methane production fig 1d cod balance was almost achieved under different conditions based on both cod removal and biogas generation for example cod removal was 0 0055 mol at 0 v which is almost in balance with the methane yield 40 6 ml equal to 0 0033 mol cod and carbon dioxide production 20 5 ml equal to 0 0016 mol cod the current significantly increased with increasing applied voltage fig s2a indicating that the enhanced electrical stimulation improved current generation the initial cap concentration had no significant effect on the current generation fig s2b 3 2 variations of args and anaerobic functional genes under different conditions typical args encoding efflux pumps cmla flor and tetc were studied and their relative abundances under different conditions are shown in fig 2 the abundances of the cmla flor and tetc increased significantly as the voltage increased p 0 05 indicating that the application of electrical stimulation enhanced the proliferation of args fig 2a the inti1 gene is recognized as an indicator of horizontal gene transfer of args while the sul1 gene is generally found on the gene cassettes of inti1 chen and zhang 2013 hardwick et al 2008 the abundances of sul1 and inti1 at higher voltages 1 and 2 v were significantly higher than at 0 v p 0 05 this indicates that higher applied voltages could enhance the horizontal gene transfer of args to clarify the contribution of horizontal gene transfer to the arg variations a spearman correlation analysis between args and inti1 was performed table s2 significant correlations were found between args except flor and inti1 indicating that horizontal gene transfer was an important factor for the variations in args under different voltages three concentrations of cap 20 50 and 80 mg l were evaluated to determine the effect of cap concentrations on args fig 2b the abundances of args and inti1 at 80 mg l were significantly higher than at 20 mg l p 0 05 indicating that higher cap concentrations enhanced the proliferation of args as well as horizontal gene transfer as shown in table s2 significant correlations were found between args and inti1 indicating that horizontal gene transfer partly contributed to variations in args at different cap concentrations to further determine the metabolic performance at different voltages and cap concentrations in the system both the abundances and expressions of three anaerobic functional genes fthfs mcra and acas were investigated their functions are presented in section 2 4 and the results are shown in fig 3 the abundances and expression of the fthfs mcra and acas increased significantly with increasing applied voltage p 0 05 fig 3a and b indicating that higher voltages resulted in the proliferation of anaerobic functional genes the abundances and expression of the fthfs gene at 80 mg l were significantly higher than at 20 mg l p 0 05 fig 3c and d indicating that the higher cap concentration enhanced acetate production however the abundances and expressions of mcra and acas genes decreased significantly with increasing cap concentration p 0 05 this indicates that higher cap concentrations inhibited both methane production and acetoclastic methanogenesis 3 3 determination of functional bacteria the composition of the microbial community was determined through a genera level analysis as shown in fig 4 the applied voltage obviously altered the microbial community structure of particular note is the increase in the relative abundances of paludibacter acidovorax proteiniclasticm macellibacteroides sedimentibacter thauera shewanella comamonas and flavobacterium with increasing applied voltage the pollutant reduction related species fermentative related species and potential electroactive species are important for the stable operation of a high performance anaerobic system the fermentative related species paludibacter proteiniclasticm and macellibacteroides can degrade organic pollutants to smaller molecular compounds such as acetate which may enhance the acetate production in the system lawson et al 2014 qiu et al 2014 rout et al 2017 acidovorax sedimentibacter thauera and flavobacterium are able to catalyze the dechlorination process and can enhance cap reduction gu et al 2004 macy et al 1993 monferrán et al 2005 saber and crawford 1985 shewanella and comamonas have been reported as common electroactive species that facilitate electron transfer between a biocatalyst and an electrode liang et al 2014 marsili et al 2008 the cap concentration also altered the microbial community structure fig 4 the relative abundances of macellibacteroides shewanella comamonas sphingopyxis and flavobacterium increased as the cap concentration increased as mentioned above macellibacteroides is a fermentative related species rout et al 2017 shewanella and comamonas are electroactive species liang et al 2014 marsili et al 2008 sphingopyxis and flavobacterium can catalyze the dechlorination process and can enhance cap degradation godoy et al 2003 saber and crawford 1985 3 4 determination of functional bacteria carrying args as shown in fig 5 and 35 bacterial genera might be potential hosts of the args based on the spearman correlation between args and genera the potential hosts of args cmla flor tetc and sul1 under different voltages were paludibacter acidovorax proteiniclasticm macellibacteroides sedimentibacter thauera shewanella comamonas and flavobacterium the result indicated that the applied voltage enriched the fermentative related species paludibacter proteiniclasticm and macellibacteroides the pollutant reduction related species acidovorax sedimentibacter thauera and flavobacterium and potential electroactive species shewanella and comamonas carrying args figs 4 and 5 as shown in fig 6 potential hosts of args under different cap concentrations were macellibacteroides shewanella comamonas sphingopyxis and flavobacterium the results show that higher cap concentrations enriched the fermentative related species macellibacteroides the potential electroactive species shewanella and comamonas and the pollutant reduction related species sphingopyxis and flavobacterium carrying args figs 4 and 6 the changes in abundances of args are caused by this shift of hosts and by horizontal gene transfer of args jia et al 2015 su et al 2015 the results of the correlation analysis between args and inti1 microbial community indicated that both shift of hosts and horizontal gene transfer contributed to the abundances of args variations under different voltages and initial cap concentrations it is worth noting that the abundance of flor increased sharply at 2 v fig 2a this sharp increase of flor in comparison to other args might be because the potential hosts showed more extreme significant correlations with flor than other args acidovorax macellibacteroides and sedimentibacter which became more dominant at 2 v 4 discussion the selection of microorganisms by electrical stimulation was the key mechanism that enhanced the metabolic performance during electrically assisted anaerobic treatment of cap wastewater the electrical stimulation promoted the abundance of pollutant reduction related species fermentative related species and potential electroactive species fig 4 thus benefiting system performance jiang et al 2016 in addition the application of electrical stimulation enhanced the horizontal gene transfer of args fig 2 thus args spread among the dominant bacteria and functional bacteria acquired args the functional bacteria carrying args cmla flor and tetc could survive from the biotoxicity of cap by transporting antibiotics out of the cell and these were further enriched in the electrically assisted anaerobic system moreover more electrons were provided with the application of electrical stimulation for cap reduction which further reduced toxic stress on functional bacteria the enrichment of functional bacteria enhanced both cap removal and methane production in the electrically assisted anaerobic system the enhancement of the methane production at higher voltages 0 5 1 and 2 v fig 1 resulted from the enrichment of fermentative related species carrying args paludibacter proteiniclasticm and macellibacteroides figs 4 and 5 paludibacter proteiniclasticm and macellibacteroides can degrade organic pollutants to smaller molecular compounds such as acetate lawson et al 2014 qiu et al 2014 rout et al 2017 thus acetogenesis partly contributed to the enhanced acetate production at higher voltages the higher abundance of the fthfs gene fig 3a and b indicated homoacetogenesis as another contributor to the enhancement of acetate production under higher voltages which represents the capacity for acetate production through homoacetogenesis leaphart and lovell 2001 the increased abundance of the fthfs gene might be a result of the higher abundance of homoacetogen which was not dominant thus the acetoclastic methanogenesis process was enhanced it has been reported that acetotrophic methanogens play an extremely important role in methane production ince et al 2011 kim et al 2013 therefore improved acetoclastic methanogenesis partly enhanced methane production in the system in addition hydrogen accumulations were found in the system under higher applied voltage fig 1c and d hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis can be stimulated by the presence of hydrogen liu et al 2016 thus both acetoclastic methanogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis enhanced the methane production at higher applied voltage the higher abundances of anaerobic functional genes mcra and acas genes fig 3a and b further showed how the methane production was enhanced under higher voltages as described above this enhanced acetate production might significantly contribute to the proliferation of acetotrophic methanogens at higher voltage the acas gene is present in acetotrophic methanogens smith and ingram smith 2007 therefore the abundance of the acas gene sharply increased at higher voltage 2 v fig 3 since acetoclastic methanogenesis is an important part of the methane production an improvement of acetoclastic methanogenesis would have partly enhanced the proliferation of the mcra gene which represents methane production luton et al 2002 it should be noted that the methane production was low at the relative high cap concentration of 80 mg l despite the fermentative related species carrying args macellibacteroides being enriched figs 4 and 6 this was likely because the high antibiotic concentration prevented the methanogens from adapting and maintaining methane production aydin et al 2015a the lower abundances of acas and mcra genes under the same cap concentration 80 mg l further confirmed this assumption fig 3c and d the higher abundance of the fthfs gene indicated the higher acetate production under higher cap concentration fig 3c and d and 4 this was consistent with a previous study that indicated that higher antibiotic concentrations contribute to short chain fatty acid production in anaerobic system wang et al 2017 the enhanced cap removal at higher voltages 0 5 1 and 2 v fig 1 was attributed to the enrichment of pollutant reduction related species acidovorax sedimentibacter thauera and flavobacterium and potential electroactive species shewanella and comamonas carrying args figs 4 and 5 with the help of potentially electroactive species shewanella and comamonas pollutant reduction related species acidovorax sedimentibacter thauera and flavobacterium could gain electrons from an electrode to catalyze the cap reduction process the enrichment of pollutant reduction related species sphingopyxis and flavobacterium and potential electroactive species shewanella and comamonas carrying args contributed to an efficient cap removal even under higher cap concentrations 50 and 80 mg l figs 4 and 6 respectively and enhanced cap removal it is worth noting that the cap removal efficiency and methane production increased as voltage increased and the abundance of args also increased significantly as voltage increased fig 1a c and 2a the risk of transfer of high arg level to pathogenic bacteria should be avoided which threatens human health pruden et al 2006 though args could help functional bacteria to survive from toxicity of cap in this study therefore the optimization of operating conditions should be balanced based on both the enhancement of metabolic performance and the control of arg proliferation moreover the system showed more than 90 cap removal efficiency at 2 v applied voltage which is acceptable for high concentration cap wastewater treatment thus the experiments under a voltage higher than 2 v were not conducted which may further increase the abundance of args in the electrically assisted anaerobic system in addition to pollutant reduction related species fermentative related species and potential electroactive species other species may be involved in the stable performance of cap removal and methane production further studies are required to investigate specific functional bacteria and genes metagenomics can be used to acquire a deeper understanding of the functional bacteria and genes in the electrically assisted anaerobic system the functional bacteria carrying args were identified only based on correlation analysis which offers good potential further investigations on the identification of specific host bacteria are necessary for example specific antibiotic resistant functional bacteria in the system sludge could be isolated using plates that contain different antibiotics 5 conclusion in this study the selection of microorganisms by electrical stimulation was the key enhancement mechanism for the metabolic performance in an electrically assisted anaerobic system electrical stimulation selected the dominant functional bacteria pollutant reduction related species fermentative related species and potential electroactive species and increased the antibiotic resistance in dominant functional bacteria which survived from the toxicity of cap and enriched the further enrichment of functional bacteria enhanced both cap removal and methane production dechlorination related bacteria and potential electroactive bacteria carrying args contributed the improvement of cap removal enhanced methane production was attributed to the survival of fermentative related bacteria that have resistance to cap this study offers new insights into the mechanisms of metabolic performance enhancement during the electrically assisted anaerobic treatment

18902,the anaerobic process is a favorable alternative for the treatment of antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater the electrically assisted anaerobic process can be used to accelerate contaminant removal especially for persistent organic pollutants such as antibiotics in this study an electrically assisted anaerobic system for chloramphenicol cap wastewater treatment was developed the system performance and the underlying metabolic mechanisms were evaluated under different applied voltages with the increase of applied voltage from 0 to 2 v the cap removal efficiencies increased from 53 3 to 89 7 while the methane production increased more than three times the microbial community structure and correlation analysis showed that electrical stimulation selected the dominant functional bacteria and increased antibiotic resistance in dominant functional bacteria both of which enhanced cap removal and methane production the improved cap removal was a result of the presence of dechlorination related bacteria acidovorax sedimentibacter thauera and flavobacterium and potential electroactive bacteria shewanella and comamonas both of which carried args and therefore could survive the biotoxicity of cap the enhanced methane production could be partly attributed to the surviving fermentative related bacteria paludibacter proteiniclasticum and macellibacteroides in the anaerobic bioreactor the increased abundances of methanogenic genes mcra and acas genes under high voltage further confirmed the enhanced methane production of this electrically assisted anaerobic system the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms underlying metabolic performance enhancement is critical for the further development of anaerobic wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic treatment chloramphenicol wastewater methane production functional bacteria antibiotic resistant bacteria 1 introduction antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewaters have led to widespread environmental pollutants of antibiotic residues antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes args which threaten human health aydin et al 2015b ng et al 2015 rysz et al 2013 chloramphenicol cap is an effective broad spectrum antibiotic that is relatively recalcitrant in the aquatic environment due to its biorefractory nitro and chlorine substituents kong et al 2015 liang et al 2013 anaerobic wastewater treatment is a traditional technique for mitigating the toxicity of nitro and chlorine substituents donlon et al 1996 zhu et al 2012 however the low degradation efficiency and the poor stability limited the application of the traditional anaerobic technique for cap degradation shen et al 2013 previous studies have reported that the application of electrical stimulation to anaerobic systems can improve the mineralization of recalcitrant pollutants with nitro and chlorine substituents such as chloronitrobenzenes and nitrophenols jiang et al 2016 shen et al 2014 and also can enhance energy recovery zhao et al 2014 by enhancing bioelectrochemical reduction therefore an electrically assisted anaerobic system can be a promising alternative for cap degradation by improving electron transfer from electron donors such as organic substrates to cap via microbial activities shen et al 2014 shi et al 2014 previous studies have demonstrated that both dominant functional bacteria reduction related species fermentative related species and potential electroactive species and methanogens under electrical stimulation play an indispensable role in the enhancement of chlorinated organic pollutant removal and methane production feng et al 2015 jiang et al 2016 liu et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 however the contribution of specific bacteria for both cap removal and methane production remains unclear it has also been reported that the application of electrical stimulation can promote the proliferation of args guo et al 2018 yuan et al 2016 furthermore args can spread among bacteria via horizontal and vertical gene transfer jia et al 2015 su et al 2015 thus dominant functional bacteria in the electrically assisted anaerobic system can acquire args and thus can resist the toxicity of antibiotics and further affect system performance aydin et al 2015a katipoglu yazan et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to investigate the contribution of functional bacteria and args to both cap removal and methane production however the available information about the role of functional bacteria and args for the enhancement of the system performance during electrically assisted anaerobic treatment of cap wastewater is very limited in this study an electrically assisted anaerobic system was developed for both cap wastewater treatment and biogas production the effects of both voltage and initial cap concentration on the metabolic performance of the anaerobic system including cap removal and biogas production were evaluated and discussed the abundances of anaerobic functional genes and args in the system were determined the functional bacteria were determined via microbial community analysis a correlation analysis between functional bacteria and args was conducted to determine the functional bacteria potentially carrying args the aims of this study were 1 to evaluate the capacity for cap removal and methane production in the electrically assisted anaerobic system 2 to identify the functional bacteria carrying args and 3 to determine the mechanisms underlying metabolic performance variations 2 materials and methods 2 1 system setup the schematic diagram of the electrically assisted anaerobic system is shown in fig s1 the column reactor was made of plexiglass and had a volume of 900 ml with the dimension of 50 mm inner diameter and 120 mm height a pair of graphite plate electrodes were used as cathode and anode a regulated direct current power source lw3j3d2 shanghai liyou china was used to supply different voltages across the electrodes and a data acquisition system 34970a agilent usa was connected to detect the voltage across an external resistor rex 10 ω to calculate the current during the experiments water jackets and a water bath heating system were used to ensure that the temperature remained at 30 2 c the biogas produced from each reactor was collected into gasbags the influent was synthetic wastewater with the following composition in g l 1 glucose 0 7 nh4cl 0 057 kh2po4 3h2o 0 022 mgso4 0 012 and cacl2 0 0115 trace element solution 10 ml l 1 was also added and the details of its composition are provided in the supporting information the cap concentrations varied depending on reactor operational conditions and were selected to stimulate antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater amin et al 2006 before pumping into the reactor the influent was deoxygenated by flushing n2 for 20 min the inoculum was collected from a batch anaerobic bioreactor that treated cap wastewater the raw sludge of the bioreactor was taken from a sedimentation tank of the guangda municipal sewage plant in jinan china glucose 1 g l was used as substrate for the bioreactor cap 20 mg l could be removed by 70 after 96 h in the bioreactor the inoculum of 300 ml was taken from the bioreactor at the end of the batch experiment to ensure the same initial concentration of args and anaerobic functional genes the concentration of the mixed liquor suspended solids of the inoculum was 3000 mg l 2 2 experimental design and operation methods since both the applied voltage and cap concentration exert important influences on the metabolic performance of the system the effects of both variables on cap removal and methane production were investigated during operation the experiments were conducted in a reactor designated r1 under different conditions another reactor without electrodes acted as control designated r2 first the effect of different voltages 0 5 1 and 2 v on cap removal and biogas production was investigated and the abundances of args and anaerobic functional genes were determined in these experiments the initial cap concentration was retained at 50 mg l second the effects of different cap concentrations 20 50 and 80 mg l on both cap removal and biogas production were studied in these experiments the voltage was maintained at 1 v three sets of experiments were repeated under identical conditions each set of experiments included three batch experiments and each batch experiment lasted for 3 d before starting a new set of experiments with a freshly added inoculum three batch tests were run to ensure the stable performance of both cap removal efficiency and biofilm enrichment sludge samples were taken at the end of each set of experiments for dna and rna extraction details are given in section 2 3 water samples were collected at the end of each batch experiment for the subsequent analysis simultaneously the biogas in the gasbag was drawn out by a syringe for volume measurement the component of biogas was detected by a gas chromatograph agilent usa 7890b equipped with flame ionization detection between repetitions of batch experiments the effluent was discharged then deoxygenized phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 4 was pumped into the reactor to wash the biomass and to remove residual cap afterwards pbs was discharged this operation was repeated twice then fresh influent was pumped into the reactor 2 3 dna and rna extraction and cdna synthesis to investigate the contribution of both suspended and attached biomass to functional bacteria sludge samples of 100 mg containing a mixture of suspended and attached biomass were taken from r1 and r2 at the end of each set of experiments dna sample was extracted from 50 mg sludge using a powersoil dna isolation kit mobio usa to evaluate the abundances of args anaerobic functional genes as well as microbial community structures rna sample was extracted from 50 mg sludge using a powersoil rna isolation kit mobio usa to evaluate the expression of anaerobic functional genes three replicates were conducted for dna and rna isolation the quality and quantity of the dna and rna were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis and nucleic acid analysis nano 200 allsheng china respectively on the day of extraction cdna was synthesized from rna extracts for analysis using a primerscript rt reagent kit with gdna eraser takara usa the reverse transcription process was conducted in two steps first gdna was removed using a gdna eraser the volume for the first step was 10 μl containing 2 μl of 5 gdna eraser buffer 1 μl of gdna eraser 0 6 μg of rna sample and the remaining volume of rnase free dh2o to reach 10 μl the 10 μl mixture was placed in a pcr instrument t100 bio rad usa at 42 c for 2 min then cdna was synthesized in a second step here the volume of the mixture was 20 μl including 10 μl of mixture from the first step 1 μl of primescript rt enzyme mix i 1 μl of rt primer mix 4 μl of 5 primescript buffer 2 and 4 μl of rnase free dh2o the reverse transcription was conducted at 37 c for 15 min followed by 85 c for 5 s both cdna and dna were stored at 20 c until they were required for qpcr 2 4 quantification of anaerobic functional genes and args the efflux of antibiotics by efflux pump coding genes has been recognized as the main mechanism of antibiotic resistance therefore three efflux pump genes cmla flor and tetc were selected the integrase of class 1 integrons inti1 was chosen as indicator for horizontal gene transfer carey et al 2016 in particular the sul1 gene was selected because it is generally associated with inti1 chen and zhang 2013 to further investigate the metabolic performance in the system three anaerobic functional genes fthfs mcra and acas were detected the fthfs gene encodes formyltetrahydrofolate synthesis which is unique to homoacetogen and represents the capacity for acetate production leaphart and lovell 2001 the mcra gene encoding methyl com reductase of the methanogenic pathway is universal in methanogens luton et al 2002 the acas gene encodes a key enzyme that stimulates the conversion of acetate to acetyl coa which represents the capacity for acetoclastic methanogenesis smith and ingram smith 2007 the information of the primers used in this study as well as the annealing temperature can be found in table s1 the qpcr assays were conducted using the lightcycler 480 system roche switzerland standard curves were generated by using plasmids containing the sequences for each of the targeted genes the abundances of these target genes were analyzed using the standard curves to avoid bias in the qpcr experiments the args and anaerobic functional genes were normalized to the 16s rrna gene the relative expression of anaerobic functional genes was calculated as described in our previous study guo et al 2017 all samples were run in triplicates in qpcr reactions pcr inhibition was tested in cdna and dna samples by using undiluted and 10 fold dilutions of each sample as qpcr templates no reverse transcription controls undiluted and 10 fold diluted rna samples were used to confirm the absence of gdna in rna samples 2 5 illumina sequencing and statistical analysis to investigate the shifts in bacterial communities the v4v5 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified with primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 907r 5 ccgtcaattcctttgagttt 3 purified and sequenced the pcrs were run with the following parameters one cycle at 94 c for 3 min 30 cycles at 94 c for 30 s 53 c for 40 s 72 c for 1 min and finally 72 c for 5 min the subsequent sequencing was conducted at the novogene institute beijing china on the illumina hiseq 2500 platform the qiime pipeline software version 1 7 0 was used to analyze the sequences chimera sequences were removed using the uchime algorithm sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus using a 97 similarity as cutoff and using uparse software taxonomic assignation was performed using the greengene database with the rdp classifier algorithm guo et al 2018 to determine the functional bacteria carrying args under different conditions quantitative correlation between args and the bacterial genera was conducted based on the spearman analysis to identify the contribution of horizontal gene transfer to the args variations spearman correlation analyses between args and inti1 were performed under different conditions the spearman indices r and significant correlation p of the correlations among genera inti1 and args were determined using spss software ibm usa the significant difference p of args under different conditions was determined using the independent samples t test p and p values below 0 05 were regarded as statistically significant 2 6 analytical methods cap concentrations were determined by a shimadzu lc 20at hplc system shimadzu japan equipped with a uv detector a shimadzu column c18 5 μm 4 250 mm was applied to isolate cap the injection volume was 20 μl and the uv detector detection was set to 275 nm the mobile phases were methanol h2o 55 45 v v at a flow rate of 0 8 ml min all effluent samples were filtered through 0 22 μm filters prior to use 3 results 3 1 performance of the electrically assisted anaerobic system under different conditions the efficiencies of cap removal and methane production were evaluated under different voltages and initial cap concentrations the results are shown in fig 1 with the increase of applied voltage from 0 to 2 v the cap removal efficiency significantly increased from 53 3 to 89 7 fig 1a this clearly indicates that the enhanced electrical stimulation improved cap removal although the cap removal efficiency decreased with increasing cap concentration fig 1b it was noteworthy that the removal efficiency exceeded 90 even under a high initial cap concentration of 80 mg l indicating that cap could still be efficiently removed biogas production was significantly influenced by the applied voltage and initial cap concentration fig 1c and d the methane yield was 40 6 ml at a voltage of 0 v but increased to 173 2 ml at a voltage of 2 v this demonstrated that higher voltage enhanced biogas production however the methane yield significantly decreased from 140 8 to 98 2 ml when the initial cap concentration increased from 20 to 80 mg l indicating that the higher initial cap concentration inhibited the methane production fig 1d cod balance was almost achieved under different conditions based on both cod removal and biogas generation for example cod removal was 0 0055 mol at 0 v which is almost in balance with the methane yield 40 6 ml equal to 0 0033 mol cod and carbon dioxide production 20 5 ml equal to 0 0016 mol cod the current significantly increased with increasing applied voltage fig s2a indicating that the enhanced electrical stimulation improved current generation the initial cap concentration had no significant effect on the current generation fig s2b 3 2 variations of args and anaerobic functional genes under different conditions typical args encoding efflux pumps cmla flor and tetc were studied and their relative abundances under different conditions are shown in fig 2 the abundances of the cmla flor and tetc increased significantly as the voltage increased p 0 05 indicating that the application of electrical stimulation enhanced the proliferation of args fig 2a the inti1 gene is recognized as an indicator of horizontal gene transfer of args while the sul1 gene is generally found on the gene cassettes of inti1 chen and zhang 2013 hardwick et al 2008 the abundances of sul1 and inti1 at higher voltages 1 and 2 v were significantly higher than at 0 v p 0 05 this indicates that higher applied voltages could enhance the horizontal gene transfer of args to clarify the contribution of horizontal gene transfer to the arg variations a spearman correlation analysis between args and inti1 was performed table s2 significant correlations were found between args except flor and inti1 indicating that horizontal gene transfer was an important factor for the variations in args under different voltages three concentrations of cap 20 50 and 80 mg l were evaluated to determine the effect of cap concentrations on args fig 2b the abundances of args and inti1 at 80 mg l were significantly higher than at 20 mg l p 0 05 indicating that higher cap concentrations enhanced the proliferation of args as well as horizontal gene transfer as shown in table s2 significant correlations were found between args and inti1 indicating that horizontal gene transfer partly contributed to variations in args at different cap concentrations to further determine the metabolic performance at different voltages and cap concentrations in the system both the abundances and expressions of three anaerobic functional genes fthfs mcra and acas were investigated their functions are presented in section 2 4 and the results are shown in fig 3 the abundances and expression of the fthfs mcra and acas increased significantly with increasing applied voltage p 0 05 fig 3a and b indicating that higher voltages resulted in the proliferation of anaerobic functional genes the abundances and expression of the fthfs gene at 80 mg l were significantly higher than at 20 mg l p 0 05 fig 3c and d indicating that the higher cap concentration enhanced acetate production however the abundances and expressions of mcra and acas genes decreased significantly with increasing cap concentration p 0 05 this indicates that higher cap concentrations inhibited both methane production and acetoclastic methanogenesis 3 3 determination of functional bacteria the composition of the microbial community was determined through a genera level analysis as shown in fig 4 the applied voltage obviously altered the microbial community structure of particular note is the increase in the relative abundances of paludibacter acidovorax proteiniclasticm macellibacteroides sedimentibacter thauera shewanella comamonas and flavobacterium with increasing applied voltage the pollutant reduction related species fermentative related species and potential electroactive species are important for the stable operation of a high performance anaerobic system the fermentative related species paludibacter proteiniclasticm and macellibacteroides can degrade organic pollutants to smaller molecular compounds such as acetate which may enhance the acetate production in the system lawson et al 2014 qiu et al 2014 rout et al 2017 acidovorax sedimentibacter thauera and flavobacterium are able to catalyze the dechlorination process and can enhance cap reduction gu et al 2004 macy et al 1993 monferrán et al 2005 saber and crawford 1985 shewanella and comamonas have been reported as common electroactive species that facilitate electron transfer between a biocatalyst and an electrode liang et al 2014 marsili et al 2008 the cap concentration also altered the microbial community structure fig 4 the relative abundances of macellibacteroides shewanella comamonas sphingopyxis and flavobacterium increased as the cap concentration increased as mentioned above macellibacteroides is a fermentative related species rout et al 2017 shewanella and comamonas are electroactive species liang et al 2014 marsili et al 2008 sphingopyxis and flavobacterium can catalyze the dechlorination process and can enhance cap degradation godoy et al 2003 saber and crawford 1985 3 4 determination of functional bacteria carrying args as shown in fig 5 and 35 bacterial genera might be potential hosts of the args based on the spearman correlation between args and genera the potential hosts of args cmla flor tetc and sul1 under different voltages were paludibacter acidovorax proteiniclasticm macellibacteroides sedimentibacter thauera shewanella comamonas and flavobacterium the result indicated that the applied voltage enriched the fermentative related species paludibacter proteiniclasticm and macellibacteroides the pollutant reduction related species acidovorax sedimentibacter thauera and flavobacterium and potential electroactive species shewanella and comamonas carrying args figs 4 and 5 as shown in fig 6 potential hosts of args under different cap concentrations were macellibacteroides shewanella comamonas sphingopyxis and flavobacterium the results show that higher cap concentrations enriched the fermentative related species macellibacteroides the potential electroactive species shewanella and comamonas and the pollutant reduction related species sphingopyxis and flavobacterium carrying args figs 4 and 6 the changes in abundances of args are caused by this shift of hosts and by horizontal gene transfer of args jia et al 2015 su et al 2015 the results of the correlation analysis between args and inti1 microbial community indicated that both shift of hosts and horizontal gene transfer contributed to the abundances of args variations under different voltages and initial cap concentrations it is worth noting that the abundance of flor increased sharply at 2 v fig 2a this sharp increase of flor in comparison to other args might be because the potential hosts showed more extreme significant correlations with flor than other args acidovorax macellibacteroides and sedimentibacter which became more dominant at 2 v 4 discussion the selection of microorganisms by electrical stimulation was the key mechanism that enhanced the metabolic performance during electrically assisted anaerobic treatment of cap wastewater the electrical stimulation promoted the abundance of pollutant reduction related species fermentative related species and potential electroactive species fig 4 thus benefiting system performance jiang et al 2016 in addition the application of electrical stimulation enhanced the horizontal gene transfer of args fig 2 thus args spread among the dominant bacteria and functional bacteria acquired args the functional bacteria carrying args cmla flor and tetc could survive from the biotoxicity of cap by transporting antibiotics out of the cell and these were further enriched in the electrically assisted anaerobic system moreover more electrons were provided with the application of electrical stimulation for cap reduction which further reduced toxic stress on functional bacteria the enrichment of functional bacteria enhanced both cap removal and methane production in the electrically assisted anaerobic system the enhancement of the methane production at higher voltages 0 5 1 and 2 v fig 1 resulted from the enrichment of fermentative related species carrying args paludibacter proteiniclasticm and macellibacteroides figs 4 and 5 paludibacter proteiniclasticm and macellibacteroides can degrade organic pollutants to smaller molecular compounds such as acetate lawson et al 2014 qiu et al 2014 rout et al 2017 thus acetogenesis partly contributed to the enhanced acetate production at higher voltages the higher abundance of the fthfs gene fig 3a and b indicated homoacetogenesis as another contributor to the enhancement of acetate production under higher voltages which represents the capacity for acetate production through homoacetogenesis leaphart and lovell 2001 the increased abundance of the fthfs gene might be a result of the higher abundance of homoacetogen which was not dominant thus the acetoclastic methanogenesis process was enhanced it has been reported that acetotrophic methanogens play an extremely important role in methane production ince et al 2011 kim et al 2013 therefore improved acetoclastic methanogenesis partly enhanced methane production in the system in addition hydrogen accumulations were found in the system under higher applied voltage fig 1c and d hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis can be stimulated by the presence of hydrogen liu et al 2016 thus both acetoclastic methanogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis enhanced the methane production at higher applied voltage the higher abundances of anaerobic functional genes mcra and acas genes fig 3a and b further showed how the methane production was enhanced under higher voltages as described above this enhanced acetate production might significantly contribute to the proliferation of acetotrophic methanogens at higher voltage the acas gene is present in acetotrophic methanogens smith and ingram smith 2007 therefore the abundance of the acas gene sharply increased at higher voltage 2 v fig 3 since acetoclastic methanogenesis is an important part of the methane production an improvement of acetoclastic methanogenesis would have partly enhanced the proliferation of the mcra gene which represents methane production luton et al 2002 it should be noted that the methane production was low at the relative high cap concentration of 80 mg l despite the fermentative related species carrying args macellibacteroides being enriched figs 4 and 6 this was likely because the high antibiotic concentration prevented the methanogens from adapting and maintaining methane production aydin et al 2015a the lower abundances of acas and mcra genes under the same cap concentration 80 mg l further confirmed this assumption fig 3c and d the higher abundance of the fthfs gene indicated the higher acetate production under higher cap concentration fig 3c and d and 4 this was consistent with a previous study that indicated that higher antibiotic concentrations contribute to short chain fatty acid production in anaerobic system wang et al 2017 the enhanced cap removal at higher voltages 0 5 1 and 2 v fig 1 was attributed to the enrichment of pollutant reduction related species acidovorax sedimentibacter thauera and flavobacterium and potential electroactive species shewanella and comamonas carrying args figs 4 and 5 with the help of potentially electroactive species shewanella and comamonas pollutant reduction related species acidovorax sedimentibacter thauera and flavobacterium could gain electrons from an electrode to catalyze the cap reduction process the enrichment of pollutant reduction related species sphingopyxis and flavobacterium and potential electroactive species shewanella and comamonas carrying args contributed to an efficient cap removal even under higher cap concentrations 50 and 80 mg l figs 4 and 6 respectively and enhanced cap removal it is worth noting that the cap removal efficiency and methane production increased as voltage increased and the abundance of args also increased significantly as voltage increased fig 1a c and 2a the risk of transfer of high arg level to pathogenic bacteria should be avoided which threatens human health pruden et al 2006 though args could help functional bacteria to survive from toxicity of cap in this study therefore the optimization of operating conditions should be balanced based on both the enhancement of metabolic performance and the control of arg proliferation moreover the system showed more than 90 cap removal efficiency at 2 v applied voltage which is acceptable for high concentration cap wastewater treatment thus the experiments under a voltage higher than 2 v were not conducted which may further increase the abundance of args in the electrically assisted anaerobic system in addition to pollutant reduction related species fermentative related species and potential electroactive species other species may be involved in the stable performance of cap removal and methane production further studies are required to investigate specific functional bacteria and genes metagenomics can be used to acquire a deeper understanding of the functional bacteria and genes in the electrically assisted anaerobic system the functional bacteria carrying args were identified only based on correlation analysis which offers good potential further investigations on the identification of specific host bacteria are necessary for example specific antibiotic resistant functional bacteria in the system sludge could be isolated using plates that contain different antibiotics 5 conclusion in this study the selection of microorganisms by electrical stimulation was the key enhancement mechanism for the metabolic performance in an electrically assisted anaerobic system electrical stimulation selected the dominant functional bacteria pollutant reduction related species fermentative related species and potential electroactive species and increased the antibiotic resistance in dominant functional bacteria which survived from the toxicity of cap and enriched the further enrichment of functional bacteria enhanced both cap removal and methane production dechlorination related bacteria and potential electroactive bacteria carrying args contributed the improvement of cap removal enhanced methane production was attributed to the survival of fermentative related bacteria that have resistance to cap this study offers new insights into the mechanisms of metabolic performance enhancement during the electrically assisted anaerobic treatment

18903,we previously demonstrated the existence of naturalized strains of e coli in wastewater and herein perform an in depth comparative whole genome analysis of these strains n 17 fourteen of the canadian e coli strains isolated from geographically separated wastewater treatment plants were virtually identical at the core genome and were 96 similar at the whole genome level suggesting clonal relatedness among these isolates remarkably these strains were shown to be extremely similar to the genome of an e coli isolated from wastewater in switzerland suggesting a global distribution of

coli gi gastrointestinal u s epa united states environmental protection agency utis urinary tract infections upec urinary pathogenic e coli 1 introduction since its discovery in 1885 escherichia coli formerly known as bacillus coli has become the most studied microorganism in the world and this notoriety has led to an entrenchment of fundamental paradigms pertaining to the biology of this organism this is especially true in the field of environmental microbiology where e coli has held the preeminent status as being an important public health indicator of fecal pollution of water for over 120 years the use of e coli as a water quality indicator rests around two fundamental dogmas i that the microbe s primary niche is the gastrointestinal system of humans and animals and ii e coli represents a single species easily distinguished from other microbiota using selective media that targets specific biochemical nutritional requirements both of these long held paradigms are now under debate currently there are six recognized species in the genus escherichia including e coli e albertii e fergusonii e hermannii e vulneris and e marmotae but recent evidence suggests certain strains of e coli may actually represent unique species within the genus liu et al 2015 walk 2015 some studies propose that e hermannii and e vulneris be reclassified as species within two new genera known as pseudescherichia and atlantibacter respectively alnajar and gupta 2017 hata et al 2016 moreover in the last two decades a number of scientific studies have provided compelling evidence that some e coli strains appear to exist as naturalized populations in non host environments including water perchec merien and lewis 2013 soil ishii et al 2006 sand walk et al 2007 and most recently wastewater zhi et al 2016a walk et al 2009 reported that e coli strains inhabiting environmental niches appear to be genetically different from enteric strains and originally described these strains as cryptic or environmental clades cryptic strains do not appear to simply represent enteric populations of animal human strains adapted to survive outside the host but rather they appear to be self sustaining populations phenotypically adapted for survival growth and replication in non host environments luo et al 2011 walk 2015 walk et al 2009 environmental strains produce robust biofilms are able to grow at reduced temperatures 8 11 c and do not appear to colonize or become pathogenic in animal models ingle et al 2011 a comparative whole genome analysis of cryptic and enteric clades of e coli carried out by luo et al 2011 revealed evidence of genetic exchange of core genes between cryptic clades of e coli but not between cryptic clades and enteric clades suggesting a sexually conjugative barrier to direct gene flow a requisite in defining a species luo et al 2011 also used heat mapping to identify dominant functional gene sets in enteric and cryptic clades of e coli and reported numerous functional gene sets that were dominant in cryptic clades but not represented in enteric clades and vice versa conversely some studies have demonstrated that e coli cryptic clades may be of fecal origin i e birds blyton et al 2015 studies also suggest that genetically distinct strains of e coli appear to colonize different animal hosts or niches and therefore displaying some degree of host niche specificity or preference gomi et al 2014 zhi et al 2015 using whole genome analysis gomi et al 2014 identified a number of unique genes from various e coli strains isolated from different animals human pig cow and chicken that could be used to track sources of fecal pollution in water warish et al 2015 using logic regression analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms snps in the dna sequences of intergenic region itgr dna sequences zhi et al 2016b 2015 observed biomarker patterns that were highly specific to the animal host from which the e coli was isolated from 15 different animal hosts they also demonstrated that these host specific intergenic snp biomarker patterns paralleled natural selection pressures driving evolution of the species in these hosts zhi et al 2016b for example in human e coli strains highly host specific snp itgr biomarkers where found upstream of genes regulating antimicrobial resistance whereas those in cattle where involved in environmental survival and stress some of the recurring debate about whether e coli represents a genetically diverse species or a species complex relates to the fact that cryptic and enteric clades appear to be metabolically indistinguishable from each other based on their growth characteristics on traditional selective media or by complex carbon utilization profiling methods luo et al 2011 these phenotypic based culture systems target common metabolic pathways across the core genome of e coli but fail to reveal the complex genetic diversity associated with the pan genome of this organism the characterization of metabolic pathways has widely been used in diagnostic microbiology over the last 100 years to identify microbes but it is widely recognized that these criteria do not solely justify the designation of a true microbial species interestingly some studies suggest that the pan genome of e coli may be more important than the core genome in governing the phenotypic genotypic ecotypic barriers to intraspecies heritability luo et al 2011 our previous research identified and characterized the potential existence of naturalized strains of e coli in wastewater zhi et al 2016a these strains were readily distinguished from enteric e coli strains based on the presence of a distinct snp biomarker patterns in certain itgrs of the genome and b a unique genetic element known as the uspc is30 flhdc present in a sub population of naturalized wastewater strains seventeen of these naturalized wastewater e coli isolates collected from six geographically separated wastewater treatment plants in canada were genome sequenced and their genomes compared against enteric and cryptic clades as well as other wastewater derived e coli that were independently isolated and sequenced from wastewater in switzerland and the united states 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains in total 17 e coli strains originating from six geographically separated wastewater treatment plants in canada were sequenced in this study all strains were confirmed as e coli through culture based biochemical analysis using a vitek bacterial identification system biomerieux canada inc st laurent canada as a note wastewater strains were originally isolated from chlorine stressed sewage based on the u s environmental protection agency s alternate test procedure u s epa 2010 briefly sewage samples were exposed to chlorine doses causing a 99 99 reduction in viable e coli concentrations and the survivors isolated through selective enrichment consequently survivors represented the chlorine resistant population for which these 17 strains were selected for details on collection isolation and identification of these e coli strains see zhi et al 2016a all 17 strains possessed the snp itgr biomarkers characterizing these as naturalized wastewater strains of e coli as described by zhi et al 2016a and 14 of the 17 strains also possessed the wastewater e coli marker known as uspc is30 flhdc a list of all e coli strains used in the various analyses inclusive of all wastewater enteric and cryptic strains is provided in supplementary table s1 2 2 genome sequencing and assembly genomic dna gdna from approximately 2 1010 cells of each wastewater derived e coli isolate was purified using the blood and cell culture midi kit qiagen toronto canada as per the manufacturer s instructions one microgram of gdna from each strain was used to generate ion xpress barcoded libraries according to the manufacturer s protocols dna sequencing was performed on an ion torrent pgm thermo fisher mississauga canada using the hi q 400 bp sequencing technology on 316 sequencing chips as per the manufacturer s instructions the genomes were sequenced using an ion torrent pgm sequencing platform with ion pgm hi q view sequencing kit according to the manufacturer s instructions low quality reads of the raw genome sequence were trimmed using ngsshort version 2 2 chen et al 2014 and the lowest

analysis 2 3 comparative genomic analysis whole genome snp analysis was performed using realphy 1 12 bertels et al 2014 and the genome of e coli strain k12 mg1655 was used as a reference in addition to the 17 in house sequenced wastewater e coli genomes five human e coli genomes six cryptic e coli genomes represented by environmental clades i iv and also used by luo et al 2011 in their comparative genome analysis an e coli genome from an isolate obtained from wastewater in switzerland zurfluh et al 2017b and the genomes of two e coli isolates obtained from wastewater samples in u s were downloaded from ncbi were also included in this comparative genome analysis supplementary table s1 a spanning tree was then generated using phyloviz version 2 0 nascimento et al 2017 based on snp analysis of the core genome of these e coli strains final core genome size for comparative analysis among all strains was 2 354 938 bp whole genome phylogenetic analysis was also performed using realphy 1 12 bertels et al 2014 a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was generated and contained the seventeen wastewater e coli from canada six cryptic e coli as well as twenty seven e coli strains

and ww38 as well as three human strains h2 h3 h4 and h11 was constructed with cgview grant et al 2012 using a blast expect value of 0 001 the wastewater strain ww10 possessing the snp itgr wastewater biomarker and the uspc is30 flhdc marker was used as the reference strain in this analysis this analysis was done in order to identify conserved and highly polymorphic areas of the e coli genome among enteric and wastewater strains 2 4 identification of unique genes in naturalized wastewater e coli strains gegenees agren et al 2012 was used to identify unique genes in the seventeen wastewater marker positive e coli isolates as compared to e coli genomes from other animal sources including thirty e coli genomes from humans thirty five e coli genomes from bovines and twenty nine genomes from other animal sources supplementary table s1 fragment size was set to 500 bp for the gegenees analysis the identified wastewater e coli specific dna gene sequences were then annotated by the rast tool aziz et al 2008 brettin et al 2015 overbeek et al 2014 to verify the uniqueness of these annotated genes against a larger dataset presumptively unique dna sequences were blasted against the ncbi nucleotide database given that there was reasonable representation of dna sequence in the ncbi nucleotide database from e coli isolated from the environment and for which these isolates could come from either enteric i e human animal feces cryptic i e endogenous microbiota or wastewater strains i e wastewater effluents discharged into a river any unique genes were defined as those genes for which 10 sequences were retrieved by ncbi blast analysis 95 coverage and 90 identity and for which the source of isolation was from e coli but not specifically e coli isolated from wastewater supplementary table s2 likewise identified genes also had to fit the criteria of being present in all 17 wastewater strains in order for it be considered unique to wastewater isolates 2 5 comparative functional genomics analysis on wastewater cryptic and enteric e coli strains genome annotations were performed on five wastewater strains possessing the snp itgr biomarker and the uspc is30 flhdc marker six environmental and fourteen enteric e coli strains using the rast pipeline aziz et al 2008 brettin et al 2015 overbeek et al 2014 strains for this analysis are listed in supplementary table s1 the annotated gene for each strain was grouped into functional subsystem categories based on predicted gene functions the relative standard deviation rsd was calculated for number of genes represented in each sample for all functional subsystems the abundance of genes represented in subsystems that had 20 rsd were compared across all three groups of strains and plotted as a heatmap using r package pheatmap kolde 2015 2 6 antibiotic resistance gene and virulence gene characterization strains used for comparative antibiotic resistance analysis and virulence gene analysis are listed in supplementary table s1 the antibiotic resistance genes in e coli genomes were identified using the resistance gene identifier rgi of the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database card jia et al 2017 the identification of virulence genes was performed by doing a blast search of 2600 virulence factors in the core dataset of the virulence factor database vfdb chen et al 2016 against all wastewater e coli genomes the minimum query coverage was set to 80 with an e value of 10 12 2 7 phenotypic antibiotic resistance testing e coli isolates were screened for antibiotic susceptibility against a panel of 14 antibiotics using gram negative cmv3agnf sensititre panels thermo fisher scientific burlington on canada according to the manufacturers instructions results were interpreted based on the sensititre swin software system thermo fisher scientific burlington on canada and according to human breakpoints outlined within the clinical and laboratory standards institute clsi guidelines clsi 2017 3 results 3 1 genomic features of sequenced wastewater e coli strains the general descriptive genome features of all 17 naturalized wastewater strains of e coli are summarized in table 1 genome size ranged from 5 0 mbp to 5 3 mbp with an average g c content of 51 6 the mean number of putative coding genes within these naturalized wastewater e coli strains was determined to be approximately 4921 3 2 core genome similarity and phylogenetic analysis of wastewater e coli genome snp analysis was used to compare core genome similarity among various e coli strains wastewater enteric and cryptic environmental the results of which are represented as a spanning tree and maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree figs 1 and 2 in both analyses enteric strains clustered together as did cryptic strains and wastewater strains figs 1 and 2 of interest was the incredible degree of core genome similarity across many of the naturalized wastewater strains of e coli from canada fig 1 particularly among the 14 isolates that possessed the wastewater specific snp itgr biomarker and the uspc is30 flhdc marker described by zhi et al 2016a represented by grey in filled circles in fig 1 these strains differed from each other by only 16 snps on average across the entire core genome size of 2 354 938 bp this genetic similarity was remarkable since these fourteen canadian wastewater isolates were originally collected from six geographically separated wastewater treatment plants in canada the similarity in core genome sequence among this sub group of naturalized wastewater e coli strains was far greater than that observed for naturalized wastewater strains lacking the uspc is30 flhdc marker fig 1 black in filled circles or among human enteric e coli strains or cryptic e coli strains fig 2 and suggesting clonal relatedness among these 14 canadian strains to rule out the potential for laboratory contamination between samples we sequenced multiple e coli isolates collected from the same wastewater treatment plant isolates that were collected from the same treatment plant e g strains ww44 ww48 ww50 ww69 dark blue outlined circles in fig 1 and which possessed both wastewater markers had the greatest degree of similarity across their core genomes averaging only 6 snps across the core genome these data provided compelling evidence that an e coli clonal strain was widely disseminated among geographically separated wastewater treatment plants in canada an even more interesting finding was the notable similarity between the core genomes of these fourteen naturalized e coli wastewater strains in canada and a wastewater strain recently sequenced by zurfluh et al 2017b from switzerland fig 1 the swiss wastewater strain abwa45 clustered together with the fourteen naturalized wastewater strains from canada as determined by both spanning tree analysis of the core genome fig 1 and by maximum likelihood whole genome phylogenetic analysis fig 2 surprisingly the swiss strain varied from canadian strains by only 1680 snps across the entire core genome of 2 354 938 bp of dna fig 1 based on blastn analysis and logic regression snp analysis in relevant itgrs this swiss wastewater strain was also found to possess a the uspc is30 flhdc wastewater marker described by zhi et al 2016a and b the snp itgr wastewater biomarker described by zhi et al 2016a genetic elements previously shown to be common among naturalized wastewater strains from canada moreover all 14 canadian strains and the swiss wastewater strain were classified as sequence type st635 based on multilocus sequence typing mlst analysis three wastewater e coli strains from canada that possessed the wastewater specific snp itgr biomarker described by zhi et al 2016a but lacked the uspc is30 flhdc marker wastewater strains ww2 ww9 and ww38 black in filled circles in fig 1 were also whole genome sequenced genome sequences from these three canadians strains were shown to be very similar to two other e coli strains that were isolated from wastewater samples in the u s econih4 and econih5 fig 1 biomarker searching revealed that the u s strains also possessed the itgr snp wastewater specific biomarker described by zhi et al 2016a but lacked the uspc is30 flhdc marker similar to the three canadian strains genetic diversity was greater among these three canadian and two u s wastewater strains than what was observed among the fourteen canadian and one swiss strain described above fig 1 four of the five wastewater strains possessing the snp itgr biomarker 2 canadian ww2 ww9 and the 2 u s strains clustered with the 15 other wastewater strains possessing both markers 14 canadian and 1 swiss strain by maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis fig 2 suggesting a common genetic background to all naturalized wastewater strains on average genetic variability in the core genome between these four isolates canadian ww2 ww9 and u s econih4 and econih5 approximated 2000 snps these two canadian wastewater strains ww2 and ww9 along with two u s strains econih4 and econih5 were classified as st399 by mlst analysis one canadian wastewater strain ww38 was the only strain that clustered with enteric strains based on phylogenetic analysis fig 2 this strain was also shown to have the greatest genetic distance from the other wastewater strains possessing 17 000 snps across the core genome compared to its closest relative the u s wastewater strain econih4 fig 1 this canadian wastewater strain was classified as st216 by mlst analysis 3 3 whole genome similarity between wastewater human enteric and cryptic clades strains of e coli in order to better understand genetic relatedness at the whole genome level we performed a pairwise whole genome similarity comparison of wastewater human enteric and cryptic clades against a single reference wastewater strain ww63 table 2 all wastewater strains possessing the wastewater specific snp itgr biomarker and the uspc is30 flhdc marker were very similar to the ww63 strain with their pairwise genome similarity ranging from 92 7 abwa45 swiss strain to 99 2 ww601 canadian strain it is interesting to note that the highest pairwise similarity observed among all the wastewater strains was between the ww63 reference strain and another canadian wastewater strain ww601 but for which the latter strain was isolated from a different wastewater treatment plant than ww63 again emphasizing the apparent clonal similarity across these strains found in different wastewater treatment plants wastewater strains possessing the snp itrg biomarker but not the uspc is30 flhdc marker were less similar to the ww63 strain with their pairwise genome similarity ranging from 84 7 ww38 to 90 1 ww9 pairwise whole genome similarity between the ww63 wastewater reference strain to human enteric strains ranged from only 79 82 7 the genome of ww63 was most dissimilar to the cryptic clades with similarity ranging from only 59 2 77 3 although we originally hypothesized that these strains may be more closely related to the cryptic clades as a result of their preferred habitat being a non host environmental wastewater niche they were in fact most closely related to enteric phylogroup a strains of e coli fig 2 suggesting an evolutionary origin from enteric e coli based on traditional phylogrouping methods all canadian wastewater strains were previously shown to belong to phylogroup a zhi et al 2016a as well as the swiss zurfluh et al 2017b and u s strains but based on whole genome phylogenetic analysis wastewater strains swiss u s and canadian all except for ww38 formed a unique clade separate from the well known enteric phylogroups of e coli a b1 b2 d e fig 2 3 4 comparative functional genomics of e coli strains genome mapping was used to reveal areas of the whole genome that were subject to polymorphic variability across human enteric and wastewater strains of e coli and whether snps or large scale genomic addition deletions accounted for this variability genome mapping revealed a large degree of commonality among the genomes of wastewater and enteric strains fig 3 but for which the maps were punctuated with relatively large gaps of polymorphism suggesting that wastewater strains possessed a variety of unique or differentially abundant genes in their genomes compared to human enteric strains fig 3 and most likely acquired through gene deletion or acquisition e g horizontal gene transfer to further evaluate the significance of these findings gene occurrence abundance was evaluated using heat mapping of functional sub systems based on whole genome sequences annotated by rast and accompanied with a search for unique genes in wastewater e coli a total of 518 functional sub systems were analyzed and of these 155 sub system displayed 20 relative standard deviation rsd among strains and were subsequently plotted as a heatmap supplementary fig s1 heat mapping demonstrated that wastewater strains human strains and cryptic strains had high within group similarity in functional sub system profiles and formed separate phenotypic clusters supplementary fig s1 and for which the phenotypic clustering recapitulated the results of our phylogenetic analysis interestingly wastewater strains possessed functional biochemical sub system characteristic of both enteric and cryptic clades table 3 these data suggested that although wastewater isolates may be genetically more similar to enteric phylogroup a strains based on phylogenetic analysis they appear to have lost certain genetic elements common to enteric clades but acquired certain genes from cryptic clades that supported their evolution to become naturalized populations in wastewater notably wastewater strains had a high abundance of genes involved in pyrimidine utilization co enzyme b12 biosynthesis gmp synthase cinnamic acid degradation lysine degradation dioxygenases and phenylpropionate degradation biochemical features common with enteric clades table 3 conversely wastewater strains were more similar to environmental cryptic clades in terms of propanediol utilization and for which these genes were notably absent from enteric strains used in the analysis other sub system biochemical profiles that were similar to cryptic clades included those involved in biofilm adhesion p aminobenzoyl glutamate utilization and a diversity of hydroxyaromatic decarboxylases table 3 3 5 unique genes in wastewater e coli strains to further identify unique genes in wastewater strains compared to enteric clades we compared the seventeen genomes from wastewater strains to the genomes of a wider range of enteric e coli isolates 30 e coli isolates from humans 35 isolates from cattle and 29 isolates from other animal sources see supplementary table s1 this genomic comparison identified a total of 147 kb of dna sequence that were unique or over represented in naturalized e coli wastewater strains accounting for 177 coding sequences these putative unique or differentially abundant genes were subsequently blastn verified against ncbi nucleotide database and 163 genes were identified as truly unique to wastewater strains supplementary table s2 functional annotation of these coding sequences revealed that the vast majority of these sequences were hypothetical putative proteins with unknown functions and not previously identified in enteric or cryptic e coli implying potential horizontal gene acquisition from xenospecific bacteria supplementary table s2 as outlined in supplementary table s3 other unique enriched genes included those that encoded proteins related to mobile genetic elements transponson integron prophage or trna genes i e that act as insertion sites for mobile genetic elements in addition several genes for toxin antitoxin systems were identified through comparative genome searches suggesting a mechanism by which these strains may outcompete other conspecific strains in a wastewater matrix toxin antitoxin genes in wastewater strains included cbta cbea and yfjz for which the cbta and cbea genes code for proteins of the cbta cbea toxin antitoxin system respectively and with yfjz encoding the antitoxin of the ypjf yfjz toxin antitoxin system toxin antitoxin systems are known to be important in the e coli sos stress response for environmental survival berghoff and wagner 2017 brown and shaw 2003 harms et al 2016 other differentially enriched genes in naturalized wastewater strains included those encoding type i and type iii restriction modification systems i e ability to recognize and cleave foreign dna other functionally annotated genes enriched in the naturalized wastewater e coli strains included those important in dna repair protein turnover and stress responses including radc dna repair protein glutathione s transferase oxidative stress cora magnesium and cobalt transport protein methyl accepting chemotaxis protein involved as sensing system for nutrients or toxins in the environment threonine dehydratase endoribonuclease l psp family protein oxidoreductase methionine sulfoxide reductase quinone oxidoreductase and serine threonine protein phosphatase the dominance of stress related genes in naturalized wastewater strains as compared to enteric clades recapitulated the need for these strains to evolve strategies against water treatment for survival in this harsh ecosystem 3 6 antibiotic resistance genes and profiles of wastewater e coli strains given the evidence that all wastewater strains shared a common genetic background and that they appeared to share similar phenotypic properties reflective of ecotype challenges we sought to evaluate other potential indicators of phenotypic genetic diversity in these strains and therefore examined the genomes for the presence of putative antibiotic resistance genes as well as virulence genes wastewater strains were shown to possess a plethora of antibiotic resistance genes supplementary table s4 antibiotic resistance gene composition was extremely similar across all canadian swiss and u s strains supplementary table s4 providing further evidence of genotypic phenotypic commonality among all globally distributed naturalized wastewater strains many of the antibiotic resistance genes found in wastewater strains were also highly represented in the cryptic clades supplementary table s4 suggesting that these genes may be important for non host environmental persistence and survival it is interesting to note that many of the antibiotic resistance genes identified were efflux pumps known to be important in transport of a variety of hydrophilic molecules and not just antibiotics blanco et al 2016 although wastewater isolates were shown to possess an abundance of antibiotic resistance genes most of the isolates were deemed to be phenotypically susceptible to all antibiotics tested in a narms panel based on mic clinical breakpoints supplementary table s5 only 3 of the 12 naturalized canadian wastewater isolates tested 25 were shown to be resistant and these three isolates were all resistant to nalidixic acid at human clinical breakpoints supplementary table s5 interestingly these three strains were isolated from different wastewater treatment plants in canada suggesting the possibility of independent acquisition of genetic mutations among these clonal isolates to drive phenotypic resistance a number of ar genes identified in these strains which were not efflux pumps imparted resistance to peptide antibiotics but unfortunately peptide antibiotics were not included in the susceptibility panel tested in addition the ampc β lactamase gene was ubiquitous in all wastewater isolates but did not confer clinical cephalosporin resistance 3 7 virulence genes in wastewater e coli strains the composition of virulence genes among all wastewater isolates canadian swiss and u s strains was also remarkably similar supplementary table s6 with an abundant representation of virulence genes commonly associated with urinary pathogenic e coli upec table 4 dominant upec virulence genes that were found in all naturalized wastewater e coli included those associated with iron acquisition such as a the ferrienterobactin multi enzyme sythetase complex and transport system fepa fepb fepc fepd fepg and enta entb entc entd ente entf ents b upec fimbrial genes fima fimb fimc fimd fime fimf fimg fimh fimi c curli virulence gene csgb d the outer membrane protein ompa and e the flagellar biosynthesis protein flha table 4 wastewater strains from the u s econih4 and econih5 as well as one wastewater strain from canada ww2 also possessed the upec virulence genes associated with the yersiniabactin siderophore biosynthetic pathway and receptor transport system ybta ybte ybtp ybtq ybts ybtt ybtu and ybtx as well as fyua and irp1 2 table 4 although wastewater strains possessed a wide array of upec related genes phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that wastewater strains clustered separately from human upec strains with human upec reference strains uti89 cft073 and 536 phylogenetically clustering with human enteric strains of the b2 phylogroup fig 2 interestingly many of the upec related virulence genes found in wastewater strains were also observed in the environmental cryptic clades supplementary table s6 suggesting that these upec related virulence genes may provide an adaptive evolutionary advantage for survival in extra intestinal niches including non host environmental niches notably wastewater strains from canada switzerland and the u s also possessed an array of virulence genes commonly associated with enterohemorrhagic e coli ehec virulence genes not found in the human reference upec isolates uti89 cft073 and 536 or in the majority of the cryptic strains supplementary table s6 these ehec related virulence genes included effector protein genes associated with the type iii secretory system located on the locus of enterocyte effacement lee espl espr1 espr 3 espr 4 espx1 espx 4 and espx 5 4 discussion defining a microbial species is a contentious debate among microbial taxonomists largely due to our lack of understanding about the interaction between genotype phenotype and ecotype diversity at the microbial level recently we developed novel dna sequence based logic regression biomarker discovery tools aimed at revealing genotype phenotype ecotype interactions to better understand population diversity in e coli zhi et al 2015 2016a 2016b using this biomarker discovery approach we identified naturalized e coli specialists in wastewater zhi et al 2016a these wastewater strains were shown to carry a unique snp itgr biomarker not seen in enteric strains or cryptic clades of e coli and for which a sub population of these strains also carried a pcr marker known as the uspc is30 flhdc element zhi et al 2016a herein we demonstrate an incredible level of genomic homogeneity among these chlorine resistant wastewater e coli isolates found in wastewater from canada switzerland and the u s suggestive of a common genetic background lineage among these naturalized strains moreover a sub population of these specialists were clonally related possessing the uspc is30 flhdc element in addition to the snp itgr biomarker and represented by fourteen canadian strains isolated from six different wastewater treatment plants in canada and a strain isolated from wastewater in switzerland and sequenced by zurfluh et al 2017b this finding is intriguing and we provide some hypotheses to potentially explain this phenomenon and reflect on the public health significance of our findings it could be argued that these naturalized wastewater strains may actually represent extremely rare enteric strains adapted to survive in the harsh conditions of a wastewater treatment plant but for which these strains ultimately rely on transmission back into the gut of a human or animal host for growth and subsequent dissemination however several observations challenge this hypothesis to date we have only ever found the wastewater specific snp itgr biomarker and uspc is30 flhdc element in e coli isolated from wastewater furthermore it seems beyond coincidence that among the vast genomic databases that do exist for enteric e coli 10 000 genomes as of may 2018 that the only other strains that possess these markers come from e coli isolates originating from wastewater in switzerland and the u s additionally it seems beyond coincidence that these wastewater strains obtained in different countries and isolated and sequenced in different laboratories and with different sequencing technologies would possess such remarkable genetic relatedness at the core genome whole genome and functional genome levels our current evidence suggests that these strains are genetically phenotypically and ecotypically distinct from enteric e coli strains their remarkable genome similarity supports a clonal expansion theory of emergence under this theory natural selection may have drove the evolution of a phylogroup a enteric strain to develop a stress resistance phenotype in order to survive wastewater treatment potentially acquiring elements of cryptic clades to support their survival in the non host environment this emergent strain dispersed geographically to colonize other wastewater treatment plant ecosystems this hypothesis is supported by our phylogenetic and pairwise whole genome similarity analysis which demonstrated that although wastewater strains were most closely related to enteric phylogroup a strains fig 2 they only shared 80 similarity at the whole genome level with enteric clades and only 64 similarity to cryptic clades but possessed up to 99 2 similarity with other wastewater isolates obtained from different wastewater treatment plants compare strains ww63 and ww601 table 2 the clonal expansion theory provides a compelling explanation for the similar genetic background observed among all wastewater strains in canada switzerland and the u s and helps explain the conservation of the snp itgr biomarker across all wastewater specialists and the occurrence of the uspc is30 flhdc element among some of these wastewater clonal specialists dissemination of these wastewater strains may be facilitated by the common practice of discharging of wastewater effluents back into natural water bodies i e rivers streams lakes oceans allowing these highly adapted environmentally resilient strains to disseminate through interconnected watersheds and hydrological pathways mechanical vectors i e aquatic birds insects aquatic mammals could have also facilitated the transport of these resilient strains into new environments once introduced naturalized wastewater strains would grow endogenously in the wastewater ecosystem in support of the clonal expansion theory our previous work has demonstrated that these wastewater strains appear to have better survival characteristics against wastewater treatment compared to enteric strains e g chlorine tolerant these wastewater strains were originally isolated from raw sewage treated with a chlorine concentration sufficient in killing 99 99 of all e coli in the samples i e 4 log10 treatment reduction u s epa 2010 consequently these naturalized wastewater strains represented the survivor or persister population after chlorination zhi et al 2016a we have some evidence to suggest that the uspc is30 flhdc marker may provide a phenotypic advantage to survival of these e coli specialists in wastewater the is30 transposon upregulates expression in flanking genes barker et al 2004 and we have recently shown that the flhdc gene a regulator of flagellar synthesis is upregulated by chlorine treatment in these wastewater strains zhi et al 2017 in turn flagellar synthesis is important for biofilm formation an important bacterial survival strategy against chlorination ryu and beuchat 2005 and for which we have demonstrated that these wastewater specialists are significantly more robust at producing biofilms compared enteric strains zhi et al 2017 likewise the uspc gene a member of the universal stress protein family specifically involved in uv resistance gustavsson et al 2002 is the other flanking gene of the is30 element in wastewater isolates uv irradiation is a common wastewater treatment strategy and preliminary data in our laboratory suggests that these strains display a resistance phenotype to uv leading to a hypothesis that the is30 element may upregulate uspc expression in naturalized wastewater strains to enhance their chances of survival against uv treatment the hybrid like phenotypic nature of these wastewater strains i e possessing characteristics of both enteric and cryptic clades is also interesting in terms of understanding natural selection pressures that may have driven evolutionary adaption in a wastewater ecosystem wastewater clades were shown to share many functional biochemical subsystems with the enteric clade and cryptic clades potentially facilitating their adaptation to survival and growth outside the host unique gene searching also revealed adaptive genotypes based on the over representation of many stress adaptive genes in wastewater strains examples of which include a toxin antitoxin ta systems important in regulating nutritional starvation and intra species competition in environments with limited resources

integration of genomic islands among bacteria peters et al 2014 collectively wastewater strains possessed an array of unique and differentially abundant gene elements that may be reflective of the evolutionary pressures associated with survival in this harsh human engineered treatment intense environment naturalized wastewater strains as well as cryptic clades of e coli were shown to possess an array of upec related virulence genes i e up to 36 genes implying that although these genes may be important for uropathogen survival they may be equally important for naturalized and cryptic strains to survive in non host environmental niches many of the well characterized upec virulence genes represent adaptations for survival in the nutrient deprived and osmotically hydrologically stressed environment of the urinary tract i e low solutes and repetitive flushing mann et al 2017 for example human upec strains have a predominance of iron sequestering virulence genes e g ferribactin yersinabactin enterobactin related genes and transport pathways to enhance their survival in iron deficient urine terlizzi et al 2017 wastewater and cryptic clades also possess these iron sequestering virulence factors likely due to the fact that they face similar iron acquisition challenges in aquatic environments and that could explain the evolutionary conservation of these upec related virulence genes as a broad based strategy for survival in extra intestinal niches interestingly recent research has demonstrated that upec strains are common in wastewater effluents adefisoye and okoh 2016 anastasi et al 2010 boczek et al 2007 calhau et al 2015 anastasi et al 2010 identified potential upec in wastewater effluents based on the presence of the virulence genes papa h pape f papc hlya cnf1 and iron in e coli isolates collected from wastewater and none of the canadian swiss and u s wastewater isolates examined in our study possessed these upec virulence genes likewise calhau et al 2015 identified upec in wastewater effluents based on the presence of the virulence genes iuta papa h and sfa and similarly these genes were not found in any of the naturalized wastewater isolates in our study at present we do not believe that naturalized wastewater strains of e coli are actual uropathogens of humans and animals since upec reference strains uti89 cft073 and 536 clustered with human enteric strains and were phylogenetically distal to wastewater clades however our data provides compelling evidence that the conservation of many upec related virulence genes among cryptic wastewater and clinical upec may help explain their collective ability to survive in extra intestinal niches and perhaps why upec pathotypes like wastewater clades appear to be both environmentally resilient and water treatment resistant and therefore differentially survive the wastewater treatment process adefisoye and okoh 2016 anastasi et al 2010 boczek et al 2007 calhau et al 2015 naturalized wastewater strains of e coli were also shown to possess a number of virulence genes common with diarrheagenic ehec ipec e g e coli o157 most notably effectors of the type iii secretory system located on the lee espl espr1 espr 3 espr 4 espx1 espx 4 and espx 5 the lee is a major chromosomal pathogenicity island in ehec strains but importantly it is not found in upec strains the fact that naturalized wastewater strains possess virulence genes common to both upec and ehec and that these genes are not shared between these enteric pathotypes provides compelling evidence of the potential horizontal transfer of pathogenicity islands and virulence genes among naturalized wastewater strains and various e coli pathotypes upec and ehec ex vivo enterohemorrhagic e coli ehec and other intestinal pathogenic e coli ipec have also been shown to be routinely detected in treated wastewater effluents ayaz et al 2014 muniesa et al 2006 suggesting that some ehec strains may have already developed some resistance to wastewater treatment processes relatedly our data provides evidence to suggest that antibiotic resistance genes may also be exchanged among naturalized and enteric strains for example the swiss wastewater strain sequenced by zurfluh et al 2017b was shown to possess the plasmid encoded 16s rrna methyltransferase gene rmtb responsible for carbapenem resistance as well as the β lactamase gene bla tem 1b genes commonly found in extended spectrum β lactamase esbl clinical isolates of e coli conversely canadian wastewater strains did not possess these ar elements it is important to note however that the swiss strain was directly isolated from hospital wastewater whereas the canadian strains were isolated from municipal wastewater i e hospital wastewater diluted in the bulk sewage flows of an entire urban municipality acquisition of diverse ar resistance elements within the naturalized wastewater lineages may depend on the concentrations of antibiotic residues within the wastewater matrix driving endogenous resistance i e antibiotic residues in untreated hospital wastewater are much greater than those typically seen in municipal wastewater karthikeyan and meyer 2006 and or the ar gene diversity from enteric clinically relevant e coli populations entering a wastewater plant that are horizontally exchanged with wastewater clades furthermore zurfluh et al 2017a showed that these carbapenam and β lactam resistant e coli appear to differentially survive the wastewater treatment process raising further concerns about the emergence of antibiotic resistance among water treatment resistant pathotypes several studies have revealed a link between antibiotic resistance and water treatment resistance huang et al 2013 demonstrated a phenotypic relationship between chlorine resistance and tetracycline resistance suggesting that chlorine treatment may increase the risk of selection of e coli isolates highly resistant to tetracycline additionally liu et al 2018 demonstrated that urban wastewater treated with chlorine dioxide resulted in the selection of macrolide ermb tetracycline teta tetb and tetc sulfonamide sul1 sul2 and sul3 β lactam ampc aminoglycoside aph 2 id rifampicin katg and vancomycin vana resistance genes in treated wastewater effluent samples interestingly the naturalized wastewater strains in our study possessed three of the ar selected genes reported from liu et al 2018 ermb ampc and sul1 demonstrating that these strains may contribute to the ar resistome of wastewater and may provide a selective advantage to survival in a wastewater matrix wastewater strains of e coli were shown to carry a plethora of common antibiotic resistance genes many of which were shared with cryptic clades re emphasizing the point that these ar genes may provide an ecologically adaptive strategy for survival in the non host environment interestingly canadian wastewater isolates were shown to be susceptible at clinical breakpoints to most of the antibiotics tested albeit for three canadian isolates resistant to nalidixic acid it is increasingly evident that genotype does not always relay a resistance phenotype a recent review by hughes and anderson hughes and andersson 2017 discuss the potential mechanisms for environmental and genetic modulation of phenotypic resistance that relate to biofilms altered growth states and a variety of other possible factors nevertheless the abundance of ar genes in wastewater strains is cause for concern for several reasons wastewater isolates may represent important and persistent reservoirs of ar gene exchange with enteric clades for example the three canadian wastewater strains resistant to nalidixic acid originated from three different wastewater treatment plants yet all isolates possessed the serine leucine mutation at position 83 of the gyra gene known to impart resistance to nalidixic acid but for which they retain their sensitivity to ciprofloxacin saenz et al 2003 the swiss wastewater strain abwa45 and one u s wastewater strain econih5 also possessed this mutation in the chromosome various mutations within the gyra gene have been mapped to quinolone resistance some of which convey resistance to nalidixic acid and some of which provide resistance to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin saenz et al 2003 so it seems odd as to why wastewater strains distributed globally would retain this particular mutation and not others it is also noteworthy that the u s wastewater strains possessed the qnra1 gene a plasmid mediated determinant of nalidixic acid resistance redgrave et al 2014 indicating that a potentially strong selection pressure exists in wastewater similar to pressures in the gut to maintain this nalidixic acid resistant phenotype this data along with that of zurfluh et al 2017b regarding plasmid encoded carbapenem and β lactam resistance in the swiss wastewater strain suggests that naturalized wastewater strains are competent for both the uptake and retention of mobile genetic ar elements from enteric clades wastewater may also act as an amplification matrix for ar genes through endogenous growth and replication of naturalized wastewater strains through endogenous amplification ar gene elements may be transferred to other enteric or cryptic clades horizontal gene transfer of ar determinants from wastewater microbes to environmental microbes has been previously demonstrated karkman et al 2018 marcinek et al 1998 collectively our data raises the public health specter that wastewater treatment may actually drive the evolution of water treatment resistant and antibiotic resistant phenotypes pathotypes of e coli the public health concerns are compounded by the problem that many of the disinfection strategies used for pathogen reduction in wastewater i e chlorination uv treatment ozone are similar to the treatment strategies used for drinking water production thus the selection of treatment resistant pathotypes in wastewater effluents could potentially affect disinfection efficacy in downstream drinking water systems due to de facto reuse of wastewater across north america and globally for example it has been estimated that 50 of drinking water treatment plants in the u s are impacted by wastewater effluents and in some cases wastewater discharge can account for up to 50 of instream flow volumes in source water systems rice and westerhoff 2015 2017 adaptive strategies to climate change such as severe droughts have also forced societies to consider wastewater as an important alternative water resource for drinking water and irrigation of food crops unfortunately virtually all microbial risk assessments performed to date ignore the potential for evolved treatment resistance in a microbial species favoring an approach focused on reference surrogates for example giardia spp are widely used as the reference microbe for deriving chlorine treatment criteria for drinking water systems health canada 2012a and adenoviruses are widely used as reference microbes for deriving uv treatment criteria health canada 2011 it is widely accepted that e coli is relatively easy to inactivate by traditional treatment processes chlorine uv advanced oxidation however our data suggests that a considerable level of treatment resistance can evolve in e coli populations raising questions as to just how resistant these strains can become to conventional water treatment processes in fact within any given microbial population there exists a highly resistant sub population known as persisters harms et al 2016 and for which these sub populations contribute to the evolution of resistance in the species as mentioned previously our naturalized wastewater strains were originally isolated from raw sewage treated with a dose of chlorine yielding a 99 99 reduction in endogenous e coli levels consequently resistance to chlorine in the e coli population in wastewater may vary by more than 4 orders of magnitude i e 10 000 times by comparison laboratory strains of e coli that are commonly used in disinfection studies are susceptible to chlorine and are typically 100 1000 times less resistant to chlorine than giardia health canada 2012b in eloquent studies done by alcantara diaz et al 2004 a parental laboratory strain of e coli was exposed to increasing doses of uv c irradiation over 80 iterative exposure growth cycles and evolved daughter strains were shown to be 100 000 times more resistant to uv irradiation than the parent strain this study demonstrated the enormous plasticity of mutational adaptation in a single strain of e coli against uv c i e vertical gene transmission and does not encompass the horizontal gene transfer potential associated with diverse mechanisms of uv resistance that exist in the microbial world as such naturalized wastewater strains of e coli may represent a persister population ensuring species continuance under the intense selection pressures posed by wastewater engineered environments we posit that analogous to the global threat of antibiotic resistance there is evidence to suggest that microbes may be evolving resistance to water treatment safe drinking water and sanitation represent the greatest human advancements for control of infectious disease and consequently any breach in these fundamental public health interventions should cause concern among the scientific community we strongly believe this to be a critical area of future scientific research 5 conclusion our data suggests that certain strains of e coli have evolved to become naturalized populations within a wastewater environment adopting a lifestyle of survival growth and replication in a non animal host niche these strains share a common genetic background and a sub population of these strains appear to be clonal in nature these strains are globally distributed and can be found in wastewater treatment plants in canada the u s and switzerland they possess properties of chlorine resistance and genetic analysis demonstrated that they possess an over abundance of stress related genes within their genomes an adaptation that likely enhances their survival during wastewater treatment naturalized wastewater strains possessed an array of upec related virulence genes as well as ehec genes suggesting that like upec they may be important for survival in an extraintestinal environment naturalized strains also possessed a wide array of antibiotic resistance genes the repertoire of virulence and antibiotic genes suggests that these strains may readily exchange genes with cryptic and enteric lineages of e coli the ability to exchange virulence antibiotic and stress related genes with enteric clades raises major concerns about the emergence of water treatment resistant e coli pathotypes in the water and wastewater industry research data the genomes of wastewater e coli strains sequenced by this study were deposited in ncbi and

18903,we previously demonstrated the existence of naturalized strains of e coli in wastewater and herein perform an in depth comparative whole genome analysis of these strains n 17 fourteen of the canadian e coli strains isolated from geographically separated wastewater treatment plants were virtually identical at the core genome and were 96 similar at the whole genome level suggesting clonal relatedness among these isolates remarkably these strains were shown to be extremely similar to the genome of an e coli isolated from wastewater in switzerland suggesting a global distribution of these strains the genomes of three other canadian wastewater strains were more diverse but very similar to the genomes of e coli isolates collected from u s wastewater samples based on maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis wastewater strains from canada the u s and switzerland formed a clade separate from other known enteric phylogroups i e a b1 b2 d e and the cryptic clades all canadian swiss and u s wastewater strains possessed a common snp biomarker pattern across their genomes and a sub population i e 14 canadian and 1 swiss strain also possessed a previously identified wastewater

and cryptic clades wastewater strains were enriched for stress response genes i e nutrient acquisition deprivation dna repair oxidative stress and uv resistance elements reflective of their environmental survival challenges wastewater strains were shown to carry a plethora of known antibiotic resistance ar genes the patterns of which were remarkably similar among all canadian u s and swiss wastewater strains virulence gene composition was also similar among all the wastewater strains with an abundant representation of virulence genes commonly associated with urinary pathogenic e coli upec as well as enterohemorrhagic ehec e coli the remarkable degree of similarity between all wastewater strains from canada switzerland and the u s suggests the evolution and global

formerly known as bacillus coli has become the most studied microorganism in the world and this notoriety has led to an entrenchment of fundamental paradigms pertaining to the biology of this organism this is especially true in the field of environmental microbiology where e coli has held the preeminent status as being an important public health indicator of fecal pollution of water for over 120 years the use of e coli as a water quality indicator rests around two fundamental dogmas i that the microbe s primary niche is the gastrointestinal system of humans and animals and ii e coli represents a single species easily distinguished from other microbiota using selective media that targets specific biochemical nutritional requirements both of these long held paradigms are now under debate currently there are six recognized species in the genus escherichia including e coli e albertii e fergusonii e hermannii e vulneris and e marmotae but recent evidence suggests certain strains of e coli may actually represent unique species within the genus liu et al 2015 walk 2015 some studies propose that e hermannii and e vulneris be reclassified as species within two new genera known as pseudescherichia and atlantibacter respectively alnajar and gupta 2017 hata et al 2016 moreover in the last two decades a number of scientific studies have provided compelling evidence that some e coli strains appear to exist as naturalized populations in non host environments including water perchec merien and lewis 2013 soil ishii et al 2006 sand walk et al 2007 and most recently wastewater zhi et al 2016a walk et al 2009 reported that e coli strains inhabiting environmental niches appear to be genetically different from enteric strains and originally described these strains as cryptic or environmental clades cryptic strains do not appear to simply represent enteric populations of animal human strains adapted to survive outside the host but rather they appear to be self sustaining populations phenotypically adapted for survival growth and replication in non host environments luo et al 2011 walk 2015 walk et al 2009 environmental strains produce robust biofilms are able to grow at reduced temperatures 8 11 c and do not appear to colonize or become pathogenic in animal models ingle et al 2011 a comparative whole genome analysis of cryptic and enteric clades of e coli carried out by luo et al 2011 revealed evidence of genetic exchange of core genes between cryptic clades of e coli but not between cryptic clades and enteric clades suggesting a sexually conjugative barrier to direct gene flow a requisite in defining a species luo et al 2011 also used heat mapping to identify dominant functional gene sets in enteric and cryptic clades of e coli and reported numerous functional gene sets that were dominant in cryptic clades but not represented in enteric clades and vice versa conversely some studies have demonstrated that e coli cryptic clades may be of fecal origin i e birds blyton et al 2015 studies also suggest that genetically distinct strains of e coli appear to colonize different animal hosts or niches and therefore displaying some degree of host niche specificity or preference gomi et al 2014 zhi et al 2015 using whole genome analysis gomi et al 2014 identified a number of unique genes from various e coli strains isolated from different animals human pig cow and chicken that could be used to track sources of fecal pollution in water warish et al 2015 using logic regression analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms snps in the dna sequences of intergenic region itgr dna sequences zhi et al 2016b 2015 observed biomarker patterns that were highly specific to the animal host from which the e coli was isolated from 15 different animal hosts they also demonstrated that these host specific intergenic snp biomarker patterns paralleled natural selection pressures driving evolution of the species in these hosts zhi et al 2016b for example in human e coli strains highly host specific snp itgr biomarkers where found upstream of genes regulating antimicrobial resistance whereas those in cattle where involved in environmental survival and stress some of the recurring debate about whether e coli represents a genetically diverse species or a species complex relates to the fact that cryptic and enteric clades appear to be metabolically indistinguishable from each other based on their growth characteristics on traditional selective media or by complex carbon utilization profiling methods luo et al 2011 these phenotypic based culture systems target common metabolic pathways across the core genome of e coli but fail to reveal the complex genetic diversity associated with the pan genome of this organism the characterization of metabolic pathways has widely been used in diagnostic microbiology over the last 100 years to identify microbes but it is widely recognized that these criteria do not solely justify the designation of a true microbial species interestingly some studies suggest that the pan genome of e coli may be more important than the core genome in governing the phenotypic genotypic ecotypic barriers to intraspecies heritability luo et al 2011 our previous research identified and characterized the potential existence of naturalized strains of e coli in wastewater zhi et al 2016a these strains were readily distinguished from enteric e coli strains based on the presence of a distinct snp biomarker patterns in certain itgrs of the genome and b a unique genetic element known as the uspc is30 flhdc present in a sub population of naturalized wastewater strains seventeen of these naturalized wastewater e coli isolates collected from six geographically separated wastewater treatment plants in canada were genome sequenced and their genomes compared against enteric and cryptic clades as well as other wastewater derived e coli that were independently isolated and sequenced from wastewater in switzerland and the united states 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains in total 17 e coli strains originating from six geographically separated wastewater treatment plants in canada were sequenced in this study all strains were confirmed as e coli through culture based biochemical analysis using a vitek bacterial identification system biomerieux canada inc st laurent canada as a note wastewater strains were originally isolated from chlorine stressed sewage based on the u s environmental protection agency s alternate test procedure u s epa 2010 briefly sewage samples were exposed to chlorine doses causing a 99 99 reduction in viable e coli concentrations and the survivors isolated through selective enrichment consequently survivors represented the chlorine resistant population for which these 17 strains were selected for details on collection isolation and identification of these e coli strains see zhi et al 2016a all 17 strains possessed the snp itgr biomarkers characterizing these as naturalized wastewater strains of e coli as described by zhi et al 2016a and 14 of the 17 strains also possessed the wastewater e coli marker known as uspc is30 flhdc a list of all e coli strains used in the various analyses inclusive of all wastewater enteric and cryptic strains is provided in supplementary table s1 2 2 genome sequencing and assembly genomic dna gdna from approximately 2 1010 cells of each wastewater derived e coli isolate was purified using the blood and cell culture midi kit qiagen toronto canada as per the manufacturer s instructions one microgram of gdna from each strain was used to generate ion xpress barcoded libraries according to the manufacturer s protocols dna sequencing was performed on an ion torrent pgm thermo fisher mississauga canada using the hi q 400 bp sequencing technology on 316 sequencing chips as per the manufacturer s instructions the genomes were sequenced using an ion torrent pgm sequencing platform

to the 17 in house sequenced wastewater e coli genomes five human e coli genomes six cryptic e coli genomes represented by environmental clades i iv and also used by luo et al 2011 in their comparative genome analysis an e coli genome from an isolate obtained from wastewater in switzerland zurfluh et al 2017b and the genomes of two e coli isolates obtained from wastewater samples in u s were downloaded from ncbi were also included in this comparative genome analysis supplementary table s1 a spanning tree was then generated using phyloviz version 2 0 nascimento et al 2017 based on snp analysis of the core genome of these e coli strains final core genome size for comparative analysis among all strains was 2 354 938 bp whole genome phylogenetic analysis was also performed using realphy 1 12 bertels et al 2014 a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was generated and contained the seventeen wastewater e coli from canada six cryptic e coli as well as twenty seven e coli strains

biomarker and the uspc is30 flhdc marker was used as the reference strain in this analysis this analysis was done in order to identify conserved and highly polymorphic areas of the e coli genome among enteric and wastewater strains 2 4 identification of unique genes in naturalized wastewater e coli strains gegenees agren et al 2012 was used to identify unique genes in the seventeen wastewater marker positive e coli isolates as compared to e coli genomes from other animal sources including thirty e coli genomes from humans thirty five e coli genomes from bovines and twenty nine genomes from other animal sources supplementary table s1 fragment size was set to 500 bp for the gegenees analysis the identified wastewater e coli specific dna gene sequences were then annotated by the rast tool aziz et al 2008 brettin et al 2015 overbeek et al 2014 to verify the uniqueness of these annotated genes against a larger dataset presumptively unique dna sequences were blasted against the ncbi nucleotide database given that there was reasonable representation of dna sequence in the ncbi nucleotide database from e coli isolated from the environment and for which these isolates could come from either enteric i e human animal feces cryptic i e endogenous microbiota or wastewater strains i e wastewater effluents discharged into a river any unique genes were defined as those genes for which 10 sequences were retrieved by ncbi blast analysis 95 coverage and 90 identity and for which the source of isolation was from e coli but not specifically e coli isolated from wastewater supplementary table s2 likewise identified genes also had to fit the criteria of being present in all 17 wastewater strains in order for it be considered unique to wastewater isolates 2 5 comparative functional genomics analysis on wastewater cryptic and enteric e coli strains genome annotations were performed on five wastewater strains possessing the snp itgr biomarker and the uspc is30 flhdc marker six environmental and fourteen enteric e coli strains using the rast pipeline aziz et al 2008 brettin et al 2015 overbeek et al 2014 strains for this analysis are listed in supplementary table s1 the annotated gene for each strain was grouped into functional subsystem categories based on predicted gene functions the relative standard deviation rsd was calculated for number of genes represented in each sample for all functional subsystems the abundance of genes represented in subsystems that had 20 rsd were compared across all three groups of strains and plotted as a heatmap

listed in supplementary table s1 the antibiotic resistance genes in e coli genomes were identified using the resistance gene identifier rgi of the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database card jia et al 2017 the identification of virulence genes was performed by doing a blast search of 2600 virulence factors in the core dataset of the virulence factor database vfdb chen et al 2016 against all wastewater e coli genomes the minimum query coverage was set to 80 with an e value of 10 12 2 7 phenotypic antibiotic resistance testing e coli isolates were screened for antibiotic susceptibility against a panel of 14 antibiotics using gram negative cmv3agnf sensititre panels thermo fisher scientific burlington on canada according to the manufacturers instructions results were interpreted based on the sensititre swin software system thermo fisher scientific burlington on canada and according to human breakpoints outlined within the clinical and laboratory standards institute clsi guidelines clsi 2017 3 results 3 1 genomic features of sequenced wastewater e coli strains the general descriptive genome features of all 17 naturalized wastewater strains of e coli are summarized in table 1 genome size ranged from 5 0 mbp to 5 3 mbp with an average g c content of 51 6 the mean number of putative coding genes within these naturalized wastewater e coli strains was determined to be approximately 4921 3 2 core genome similarity and phylogenetic analysis of wastewater e coli genome snp analysis was used to compare core genome similarity among various e coli strains wastewater enteric and cryptic environmental the results of which are represented as a spanning tree and maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree figs 1 and 2 in both analyses enteric strains clustered together as did cryptic strains and wastewater strains figs 1 and 2 of interest was the incredible degree of core genome similarity across many of the naturalized wastewater strains of e coli from canada fig 1 particularly among the 14 isolates that possessed the wastewater specific snp itgr biomarker and the uspc is30 flhdc marker described by zhi et al 2016a represented by grey in filled circles in fig 1 these strains differed from each other by only 16 snps on average across the entire core genome size of 2 354 938 bp this genetic similarity was remarkable since these fourteen canadian wastewater isolates were originally collected from six geographically separated wastewater treatment plants in canada the similarity in core genome sequence among this sub group of naturalized wastewater e coli strains was far greater than that observed for naturalized wastewater strains lacking the uspc is30 flhdc marker fig 1 black in filled circles or among human enteric e coli strains or cryptic e coli strains fig 2 and suggesting clonal relatedness among these 14 canadian strains to rule out the potential for laboratory contamination between samples we sequenced multiple e coli isolates collected from the same wastewater treatment plant isolates that were collected from the same treatment plant e g strains ww44 ww48 ww50 ww69 dark blue outlined circles in fig 1 and which possessed both wastewater markers had the greatest degree of similarity across their core genomes averaging only 6 snps across the core genome these data provided compelling evidence that an e coli clonal strain was widely disseminated among geographically separated wastewater treatment plants in canada an even more interesting finding was the notable similarity between the core genomes of these fourteen naturalized e coli wastewater strains in canada and a wastewater strain recently sequenced by zurfluh et al 2017b from switzerland fig 1 the swiss wastewater strain abwa45 clustered together with the fourteen naturalized wastewater strains from canada as determined by both spanning tree analysis of the core genome fig 1 and by maximum likelihood whole genome phylogenetic analysis fig 2 surprisingly the swiss strain varied from canadian strains by only 1680 snps across the entire core genome of 2 354 938 bp of dna fig 1 based on blastn analysis and logic regression snp analysis in relevant itgrs this swiss wastewater strain was also found to possess a the uspc is30 flhdc wastewater marker described by zhi et al 2016a and b the snp itgr wastewater biomarker described by zhi et al 2016a genetic elements previously shown to be common among naturalized wastewater strains from canada moreover all 14 canadian strains and the swiss wastewater strain were classified as sequence type st635 based on multilocus sequence typing mlst analysis three wastewater e coli strains from canada that possessed the wastewater specific snp itgr biomarker described by zhi et al 2016a but lacked the uspc is30 flhdc marker wastewater strains ww2 ww9 and ww38 black in filled circles in fig 1 were also whole genome sequenced genome sequences from these three canadians strains were shown to be very similar to two other e coli strains that were isolated from wastewater samples in the u s econih4 and econih5 fig 1 biomarker searching revealed that the u s strains also possessed the itgr snp wastewater specific biomarker described by zhi et al 2016a but lacked the uspc is30 flhdc marker similar to the three canadian strains genetic diversity was greater among these three canadian and two u s wastewater strains than what was observed among the fourteen canadian and one swiss strain described above fig 1 four of the five wastewater strains possessing the snp itgr biomarker 2 canadian ww2 ww9 and the 2 u s strains clustered with the 15 other wastewater strains possessing both markers 14 canadian and 1 swiss strain by maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis fig 2 suggesting a common genetic background to all naturalized wastewater strains on average genetic variability in the core genome between these four isolates canadian ww2 ww9 and u s econih4 and econih5 approximated 2000 snps these two canadian wastewater strains ww2 and ww9 along with two u s strains econih4 and econih5 were classified as st399 by mlst analysis one canadian wastewater strain ww38 was the only strain that clustered with enteric strains based on phylogenetic analysis fig 2 this strain was also shown to have the greatest genetic distance from the other wastewater strains possessing 17 000 snps across the core genome compared to its closest relative the u s wastewater strain econih4 fig 1 this canadian wastewater strain was classified as st216 by mlst analysis 3 3 whole genome similarity between wastewater human enteric and cryptic clades strains of e coli in order to better understand genetic relatedness at the whole genome level we performed a pairwise whole genome similarity comparison of wastewater human enteric and cryptic clades against a single reference wastewater strain ww63 table 2 all wastewater strains possessing the wastewater specific snp itgr biomarker and the uspc is30 flhdc marker were very similar to the ww63 strain with their pairwise genome similarity ranging from 92 7 abwa45 swiss strain to 99 2 ww601 canadian strain it is interesting to note that the highest pairwise similarity observed among all the wastewater strains was between the ww63 reference strain and another canadian wastewater strain ww601 but for which the latter strain was isolated from a different wastewater treatment plant than ww63 again emphasizing the apparent clonal similarity across these strains found in different wastewater treatment plants wastewater strains possessing the snp itrg biomarker but not the uspc is30 flhdc marker were less similar to the ww63 strain with their pairwise genome similarity ranging from 84 7 ww38 to 90 1 ww9 pairwise whole genome similarity between the ww63 wastewater reference strain to human enteric strains ranged from only 79 82 7 the genome of ww63 was most dissimilar to the cryptic clades with similarity ranging from only 59 2 77 3 although we originally hypothesized that these strains may be more closely related to the cryptic clades as a result of their preferred habitat being a non host environmental wastewater niche they were in fact most closely related to enteric phylogroup a strains of e coli fig 2 suggesting an evolutionary origin from enteric e coli based on traditional phylogrouping methods all canadian wastewater strains were previously shown to belong to phylogroup a zhi et al 2016a as well as the swiss zurfluh et al 2017b and u s strains but based on whole genome phylogenetic analysis wastewater strains swiss u s and canadian all except for ww38 formed a unique clade separate from the well known enteric phylogroups of e coli a b1 b2 d e fig 2 3 4 comparative functional genomics of e coli strains genome mapping was used to reveal areas of the whole genome that were subject to polymorphic variability across human enteric and wastewater strains of e coli and whether snps or large scale genomic addition deletions accounted for this variability genome mapping revealed a large degree of commonality among the genomes of wastewater and enteric strains fig 3 but for which the maps were punctuated with relatively large gaps of polymorphism suggesting that wastewater strains possessed a variety of unique or differentially abundant genes in their genomes compared to human enteric strains fig 3 and most likely acquired through gene deletion or acquisition e g horizontal gene transfer to further evaluate the significance of these findings gene occurrence abundance was evaluated using heat mapping of functional sub systems based on whole genome sequences annotated by rast and accompanied with a search for unique genes in wastewater e coli a total of 518 functional sub systems were analyzed and of these 155 sub system displayed 20 relative standard deviation rsd among strains and were subsequently plotted as a heatmap supplementary fig s1 heat mapping demonstrated that wastewater strains human strains and cryptic strains had high within group similarity in functional sub system profiles and formed separate phenotypic clusters supplementary fig s1 and for which the phenotypic clustering recapitulated the results of our phylogenetic analysis interestingly wastewater strains possessed functional biochemical sub system characteristic of both enteric and cryptic clades table 3 these data suggested that although wastewater isolates may be genetically more similar to enteric phylogroup a strains based on phylogenetic analysis they appear to have lost certain genetic elements common to enteric clades but acquired certain genes from cryptic clades that supported their evolution to become naturalized populations in wastewater notably wastewater strains had a high abundance of genes involved in pyrimidine utilization co enzyme b12 biosynthesis gmp synthase cinnamic acid degradation lysine degradation dioxygenases and phenylpropionate degradation biochemical features common with enteric clades table 3 conversely wastewater strains were more similar to environmental cryptic clades in terms of propanediol utilization and for which these genes were notably absent from enteric strains used in the analysis other sub system biochemical profiles that were similar to cryptic clades included those involved in biofilm adhesion p aminobenzoyl glutamate utilization and a diversity of hydroxyaromatic decarboxylases table 3 3 5 unique genes in wastewater e coli strains to further identify unique genes in wastewater strains compared to enteric clades we compared the seventeen genomes from wastewater strains to the genomes of a wider range of enteric e coli isolates 30 e coli isolates from humans 35 isolates from cattle and 29 isolates from other animal sources see supplementary table s1 this genomic comparison identified a total of 147 kb of dna sequence that were unique or over represented in naturalized e coli wastewater strains accounting for 177 coding sequences these putative unique or differentially abundant genes were subsequently blastn verified against ncbi nucleotide database and 163 genes were identified as truly unique to wastewater strains supplementary table s2 functional annotation of these coding sequences revealed that the vast majority of these sequences were hypothetical putative proteins with unknown functions and not previously identified in enteric or cryptic e coli implying potential horizontal gene acquisition from xenospecific bacteria supplementary table s2 as outlined in supplementary table s3 other unique enriched genes included those that encoded proteins related to mobile genetic elements transponson integron prophage or trna genes i e that act as insertion sites for mobile genetic elements in addition several genes for toxin antitoxin systems were identified through comparative genome searches suggesting a mechanism by which these strains may outcompete other conspecific strains in a wastewater matrix toxin antitoxin genes in wastewater strains included cbta cbea and yfjz for which the cbta and cbea genes code for proteins of the cbta cbea toxin antitoxin system respectively and with yfjz encoding the antitoxin of the ypjf yfjz toxin antitoxin system toxin antitoxin systems are known to be important in the e coli sos stress response for environmental survival berghoff and wagner 2017 brown and shaw 2003 harms et al 2016 other differentially enriched genes in naturalized wastewater strains included those encoding type i and type iii restriction modification systems i e ability to recognize and cleave foreign dna other functionally annotated genes enriched in the naturalized wastewater e coli strains included those important in dna repair protein turnover and stress responses including radc dna repair protein glutathione s transferase oxidative stress cora magnesium and cobalt transport protein methyl accepting chemotaxis protein involved as sensing system for nutrients or toxins in the environment threonine dehydratase endoribonuclease l psp family protein oxidoreductase methionine sulfoxide reductase quinone oxidoreductase and serine threonine protein phosphatase the dominance of stress related genes in naturalized wastewater strains as compared to enteric clades recapitulated the need for these strains to evolve strategies against water treatment for survival in this harsh ecosystem 3 6 antibiotic resistance genes and profiles of wastewater e coli strains given the evidence that all wastewater strains shared a common genetic background and that they appeared to share similar phenotypic properties reflective of ecotype challenges we sought to evaluate other potential indicators of phenotypic genetic diversity in these strains and therefore examined the genomes for the presence of putative antibiotic resistance genes as well as virulence genes wastewater strains were shown to possess a plethora of antibiotic resistance genes supplementary table s4 antibiotic resistance gene composition was extremely similar across all canadian swiss and u s strains supplementary table s4 providing further evidence of genotypic phenotypic commonality among all globally distributed naturalized wastewater strains many of the antibiotic resistance genes found in wastewater strains were also highly represented in the cryptic clades supplementary table s4 suggesting that these genes may be important for non host environmental persistence and survival it is interesting to note that many of the antibiotic resistance genes identified were efflux pumps known to be important in transport of a variety of hydrophilic molecules and not just antibiotics blanco et al 2016 although wastewater isolates were shown to possess an abundance of antibiotic resistance genes most of the isolates were deemed to be phenotypically susceptible to all antibiotics tested in a narms panel based on mic clinical breakpoints supplementary table s5 only 3 of the 12 naturalized canadian wastewater isolates tested 25 were shown to be resistant and these three isolates were all resistant to nalidixic acid at human clinical breakpoints supplementary table s5 interestingly these three strains were isolated from different wastewater treatment plants in canada suggesting the possibility of independent acquisition of genetic mutations among these clonal isolates to drive phenotypic resistance a number of ar genes identified in these strains which were not efflux pumps imparted resistance to peptide antibiotics but unfortunately peptide antibiotics were not included in the susceptibility panel tested in addition the ampc β lactamase gene was ubiquitous in all wastewater isolates but did not confer clinical cephalosporin resistance 3 7 virulence genes in wastewater e coli strains the composition of virulence genes among all wastewater isolates canadian swiss and u s strains was also remarkably similar supplementary table s6 with an abundant representation of virulence genes commonly associated with urinary pathogenic e coli upec table 4 dominant upec virulence genes that were found in all naturalized wastewater e coli included those associated with iron acquisition such as a the ferrienterobactin multi enzyme sythetase complex and transport system fepa fepb fepc fepd fepg and enta entb entc entd ente entf ents b upec fimbrial genes fima fimb fimc fimd fime fimf fimg fimh fimi c curli virulence gene csgb d the outer membrane protein ompa and e the flagellar biosynthesis protein flha table 4 wastewater strains from the u s econih4 and econih5 as well as one wastewater strain from canada ww2 also possessed the upec virulence genes associated with the yersiniabactin siderophore biosynthetic pathway and receptor transport system ybta ybte ybtp ybtq ybts ybtt ybtu and ybtx as well as fyua and irp1 2 table 4 although wastewater strains possessed a wide array of upec related genes phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that wastewater strains clustered separately from human upec strains with human upec reference strains uti89 cft073 and 536 phylogenetically clustering with human enteric strains of the b2 phylogroup fig 2 interestingly many of the upec related virulence genes found in wastewater strains were also observed in the environmental cryptic clades supplementary table s6 suggesting that these upec related virulence genes may provide an adaptive evolutionary advantage for survival in extra intestinal niches including non host environmental niches notably wastewater strains from canada switzerland and the u s also possessed an array of virulence genes commonly associated with enterohemorrhagic e coli ehec virulence genes not found in the human reference upec isolates uti89 cft073 and 536 or in the majority of the cryptic strains supplementary table s6 these ehec related virulence genes included effector protein genes associated with the type iii secretory system located on the locus of enterocyte effacement lee espl espr1 espr 3 espr 4 espx1 espx 4 and espx 5 4 discussion defining a microbial species is a contentious debate among microbial taxonomists largely due to our lack of understanding about the interaction between genotype phenotype and ecotype diversity at the microbial level recently we developed novel dna sequence based logic regression biomarker discovery tools aimed at revealing genotype phenotype ecotype interactions to better understand population diversity in e coli zhi et al 2015 2016a 2016b using this biomarker discovery approach we identified naturalized e coli specialists in wastewater zhi et al 2016a these wastewater strains were shown to carry a unique snp itgr biomarker not seen in enteric strains or cryptic clades of e coli and for which a sub population of these strains also carried a pcr marker known as the uspc is30 flhdc element zhi et al 2016a herein we demonstrate an incredible level of genomic homogeneity among these chlorine resistant wastewater e coli isolates found in wastewater from canada switzerland and the u s suggestive of a common genetic background lineage among these naturalized strains moreover a sub population of these specialists were clonally related possessing the uspc is30 flhdc element in addition to the snp itgr biomarker and represented by fourteen canadian strains isolated from six different wastewater treatment plants in canada and a strain isolated from wastewater in switzerland and sequenced by zurfluh et al 2017b this finding is intriguing and we provide some hypotheses to potentially explain this phenomenon and reflect on the public health significance of our findings it could be argued that these naturalized wastewater strains may actually represent extremely rare enteric strains adapted to survive in the harsh conditions of a wastewater treatment plant but for which these strains ultimately rely on transmission back into the gut of a human or animal host for growth and subsequent dissemination however several observations challenge this hypothesis to date we have only ever found the wastewater specific snp itgr biomarker and uspc is30 flhdc element in e coli isolated from wastewater furthermore it seems beyond coincidence that among the vast genomic databases that do exist for enteric e coli 10 000 genomes as of may 2018 that the only other strains that possess these markers come from e coli isolates originating from wastewater in switzerland and the u s additionally it seems beyond coincidence that these wastewater strains obtained in different countries and isolated and sequenced in different laboratories and with different sequencing technologies would possess such remarkable genetic relatedness at the core genome whole genome and functional genome levels our current evidence suggests that these strains are genetically phenotypically and ecotypically distinct from enteric e coli strains their remarkable genome similarity supports a clonal expansion theory of emergence under this theory natural selection may have drove the evolution of a phylogroup a enteric strain to develop a stress resistance phenotype in order to survive wastewater treatment potentially acquiring elements of cryptic clades to support their survival in the non host environment this emergent strain dispersed geographically to colonize other wastewater treatment plant ecosystems this hypothesis is supported by our phylogenetic and pairwise whole genome similarity analysis which demonstrated that although wastewater strains were most closely related to enteric phylogroup a strains fig 2 they only shared 80 similarity at the whole genome level with enteric clades and only 64 similarity to cryptic clades but possessed up to 99 2 similarity with other wastewater isolates obtained from different wastewater treatment plants compare strains ww63 and ww601 table 2 the clonal expansion theory provides a compelling explanation for the similar genetic background observed among all wastewater strains in canada switzerland and the u s and helps explain the conservation of the snp itgr biomarker across all wastewater specialists and the occurrence of the uspc is30 flhdc element among some of these wastewater clonal specialists dissemination of these wastewater strains may be facilitated by the common practice of discharging of wastewater effluents back into natural water bodies i e rivers streams lakes oceans allowing these highly adapted environmentally resilient strains to disseminate through interconnected watersheds and hydrological pathways mechanical vectors i e aquatic birds insects aquatic mammals could have also facilitated the transport of these resilient strains into new environments once introduced naturalized wastewater strains would grow endogenously in the wastewater ecosystem in support of the clonal expansion theory our previous work has demonstrated that these wastewater strains appear to have better survival characteristics against wastewater treatment compared to enteric strains e g chlorine tolerant these wastewater strains were originally isolated from raw sewage treated with a chlorine concentration sufficient in killing 99 99 of all e coli in the samples i e 4 log10 treatment reduction u s epa 2010 consequently these naturalized wastewater strains represented the survivor or persister population after chlorination zhi et al 2016a we have some evidence to suggest that the uspc is30 flhdc marker may provide a phenotypic advantage to survival of these e coli specialists in wastewater the is30 transposon upregulates expression in flanking genes barker et al 2004 and we have recently shown that the flhdc gene a regulator of flagellar synthesis is upregulated by chlorine treatment in these wastewater strains zhi et al 2017 in turn flagellar synthesis is important for biofilm formation an important bacterial survival strategy against chlorination ryu and beuchat 2005 and for which we have demonstrated that these wastewater specialists are significantly more robust at producing biofilms compared enteric strains zhi et al 2017 likewise the uspc gene a member of the universal stress protein family specifically involved in uv resistance gustavsson et al 2002 is the other flanking gene of the is30 element in wastewater isolates uv irradiation is a common wastewater treatment strategy and preliminary data in our laboratory suggests that these strains display a resistance phenotype to uv leading to a hypothesis that the is30 element may upregulate uspc expression in naturalized wastewater strains to enhance their chances of survival against uv treatment the hybrid like phenotypic nature of these wastewater strains i e possessing characteristics of both enteric and cryptic clades is also interesting in terms of understanding natural selection pressures that may have driven evolutionary adaption in a wastewater ecosystem wastewater clades were shown to share many functional biochemical subsystems with the enteric clade and cryptic clades potentially facilitating their adaptation to survival and growth outside the host unique gene searching also revealed adaptive genotypes based on the over representation of many stress adaptive genes in wastewater strains examples of which include a toxin antitoxin ta systems important in regulating nutritional starvation and intra species competition in environments with limited resources christensen et al 2001 2003 b type i and iii restriction modification systems important in cleaving foreign dna and likely critical for survival in a wastewater environment abundant in diverse bacteriophages and conjugative plasmids dupuis et al 2013 c dna repair systems and in particular those associated with damage caused by uv a common wastewater treatment practice d various oxidoreductases glutathione transferase systems associated with dealing with oxidative stressors and implicated in oxidative resistance against uv chlorine and hydrogen peroxide allocati et al 2009 khemiri et al 2014 lemire et al 2017 patridge and ferry 2006 and e heteromeric transposase elements shown to be important for environmental adaptation by promoting horizontal gene transfer and integration of genomic islands among bacteria peters et al 2014 collectively wastewater strains possessed an array of unique and differentially abundant gene elements that may be reflective of the evolutionary pressures associated with survival in this harsh human engineered treatment intense environment naturalized wastewater strains as well as cryptic clades of e coli were shown to possess an array of upec related virulence genes i e up to 36 genes implying that although these genes may be important for uropathogen survival they may be equally important for naturalized and cryptic strains to survive in non host environmental niches many of the well characterized upec virulence genes represent adaptations for survival in the nutrient deprived and osmotically hydrologically stressed environment of the urinary tract i e low solutes and repetitive flushing mann et al 2017 for example human upec strains have a predominance of iron sequestering virulence genes e g ferribactin yersinabactin enterobactin related genes and transport pathways to enhance their survival in iron deficient urine terlizzi et al 2017 wastewater and cryptic clades also possess these iron sequestering virulence factors likely due to the fact that they face similar iron acquisition challenges in aquatic environments and that could explain the evolutionary conservation of these upec related virulence genes as a broad based strategy for survival in extra intestinal niches interestingly recent research has demonstrated that upec strains are common in wastewater effluents adefisoye and okoh 2016 anastasi et al 2010 boczek et al 2007 calhau et al 2015 anastasi et al 2010 identified potential upec in wastewater effluents based on the presence of the virulence genes papa h pape f papc hlya cnf1 and iron in e coli isolates collected from wastewater and none of the canadian swiss and u s wastewater isolates examined in our study possessed these upec virulence genes likewise calhau et al 2015 identified upec in wastewater effluents based on the presence of the virulence genes iuta papa h and sfa and similarly these genes were not found in any of the naturalized wastewater isolates in our study at present we do not believe that naturalized wastewater strains of e coli are actual uropathogens of humans and animals since upec reference strains uti89 cft073 and 536 clustered with human enteric strains and were phylogenetically distal to wastewater clades however our data provides compelling evidence that the conservation of many upec related virulence genes among cryptic wastewater and clinical upec may help explain their collective ability to survive in extra intestinal niches and perhaps why upec pathotypes like wastewater clades appear to be both environmentally resilient and water treatment resistant and therefore differentially survive the wastewater treatment process adefisoye and okoh 2016 anastasi et al 2010 boczek et al 2007 calhau et al 2015 naturalized wastewater strains of e coli were also shown to possess a number of virulence genes common with diarrheagenic ehec ipec e g e coli o157 most notably effectors of the type iii secretory system located on the lee espl espr1 espr 3 espr 4 espx1 espx 4 and espx 5 the lee is a major chromosomal pathogenicity island in ehec strains but importantly it is not found in upec strains the fact that naturalized wastewater strains possess virulence genes common to both upec and ehec and that these genes are not shared between these enteric pathotypes provides compelling evidence of the potential horizontal transfer of pathogenicity islands and virulence genes among naturalized wastewater strains and various e coli pathotypes upec and ehec ex vivo enterohemorrhagic e coli ehec and other intestinal pathogenic e coli ipec have also been shown to be routinely detected in treated wastewater effluents ayaz et al 2014 muniesa et al 2006 suggesting that some ehec strains may have already developed some resistance to wastewater treatment processes relatedly our data provides evidence to suggest that antibiotic resistance genes may also be exchanged among naturalized and enteric strains for example the swiss wastewater strain sequenced by zurfluh et al 2017b was shown to possess the plasmid encoded 16s rrna methyltransferase gene rmtb responsible for carbapenem resistance as well as the β lactamase gene bla tem 1b genes commonly found in extended spectrum β lactamase esbl clinical isolates of e coli conversely canadian wastewater strains did not possess these ar elements it is important to note however that the swiss strain was directly isolated from hospital wastewater whereas the canadian strains were isolated from municipal wastewater i e hospital wastewater diluted in the bulk sewage flows of an entire urban municipality acquisition of diverse ar resistance elements within the naturalized wastewater lineages may depend on the concentrations of antibiotic residues within the wastewater matrix driving endogenous resistance i e antibiotic residues in untreated hospital wastewater are much greater than those typically seen in municipal wastewater karthikeyan and meyer 2006 and or the ar gene diversity from enteric clinically relevant e coli populations entering a wastewater plant that are horizontally exchanged with wastewater clades furthermore zurfluh et al 2017a showed that these carbapenam and β lactam resistant e coli appear to differentially survive the wastewater treatment process raising further concerns about the emergence of antibiotic resistance among water treatment resistant pathotypes several studies have revealed a link between antibiotic resistance and water treatment resistance huang et al 2013 demonstrated a phenotypic relationship between chlorine resistance and tetracycline resistance suggesting that chlorine treatment may increase the risk of selection of e coli isolates highly resistant to tetracycline additionally liu et al 2018 demonstrated that urban wastewater treated with chlorine dioxide resulted in the selection of macrolide ermb tetracycline teta tetb and tetc sulfonamide sul1 sul2 and sul3 β lactam ampc aminoglycoside aph 2 id rifampicin katg and vancomycin vana resistance genes in treated wastewater effluent samples interestingly the naturalized wastewater strains in our study possessed three of the ar selected genes reported from liu et al 2018 ermb ampc and sul1 demonstrating that these strains may contribute to the ar resistome of wastewater and may provide a selective advantage to survival in a wastewater matrix wastewater strains of e coli were shown to carry a plethora of common antibiotic resistance genes many of which were shared with cryptic clades re emphasizing the point that these ar genes may provide an ecologically adaptive strategy for survival in the non host environment interestingly canadian wastewater isolates were shown to be susceptible at clinical breakpoints to most of the antibiotics tested albeit for three canadian isolates resistant to nalidixic acid it is increasingly evident that genotype does not always relay a resistance phenotype a recent review by hughes and anderson hughes and andersson 2017 discuss the potential mechanisms for environmental and genetic modulation of phenotypic resistance that relate to biofilms altered growth states and a variety of other possible factors nevertheless the abundance of ar genes in wastewater strains is cause for concern for several reasons wastewater isolates may represent important and persistent reservoirs of ar gene exchange with enteric clades for example the three canadian wastewater strains resistant to nalidixic acid originated from three different wastewater treatment plants yet all isolates possessed the serine leucine mutation at position 83 of the gyra gene known to impart resistance to nalidixic acid but for which they retain their sensitivity to ciprofloxacin saenz et al 2003 the swiss wastewater strain abwa45 and one u s wastewater strain econih5 also possessed this mutation in the chromosome various mutations within the gyra gene have been mapped to quinolone resistance some of which convey resistance to nalidixic acid and some of which provide resistance to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin saenz et al 2003 so it seems odd as to why wastewater strains distributed globally would retain this particular mutation and not others it is also noteworthy that the u s wastewater strains possessed the qnra1 gene a plasmid mediated determinant of nalidixic acid resistance redgrave et al 2014 indicating that a potentially strong selection pressure exists in wastewater similar to pressures in the gut to maintain this nalidixic acid resistant phenotype this data along with that of zurfluh et al 2017b regarding plasmid encoded carbapenem and β lactam resistance in the swiss wastewater strain suggests that naturalized wastewater strains are competent for both the uptake and retention of mobile genetic ar elements from enteric clades wastewater may also act as an amplification matrix for ar genes through endogenous growth and replication of naturalized wastewater strains through endogenous amplification ar gene elements may be transferred to other enteric or cryptic clades horizontal gene transfer of ar determinants from wastewater microbes to environmental microbes has been previously demonstrated karkman et al 2018 marcinek et al 1998 collectively our data raises the public health specter that wastewater treatment may actually drive the evolution of water treatment resistant and antibiotic resistant phenotypes pathotypes of e coli the public health concerns are compounded by the problem that many of the disinfection strategies used for pathogen reduction in wastewater i e chlorination uv treatment ozone are similar to the treatment strategies used for drinking water production thus the selection of treatment resistant pathotypes in wastewater effluents could potentially affect disinfection efficacy in downstream drinking water systems due to de facto reuse of wastewater across north america and globally for example it has been estimated that 50 of drinking water treatment plants in the u s are impacted by wastewater effluents and in some cases wastewater discharge can account for up to 50 of instream flow volumes in source water systems rice and westerhoff 2015 2017 adaptive strategies to climate change such as severe droughts have also forced societies to consider wastewater as an important alternative water resource for drinking water and irrigation of food crops unfortunately virtually all microbial risk assessments performed to date ignore the potential for evolved treatment resistance in a microbial species favoring an approach focused on reference surrogates for example giardia spp are widely used as the reference microbe for deriving chlorine treatment criteria for drinking water systems health canada 2012a and adenoviruses are widely used as reference microbes for deriving uv treatment criteria health canada 2011 it is widely accepted that e coli is relatively easy to inactivate by traditional treatment processes chlorine uv advanced oxidation however our data suggests that a considerable level of treatment resistance can evolve in e coli populations raising questions as to just how resistant these strains can become to conventional water treatment processes in fact within any given microbial population there exists a highly resistant sub population known as persisters harms et al 2016 and for which these sub populations contribute to the evolution of resistance in the species as mentioned previously our naturalized wastewater strains were originally isolated from raw sewage treated with a dose of chlorine yielding a 99 99 reduction in endogenous e coli levels consequently resistance to chlorine in the e coli population in wastewater may vary by more than 4 orders of magnitude i e 10 000 times by comparison laboratory strains of e coli that are commonly used in disinfection studies are susceptible to chlorine and are typically 100 1000 times less resistant to chlorine than giardia health canada 2012b in eloquent studies done by alcantara diaz et al 2004 a parental laboratory strain of e coli was exposed to increasing doses of uv c irradiation over 80 iterative exposure growth cycles and evolved daughter strains were shown to be 100 000 times more resistant to uv irradiation than the parent strain this study demonstrated the enormous plasticity of mutational adaptation in a single strain of e coli against uv c i e vertical gene transmission and does not encompass the horizontal gene transfer potential associated with diverse mechanisms of uv resistance that exist in the microbial world as such naturalized wastewater strains of e coli may represent a persister population ensuring species continuance under the intense selection pressures posed by wastewater engineered environments we posit that analogous to the global threat of antibiotic resistance there is evidence to suggest that microbes may be evolving resistance to water treatment safe drinking water and sanitation represent the greatest human advancements for control of infectious disease and consequently any breach in these fundamental public health interventions should cause concern among the scientific community we strongly believe this to be a critical area of future scientific research 5 conclusion our data suggests that certain strains of e coli have evolved to become naturalized populations within a wastewater environment adopting a lifestyle of survival growth and replication in a non animal host niche these strains share a common genetic background and a sub population of these strains appear to be clonal in nature these strains are globally distributed and can be found in wastewater treatment plants in canada the u s and switzerland they possess properties of chlorine resistance and genetic analysis demonstrated that they possess an over abundance of stress related genes within their genomes an adaptation that likely enhances their survival during wastewater treatment naturalized wastewater strains possessed an array of upec related virulence genes as well as ehec genes suggesting that like upec they may be important for survival in an extraintestinal environment naturalized strains also possessed a wide array of antibiotic resistance genes the repertoire of virulence and antibiotic genes suggests that these strains may readily exchange genes with cryptic and enteric lineages of e coli the ability to exchange virulence antibiotic and stress related genes with enteric clades raises major concerns about the emergence of water treatment resistant e coli pathotypes in the water and wastewater industry research data the genomes of wastewater e coli strains sequenced by this study were deposited in ncbi and

18904,the present study shows the results of solar photo fenton oxidation of paracetamol pct and amoxicillin amx fe2 so4 3 was used as the source of iron and edds as the iron complexing agent employing different doses of hydrogen peroxide two aqueous matrices a synthetic wastewater and real wastewater from el ejido wwtp effluent almeria were used in all cases the process was operated under conditions of natural sunlight results showed that the degradation of both drugs is favoured when the aqueous matrix presents low concentration of carbonates under the conditions studied here degradation percentages above 90 were obtained in the synthetic wastewater and 80 in the actual effluent the degradation products were determined using liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry with hybrid quadrupole time of flight analyser the intermediates detected throughout the oxidative process for both micro contaminants were mainly products of hydroxylation reactions the toxicity of the samples was determined using the bacterium vibrio fischeri in the acute toxicity test it was observed that the bacteria did not undergo inhibition in any of the cases however chronic toxicity studies showed that the higher the hydraulic retention time hrt employed in the assays the higher the bacterial inhibition graphical abstract image 1 keywords drugs wastewater solar photo fenton process intermediates 1 introduction in recent years the production and consumption of a number of pharmaceuticals has increased considerably due to the growth and development of society the most commonly consumed drugs include antibiotics analgesics and antipyretics liang et al 2018 in the case of antibiotics some authors have reported a 36 increase in consumption in 71 countries between 2000 and 2010 van boeckel et al 2014 penicillins comprise the most frequently consumed group of antibiotics in the european union other antibiotics such as amoxicillin amx are consumed in greater quantities in countries like india kotwani et al 2011 and brazil magalhães and borschiver 2012 amoxicillin amx is a β lactam antibiotic belonging to the aminopenicillin family among analgesics acetaminophen or paracetamol pct occupies the top of the list in a study carried out in 2003 by sebastine and wakeman 2003 paracetamol was classified as one of the top three drugs prescribed in england with more than 400 tons being consumed in that year the main problem with the high demand for these pharmaceutical products is that once they have been consumed they end up in the environment via different pathways whether as the result of human excretions unconsumed remains that are discharged together with wastewater waste produced by animals or via industrial wastewater effluents kummerer 2009 antibiotics have been detected in surface waters hirsch et al 1999 yan et al 2013 in groundwater barnes et al 2008 batt et al 2006 in drinking water benotti et al 2008 in sediments zhou et al 2011 and even in agricultural soil hu et al 2007 given the importance of these pollutants in the integrated water cycle their presence in the effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtp has been investigated in different countries fatta kassinos et al 2011 jones et al 2005 miao et al 2005 in the case of paracetamol a concentration of up to 6 μg l has been reported in effluents from european treatment plants ternes 1998 up to 10 μg l in natural waters in the usa kolpin et al 2002 and even above 65 μg l in the tyne river uk roberts and thomas 2006 one of the reasons these products reach the environment is because most wwtp are not designed to remove emerging pharmaceutical contaminants therefore it is of major interest to investigate what types of treatments allow the removal of these micro pollutants from wastewater different tertiary treatments have been assessed to remove these emerging pollutants including membrane filtration active carbon adsorption and advanced oxidation processes bolong et al 2009 among others advanced oxidation processes aop are oxidative processes based on the generation of highly oxidizing species such as hydroxyl radicals ho the main characteristics of this species are its high reduction potential and non selective nature in removing toxic and persistent compounds present in natural waters or wastewaters that have been treated via conventional technologies gogate 2004 this type of treatment is also used to treat industrial effluents hazardous effluents from hospitals and landfill leachate in order to remove pathogens given their high efficiency in contaminants degradation suty et al 2004 pignatello et al 2006 malato et al 2009 the most widely used aops in wastewater treatment include the use of ozone o3 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 ultraviolet radiation and photocatalysis or combinations thereof for instance the removal of aqueous acetaminophen is currently being carried out via ozonation or other aops such as o3 uv vogna et al 2004 andreozzi et al 2003 skoumal et al 2006 and electrochemical treatment brillas et al 2005 sirés et al 2006 among others another aop used for the removal of this type of contaminant is the photo fenton process trovó et al 2011 2012 which involves the reaction between fe ions and hydrogen peroxide to form reactive species capable of oxidizing different organic compounds the main problems this type of process presents are the ph at which the reaction takes place ph 2 3 and the presence of carbonates in the water both of these drawbacks make the process more costly and economically unfeasible in order to avoid the high consumption of reagents involved in operating at ph 2 or 3 different complexing agents have been studied which keep the fe in solution thus avoiding its precipitation these include citrate oxalate edta and nta clarizia et al 2017 the importance of removing carbonates resides in the fact that they act as scavengers of ho radicals pignatello et al 2006 it has been proved that carbonates removal makes the photo fenton process both more effective and more economical klamerth et al 2012 taking all the above into account and given the scarcity of studies found in the literature on the degradation of pct and amx in urban wastewater and the actual concentrations found in this type of water the present study addresses the removal of two drugs amoxicillin amx and paracetamol pct present in the wastewater effluent using an advanced oxidation process namely the photo fenton reaction ethylenediamine disuccinic acid edds was used as the complexing agent in this study the use of this compound allows the reaction to be carried out at neutral ph and minimizes the use of reagents employed in the treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and chemicals used the two pharmaceutical drugs selected as emerging contaminants for the purpose of this study high purity 99 amoxicillin and paracetamol were purchased from sigma aldrich

the photo fenton process a 35 w v solution of ethylenediamine disuccinic acid edds supplied by sigma aldrich was used as the iron chelating agent while 35 w v hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and 98 sulphuric acid for the removal of carbonate were supplied by panreac 2 2 analytical determinations the concentrations of the pharmaceuticals were measured by high performance liquid chromatography provided with uv detection hplc uv agilent technologies series 1200 a gemini c 18 column was used for the chromatographic separation the solvents used as the mobile phase were 10 mm kh2po4 buffer mobile phase a and acn mobile phase b at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 the elution gradient was as follows 100 a for the first 10 min then 60 a to 100 b during the following 13 min samples were pre filtered through a 0 22 μm syringe filter and a 100 μl aliquot was injected into the hplc the detection wavelengths limits of quantitation loq and limits of detection lod for each pharmaceutical product are shown in table 1 liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry lc qtof ms was used to identify and monitor the transformation products generated during the photo fenton processes

run time was 13 min the sample injection volume was 20 μl and the flow rate was kept constant at 0 5 ml min 1 the hplc system was connected to a triple tof 5600 ab sciex mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization esi interface mineralization of the drugs during the photo fenton process was assessed by monitoring the dissolved organic carbon doc on a shimadzu toc vcsn analyser the total iron concentration was measured using the 1 10 phenanthroline method in accordance with iso 6332 hydrogen peroxide was measured using titanium oxysulphate iv following din 38402h15 anion concentrations were determined with a metrohm 872 extension module 1 and 2 ion chromatography ic system configured for gradient analysis cation and ammonium concentrations were determined with a metrohm 850 professional ic configured for isocratic analysis sample measurements were made by injection after pre filtering using 0 22 μm pore syringe filters 2 3 toxicity the toxicity study during the photo fenton experiments was performed by analysing the inhibition of bioluminescence emitted by the marine bacterium vibrio fischeri bioluminescence was measured using a biofix lumi 10 luminometer and commercial macherey nagel biofix lumi multi shot luminescent bacteria kits for 200 samples ref 945007 which included the restorative solution samples were filtered through a 0 20 μm ptfe filter millipore millex gn to remove suspended solids the ph was adjusted to 6 8 and the salinity to 2 w v by adding nacl when needed lyophilized bacteria were reconstituted in 11 ml restorative solution stored at 4 c for 30 min and then incubated at 15 c the change in bioluminescence percent inhibition was measured after 5 15 and 30 min versus a blank battery in a saline medium 2 4 oxidation treatment the photo fenton experiments were carried out with natural solar radiation in a composite parabolic collector cpc photoreactor located at the plataforma solar de almería psa latitude 37 n longitude 2 4 w this apparatus consists of two cpc photoreactors whose reflector is made of highly anodized aluminium each module is mounted on an aluminium frame and consists of 12 tubes the entire structure is tilted at the same angle as the local latitude of the site 37 the two modules are connected in series and the working fluid flows directly from one to another and ends up in a 10 l spherical recirculating borosilicate glass tank the tank has a glass cover for inserting components required during the test such as reagents gas air oxygen inert gas etc ph electrodes and dissolved oxygen sensors the glass tank is placed under roof so light is not penetrating never the tank a centrifugal pump pan world model nh 100 px 100 w returns the fluid to the concentrators at a flow rate

2 below ultraviolet solar uv radiation was measured by means of a cuv 3 global uv radiometer kipp zonen mounted on a 37 tilted platform the same as the cpc modules given that the tests were carried

cpc using simulated water from a wwtp effluent prepared in the laboratory and real effluent water discharged from el ejido wwtp the characterization of the simulated water and the effluent can be seen in table 3 five types of experiments were carried out in the solar cpc pilot plant in each of these experiments 35 l of water solutions at neutral ph ph 7 8 were used the necessary volume of a stock standard solution containing 1000 ppm of each drug in milliq water was added to these solutions to achieve a final concentration of 1 ppm of each compound experiments 1 and 2 were performed by using simulated wwtp effluent the behaviour of each drug was investigated separately in order to assess its degradation rate and to study its primary degradation subsequently another experiment was performed with a mixture of both compounds in the simulated wastewater experiment 3 the fourth and fifth experiments were carried out with treated effluent from the wwtp located in the municipality of el ejido almería and a mixture of both contaminants in these experiments carbonates were partly removed before starting the photo fenton process by adding a minimum amount of h2so4 0 5 1 ppm under stirring not to modify the ph of the treated water and to be able to work at neutral ph carbonate removal has been shown to make the photo fenton process more effective klamerth et al 2009 the contaminants under study were below the detection limits in pristine wastewater so for experiments 1 4 1 ppm of the drugs and the same reagent concentration were used to carry out the photo fenton reaction 3 ppm fe3 and 2 75 ppm h2o2 these concentrations were established following a study carried out by the present authors phd of mercedes hinojosa pending publication in a solar simulator to determine the optimum concentrations of reagents that eventually enabled a micropollutants degradation percentage of 90 the iron and drug concentrations were maintained in experiment 5 but the hrt was increased to 240 min and the h2o2 dose to 5 ppm to determine whether degradation of both contaminants could be achieved under these conditions because other authors trovó et al 2008 had obtained high degradation rates when working with higher h2o2 concentrations the fe2 so4 3 edds concentration was in the proportion of 1 2 the fe edds complex was prepared in the laboratory before each experiment by dissolving fe2 so4 3h2o in water at ph 3 adding edds and homogenizing the complex thus formed was then placed in the cpc reactor 35 l ensuring a ph of between 7 and 8 the water in the reactor was kept recirculating for about 5 min to obtain a homogeneous sample an initial sample was analysed to ensure operating with the required fe iii concentration after this time the h2o2 concentration 2 75 or 5 ppm was added and the collectors were uncovered to start the photo fenton reaction successive additions of hydrogen peroxide were made as the reaction progressed calculating the cost of these additions the experimental protocol has been detailed by other authors klamerth et al 2012 the degradation percentage was found to decrease to 70 in experiment 4 operating at 210 min hrt and making 6 additions of 2 75 ppm h2o2 for either of the two pollutants in experiment 5 three additions of 5 ppm hydrogen peroxide were made followed by a final addition of 10 ppm at 122 min as it was observed that the degradation of the contaminants did not reach 60 the experiments carried out with simulated wastewater experiments 1 to 3 lasted 60 min taking samples every 3 min experiment 4 carried out with wwtp effluent lasted 210 min and experiment 5 up to 240 min taking samples every 5 min in the first hour every 15 min for the next 2 h and every 20 min in the last hour the reason for prolonging experiments 4 and 5 lay in the characteristics of the wastewater being used as ho radicals are not selective for degradation and they are consumed by several wastewater components 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of paracetamol and amoxicillin via the photo fenton process experiments 1 and 2 were used to assess the degradation of both compounds separately table 4 shows the results obtained it can be seen that even when operating at low doses of fe and h2o2 the percentage of degraded compound increases as the oxidation process evolves obtaining 90 degradation in only a few minutes of reaction time 9 min for amx and 36 min for pct for experiment 3 mixture of 1 ppm of each pollutant a 50 min hrt was needed to obtain the same degradation percentage table 4 this rapid degradation may be due to the characteristics of the wastewater used in these experiments simulated wwtp effluent indeed the amount of organic matter and carbonates was lower in this type of water than in real effluents hence the hydroxyl radicals produced in the reaction attack the drugs directly inducing a high degradation rate and thus obtaining a high degree of efficiency in the photo fenton process klamerth et al 2009 the difference in degradation obtained in the experiments in which the drugs were treated individually experiments 1 and 2 and when working with a mixture of the two experiment 3 may be due to the antagonistic effect of the two pollutants this effect increases the degradation time however it should also be considered that in the first two trials 5 separate additions of 2 75 ppm hydrogen peroxide were made in all whereas only 4 such additions were made in the third experiment these results are in agreement with those obtained by klamerth 2010a 2010b who showed that high micro contaminant degradation rates can be achieved without ph adjustment and employing low concentrations of iron if there is no carbonate present the degradation of both compounds throughout the photo fenton process is shown in experiments 4 and 5 figs 1 and 2 respectively these experiments were carried out in wastewater matrix degradation was found to be much slower than in the previous trials with high amounts of non degraded contaminants remaining even when the reaction time was increased fig 1 shows the variation in the concentration of each pollutant versus hrt for experiment 4 it can be seen that degradation percentages of 70 were obtained for pct and of 66 for amx at 210 min after 6 additions of 2 75 ppm hydrogen peroxide in the 10th 30th 40th 90th 135th minutes and a last one in the 180th minute of reaction this slow degradation may be due to the presence of carbonates as they were not completely removed leaving concentrations of up to 44 ppm in the medium as already mentioned these compounds act as hydroxyl radical scavengers pignatello et al 2006 also the wastewater organic matter could act as ho scavenger fig 2 shows the degradation of each pollutant versus hrt for experiment 5 the differences with respect to experiment 4 are that the carbonate concentration was lower 36 ppm the hrt was increased to 240 min and the added hydrogen peroxide concentration changed to 3 additions of 5 ppm each one at the beginning of the reaction and another two in the 20th and 60th minutes followed by a final addition of 10 ppm in the 120th minute under these new conditions the amx degradation was faster and it reached higher levels than that obtained in experiment 4 97 while a pct degradation percentage of 80 was obtained versus 70 when the hydrogen peroxide dose was 2 75 ppm experiment 4 3 2 mineralization of the pharmaceuticals fig 3 shows the evolution of total organic carbon toc in experiments 1 2 and 3 toc came mainly from target pharmaceuticals and edds taking into account that the toc of the aqueous matrix is constant in the 3 experiments it can be asserted that the differences are mainly due to the toc accounted for by pharmaceutical products and edds initial toc in experiment 3 was higher than in the other trials due to the sum of toc coming from both drugs it is important to highlight that some toc reduction was detected in all the experiments the percentage of toc removal measured for each of the experiments was 19 5 in experiment 1 26 6 in experiment 2 and 26 5 in experiment 3 these results are in line with those of andreozzi et al 2003 who obtained 30 mineralization of the same drugs when working with ozone regarding experiments 4 and 5 the percentage of toc removed was even lower than for experiments 1 2 and 3 reaching only 6 5 for experiment 4 even when the hrt was higher 210 min and 21 for experiment 5 in those cases the presence of higher concentration of carbonates in the real effluent of the municipal wwtp as well as the presence of other organic carbon sources decreased the efficiency of the mineralization process finally the higher efficiency in toc abatement observed in experiment 5 compared to 4 was due to the addition of a higher amount of h2o2 as well as the longer reaction time 3 3 intermediates of the photo fenton reaction chemical oxidation processes occur through different pathways than biological oxidation processes usually the most important stages in a biological oxidation process are oxidative conversion of one of the two methyl groups of the alkyl chain to carboxylic group ω oxidation oxidative shortening of the alkyl chain in two units of carbon atoms β oxidation oxidative cleavage of the ring in chemical oxidation processes several active radicals are formed that can attack through many points in the molecule however in biological oxidation processes an enzyme has to be introduced into the molecule to form an enzyme substrate complex the compounds may follow different oxidation pathways depending on the aop applied in this case the solar photo fenton process the concentration of reagents used fe and h2o2 the type of substrate to be oxidized paracetamol or amoxicillin and the moles of h2o2 moles of substrate ratio hence many possible intermediates may be formed in the process villota et al 2016 in turn each oxidation pathway can take different routes depending on the process variables hence the difficulty arises of definitively establishing a single degradation pathway bearing all this in mind starting with experiment 5 in which mineralization of the compounds was not observed a study of the intermediates that arose as the reaction progressed was carried out it should be noted that no pre concentration was applied to the samples which were only filtered through a 0 22 μm cellulose nitrate membrane filter before lc ms analysis the molecular structure of the intermediates was determined on the basis of the high resolution mass spectra of the compounds detected provided by a lc qtof ms ms system which allows the determination of the elemental composition of the protonated molecules and their fragment ions with a high degree of accuracy tables 5 and 6 show information regarding the retention time accurate mass experimental and calculated error ppm and empirical formula for the protonated molecule and ms ms fragment ions of the main transformation products of pct and amx at 240 min reaction time 3 3 1 paracetamol degradation pathway table 5 shows the transformation products identified during the photo fenton treatment of pct operating in a cpc reactor at neutral ph with fe3 edds it should first be noted that all compounds except c5 c6h7o2 contain nitrogen in their molecules this clearly shows that no cleavage of the n c bond of the original pct molecule took place at the beginning of the process the aromatic ring cleavage also reported during the application of other oxidative treatments andreozzi et al 2003 el najjar et al 2014 was not observed in this study and the resulting short chain carboxylic acid anions acetate oxalate or formate were not identified probably due to the duration of the test and the conditions under which it was conducted low initial concentrations of the drug etc the pct molecule eluted at a retention time of 6 01 min the protonated molecule c8h10no2 at m z 152 0706 and the characteristic ion fragment c6h8no m z 110 0604 corresponding to the loss of the coch3 group were the main ions observed in the ms ms spectrum the following compounds were detected according to their order of elution in the lc chromatogram the first eluted compound at 2 46 min presented the ion formula c8h10no3 m z 168 0655 corresponding to the hydroxylation reaction in the benzene ring of pct tp168 c1 the rbd of 4 ring double bond corresponds to an aromatic ring 3 correspond to the double bonds and 1 to the ring itself this conclusion is reinforced by rdb value of 5 representing the number of rings and double bonds present in the molecule the ms ms spectra obtained yielded the fragment ions c8h8no2 c6h8no2 c7h10no and c6h6no the ion c8h8no2 m z 150 0550 corresponds to a neutral loss of h2o which is followed by the loss of the coch3 group to yield c6h6no m z 108 0443 finally the fragment c6h8no2 m z 126 0550 should correspond to the direct loss of the coch3 group similar to those observed in the pct molecule to yield the ion c6h8no m z 110 0604 which confirm that the hydroxylation takes place in the benzenic ring at 4 52 min a compound tp184 c2 was detected which should correspond to the additional hydroxylation of the benzene ring of pct also reported in the literature trovó et al 2012 producing a dihydroxylated intermediate of m z 184 0604 and molecular formula c8h10no4 the neutral loss of h2o yielded the ion fragment c8h8no3 at m z 166 0496 at 11 38 min the ions at m z 140 0392 112 039 and 70 0287 corresponding to c6h6no3 protonated molecule c5h6no2 and c3h4no respectively suggested the formation of a dihydroxy 4 iminocyclohexa 2 5 dienone derivative c3 tp140 the two ion fragments observed with three and five carbon atoms correspond to the breakage of the benzene ring the transformation products obtained here are in line with those reported by different authors yang et al 2008 dalmazio et al 2008 trovó et al 2012 who also identified nitrogenous organic compounds in the oxidation reaction the presence of which in the medium contributes to a residual toc concentration they contrast however with those obtained by villota et al 2016 when studying the oxidation of pct by means of the photo fenton process employing different molar ratios of h2o2 paracetamol these authors obtained organic compounds that did not contain nitrogen in their molecule which indicates that the n ring aromatic linkage had been cleaved on the other hand andreozzi et al 2003 when studying the degradation of paracetamol by ozonisation obtained a greater number of compounds in which the oxidation reaction broke down the nitrogen bond with the aromatic ring however when these same authors studied h2o2 uv oxidation this occurred as a result of both cleavage of the bond between the nitrogen and the benzene ring and oxidation of the aromatic ring itself from the data shown in table 5 it is possible to establish a possible pathway for pct although it should be pointed out that a drug can present several degradation pathways and generate different transformation products before being completely degraded or not depending on different variables as discussed above in the case of pct as it has got different functional groups amino carbonyl and hydroxyl groups it may undergo several oxidative attacks aromatic hydroxylation allylic and benzylic oxidations amine dealkylation amine oxidation etc thus different mechanisms can be described to explain the formation of some of the species thus obtained direct attacks of hydroxyl radicals on double ring bonds benzene ring cleavage decarboxylation reactions etc the mechanism proposed in this paper is shown in fig 4 and is similar to that published by trovó et al 2012 as all the compounds identified in both papers are quite similar the hydroxylation reaction of pct is produced in a first step yielding the monohydroxilated derivative c1 tp168 subsequently compound c1 tp168 simultaneously undergoes hydrolysis or oxidation reactions via hydroxylation it is transformed into c2 tp184 which is then transformed into c3 tp140 in which the carbonyl group of the aromatic ring molecule has already been separated off on the other hand the attack of the hydroxyl radical on the para position to the phenolic function lead to hydroquinone formation these compounds can further undergo another series of reactions to produce more recalcitrant compounds or co2 and water however the proposal made by villota et al 2016 for pct degradation is that when the paracetamol molecule is oxidized it may be broken down via different pathways one pathway would correspond to the rupture of the bond between the aromatic ring and the amino group giving rise to what would be a phenol molecule and an acetamide molecule the phenol molecule would continue its oxidation via di and tri hydroxylated para substituted rings hydroquinone hydroxylhydroquinone although the formation of ortho catechol pyrogallol and meta substituted resorcinol rings would also occur a second pathway followed by the pct molecule in its oxidation would be rupture of the bond between the nitrogen of the amino group and the keto group generating a molecule of 4 aminophenol and formic acid finally the third oxidation pathway would correspond to hydroxylation of the paracetamol molecule with two hydroxyl groups in the ortho position in the form of 3 hydroxyacetaminophen 3 3 2 degradation pathway of amoxicillin in principle establishing the degradation pathway of amx is more difficult than in the case of pct due to the greater functional richness of the former molecule this means that many oxidation pathways may arise and hence numerous intermediates may be formed aldehydes alcohols ketones organic acids etc table 6 shows the analytical information obtained from the lc qtof ms ms analyses although degradation mechanisms can be influenced by the type of treatment applied previous studies have reported various degradation pathways for amx trovó et al 2011 lamm et al 2009 which include typical hydroxylation reactions at the level of the benzene ring or the nitrogen atom of the acetylamino moiety the cleavage of the four membered β lactam ring the oxidation of the sulphur atom and other bond cleavage reactions gozlan et al 2013 in our study three major products were detected which according to their molecular masses elemental composition and rdb confirm the hydroxylation of the amx molecule by the formation of tp382 c1 and the opening of the four membered β lactam ring to yield amoxicillin penicilloic acid tp384 c2 which further loses co2 to form amoxicillin penicilloic acid descarboxylated tp340 c3 fig 5 shows a basic representation of the possible degradation pathway obtained the number of transformation products identified is low compared with those reported by other authors trovó et al 2011 probably as a consequence of the lower initial concentration of the drug used in our study and the different experimental conditions under which the oxidation process was carried out however the identification of these three compounds can indicate that they represent preferential routes this pathway is different however from that proposed by mo li li et al 2015 who studied the o3 fenton oxidation process establishing that in a first stage the amide group of amoxicillin is transformed into a nitro group subsequently the β lactam group is broken down by oxidation and the compounds thus formed are attacked by hydroxyl radicals the successive oxidation stages range from the rupture of the 5 atom ring to processes of desulphurization of the amx molecule denitrification decarboxylation etc finally yielding small molecules that are subsequently transformed into co2 and water 3 4 toxicity a toxicity study was conducted using the vibrio fischeri bacteria in experiment 5 to test whether the intermediates produced during the degradation of the contaminants were more toxic to this species than the original drugs for this purpose it was necessary to reconstitute lyophilized bacteria as described in the section on material and methods so as to study the change in bioluminescence that the bacteria underwent percent inhibition after 5 15 and 30 min versus a blank battery in a saline medium the results allow us to conclude that the vibrio fischeri bacteria did not show symptoms of inhibition at any of the reaction times studied here in fact the contrary was observed increasing hrt led to an increase in the percentage stimulation of their activity these results show that the transformation products that arise throughout the reaction are less toxic than the starting drugs 4 conclusions in the studies carried out with wwtp effluent toc removal was found to be dependent on the concentration of hydrogen peroxide when operating at concentrations of 2 75 ppm h2o2 the removal rate was 6 5 while at an h2o2 concentration of 5 0 ppm the removal rate was 20 in both cases it can be stated that no mineralization of the drugs took place the degradation pathways of both drugs were studied in both cases the identification of intermediates was based on the measurement of the accurate masses of the intermediates and their main fragments degradation of paracetamol occurs by hydroxylation reaction of the aromatic ring yielding mono and di hydroxylated derivatives another of the products found is hydroquinone which is formed by the attack of hydroxyl radicals on the aromatic ring in the case of amoxicillin the intermediates identified suggest the hydroxylation of the aromatic ring and the opening of the four membered β lactam ring and subsequent formation of amoxilloic acid and amoxicilloic acid as the main transformation pathways the degradation pathways identified are in accordance with those for these compounds in previous studies although the low initial concentrations studied and the scarce mineralization observed have not allowed for the identification of molecules corresponding to more advanced degradation stages acute toxicity for vibrio fischeri was not found in any case 
18904,the present study shows the results of solar photo fenton oxidation of paracetamol pct and amoxicillin amx fe2 so4 3 was used as the source of iron and edds as the iron complexing agent employing different doses of hydrogen peroxide two aqueous matrices a synthetic wastewater and real wastewater from el ejido wwtp effluent almeria were used in all cases the process was operated under conditions of natural sunlight results showed that the degradation of both drugs is favoured when the aqueous matrix presents low concentration of carbonates under the conditions studied here degradation percentages above 90 were obtained in the synthetic wastewater and 80 in the actual effluent the degradation products were determined using liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry with hybrid quadrupole time of flight analyser the intermediates detected throughout the oxidative process for both micro contaminants were mainly products of hydroxylation reactions the toxicity of the samples was determined using the bacterium vibrio fischeri in the acute toxicity test it was observed that the bacteria did not undergo inhibition in any of the cases however chronic toxicity studies showed that the higher the hydraulic retention time hrt employed in the assays the higher the bacterial inhibition graphical abstract image 1 keywords drugs wastewater solar photo fenton process intermediates 1 introduction in recent years the production and consumption of a number of pharmaceuticals has increased considerably due to the growth and development of society the most commonly consumed drugs include antibiotics analgesics and antipyretics liang et al 2018 in the case of antibiotics some authors have reported a 36 increase in consumption in 71 countries between 2000 and 2010 van boeckel et al 2014 penicillins comprise the most frequently consumed group of antibiotics in the european union other antibiotics such as amoxicillin amx are consumed in greater quantities in countries like india kotwani et al 2011 and brazil magalhães and borschiver 2012 amoxicillin amx is a β lactam antibiotic belonging to the aminopenicillin family among analgesics acetaminophen or paracetamol pct occupies the top of the list in a study carried out in 2003 by sebastine and wakeman 2003 paracetamol was classified as one of the top three drugs prescribed in england with more than 400 tons being consumed in that year the main problem with the high demand for these pharmaceutical products is that once they have been consumed they end up in the environment via different pathways whether as the result of human excretions unconsumed remains that are discharged together with wastewater waste produced by animals or via industrial wastewater effluents kummerer 2009 antibiotics have been detected in surface waters hirsch et al 1999 yan et al 2013 in groundwater barnes et al 2008 batt et al 2006 in drinking water benotti et al 2008 in sediments zhou et al 2011 and even in agricultural soil hu et al 2007 given the importance of these pollutants in the integrated water cycle their presence in the effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtp has been investigated in different countries fatta kassinos et al 2011 jones et al 2005 miao et al 2005 in the case of paracetamol a concentration of up to 6 μg l has been reported in effluents from european treatment plants ternes 1998 up to 10 μg l in natural waters in the usa kolpin et al 2002 and even above 65 μg l in the tyne river uk roberts and thomas 2006 one of the reasons these products reach the environment is because most wwtp are not designed to remove emerging pharmaceutical contaminants therefore it is of major interest to investigate what types of treatments allow the removal of these micro pollutants from wastewater different tertiary treatments have been assessed to remove these emerging pollutants including membrane filtration active carbon adsorption and advanced oxidation processes bolong et al 2009 among others advanced oxidation processes aop are oxidative processes based on the generation of highly oxidizing species such as hydroxyl radicals ho the main

uv vogna et al 2004 andreozzi et al 2003 skoumal et al 2006 and electrochemical treatment brillas et al 2005 sirés et al 2006 among others another aop used for the removal of this type of contaminant is the photo fenton process trovó et al 2011 2012 which involves the reaction between fe ions and hydrogen peroxide to form reactive species capable of oxidizing different organic compounds the main problems this type of process presents are the ph at which the reaction takes place ph 2 3 and the presence of carbonates in the water both of these drawbacks make the process more costly and economically unfeasible in order to avoid the high consumption of reagents involved in operating at ph 2 or 3 different complexing agents have been studied which keep the fe in solution thus avoiding its precipitation these include citrate oxalate edta and nta clarizia et al 2017 the importance of removing carbonates resides in the fact that they act as scavengers of ho radicals pignatello et al 2006 it has been proved that carbonates removal makes the photo fenton process both more effective and more economical klamerth et al 2012 taking all the above into account and given the scarcity of studies found in the literature on the degradation of pct and amx in urban wastewater and the actual concentrations found in this type of water the present study addresses the removal of two drugs amoxicillin amx and paracetamol pct present in the wastewater effluent using an advanced oxidation process namely the photo fenton reaction ethylenediamine disuccinic acid edds was used as the complexing agent in this study the use of this compound allows the reaction to be carried out at neutral ph and minimizes the use of reagents employed in the treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1

acn mobile phase b at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 the elution gradient was as follows 100 a for the first 10 min then 60 a to 100 b during the following 13 min samples were pre filtered through a 0 22 μm syringe filter and a 100 μl aliquot was injected into the hplc the detection wavelengths limits of quantitation loq and limits of detection lod for each pharmaceutical product are shown in table 1

run time was 13 min the sample injection volume was 20 μl and the flow rate was kept constant at 0 5 ml min 1 the hplc system was connected to a triple tof 5600 ab sciex mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization esi interface mineralization of the drugs during the photo fenton process was assessed by monitoring the dissolved organic carbon doc on a shimadzu toc vcsn analyser the total iron concentration was measured using the 1 10 phenanthroline method in accordance with iso 6332 hydrogen peroxide was measured using titanium oxysulphate iv following din 38402h15 anion

metrohm 850 professional ic configured for isocratic analysis sample measurements were made by injection after pre filtering using 0 22 μm pore syringe filters 2 3 toxicity the toxicity study during the photo fenton experiments was performed by analysing the inhibition of bioluminescence emitted by the marine bacterium vibrio fischeri bioluminescence was measured using a biofix lumi 10 luminometer and commercial macherey nagel biofix lumi multi shot luminescent bacteria kits for 200 samples ref 945007 which included the restorative solution samples were filtered through a 0 20 μm ptfe filter millipore millex gn to remove suspended solids the ph was adjusted to 6 8 and the salinity to 2 w v by adding nacl when needed lyophilized bacteria were reconstituted in 11 ml restorative solution stored at 4 c for 30 min and then incubated at 15 c the change in bioluminescence percent inhibition was measured after 5 15 and 30 min versus a blank battery in a saline medium 2 4 oxidation treatment the photo fenton experiments were carried out with natural solar radiation in a composite parabolic collector cpc photoreactor located at the plataforma solar de almería psa latitude 37 n longitude 2 4 w this apparatus consists of two cpc photoreactors whose reflector is made of highly anodized aluminium each module is mounted on an aluminium frame and consists of 12 tubes the entire structure is tilted at the same angle as the local latitude of the site 37 the two modules are connected in series and the working fluid flows directly from one to another and ends up in a 10 l spherical recirculating borosilicate glass tank the tank has a glass cover for inserting components required during the test such as reagents gas air oxygen inert gas etc ph electrodes and dissolved oxygen sensors the glass tank is placed under roof so light is not penetrating never the tank a centrifugal pump pan world model nh 100 px 100 w returns the fluid to the concentrators at a flow rate

cpc using simulated water from a wwtp effluent prepared in the laboratory and real effluent water discharged from el ejido wwtp the characterization of the simulated water and the effluent can be seen in table 3 five types of experiments were carried out in the solar cpc pilot plant in each of these experiments 35 l of water solutions at neutral ph ph 7 8 were used the necessary volume of a stock standard solution containing 1000 ppm of each drug in milliq water was added to these solutions to achieve a final concentration of 1 ppm of each compound experiments 1 and 2 were performed by using simulated wwtp effluent the behaviour of each drug was investigated separately in order to assess its degradation rate and to study its primary degradation subsequently another experiment was performed with a mixture of both compounds in the simulated wastewater experiment 3 the fourth and fifth experiments were carried out with treated effluent from the wwtp located in the municipality of el ejido almería and a mixture of both contaminants in these experiments carbonates were partly removed before starting the photo fenton process by adding a minimum amount of h2so4 0 5 1 ppm under stirring not to modify the ph of the treated water and to be able to work at neutral ph carbonate removal has been shown to make the photo fenton process more effective klamerth et al 2009 the contaminants under study were below the detection limits in pristine wastewater so for experiments 1 4 1 ppm of the drugs and the same reagent concentration were used to carry out the photo fenton reaction 3 ppm fe3 and 2 75 ppm h2o2 these concentrations were established following a study carried out by the present authors phd of mercedes hinojosa pending publication in a solar simulator to determine the optimum concentrations of reagents that eventually enabled a micropollutants degradation percentage of 90 the iron and drug concentrations were maintained in experiment 5 but the hrt was increased to 240 min and the h2o2 dose to 5 ppm to determine whether degradation of both contaminants could be achieved under these conditions because other authors trovó et al 2008 had obtained high degradation rates when working with higher h2o2 concentrations the fe2 so4 3 edds concentration was in the proportion of 1 2 the fe edds complex was prepared in the laboratory before each experiment by dissolving fe2 so4 3h2o in water at ph 3 adding edds and homogenizing the complex thus formed was then placed in the cpc reactor 35 l ensuring a ph of between 7 and 8 the water in the reactor was kept recirculating for about 5 min to obtain a homogeneous sample an initial sample was analysed to ensure operating with the required fe iii concentration after this time the h2o2 concentration 2 75 or 5 ppm was added and the collectors were uncovered to start the photo fenton reaction successive additions of hydrogen peroxide were made as the reaction progressed calculating the cost of these additions the experimental protocol has been detailed by other authors klamerth et al 2012 the degradation percentage was found to decrease to 70 in experiment 4 operating at 210 min hrt and making 6 additions of 2 75 ppm h2o2 for either of the two pollutants in experiment 5 three additions of 5 ppm hydrogen peroxide were made followed by a final addition of 10 ppm at 122 min as it was observed that the degradation of the contaminants did not reach 60 the experiments carried out with simulated wastewater experiments 1 to 3 lasted 60 min taking samples every 3 min experiment 4 carried out with wwtp effluent lasted 210 min and experiment 5 up to 240 min taking samples every 5 min in the first hour every 15 min for the next 2 h and every 20 min in the last hour the reason for prolonging experiments 4 and 5 lay in the characteristics of the wastewater being used as ho radicals are not selective for degradation and they are consumed by several wastewater components 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of paracetamol and amoxicillin via the photo fenton process experiments 1 and 2 were used to assess the degradation of both compounds separately table 4 shows the results obtained it can be seen that even when operating at low doses of fe and h2o2 the percentage of degraded compound increases as the oxidation process evolves obtaining 90 degradation in only a few minutes of reaction time 9 min for amx and 36 min for pct for experiment 3 mixture of 1 ppm of each pollutant a 50 min hrt was needed to obtain the same degradation percentage table 4 this rapid degradation may be due to the characteristics of the wastewater used in these experiments simulated wwtp effluent indeed the amount of organic matter and carbonates was lower in this type of water than in real effluents hence the hydroxyl radicals produced in the reaction attack the drugs directly inducing a high degradation rate and thus obtaining a high degree of efficiency in the photo fenton process klamerth et al 2009 the difference in degradation obtained in the experiments in which the drugs were treated individually experiments 1 and 2 and when working with a mixture of the two experiment 3 may be due to the antagonistic effect of the two pollutants this effect increases the degradation time however it should also be considered that in the first two trials 5 separate additions of 2 75 ppm hydrogen peroxide were made in all whereas only 4 such additions were made in the third experiment these results are in agreement with those obtained by klamerth 2010a 2010b who showed that high micro contaminant degradation rates can be achieved without ph adjustment and employing low concentrations of iron if there is no carbonate present the degradation of both compounds throughout the photo fenton process is shown in experiments 4 and 5 figs 1 and 2 respectively these experiments were carried out in wastewater matrix degradation was found to be much slower than in the previous trials with high amounts of non degraded contaminants remaining even when the reaction time was increased fig 1 shows the variation in the concentration of each pollutant versus hrt for experiment 4 it can be seen that degradation percentages of 70 were obtained for pct and of 66 for amx at 210 min after 6 additions of 2 75 ppm hydrogen peroxide in the 10th 30th 40th 90th 135th minutes and a last one in the 180th minute of reaction this slow degradation may be due to the presence of carbonates as they were not completely removed leaving concentrations of up to 44 ppm in the medium as already mentioned these compounds act as hydroxyl radical scavengers pignatello et al 2006 also the wastewater organic matter could act as ho scavenger fig 2 shows the degradation of each pollutant versus hrt for experiment 5 the differences with respect to experiment 4 are that the carbonate concentration was lower 36 ppm the hrt was increased to 240 min and the added hydrogen peroxide concentration changed to 3 additions of 5 ppm each one at the beginning of the reaction and another two in the 20th and 60th minutes followed by a final addition of 10 ppm in the 120th minute under these new conditions the amx degradation was faster and it reached higher levels than that obtained in experiment 4 97 while a pct degradation percentage of 80 was obtained versus 70 when the hydrogen peroxide dose was 2 75 ppm experiment 4 3 2 mineralization of the pharmaceuticals fig 3 shows the evolution of total organic carbon toc in experiments 1 2 and 3 toc came mainly from target pharmaceuticals and edds taking into account that the toc of the aqueous matrix is constant in the 3 experiments it can be asserted that the differences are mainly due to the toc accounted for by pharmaceutical products and edds initial toc in experiment 3 was higher than in the other trials due to the sum of toc coming from both drugs it is important to highlight that some toc reduction was detected in all the experiments the percentage of toc removal measured for each of the experiments was 19 5 in experiment 1 26 6 in experiment 2 and 26 5 in experiment 3 these results are in line with those of andreozzi et al 2003 who obtained 30 mineralization of the same drugs when working with ozone regarding experiments 4 and 5 the percentage of toc removed was even lower than for experiments 1 2 and 3 reaching only 6 5 for experiment 4 even when the hrt was higher 210 min and 21 for experiment 5 in those cases the presence of higher concentration of carbonates in the real effluent of the municipal wwtp as well as the presence of other organic carbon sources decreased the efficiency of the mineralization process finally the higher efficiency in toc abatement observed in experiment 5 compared to 4 was due to the addition of a higher amount of h2o2 as well as the longer reaction time 3 3 intermediates of the photo fenton reaction chemical oxidation processes occur through different pathways than biological oxidation processes usually the most important stages in a biological oxidation process are oxidative conversion of one of the two methyl groups of the alkyl chain to carboxylic group ω oxidation oxidative shortening of the alkyl chain in two units of carbon atoms β oxidation oxidative cleavage of the ring in chemical oxidation processes several active radicals are formed that can attack through many points in the molecule however in biological oxidation processes an enzyme has to be introduced into the molecule to form an enzyme substrate complex the compounds may follow different oxidation pathways depending on the aop applied in this case the solar photo fenton process the concentration of reagents used fe and h2o2 the type of substrate to be oxidized paracetamol or amoxicillin and the moles of h2o2 moles of substrate ratio hence many possible intermediates may be formed in the process villota et al 2016 in turn each oxidation pathway can take different routes depending on the process variables hence the difficulty arises of definitively establishing a single degradation pathway bearing all this in mind starting with experiment 5 in which mineralization of the compounds was not observed a study of the intermediates that arose as the reaction progressed was carried out it should be noted that no pre concentration was applied to the samples which were only filtered through a 0 22 μm cellulose nitrate membrane filter before lc ms analysis the molecular structure of the intermediates was determined on the basis of the high resolution mass spectra of the compounds detected provided by a lc qtof ms ms system which allows the determination of the elemental composition of the protonated molecules and their fragment ions with a high degree of accuracy tables 5 and 6 show information regarding the retention time accurate mass experimental and calculated error ppm and empirical formula for the protonated molecule and ms ms fragment ions of the main transformation products of pct and amx at 240 min reaction time 3 3 1 paracetamol degradation pathway table 5 shows the transformation products identified during the photo fenton treatment of pct operating in a cpc reactor at neutral ph with fe3 edds it should first be noted that all compounds except c5 c6h7o2 contain nitrogen in their molecules this clearly shows that no cleavage of the n c bond of the original pct molecule took place at the beginning of the process the aromatic ring cleavage also reported during the application of other oxidative treatments andreozzi et al 2003 el najjar et al 2014 was not observed in this study and the resulting short chain carboxylic acid anions acetate oxalate or formate were not identified probably due to the duration of the test and the conditions under which it was conducted low initial concentrations of the drug etc the pct molecule eluted at a retention time of 6 01 min the protonated molecule c8h10no2 at m z 152 0706 and the characteristic ion fragment c6h8no m z 110 0604 corresponding to the loss of the coch3 group were the main ions observed in the ms ms spectrum the following compounds were detected according to their order of elution in the lc chromatogram the first eluted compound at 2 46 min presented the ion formula c8h10no3 m z 168 0655 corresponding to the hydroxylation reaction in the benzene ring of pct tp168 c1 the rbd of 4 ring double bond corresponds to an aromatic ring 3 correspond to the double bonds and 1 to the ring itself this conclusion is reinforced by rdb value of 5 representing the number of rings and double bonds present in the molecule the ms ms spectra obtained yielded the fragment ions c8h8no2 c6h8no2 c7h10no and c6h6no the ion c8h8no2 m z 150 0550 corresponds to a neutral loss of h2o which is followed by the loss of the coch3 group to yield c6h6no m z 108 0443 finally the fragment c6h8no2 m z 126 0550 should correspond to the direct loss of the coch3 group similar to those observed in the pct molecule to yield the ion c6h8no m z 110 0604 which confirm that the hydroxylation takes place in the benzenic ring at 4 52 min a compound tp184 c2 was detected which should correspond to the additional hydroxylation of the benzene ring of pct also reported in the literature trovó et al 2012 producing a dihydroxylated intermediate of m z 184 0604 and molecular formula c8h10no4 the neutral loss of h2o yielded the ion fragment c8h8no3 at m z 166 0496 at 11 38 min the ions at m z 140 0392 112 039 and 70 0287 corresponding to c6h6no3 protonated molecule c5h6no2 and c3h4no respectively suggested the formation of a dihydroxy 4 iminocyclohexa 2 5 dienone derivative c3 tp140 the two ion fragments observed with three and five carbon atoms correspond to the breakage of the benzene ring the transformation products obtained here are in line with those reported by different authors yang et al 2008 dalmazio et al 2008 trovó et al 2012 who also identified nitrogenous organic compounds in the oxidation reaction the presence of which in the medium contributes to a residual toc concentration they contrast however with those obtained by villota et al 2016 when studying the oxidation of pct by means of the photo fenton process employing different molar ratios of h2o2 paracetamol these authors obtained organic compounds that did not contain nitrogen in their molecule which indicates that the n ring aromatic linkage had been cleaved on the other hand andreozzi et al 2003 when studying the degradation of paracetamol by ozonisation obtained a greater number of compounds in which the oxidation reaction broke down the nitrogen bond with the aromatic ring however when these same authors studied h2o2 uv oxidation this occurred as a result of both cleavage of the bond between the nitrogen and the benzene ring and oxidation of the aromatic ring itself from the data shown in table 5 it is possible to establish a possible pathway for pct although it should be pointed out that a drug can present several degradation pathways and generate different transformation products before being completely degraded or not depending on different variables as discussed above in the case of pct as it has got different functional groups amino carbonyl and hydroxyl groups it may undergo several oxidative attacks aromatic hydroxylation allylic and benzylic oxidations amine dealkylation amine oxidation etc thus different mechanisms can be described to explain the formation of some of the species thus obtained direct attacks of hydroxyl radicals on double ring bonds benzene ring cleavage decarboxylation reactions etc the mechanism proposed in this paper is shown in fig 4 and is similar to that published by trovó et al 2012 as all the compounds identified in both papers are quite similar the hydroxylation reaction of pct is produced in a first step yielding the monohydroxilated derivative c1 tp168 subsequently compound c1 tp168 simultaneously undergoes hydrolysis or oxidation reactions via hydroxylation it is transformed into c2 tp184 which is then transformed into c3 tp140 in which the carbonyl group of the aromatic ring molecule has already been separated off on the other hand the attack of the hydroxyl radical on the para position to the phenolic function lead to hydroquinone formation these compounds can further undergo another series of reactions to produce more recalcitrant compounds or co2 and water however the proposal made by villota et al 2016 for pct degradation is that when the paracetamol molecule is oxidized it may be broken down via different pathways one pathway would correspond to the rupture of the bond between the aromatic ring and the amino group giving rise to what would be a phenol molecule and an acetamide molecule the phenol molecule would continue its oxidation via di and tri hydroxylated para substituted rings hydroquinone hydroxylhydroquinone although the formation of ortho catechol pyrogallol and meta substituted resorcinol rings would also occur a second pathway followed by the pct molecule in its oxidation would be rupture of the bond between the nitrogen of the amino group and the keto group generating a molecule of 4 aminophenol and formic acid finally the third oxidation pathway would correspond to hydroxylation of the paracetamol molecule with two hydroxyl groups in the ortho position in the form of 3 hydroxyacetaminophen 3 3 2 degradation pathway of amoxicillin in principle establishing the degradation pathway of amx is more difficult than in the case of pct due to the greater functional richness of the former molecule this means that many oxidation pathways may arise and hence numerous intermediates may be formed aldehydes alcohols ketones organic acids etc table 6 shows the analytical information obtained from the lc qtof ms ms analyses although degradation mechanisms can be influenced by the type of treatment applied previous studies have reported various degradation pathways for amx trovó et al 2011 lamm et al 2009 which include typical hydroxylation reactions at the level of the benzene ring or the nitrogen atom of the acetylamino moiety the cleavage of the four membered β lactam ring the oxidation of the sulphur atom and other bond cleavage reactions gozlan et al 2013 in our study three major products were detected which according to their molecular masses elemental composition and rdb confirm the hydroxylation of the amx molecule by the formation of tp382 c1 and the opening of the four membered β lactam ring to yield amoxicillin penicilloic acid tp384 c2 which further loses co2 to form amoxicillin penicilloic acid descarboxylated tp340 c3 fig 5 shows a basic representation of the possible degradation pathway obtained the number of transformation products identified is low compared with those reported by other authors trovó et al 2011 probably as a consequence of the lower initial concentration of the drug used in our study and the different experimental conditions under which the oxidation process was carried out however the identification of these three compounds can indicate that they represent preferential routes this pathway is different however from that proposed by mo li li et al 2015 who studied the o3 fenton oxidation process establishing that in a first stage the amide group of amoxicillin is transformed into a nitro group subsequently the β lactam group is broken down by oxidation and the compounds thus formed are attacked by hydroxyl radicals the successive oxidation stages range from the rupture of the 5 atom ring to processes of desulphurization of the amx molecule denitrification decarboxylation etc finally yielding small molecules that are subsequently transformed into co2 and water 3 4 toxicity a toxicity study was conducted using the vibrio fischeri bacteria in experiment 5 to test whether the intermediates produced during the degradation of the contaminants were more toxic to this species than the original drugs for this purpose it was necessary to reconstitute lyophilized bacteria as described in the section on material and methods so as to study the change in bioluminescence that the bacteria underwent percent inhibition after 5 15 and 30 min versus a blank battery in a saline medium the results allow us to conclude that the vibrio fischeri bacteria did not show symptoms of inhibition at any of the reaction times studied here in fact the contrary was observed increasing hrt led to an increase in the percentage stimulation of their activity these results show that the transformation products that arise throughout the reaction are less toxic than the starting drugs 4 conclusions in the studies carried out with wwtp effluent toc removal was found to be dependent on the concentration of hydrogen peroxide when operating at concentrations of 2 75 ppm h2o2 the removal rate was 6 5 while at an h2o2 concentration of 5 0 ppm the removal rate was 20 in both cases it can be stated that no mineralization of the drugs took place the degradation pathways of both drugs were studied in both cases the identification of intermediates was based on the measurement of the accurate masses of the intermediates and their main fragments degradation of paracetamol occurs by hydroxylation reaction of the aromatic ring yielding mono and di hydroxylated derivatives another of the products found is hydroquinone which is formed by the attack of hydroxyl radicals on the aromatic ring in the case of amoxicillin the intermediates identified suggest the hydroxylation of the aromatic ring and the opening of the four membered β lactam ring and subsequent formation of amoxilloic acid and amoxicilloic acid as the main transformation pathways the degradation pathways identified are in accordance with those for these compounds in previous studies although the low initial concentrations studied and the scarce mineralization observed have not allowed for the identification of molecules corresponding to more advanced degradation stages acute toxicity for vibrio fischeri was not found in any case
