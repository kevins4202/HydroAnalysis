20270,we conduct performance analyses of a family of vertical axis water turbines vawts under single phase water and two phase open channel flow conditions using unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans numerical simulations the performance including self starting capability and energy harvesting efficiency of a recently developed hybrid darrieus modified savonius hdms design is examined under single phase water flow conditions with a two way coupled fluid structure interaction fsi approach we demonstrate that the water turbine has excellent self starting capability after that the effects of the reynolds number tip speed ratio tsr and geometric design of the turbine including turbine size solidity and number of blades are systematically studied since the main function of the modified savonius rotor is to assist self start and this part has a negligible effect on energy harvesting performance when the turbine is under stable operation only the darrieus rotor is studied under two phase open channel flow conditions to save computational cost a key finding is that larger blockage ratios result in better energy harvesting performance of the water turbines when the blockage ratio is 60 and the tsr of the turbine is 5 0 the power coefficient of the water turbine can reach up to 73 which exceeds betz s limit keywords vertical axis water turbine hybrid darrieus and modified savonius design self start energy harvesting efficiency fluid structure interaction open channel flow 1 introduction hydrokinetic energy is one important type of clean renewable energy which does not generate toxic pollution or greenhouse gases in the process of electricity production much research has demonstrated that turbine technologies are highly related to the cost and performance of energy production in both offshore and onshore areas fertahi et al 2018 zamani et al 2016a in this study we focus on analyzing the performance of vertical axis water turbines khan et al 2009 kumar and saini 2016 which are suitable for hydrokinetic energy harvesting in regions such as rivers estuaries and canals most of previous works on vawts focus on either darrieus or savonius turbines here we first give a brief review of them more works can be found in the contemporary reviews khan et al 2009 kumar and saini 2016 and then discuss a recently developed hybrid vertical axis turbine design liu et al 2019 and its application to hydrokinetic energy harvesting both experimental and numerical approaches have been utilized to study water turbines hwang et al 2009 used an active blade pitch control system to improve the energy harvesting performance of a darrieus water turbine elbatran et al 2017 demonstrated that using ducted nozzle savonius water turbine can increase the power efficiency of the turbine system the research by velasco velasco et al 2017 presented that active flow control with synthetic jets can improve the energy harvesting efficiency of darrieus water turbines laín et al 2018 indicated that adding winglets to the tip of a darrieus blade can enhance its energy harvesting capability under water flow conditions li et al 2014 studied the effect of the ratio between the turbine height and radius on its energy harvesting performance of a darrieus water turbine and found that there exists an optimal ratio for reliable maximum power output li and calışal 2010 carried out a study of a twin darrieus water turbine system and found that the total power output of the twin turbine system with an optimal layout can exceed two times that of a stand alone turbine in general previous studies reach a consensus that the lift driven darrieus turbine has better energy harvesting capability than the drag driven savonius turbine at relatively large tsrs but has poor self starting capability when the tsr is small while the savonius turbine has good self starting capability at relatively small tsrs due to its drag driven features but its power efficiency is low at the energy harvesting stage a hybrid design such as that developed for vertical axis wind turbines fertahi et al 2018 liu et al 2019 wakui et al 2005 liang et al 2017 may synthesize the advantages of individual darrieus or savonius designs while surmounting their disadvantages as a matter of fact when operating in single phase water flows without free surface effects vertical axis water turbines have similar performance with vertical axis wind turbines li et al 2013 karimian and abdolahifar 2020 abdalrahman et al 2017 su et al 2020 mohamed et al 2020 mohamed et al 2019 as demonstrated in section 3 1 this motivates us to adapt a hybrid darrieus modified savonius design of a vertical axis wind turbine from our previous work liu et al 2019 for hydrokinetic energy harvesting the hdms turbine has a savonius rotor inside and three darrieus blades around the self starting capability and energy harvesting efficiency of the hdms turbine has been investigated in the context of wind energy harvesting results indicate that the hybrid design can circumvent the weaknesses of individual darrieus and savonius designs by engineering nonlinear dynamic interaction between the two we note that similar hybrid designs have been used for hydropower collection for example fertahi et al 2018 has conducted numerical and experimental studies for a hybridization of savonius and darrieus water turbine under different tsr conditions and found that the energy harvesting performance of a design with an asynchronous coupling of savonius and darrieus rotors is better than that of other designs mosbahi et al 2020 combined a delta bladed darrieus turbine with a savonius one and studied the energy harvesting performance of different savonius and darrieus designs in a limited tsr range i e smaller than one no previous studies have systematically analyzed the energy harvesting performance of hybrid turbine designs with different dynamic kinematic and geometric parameters in water flows in this work results from comprehensive analyses of the hdms water turbine s performance under different flow and operating conditions are presented and discussed we specifically focus on analyzing the crossflow hdms vawt design yu and zhu 2020 as illustrated in fig 1 in this design two crossflow vawts are grouped together to share one gearbox and one generator thus lowering the installation and maintenance cost the crossflow design concept has been adopted by the marine renewable energy industry see for example the turbine generator unit tgu developed by ocean renewable power company orpc inc oprc 2021 we mention that although water turbines share many design similarities with wind turbines there are several unique features for water turbines first a constant pressure gradient due to hydrostatic conditions may affect the performance of water turbines according to our tests this has negligible influence on the performance of crossflow vawts studied here see section 2 4 for more details second the reynolds number of a vawt is usually higher than that of the wind turbine of the same size for example state of the art hydrokinetic energy harvesting devices usually operate at high water flow speeds e g greater than 2 25 m s velasco et al 2017 laín et al 2018 thus for a vawt with a diameter d around 2 m bianchini et al 2017 maître et al 2013 mejia and quiñones 2018 velasco et al 2017 the reynolds number r e ρ u d μ based on the freestream velocity and turbine diameter is often larger than 4 5 10 6 for wind turbines of the same size operating in the wind speed ranging from 5 m s to 15 m s ruffino et al 2018 li et al 2013 marinić kragić et al 2019 shahizare et al 2016 zamani et al 2016b firdaus et al 2015 the reynolds numbers fall into the range between 0 8 10 6 and 2 4 10 6 in this work we investigate the effect of the reynolds number on the hdms water turbine in single phase water flows especially in the reynolds number range where wind turbines of the same size can hardly achieve we note that the reynolds number can also be defined locally as r e l ρ r ω c μ where r d 2 is the radius of the turbine ω is the angular velocity of the turbine and c is the chord length of the darrieus blade note that the tsr is defined as λ r ω u and the solidity of the turbine is defined as σ n c π d where n is the number of the darrieus blades therefore the ratio between r e l based on local flow measurements and r e based on global ones is r e l r e π λ σ n this indicates that local flow features of the darrieus rotor measured by r e l are jointly determined by the global reynolds number of the entire turbine tsr solidity and blade number in this study we examine the effect of each parameter on the turbine performance with the other three fixed last but not least free water air surfaces can affect the performance of water turbines when they are operating in open channel flows houlsby and vogel 2017 have carried out a theoretical analysis by linear momentum actuator disc theory lmadt they found that the performance of the water turbine in open channel flows can exceed betz s limit the reason is that the potential energy loss due to the free surface position change can be extracted by the water turbine whelan et al 2009 used blade element momentum bem approach and experimental data obtained by a porous disc and strip to demonstrate that the tangential force coefficient in a highly blocked open channel flow is higher than that in the unblocked flow chamorro et al 2013 has conducted an open channel experimental test with a horizontal axis water turbine hawt and the blockage ratio is about 6 and their maximum power coefficient is about 45 which is below betz s limit nishi et al 2017 found that the superior energy harvesting performance observed from their hawt experiment in open channel flows is due to that the energy collection device was not filled with water after the correction the power coefficient from the free surface flow is even smaller than that from the single phase flow hocine et al 2019 tested the power coefficient of a vawt half immersed in an open channel flow by a 2 5d numerical simulation i e a three dimensional 3d simulation without considering the blade tip effects and their maximum power coefficient is about 32 which is lower than the power coefficient in the single phase flow apparently no consensus on whether the blockage effect shown up in the open channel flow can enhance the hydrodynamic performance of a water turbine has been reached in previous studies in addition from the numerical simulation perspective studying the performance of water turbines in open channel flows remains challenging due to the large computational cost to capture the intricate flow physics induced by the free water air surface effect in this work we aim to provide high fidelity flow simulation results to further explain the blockage effect on the crossflow water turbine operating in open channel flows specifically we examine the performance of the darrieus rotor of the hdms vawt in open channel flows with different blockage ratios note that the main function of the modified savonius rotor of the hdms turbine is to assist self start and this part has a negligible effect on energy harvesting performance when the turbine is under stable operation liu et al 2019 therefore only the darrieus rotor is used in two phase open channel flow simulations to save computational cost contributions in this work we systematically analyze the performance of vawts under either single phase water or two phase open channel flow conditions first the self starting capability of an innovative hdms design in single phase water flows is tested with a two way coupled fsi approach note that the self starting capability cannot be examined through traditional computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations with prescribed motion of the structure we further perform a comprehensive study of the effects of dynamic kinematic and geometric parameters that can affect the energy harvesting performance of the hdms vawt to reveal flow physics of vawts in single phase water flows these parameters include the reynolds number tsr turbine size solidity and number of blades furthermore we demonstrate superior performance of a darrieus type vawt fully submerged in open channel flows with high fidelity numerical simulations and explain the underlying flow physics chapter overview in section 2 numerical methods and simulation setup are introduced and verified there we explain the two way coupled fsi strategy and verify the independence of results from meshes turbulence models and hydrostatic conditions in section 3 numerical results are presented and discussed specifically in section 3 1 the self starting capability of the hdms vawt is affirmed with fsi analyses in section 3 2 the effects of different parameters on the energy harvesting performance of the water turbine in single phase water flows are studied then in section 3 3 the energy harvesting performance of a darrieus turbine in open channel flows with varying blockage ratios is studied section 4 concludes the study and discusses possible future works 2 computational models and simulation setup 2 1 computational models of vawts in this study two dimensional 2d computational models are adopted to analyze the performance of hdms vawts the geometric configuration of the original design is shown in fig 2 a specifically it consists of a three bladed darrieus h shaped rotor and a three bladed ms rotor a modified naca0015 airfoil with a round trailing edge is used for the darrieus h shaped rotor the diameter d of the entire turbine varies from 0 7 m to 14 m the chord length of outer darrieus blades varies based on the solidity of the turbine the inner modified savonius ms rotor blades with specially designed curvature see us patent 2011014261a1 anderson 2010 are attached to the shaft and are 120 o apart from each other the radius of the ms rotor is equal to the chord length of the original darrieus blade outside the blade tip of the ms rotor is aligned with the aerodynamic center of the corresponding blade in the darrieus rotor and for the other designs shown in fig 2 b f the ratios between the radius of the ms rotor and the radius of the entire turbine are fixed to the value of the original design the solidity of the original design shown in fig 2 a is calculated from σ n c π d as 0 1364 meanwhile different designs of the hdms vawt as shown in fig 2 are also investigated these designs include a three bladed turbine with double solidity compared to the original one see fig 2 b a three bladed turbine with half solidity compared to the original one see fig 2 c a five bladed turbine with 5 3 solidity compared to the original one see fig 2 d a six bladed turbine with the same solidity as the original design see fig 2 e and a nine bladed turbine with the same solidity as the original design see fig 2 f these 2d profiles can be treated as 3d vawts with a large height radius or aspect ratio under which scenario the blade tip effects can be neglected many researchers liu et al 2019 danao et al 2014 wekesa et al 2015 ferreira et al 2007 castelli et al 2010 beri and yao 2011 nobile et al 2014 trivellato and castelli 2014 wang et al 2016 have already demonstrated that 2d models can predict the efficiency and hydrodynamic behaviors of vertical axis wind turbines reasonably well with reduced computational cost therefore 2d models are used exclusively in all the simulations in this study the schematic illustration of the computational domain and boundary conditions can be found in liu et al 2019 to measure the performance of vawts several parameters namely angular velocity θ hydrodynamic moment m w a t e r and power coefficient c p o w e r are used in this study once the hydrodynamic moment m w a t e r and the angular velocity θ of the water turbine are obtained the power p extracted from the water flow is calculate as follows 1 p m w a t e r θ the total power in the incoming water passing across the turbine with a reference area a can be calculated using the following equation 2 p m a x 1 2 ρ u 3 a finally the power coefficient c p is calculated as 3 c p p p m a x based on betz s law the maximum value of the time averaged power coefficient c p is 59 3 in a single phase open flow betz 1966 2 2 numerical framework of fluid rigid body interaction the governing equations of fluid flow are the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations in this study the turbulence model is selected as the shear stress transport sst k ω model the accuracy and stability of which have been proved by many other researchers zanforlin 2018 yang and lawn 2011 2013 marsh et al 2016 mejia and quiñones 2018 the urans is simulated using the ansys fluent 15 0 high performance computing hpc software to test the self starting capability of vawts using the fsi approach the flow solver is coupled with the kinematics equation of the turbine which is specified in the user defined functions udfs the turbine kinematics is modeled as follows for a rigid vawt which rotates with respect to its shaft the kinematics equation is 4 i θ m w a t e r m l o a d herein i is the moment of inertia θ is the angular acceleration m w a t e r is the hydrodynamic moment and m l o a d is the external load which can be from the generator and or the transmission system such as the gearbox for practical hydro energy harvesting applications the external load can be an intricate function of the angular velocity θ and or acceleration θ of the turbine in this study a linear relationship between m l o a d and θ is assumed namely m l o a d c θ where c is the damping factor thus eq 4 can be expressed as 5 i θ c θ m w a t e r note that in the ansys fluent software m w a t e r is calculated via the integration of the product of distributed forces i e pressure and viscous forces over the surfaces of the turbine and their distances to the shaft the moment coefficient c m is evaluated as c m m w a t e r 0 5 ρ u 2 a l where u is the freestream velocity a is the reference area and l is the reference length after the kinematics equation of the water turbine system is specified a partitioned two way coupled fsi algorithm can be developed as follows first the flow solver simulates the fluid flow and it gives the hydrodynamic moment m w a t e r in eq 4 then the angular velocity θ and angular displacement θ are expressed through numerical integration using a fourth order multi point adams moulton formulation snyder et al 2003 and determined by plugging eq 5 into the discrete angular velocity and displacement formulations thus new boundary conditions for the flow solver are available for the next time step to get a new hydrodynamic moment for achieving the coupling between the fluid flow and turbine kinematics 2 3 simulation setup the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple algorithm with a second order upwind spatial discretization scheme are utilized to solve the fluid flow equations for the time marching solver a second order implicit scheme is selected to ensure the accuracy of the time integration the sst k ω turbulence model is used for all the simulations presented in this study the turbulence viscosity ratio is set to 5 and the turbulence intensity is set to 10 for the freestream the residual convergence criterion is set to 10 4 to ensure convergence within each physical time step the simulation parameters are summarized in table 1 in all simulations the mesh motion is achieved through the sliding mesh algorithm 2 4 verification and validation of the numerical setup in this study meshes near the wall boundaries of both outer darrieus and inner savonius blades have good resolution similar to those in liu et al 2019 to ensure that numerical results are independent of mesh resolution a mesh refinement study is carried out using three sets of meshes as shown in fig 3 a b and c therein the coarse mesh consists of 71 940 elements medium one 221 840 elements and fine one 715 680 near the darrieus blades the refinement is carried out in both the radial and circumferential directions simultaneously the mesh refinement study is conducted for a vawt with a diameter d 1 4 m freestream velocity u 2 5 m s and t s r 2 5 the results are presented in table 2 we observe that the differences of the power coefficient between the medium and fine meshes are minuscule in addition the histories of the moment coefficient are presented in figs 4 and 5 it shows that the moment coefficient histories of these three sets of mesh are almost indistinguishable therefore the medium mesh is selected to conduct numerical simulation to save computational cost in the study by maître et al 2013 it was demonstrated that the near wall grid has a significant effect on the urans numerical simulations for darrieus water turbines the grid quality is reflected by the value of the non dimensional wall distance y and their reference value of the mean y is 0 71 note that y is a non dimensional wall distance defined as y u h ν where u is the friction velocity h is the size of the first mesh layer and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid fig 4 presents the mean y at five different times during one arbitrarily selected revolution of the vawt with the medium mesh shown in fig 3 we observe that the mean y of this case is about 0 4 which is smaller than the reference value in maître et al 2013 to investigate the effect of turbulence models simulation results using the spalart allmaras s a turbulence model are compared to those with the sst k ω model two cases are simulated for comparison namely the cases with d 1 4 m t s r 2 5 u 2 5 m s and u 3 0 m s respectively the time averaged power coefficients c p and moment coefficient histories obtained from different turbulence models are displayed in fig 6 a and b the mean c p s from the s a model are slightly smaller than the results from the sst k ω model in both cases 47 98 versus 50 30 and 49 36 versus 51 77 respectively the moment coefficient histories of the two turbulence models show excellent agreement with each other thus the influence of the turbulence model can be neglected in this study to investigate the effect of the hydrostatic conditions two simulations are performed the geometric configurations are the same as those in the turbulence model study shown above the freestream velocity is set to 0 5 m s and the tsr is 2 5 in one case the gravitational acceleration g 9 81 k g m s 2 is turned on in the vertical i e negative y direction and the other is not we observe from fig 7 that the differences between the two cases in both the moment coefficient history and the time averaged power coefficient are almost undistinguishable therefore the effect of gravity is negligible and it is not employed in the simulations performed in the rest of this work the same approach has been used in other researchers work on water turbines maître et al 2013 laín et al 2018 we mention that benchmark tests of vertical axis wind turbines using both 2d urans model and 2 5d large eddy simulation les model with different time step sizes have been performed in our previous work liu et al 2019 our results from both 2d urans model and 2 5d les model have good agreement with the numerical results from li et al 2013 moreover the result of 2 5d les model agrees reasonably well with the experimental result by mclaren 2011 and these results also unveil the optimal time step size δ t 0 001 s which is also adopted in the simulations presented here note that in the works by sørensen and michelsen 2004 and travin et al 2002 the authors suggested that the non dimensional time step τ δ t u c can be about 0 01 and 0 025 to handle the unsteady flow features the smaller the τ is the better the flow resolution is in our cases the largest τ based on the maximum free stream velocity i e 3 5 m s and the minimum chord length i e 0 2 m is about 0 0175 within the suggested range 3 results and discussions 3 1 self starting capability of hdms vawts using the fsi approach as discussed by dominy et al 2007 researchers have different definitions of the self starting capability of a vawt and no consensus of the term self starting has been achieved in this study we use the same approach in liu et al 2019 the self starting capability of a vawt is defined as that the turbine can reach the desirable tsrs under nominal water flow conditions without external load as a result the turbines can effectively harvest hydro energy when appropriate energy collectors in the form of external load are activated in this self starting capability study the original three bladed hdms design with d 1 4 m is selected for tests note that it has been found from our previous study liu et al 2019 that this design can effectively balance the self starting capability and energy harvesting performance when operating in low speed wind the freestream velocity u of the single phase water flow is set to 1 m s which is relatively low compared to that used in other researchers work marsh et al 2016 maître et al 2013 note that the moment of inertia of the vawt plays a significant role on the self starting capability liu et al 2019 in this study the moment of inertia of the vawt is set to 10 0 k g m 2 or equivalently the moment of inertia per unit length is 10 0 k g m note that to avoid any confusion about the unit of a physical quantity such as the moment of inertia we will always assume that the default height of a 2d geometry is 1 m thus the dimension of any physical quantity can be described in its 3d format the simulation procedure follows our previous work liu et al 2019 first the vawt is put under free loading conditions thus the damping factor c in eq 5 is set to zero after the free loading period a damping factor c 20 k g m 2 s is used to generate external load m l o a d c θ on the turbine to examine whether the vawt can still maintain reasonably high tsr and harvest hydrokinetic energy note that the choice of the damping factor values in real life applications depends on the features of the physical system liu et al 2019 a rule of thumb to determine a reasonable damping factor value is to select a value e g through trial and error that can support the tsr of the turbine between two and three under which the turbine can have a high power coefficient the tsr history of the self starting test is shown in fig 8 we observe that during the free loading period the vawt rotates in the clockwise direction at the very beginning and then rotates back in the counterclockwise direction next the tsr of the vawt surges to a relatively high value over 5 5 eventually the tsr gradually decreases to a stable and periodic stage which is about 4 5 similar phenomenon has been observed from the hdms wind turbine in liu et al 2019 after the free loading period an external load with the damping factor c 20 k g m 2 s is exerted on the turbine to collect energy therefore the tsr decreases and reaches a stable stage around 2 9 the water turbine can then generate power to support energy consumption by the external load the power coefficient c p is about 40 at this stage based on the definition of the self starting capability at the beginning of this section we conclude that the design tested here has good self starting capability the normalized vorticity in the z direction of this hdms vawt under water flow condition and wind air conditions at its stable power generating stage are presented in fig 9 a and b for comparison we observe that the two vorticity fields share many similarities although the reynolds number of the water turbine nearly doubles that of the wind turbine for more self starting capability comparisons between hybrid turbine designs with different inertias damping factors and geometric configurations such as the radius ratio and relative position between the inner savonius and outer darrieus rotors readers are referred to liu et al 2019 3 2 energy harvesting performance analysis of hdms vawts using the prescribed motion approach in single phase flows 3 2 1 performance analysis of the original hdms vawt design researchers araya and dabiri 2015 liu et al 2019 have already demonstrated that the motor driven turbine i e a turbine with the prescribed motion can reproduce the physics of a wind driven turbine under certain conditions therefore to precisely control the tsr with different freestream velocities the prescribed motion approach is adopted for this study herein the vawt simulations are conducted with various freestream velocities u from 0 25 m s to 3 5 m s which lead to the reynolds number r e ρ u d μ from 3 48 10 5 to 4 88 10 6 the tsr is set to 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 for each freestream velocity respectively fig 10 shows the relationship between the power coefficient c p of the original design of this hdms turbine see fig 2 a and the turbine diameter d 1 4 m and the u and the corresponding r e together with tsrs in the single phase water flow note that unless specifically mentioned the power coefficient c p is for the entire turbine consisting of the darrieus and savonius rotors from fig 10 we observe that the inner savonius rotor contributes little to the total power harvesting performance for all cases with different u and tsrs specifically the absolute value of the c p contributed by the inner savonius rotor is relatively insignificant about 1 or less compared to the total c p created by both the darrieus and savonius rotors thus the effect of the inner savonius rotor on the total energy harvesting performance can be neglected and the total energy harvesting performance is dominated by the outer darrieus blades the similar phenomenon has been observed for wind turbines liu et al 2019 we reiterate the purpose of the inner savonius design is to assist self start of the turbine we also observe in fig 10 that when the freestream velocity u is 0 25 m s the c p obtained by using t s r 2 0 has the lowest value 7 6 compared to the c p using the other two tsrs meanwhile the c p obtained by using t s r 3 0 has the highest value compared to the other two cases the reason is that the relatively low u and tsr lead to dynamic stall over the outer darrieus blades as shown in fig 11 a see the severe flow separation over the darrieus blade in the southwest this dynamic stall can significantly decrease the hydrodynamic moment acting on the darrieus turbines therefore the total energy harvesting performance at t s r 2 0 is worse than that at the other two tsrs when u 0 25 m s from fig 11 which shows the flow field of the normalized vorticity in the z direction we find that the darrieus blade in the southwest of the case with u 0 25 m s and t s r 2 0 see fig 11 a encounters large dynamic stall however when the tsr reaches 3 0 as shown in fig 11 b the dynamic stall is suppressed over the blade at the same position this dynamic stall mitigation is due to the decrease of angles of attack aoas resulted by the relatively high tsr for example the local aoa of the darrieus blade in the southwest in fig 11 is decreased from 28 68 in a to 17 14 in b the values of c p under different u and tsr conditions are documented in table 3 combining table 3 and fig 10 we find that for the original hdms turbine design there exists an optimal reynolds number range near r e 4 17 10 6 for operation no matter what tsrs are used we also observe that when the freestream flow speed is fixed there exists an optimal tsr around 2 5 specifically when u is greater than 0 25 m s all cases with t s r 2 5 have the highest c p compared to the cases with the other two tsrs the maximum c p obtained from this study is 51 77 when t s r 2 5 and u 3 0 m s equivalently r e 4 17 10 6 note that this value is over 80 of betz s limit fig 12 a and b show the normalized vorticity fields in the z direction when u 3 0 m s t s r 2 0 and 3 0 respectively we find in fig 12 a that the flow separation is less obvious over the blade in the southwest compared to that in fig 11 a when u 0 25 m s at the same position obviously the reynolds number when u 3 0 m s is about one order of magnitude larger than that when u 0 25 m s the turbulent boundary layer at higher reynolds numbers can be more resilient to flow separation over the darrieus blades from fig 12 b we observe that the higher tsr 3 0 can further suppress the flow separation over the turbine blades however as seen in table 3 the power coefficient decreases this is closely related to the variation of local aoas of the darrieus blades which determines the variation of the lift force on the blades specially within the stall aoa the suppression of leading edge vortices indicates small lift generation on the blades causing a performance penalty on the turbine the resultant hydrodynamic forces acting on one single outer darrieus blade can be decomposed into two components the normal force f n perpendicular to the chord and the tangential force f t parallel to the chord based on the works by mclaren 2011 and li et al 2013 the tangential and normal force coefficients for 2d problems are defined as c t f t 0 5 ρ u 2 c c n f n 0 5 ρ u 2 c fig 13 shows the comparison of tangential and normal force coefficients with respect to the blade position of five different freestream velocities u from 0 25 m s to 3 5 m s the behaviors of the c t and c n from all the cases in the single phase flow show certain similarity both the force coefficients grows when the blade starts passing through the upstream region 0 θ π then they reach their maximum value when θ is about π 2 after that both c t and c n decrease until the blade enters the downstream region π θ 2 π in the downstream region the c t and c n have small almost constant values with slight fluctuation the differences between the tangential force coefficients are most apparent when the reynolds number and tsr are small this is closely related to the unsteady flow features shown up near the darrieus blades under those conditions see again fig 11 these phenomena agree well with other researchers results li et al 2013 additionally we found that in the upstream region larger tsrs can always lead to larger c n due to the stronger centrifugal acceleration 3 2 2 performance analysis of different designs of the hdms vawt 3 2 2 1 turbine size effects to further investigate the relationship between the reynolds number and the power coefficient c p the size of the original hdms vawt design is scaled up or down with the same solidity five diameters namely d 0 7 m d 1 4 m d 2 8 m d 5 6 m and d 14 0 m are studied here the freestream velocity u and tsr are fixed to 2 5 m s and 2 5 respectively fig 14 shows the relationship between the power coefficient and the sizes of different hdms vawts when u 2 5 m s and t s r 2 5 and table 4 presents the values of the c p we observe that the power coefficient c p increases while the diameter of the turbine is enlarged when the diameter d reaches 14 0 m which is 10 times as that of the original hdms vawt design the c p is 57 42 this value is close to betz s limit thus increasing the reynolds number by enlarging the turbine size can also result in higher power coefficients according to foregoing discussions this is related to stronger resistance of high reynolds number turbulent boundary layers to large scale flow separation over the darrieus blades fig 15 presents the moment coefficient c m histories with the turbine size of d 0 7 m d 1 4 m and d 14 0 m we find that the c m histories for the cases with larger turbine sizes are consistently shifted toward larger values fig 16 shows the flow fields of the normalized vorticity in the z direction when d 0 7 m and d 14 m we observe that although the sizes of the two turbines are very different the flow fields near the outer darrieus blades are similar however flow separation over the blade in the southwest when d 14 m is further suppressed compared to that when d 0 7 m specifically as observed from fig 16 the separation point on the blade in the southwest when d 14 m is closer to the trailing edge of the blade resulting in a narrower wake 3 2 2 2 solidity effects hdms vawts with different solidities are investigated in this subsection we note that the solidity can be modified in three ways namely varying the blade size with the blade number fixed varying the blade number with the blade size fixed and a mix of the aforementioned two approaches in this study we employ the first two approaches we first fix the blade number and double the size of the darrieus blades or decrease it by half these two cases are labeled as double solidity see fig 2 b and half solidity see fig 2 c we then fix the blade size and change the darrieus blade number from 3 to 5 this case is labeled as 5 3 solidity see fig 2 d the other parameters for the three turbines are set as follows d 14 m u 2 5 m s and t s r 2 5 the results are shown in table 5 we observe that c p s of the three new cases cannot reach as high as that of the original design and the c p s of the turbines with the 5 3 and double solidities are significantly lower than that of the original design we note that in the work by rezaeiha et al 2018 the power coefficient c p can be approximated as a function of σ λ 3 regardless of blade numbers therein the solidity is defined as n c d which is π times of our definition of σ the optimal value of π σ λ 3 that results in the maximum c p when the turbulence intensity is 5 is about 6 0 in our case the factor π σ λ 3 is 6 7 very close to the optimal one this explains why the power coefficient of the original design is much higher than those with larger or smaller solidities we present the normalized vorticity fields in the z direction of the three cases with different solidities in fig 17 it is clear that when larger solidities are used the darrieus blades have more intensive but negative interaction with the wakes degrading their energy harvesting performance 3 2 2 3 blade number effects recently mabrouk and hami 2019 claimed that three bladed darrieus turbine configuration exhibits the best performance regarding the moment and energy production interestingly in the work by rezaeiha et al 2018 the performance of the turbines can be irrelevant of the number of blades when the power coefficient c p is measured as a function of σ λ 3 in this subsection we test the statements by studying the effect of the number of the outer darrieus blade with the solidity of the vawt fixed six bladed and nine bladed configurations see fig 2 e and f respectively are implemented to carry out the study the same turbine setting as that used in the solidity effect study i e the diameter d 14 m freestream velocity u 2 5 m s and tsr 2 5 is employed here results in table 6 shows that the c p of the six bladed design is 55 77 and the c p of the nine bladed design is 49 39 both are lower than the c p 57 42 of the original three bladed design with the same solidity this shows the configuration of the original three bladed design hdms vawt has the best energy harvesting performance which agrees with the results in mabrouk and hami 2019 as observed in fig 18 where the normalized vorticity fields in the z direction of the six bladed and nine bladed designs are shown the inferior performance of the nine bladed design may be attributed to intensive interaction between the blades and wakes 3 3 energy harvesting performance analysis of the darrieus vawt using the prescribed motion approach in two phase open channel flows as mentioned in section 1 houlsby and vogel 2017 and whelan et al 2009 have done theoretical derivations based on lmadt and bem theories they stated that the performance of the water turbine in open channel flows can exceed betz s limit we verify the statements by high fidelity cfd simulations a three bladed darrieus vawt is used to perform the study in this section the geometric configuration of the darrieus vawt is identical to the outer darrieus rotor of the hdms design shown in fig 2 a the schematic illustration of the computational domain and boundary conditions are presented in fig 19 the turbine diameter d is fixed to 1 4 m tsr to 2 5 and freestream velocity u to 0 5 m s various blockage ratios b d h have been tested and the variation of blockage ratios is achieved by modifying the water height a k a free surface level h note that the vawt is placed at the middle position in the cross direction of the water flow to avoid any man made geometric asymmetry the volume of fluid vof multiphase model is utilized to conduct open channel flow simulations smith et al 2019 in this method two phases namely air and water are defined by a volume fraction if this value is one it represents water if it is zero it represents air the meshes used in the open channel flow simulation have over one million elements to better capture flow features comparable to that used in other works for open channel flow simulations hocine et al 2019 three different blockage ratios namely b 20 b 40 and b 60 are selected to study vawt s performance in open channel flows fig 20 shows the contour of the air water multiphase flow and the relative position of the vawt dashed circle in the channel table 7 presents the power coefficient c p of all the open channel flow simulations together with that obtained by the corresponding single phase flow we observe that when the tsr is 2 5 the power coefficient c p of the darrieus vawt in the single phase flow is 46 15 which is 2 5 higher than the c p of the hdms vawt in the single phase flow with the same parameters shown in table 3 this agrees well with the observation from the wind turbine in liu et al 2019 that the c p of the hdms turbine is slightly lower than that of the darrieus turbine at its optimal tsr this is due to that the inner savonius rotor has negative effect on the energy harvesting performance although it can enhance the self starting capability of the entire turbine system when the vawt operates in the open channel flow and the blockage ratio b is 20 the c p of the turbine is 46 06 close to that in the single phase flow as seen in fig 21 the moment coefficient histories obtained from the single phase flow and the open channel flow with b 20 are similar to each other we also observe from fig 22 that when t s r 2 5 the normalized vorticity fields in the z direction obtained in single phase flow and open channel flow with b 20 are almost indistinguishable when b is increased from 20 to 40 and 60 as shown in table 7 the c p of the turbine increases significantly with 51 39 for b 40 and 58 78 for b 60 respectively the velocity fields in the x direction for the single phase flow case and open channel flow cases with different blockage ratios are displayed in fig 23 therein we observe that the flow fields around the vawts operating in open channel flows are affected by the free surface on top of the turbine and wall bottom effects the flow around the turbine blades has been gradually accelerated when the blockage ratio becomes larger and the larger the blockage ratio is the more significant the acceleration effect is when the blockage ratio is relatively small b 20 this effect is not apparent thus the velocity field of b 20 is similar to that in the single phase flow see fig 23 a and b when the blockage ratio is relatively large i e b 40 and b 60 this acceleration effect becomes apparent visually see fig 23 c and d this flow speedup results in an increase of the density of the flow hydrokinetic energy extracted by the vawt thus enhancing the energy harvesting efficiency when the tsr reaches 5 0 by increasing the angular velocity of the turbine we see from table 7 that the power coefficients c p s obtained in the single phase flow and open channel flow with b 20 are negative when the blockage ratio increases to 40 the c p reaches 14 42 and it can reach 73 60 with b 60 which exceeds betz s limit note that a negative power coefficient can only be achieved when the motion of the water turbine is driven by a motor instead of the flow araya and dabiri 2015 the moment coefficient histories of all cases are presented in fig 24 and the corresponding velocity fields in the x direction are displayed in fig 25 different from the t s r 2 5 case the moment coefficient history of the open channel flow case with b 20 is shifted towards the positive value compared to that of the single flow case the velocity field of the open channel flow case with b 20 seems to have been affected by the free surface and wall however since the blockage ratio is small the flow acceleration effect is not apparent for the open channel flow cases with b 40 and 60 the water flow speedup phenomenon becomes more apparent compared to that when t s r 2 5 as observed in fig 25 c and d especially for the b 60 case the flow conditions are analogous to those for the ducted turbines see one ducted wind turbine example in kanya and visser 2018 the energy harvesting efficiency of which can exceed betz s limit due to local flow acceleration we mention that the optimal tsrs of the water turbines in open channel flows are affected by the free surface and wall effects and remain to be determined for each blockage ratio this is beyond the scope of this study and results will be reported in our future publications 4 conclusions this study investigates the energy harvesting performance of a family of vawts under single phase water and two phase open channel flow conditions the self starting capability of a recently developed hdms type vawt is studied by a two way coupled fsi approach and its energy harvesting performance at stable operational status is studied by the prescribed motion approach specifically the self starting capability of the hdms vawts is systematically analyzed first using the fsi approach then the energy harvesting efficiency of hdms vawts under various freestream velocities and turbine diameters is studied which gives a comprehensive understanding of the impact of the reynolds number next different geometric configurations are investigated to evaluate the effects of the turbine s solidity and blade number as a last step the darrieus rotor of the water turbine is tested under open channel flow conditions different blockage ratios are studied and the results are compared to those from the simulations in single phase water flows the main conclusions are summarized as follows the hdms vawt has excellent self starting capability and can maintain high power coefficients in single phase water flows the optimal tsr of the water turbine for energy harvesting is around 2 5 and the maximum power coefficient obtained is about 52 the modified savonius rotor has negligible effect on energy harvesting performance when the turbine is under stable operation these features are similar to those observed from hdms wind turbines liu et al 2019 increasing the reynolds number by enlarging the freestream velocity or the turbine diameters can enhance the energy harvesting performance of the hdms vawt the optimal solidity observed for the water turbine in single phase water flows is similar to that observed for wind turbines rezaeiha et al 2018 from the study of blade number effect we find that when the solidity of the turbine is fixed at the optimal value the three bladed darrieus turbine configuration has better energy harvesting performance compared to the six bladed and nine bladed configuration which agrees with the results in mabrouk and hami 2019 this is closely related to blade wake interaction open channel flow conditions can significantly enhance the energy harvesting efficiency of a water turbine when the blockage ratio is large we find that at relatively high tsr 5 0 under which the vawt in single phase water flows cannot extract energy the same vawt under open channel flow conditions with a large blockage ratio i e 60 in this study can achieve a power coefficient exceeding betz s limit we note that previous studies have found that 2d simulations can overestimate the power coefficients under both wind li et al 2013 liu et al 2019 and water conditions maître et al 2013 hwang et al 2009 elbatran et al 2017 due to that the tip loss of the 3d blades howell et al 2010 elkhoury et al 2015 alaimo et al 2015 is not considered therefore in future works 3d numerical simulations and experiments need to be carried out to quantify the tip loss effects of the hdms water turbines we also notice that there is very limited work nishi et al 2017 hocine et al 2019 on the performance analysis of water turbines under open channel flow conditions more experimental and numerical studies are needed to decipher the flow physics there thus better assisting design and control of water turbines operating

20270,we conduct performance analyses of a family of vertical axis water turbines vawts under single phase water and two phase open channel flow conditions using unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans numerical simulations the performance including self starting capability and energy harvesting efficiency of a recently developed hybrid darrieus modified savonius hdms design is examined under single phase water flow conditions with a two way coupled fluid structure interaction fsi approach we demonstrate that the water turbine has excellent self starting capability after that the effects of the reynolds number tip speed ratio tsr and geometric design of the turbine including turbine size solidity and number of blades are systematically studied since the main function of the modified savonius rotor is to assist self start and this part has a negligible effect on energy harvesting performance when the turbine is under stable operation only the darrieus rotor is studied under two phase open channel flow conditions to save computational cost a key finding is that larger blockage ratios result in better energy harvesting performance of the water turbines when the blockage ratio is 60 and the tsr of the turbine is 5 0 the power coefficient of the water turbine can reach up to 73 which exceeds betz s limit keywords vertical axis water turbine hybrid darrieus and modified savonius design self start energy harvesting efficiency fluid structure interaction open channel flow 1 introduction hydrokinetic energy is one important type of clean renewable energy which does not generate toxic pollution or greenhouse gases in the process of electricity production much research has demonstrated that turbine technologies are highly related to the cost and performance of energy production in both offshore and onshore areas fertahi et al 2018 zamani et al 2016a in this study we focus on analyzing the performance of vertical axis water turbines khan et al 2009 kumar and saini 2016 which are suitable for hydrokinetic energy harvesting in regions such as rivers estuaries and canals most of previous works on vawts focus on either darrieus or savonius turbines here we first give a brief review of them more works can be found in the contemporary reviews khan et al 2009 kumar and saini 2016 and then discuss a recently developed hybrid vertical axis turbine design liu et al 2019 and its application to hydrokinetic energy harvesting both experimental and numerical approaches have been utilized to study water turbines hwang et al 2009 used an active blade pitch control system to improve the energy harvesting performance of a darrieus water turbine elbatran et al 2017 demonstrated that using ducted nozzle savonius water turbine can increase the power efficiency of the turbine system the research by velasco velasco et al 2017 presented that active flow control with synthetic jets can improve the energy harvesting efficiency of darrieus water turbines laín et al 2018 indicated that adding winglets to the tip of a darrieus blade can enhance its energy harvesting capability under water flow conditions li et al 2014 studied the effect of the ratio between the turbine height and radius on its energy harvesting performance of a darrieus water turbine and found that there exists an optimal ratio for reliable maximum power output li and calışal 2010 carried out a study of a twin darrieus water turbine system and found that the total power output of the twin turbine system with an optimal layout can exceed two times that of a stand alone turbine in general previous studies reach a consensus that the lift driven darrieus turbine has better energy harvesting capability than the drag driven savonius turbine at relatively large tsrs but has poor self starting capability when the tsr is small while the savonius turbine has good self starting capability at relatively small tsrs due to its drag driven features but its power efficiency is low at the energy harvesting stage a hybrid design such as that developed for vertical axis wind turbines fertahi et al 2018 liu et al 2019 wakui et al 2005 liang et al 2017 may synthesize the advantages of individual darrieus or savonius designs while surmounting their disadvantages as a matter of fact when operating in single phase water flows without free surface effects vertical axis water turbines have similar performance with vertical axis wind turbines li et al 2013 karimian and abdolahifar 2020 abdalrahman et al 2017 su et al 2020 mohamed et al 2020 mohamed et al 2019 as demonstrated in section 3 1 this motivates us to adapt a hybrid darrieus modified savonius design of a vertical axis wind turbine from our previous work liu et al 2019 for hydrokinetic energy harvesting the hdms turbine has a savonius rotor inside and three darrieus blades around the self starting capability and energy harvesting efficiency of the hdms turbine has been investigated in the context of wind energy harvesting results indicate that the hybrid design can circumvent the weaknesses of individual darrieus and savonius designs by engineering nonlinear dynamic interaction between the two we note that similar hybrid designs have been used for hydropower collection for example fertahi et al 2018 has conducted numerical and experimental studies for a hybridization of savonius and darrieus water turbine under different tsr conditions and found that the energy harvesting performance of a design with an asynchronous coupling of savonius and darrieus rotors is better than that of other designs mosbahi et al 2020 combined a delta bladed darrieus turbine with a savonius one and studied the energy harvesting performance of different savonius and darrieus designs in a limited tsr range i e smaller than one no previous studies have systematically analyzed the energy harvesting performance of hybrid turbine designs with different dynamic kinematic and geometric parameters in water flows in this work results from comprehensive analyses of the hdms water turbine s performance under different flow and operating conditions are presented and discussed we specifically focus on analyzing the crossflow hdms vawt design yu and zhu 2020 as illustrated in fig 1 in this design two crossflow vawts are grouped together to share one gearbox and one generator thus lowering the installation and maintenance cost the crossflow design concept has been adopted by the marine renewable energy industry see for example the turbine generator unit tgu developed by ocean renewable power company orpc inc oprc 2021 we mention that although water turbines share many design similarities with wind turbines there are several unique features for water turbines first a constant pressure gradient due to hydrostatic conditions may affect the performance of water turbines according to our tests this has negligible influence on the performance of crossflow vawts studied here see section 2 4 for more details second the reynolds number of a vawt is usually higher than that of the wind turbine of the same size for example state of the art hydrokinetic energy harvesting devices usually operate at high water flow speeds e g greater than 2 25 m s velasco et al 2017 laín et al 2018 thus for a vawt with a diameter d around 2 m bianchini et al 2017 maître et al 2013 mejia and quiñones 2018 velasco et al 2017 the reynolds number r e ρ u d μ based on the freestream velocity and turbine diameter is often larger than 4 5 10 6 for wind turbines of the same size operating in the wind speed ranging from 5 m s to 15 m s ruffino et al 2018 li et al 2013 marinić kragić et al 2019 shahizare et al 2016 zamani et al 2016b firdaus et al 2015 the reynolds numbers fall into the range between 0 8 10 6 and 2 4 10 6 in this work we investigate the effect of the reynolds number on the hdms water turbine in single phase water flows especially in the reynolds number range where wind turbines of the same size can hardly achieve we note that the reynolds number can also be defined locally as r e l ρ r ω c μ where r d 2 is the radius of the turbine ω is the angular velocity of the turbine and c is the chord length of the darrieus blade note that the tsr is defined as λ r ω u and the solidity of the turbine is defined as σ n c π d where n is the number of the darrieus blades therefore the ratio between r e l based on local flow measurements and r e based on global ones is r e l r e π λ σ n this indicates that local flow features of the darrieus rotor measured by r e l are jointly determined by the global reynolds number of the entire turbine tsr solidity and blade number in this study we examine the effect of each parameter on the turbine performance with the other three fixed last but not least free water air surfaces can affect the performance of water turbines when they are operating in open channel flows houlsby and vogel 2017 have carried out a theoretical analysis by linear momentum actuator disc theory lmadt they found that the performance of the water turbine in open channel flows can exceed betz s limit the reason is that the potential energy loss due to the free surface position change can be extracted by the water turbine whelan et al 2009 used blade element momentum bem approach and experimental data obtained by a porous disc and strip to demonstrate that the tangential force coefficient in a highly blocked open channel flow is higher than that in the unblocked flow chamorro et al 2013 has conducted an open channel experimental test with a horizontal axis water turbine hawt and the blockage ratio is about 6 and their maximum power coefficient is about 45 which is below betz s limit nishi et al 2017 found that the superior energy harvesting performance observed from their hawt experiment in open channel flows is due to that the energy collection device was not filled with water after the correction the power coefficient from the free surface flow is even smaller than that from the single phase flow hocine et al 2019 tested the power coefficient of a vawt half immersed in an open channel flow by a 2 5d numerical simulation i e a three dimensional 3d simulation without considering the blade tip effects and their maximum power coefficient is about 32 which is lower than the power coefficient in the single phase flow apparently no consensus on whether the blockage effect shown up in the open channel flow can enhance the hydrodynamic performance of a water turbine has been reached in previous studies in addition from the numerical simulation perspective studying the performance of water turbines in open channel flows remains challenging due to the large computational cost to capture the intricate flow physics induced by the free water air surface effect in this work we aim to provide high fidelity flow simulation results to further explain the blockage effect on the crossflow water turbine operating in open channel flows specifically we examine the performance of the darrieus rotor of the hdms vawt in open channel flows with different blockage ratios note that the main function of the modified savonius rotor of the hdms turbine is to assist self start and this part has a negligible effect on energy harvesting performance when the turbine is under stable operation liu et al 2019 therefore only the darrieus rotor is used in two phase open channel flow simulations to save computational cost contributions in this work we systematically analyze the performance of vawts under either single phase water or two phase open channel flow conditions first the self starting capability of an innovative hdms design in single phase water flows is tested with a two way coupled fsi approach note that the self starting capability cannot be examined through traditional computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations with prescribed motion of the structure we further perform a comprehensive study of the effects of dynamic kinematic and geometric parameters that can affect the energy harvesting performance of the hdms vawt to reveal flow physics of vawts in single phase water flows these parameters include the reynolds number tsr turbine size solidity and number of blades furthermore we demonstrate superior performance of a darrieus type vawt fully submerged in open channel flows with high fidelity numerical simulations and explain the underlying flow physics chapter overview in section 2 numerical methods and simulation setup are introduced and verified there we explain the two way coupled fsi strategy and verify the independence of results from meshes turbulence models and hydrostatic conditions in section 3 numerical results are presented and discussed specifically in section 3 1 the self starting capability of the hdms vawt is affirmed with fsi analyses in section 3 2 the effects of different parameters on the energy harvesting performance of the water turbine in single phase water flows are studied then in section 3 3 the energy harvesting performance of a darrieus turbine in open channel flows with varying blockage ratios is studied section 4 concludes the study and discusses possible future works 2 computational models and simulation setup 2 1 computational models of vawts in this study two dimensional 2d computational models are adopted to analyze the performance of hdms vawts the geometric configuration of the original design is shown in fig 2 a specifically it consists of a three bladed darrieus h shaped rotor and a three bladed ms rotor a modified naca0015 airfoil with a round trailing edge is used for the darrieus h shaped rotor the diameter d of the entire turbine varies from 0 7 m to 14 m the chord length of outer darrieus blades varies based on the solidity of the turbine the inner modified savonius ms rotor blades with specially designed curvature see us patent 2011014261a1 anderson 2010 are attached to the shaft and are 120 o apart from each other the radius of the ms rotor is equal to the chord length of the original darrieus blade outside the blade tip of the ms rotor is aligned with the aerodynamic center of the corresponding blade in the darrieus rotor and for the other designs shown in fig 2 b f the ratios between the radius of the ms rotor and the radius of the entire turbine are fixed to the value of the original design the solidity of the original design shown in fig 2 a is calculated from σ n c π d as 0 1364 meanwhile different designs of the hdms vawt as shown in fig 2 are also investigated these designs include a three bladed turbine with double solidity compared to the original one see fig 2 b a three bladed turbine with half solidity compared to the original one see fig 2 c a five bladed turbine with 5 3 solidity compared to the original one see fig 2 d a six bladed turbine with the same solidity as the original design see fig 2 e and a nine bladed turbine with the same solidity as the original design see fig 2 f these 2d profiles can be treated as 3d vawts with a large height radius or aspect ratio under which scenario the blade tip effects can be neglected many researchers liu et al 2019 danao et al 2014 wekesa et al 2015 ferreira et al 2007 castelli et al 2010 beri and yao 2011 nobile et al 2014 trivellato and castelli 2014 wang et al 2016 have already demonstrated that 2d models can predict the efficiency and hydrodynamic behaviors of vertical axis wind turbines reasonably well with reduced computational cost therefore 2d models are used exclusively in all the simulations in this study the schematic illustration of the computational domain and boundary conditions can be found in liu et al 2019 to measure the performance of vawts several parameters namely angular velocity θ hydrodynamic moment m w a t e r and power coefficient c p o w e r are used in this study once the hydrodynamic moment m w a t e r and the angular velocity θ of the water turbine are obtained the power p extracted from the water flow is calculate as follows 1 p m w a t e r θ the total power in the incoming water passing across the turbine with a reference area a can be calculated using the following equation 2 p m a x 1 2 ρ u 3 a finally the power coefficient c p is calculated as 3 c p p p m a x based on betz s law the maximum value of the time averaged power coefficient c p is 59 3 in a single phase open flow betz 1966 2 2 numerical framework of fluid rigid body interaction the governing equations of fluid flow are the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations in this study the turbulence model is selected as the shear stress transport sst k ω model the accuracy and stability of which have been proved by many other researchers zanforlin 2018 yang and lawn 2011 2013 marsh et al 2016 mejia and quiñones 2018 the urans is simulated using the ansys fluent 15 0 high performance computing hpc software to test the self starting capability of vawts using the fsi approach the flow solver is coupled with the kinematics equation of the turbine which is specified in the user defined functions udfs the turbine kinematics is modeled as follows for a rigid vawt which rotates with respect to its shaft the kinematics equation is 4 i θ m w a t e r m l o a d herein i is the moment of inertia θ is the angular acceleration m w a t e r is the hydrodynamic moment and m l o a d is the external load which can be from the generator and or the transmission system such as the gearbox for practical hydro energy harvesting applications the external load can be an intricate function of the angular velocity θ and or acceleration θ of the turbine in this study a linear relationship between m l o a d and θ is assumed namely m l o a d c θ where c is the damping factor thus eq 4 can be expressed as 5 i θ c θ m w a t e r note that in the ansys fluent software m w a t e r is calculated via the integration of the product of distributed forces i e pressure and viscous forces over the surfaces of the turbine and their distances to the shaft the moment coefficient c m is evaluated as c m m w a t e r 0 5 ρ u 2 a l where u is the freestream velocity a is the reference area and l is the reference length after the kinematics equation of the water turbine system is specified a partitioned two way coupled fsi algorithm can be developed as follows first the flow solver simulates the fluid flow and it gives the hydrodynamic moment m w a t e r in eq 4 then the angular velocity θ and angular displacement θ are expressed through numerical integration using a fourth order multi point adams moulton formulation snyder et al 2003 and determined by plugging eq 5 into the discrete angular velocity and displacement formulations thus new boundary conditions for the flow solver are available for the next time step to get a new hydrodynamic moment for achieving the coupling between the fluid flow and turbine kinematics 2 3 simulation setup the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple algorithm with a second order upwind spatial discretization scheme are utilized to solve the fluid flow equations for the time marching solver a second order implicit scheme is selected to ensure the accuracy of the time integration the sst k ω turbulence model is used for all the simulations presented in this study the turbulence viscosity ratio is set to 5 and the turbulence intensity is set to 10 for the freestream the residual convergence criterion is set to 10 4 to ensure convergence within each physical time step the simulation parameters are summarized in table 1 in all simulations the mesh motion is achieved through the sliding mesh algorithm 2 4 verification and validation of the numerical setup in this study meshes near the wall boundaries of both outer darrieus and inner savonius blades have good resolution similar to those in liu et al 2019 to ensure that numerical results are independent of mesh resolution a mesh refinement study is carried out using three sets of meshes as shown in fig 3 a b and c therein the coarse mesh consists of 71 940 elements medium one 221 840 elements and fine one 715 680 near the darrieus blades the refinement is carried out in both the radial and circumferential directions simultaneously the mesh refinement study is conducted for a vawt with a diameter d 1 4 m freestream velocity u 2 5 m s and t s r 2 5 the results are presented in table 2 we observe that the differences of the power coefficient between the medium and fine meshes are minuscule in addition the histories of the moment coefficient are presented in figs 4 and 5 it shows that the moment coefficient histories of these three sets of mesh are almost indistinguishable therefore the medium mesh is selected to conduct numerical simulation to save computational cost in the study by maître et al 2013 it was demonstrated that the near wall grid has a significant effect on the urans numerical simulations for darrieus water turbines the grid quality is reflected by the value of the non dimensional wall distance y and their reference value of the mean y is 0 71 note that y is a non dimensional wall distance defined as y u h ν where u is the friction velocity h is the size of the first mesh layer and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid fig 4 presents the mean y at five different times during one arbitrarily selected revolution of the vawt with the medium mesh shown in fig 3 we observe that the mean y of this case is about 0 4 which is smaller than the reference value in maître et al 2013 to investigate the effect of turbulence models simulation results using the spalart allmaras s a turbulence model are compared to those with the sst k ω model two cases are simulated for comparison namely the cases with d 1 4 m t s r 2 5 u 2 5 m s and u 3 0 m s respectively the time averaged power coefficients c p and moment coefficient histories obtained from different turbulence models are displayed in fig 6 a and b the mean c p s from the s a model are slightly smaller than the results from the sst k ω model in both cases 47 98 versus 50 30 and 49 36 versus 51 77 respectively the moment coefficient histories of the two turbulence models show excellent agreement with each other thus the influence of the turbulence model can be neglected in this study to investigate the effect of the hydrostatic conditions two simulations are performed the geometric configurations are the same as those in the turbulence model study shown above the freestream velocity is set to 0 5 m s and the tsr is 2 5 in one case the gravitational acceleration g 9 81 k g m s 2 is turned on in the vertical i e negative y direction and the other is not we observe from fig 7 that the differences between the two cases in both the moment coefficient history and the time averaged power coefficient are almost undistinguishable therefore the effect of gravity is negligible and it is not employed in the simulations performed in the rest of this work the same approach has been used in other researchers work on water turbines maître et al 2013 laín et al 2018 we mention that benchmark tests of vertical axis wind turbines using both 2d urans model and 2 5d large eddy simulation les model with different time step sizes have been performed in our previous work liu et al 2019 our results from both 2d urans model and 2 5d les model have good agreement with the numerical results from li et al 2013 moreover the result of 2 5d les model agrees reasonably well with the experimental result by mclaren 2011 and these results also unveil the optimal time step size δ t 0 001 s which is also adopted in the simulations presented here note that in the works by sørensen and michelsen 2004 and travin et al 2002 the authors suggested that the non dimensional time step τ δ t u c can be about 0 01 and 0 025 to handle the unsteady flow features the smaller the τ is the better the flow resolution is in our cases the largest τ based on the maximum free stream velocity i e 3 5 m s and the minimum chord length i e 0 2 m is about 0 0175 within the suggested range 3 results and discussions 3 1 self starting capability of hdms vawts using the fsi approach as discussed by dominy et al 2007 researchers have different definitions of the self starting capability of a vawt and no consensus of the term self starting has been achieved in this study we use the same approach in liu et al 2019 the self starting capability of a vawt is defined as that the turbine can reach the desirable tsrs under nominal water flow conditions without external load as a result the turbines can effectively harvest hydro energy when appropriate energy collectors in the form of external load are activated in this self starting capability study the original three bladed hdms design with d 1 4 m is selected for tests note that it has been found from our previous study liu et al 2019 that this design can effectively balance the self starting capability and energy harvesting performance when operating in low speed wind the freestream velocity u of the single phase water flow is set to 1 m s which is relatively low compared to that used in other researchers work marsh et al 2016 maître et al 2013 note that the moment of inertia of the vawt plays a significant role on the self starting capability liu et al 2019 in this study the moment of inertia of the vawt is set to 10 0 k g m 2 or equivalently the moment of inertia per unit length is 10 0 k g m note that to avoid any confusion about the unit of a physical quantity such as the moment of inertia we will always assume that the default height of a 2d geometry is 1 m thus the dimension of any physical quantity can be described in its 3d format the simulation procedure follows our previous work liu et al 2019 first the vawt is put under free loading conditions thus the damping factor c in eq 5 is set to zero after the free loading period a damping factor c 20 k g m 2 s is used to generate external load m l o a d c θ on the turbine to examine whether the vawt can still maintain reasonably high tsr and harvest hydrokinetic energy note that the choice of the damping factor values in real life applications depends on the features of the physical system liu et al 2019 a rule of thumb to determine a reasonable damping factor value is to select a value e g through trial and error that can support the tsr of the turbine between two and three under which the turbine can have a high power coefficient the tsr history of the self starting test is shown in fig 8 we observe that during the free loading period the vawt rotates in the clockwise direction at the very beginning and then rotates back in the counterclockwise direction next the tsr of the vawt surges to a relatively high value over 5 5 eventually the tsr gradually decreases to a stable and periodic stage which is about 4 5 similar phenomenon has been observed from the hdms wind turbine in liu et al 2019 after the free loading period an external load with the damping factor c 20 k g m 2 s is exerted on the turbine to collect energy therefore the tsr decreases and reaches a stable stage around 2 9 the water turbine can then generate power to support energy consumption by the external load the power coefficient c p is about 40 at this stage based on the definition of the self starting capability at the beginning of this section we conclude that the design tested here has good self starting capability the normalized vorticity in the z direction of this hdms vawt under water flow condition and wind air conditions at its stable power generating stage are presented in fig 9 a and b for comparison we observe that the two vorticity fields share many similarities although the reynolds number of the water turbine nearly doubles that of the wind turbine for more self starting capability comparisons between hybrid turbine designs with different inertias damping factors and geometric configurations such as the radius ratio and relative position between the inner savonius and outer darrieus rotors readers are referred to liu et al 2019 3 2 energy harvesting performance analysis of hdms vawts using the prescribed motion approach in single phase flows 3 2 1 performance analysis of the original hdms vawt design researchers araya and dabiri 2015 liu et al 2019 have already demonstrated that the motor driven turbine i e a turbine with the prescribed motion can reproduce the physics of a wind driven turbine under certain conditions therefore to precisely control the tsr with different freestream velocities the prescribed motion approach is adopted for this study herein the vawt simulations are conducted with various freestream velocities u from 0 25 m s to 3 5 m s which lead to the reynolds number r e ρ u d μ from 3 48 10 5 to 4 88 10 6 the tsr is set to 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 for each freestream velocity respectively fig 10 shows the relationship between the power coefficient c p of the original design of this hdms turbine see fig 2 a and the turbine diameter d 1 4 m and the u and the corresponding r e together with tsrs in the single phase water flow note that unless specifically mentioned the power coefficient c p is for the entire turbine consisting of the darrieus and savonius rotors from fig 10 we observe that the inner savonius rotor contributes little to the total power harvesting performance for all cases with different u and tsrs specifically the absolute value of the c p contributed by the inner savonius rotor is relatively insignificant about 1 or less compared to the total c p created by both the darrieus and savonius rotors thus the effect of the inner savonius rotor on the total energy harvesting performance can be neglected and the total energy harvesting performance is dominated by the outer darrieus blades the similar phenomenon has been observed for wind turbines liu et al 2019 we reiterate the purpose of the inner savonius design is to assist self start of the turbine we also observe in fig 10 that when the freestream velocity u is 0 25 m s the c p obtained by using t s r 2 0 has the lowest value 7 6 compared to the c p using the other two tsrs meanwhile the c p obtained by using t s r 3 0 has the highest value compared to the other two cases the reason is that the relatively low u and tsr lead to dynamic stall over the outer darrieus blades as shown in fig 11 a see the severe flow separation over the darrieus blade in the southwest this dynamic stall can significantly decrease the hydrodynamic moment acting on the darrieus turbines therefore the total energy harvesting performance at t s r 2 0 is worse than that at the other two tsrs when u 0 25 m s from fig 11 which shows the flow field of the normalized vorticity in the z direction we find that the darrieus blade in the southwest of the case with u 0 25 m s and t s r 2 0 see fig 11 a encounters large dynamic stall however when the tsr reaches 3 0 as shown in fig 11 b the dynamic stall is suppressed over the blade at the same position this dynamic stall mitigation is due to the decrease of angles of attack aoas resulted by the relatively high tsr for example the local aoa of the darrieus blade in the southwest in fig 11 is decreased from 28 68 in a to 17 14 in b the values of c p under different u and tsr conditions are documented in table 3 combining table 3 and fig 10 we find that for the original hdms turbine design there exists an optimal reynolds number range near r e 4 17 10 6 for operation no matter what tsrs are used we also observe that when the freestream flow speed is fixed there exists an optimal tsr around 2 5 specifically when u is greater than 0 25 m s all cases with t s r 2 5 have the highest c p compared to the cases with the other two tsrs the maximum c p obtained from this study is 51 77 when t s r 2 5 and u 3 0 m s equivalently r e 4 17 10 6 note that this value is over 80 of betz s limit fig 12 a and b show the normalized vorticity fields in the z direction when u 3 0 m s t s r 2 0 and 3 0 respectively we find in fig 12 a that the flow separation is less obvious over the blade in the southwest compared to that in fig 11 a when u 0 25 m s at the same position obviously the reynolds number when u 3 0 m s is about one order of magnitude larger than that when u 0 25 m s the turbulent boundary layer at higher reynolds numbers can be more resilient to flow separation over the darrieus blades from fig 12 b we observe that the higher tsr 3 0 can further suppress the flow separation over the turbine blades however as seen in table 3 the power coefficient decreases this is closely related to the variation of local aoas of the darrieus blades which determines the variation of the lift force on the blades specially within the stall aoa the suppression of leading edge vortices indicates small lift generation on the blades causing a performance penalty on the turbine the resultant hydrodynamic forces acting on one single outer darrieus blade can be decomposed into two components the normal force f n perpendicular to the chord and the tangential force f t parallel to the chord based on the works by mclaren 2011 and li et al 2013 the tangential and normal force coefficients for 2d problems are defined as c t f t 0 5 ρ u 2 c c n f n 0 5 ρ u 2 c fig 13 shows the comparison of tangential and normal force coefficients with respect to the blade position of five different freestream velocities u from 0 25 m s to 3 5 m s the behaviors of the c t and c n from all the cases in the single phase flow show certain similarity both the force coefficients grows when the blade starts passing through the upstream region 0 θ π then they reach their maximum value when θ is about π 2 after that both c t and c n decrease until the blade enters the downstream region π θ 2 π in the downstream region the c t and c n have small almost constant values with slight fluctuation the differences between the tangential force coefficients are most apparent when the reynolds number and tsr are small this is closely related to the unsteady flow features shown up near the darrieus blades under those conditions see again fig 11 these phenomena agree well with other researchers results li et al 2013 additionally we found that in the upstream region larger tsrs can always lead to larger c n due to the stronger centrifugal acceleration 3 2 2 performance analysis of different designs of the hdms vawt 3 2 2 1 turbine size effects to further investigate the relationship between the reynolds number and the power coefficient c p the size of the original hdms vawt design is scaled up or down with the same solidity five diameters namely d 0 7 m d 1 4 m d 2 8 m d 5 6 m and d 14 0 m are studied here the freestream velocity u and tsr are fixed to 2 5 m s and 2 5 respectively fig 14 shows the relationship between the power coefficient and the sizes of different hdms vawts when u 2 5 m s and t s r 2 5 and table 4 presents the values of the c p we observe that the power coefficient c p increases while the diameter of the turbine is enlarged when the diameter d reaches 14 0 m which is 10 times as that of the original hdms vawt design the c p is 57 42 this value is close to betz s limit thus increasing the reynolds number by enlarging the turbine size can also result in higher power coefficients according to foregoing discussions this is related to stronger resistance of high reynolds number turbulent boundary layers to large scale flow separation over the darrieus blades fig 15 presents the moment coefficient c m histories with the turbine size of d 0 7 m d 1 4 m and d 14 0 m we find that the c m histories for the cases with larger turbine sizes are consistently shifted toward larger values fig 16 shows the flow fields of the normalized vorticity in the z direction when d 0 7 m and d 14 m we observe that although the sizes of the two turbines are very different the flow fields near the outer darrieus blades are similar however flow separation over the blade in the southwest when d 14 m is further suppressed compared to that when d 0 7 m specifically as observed from fig 16 the separation point on the blade in the southwest when d 14 m is closer to the trailing edge of the blade resulting in a narrower wake 3 2 2 2 solidity effects hdms vawts with different solidities are investigated in this subsection we note that the solidity can be modified in three ways namely varying the blade size with the blade number fixed varying the blade number with the blade size fixed and a mix of the aforementioned two approaches in this study we employ the first two approaches we first fix the blade number and double the size of the darrieus blades or decrease it by half these two cases are labeled as double solidity see fig 2 b and half solidity see fig 2 c we then fix the blade size and change the darrieus blade number from 3 to 5 this case is labeled as 5 3 solidity see fig 2 d the other parameters for the three turbines are set as follows d 14 m u 2 5 m s and t s r 2 5 the results are shown in table 5 we observe that c p s of the three new cases cannot reach as high as that of the original design and the c p s of the turbines with the 5 3 and double solidities are significantly lower than that of the original design we note that in the work by rezaeiha et al 2018 the power coefficient c p can be approximated as a function of σ λ 3 regardless of blade numbers therein the solidity is defined as n c d which is π times of our definition of σ the optimal value of π σ λ 3 that results in the maximum c p when the turbulence intensity is 5 is about 6 0 in our case the factor π σ λ 3 is 6 7 very close to the optimal one this explains why the power coefficient of the original design is much higher than those with larger or smaller solidities we present the normalized vorticity fields in the z direction of the three cases with different solidities in fig 17 it is clear that when larger solidities are used the darrieus blades have more intensive but negative interaction with the wakes degrading their energy harvesting performance 3 2 2 3 blade number effects recently mabrouk and hami 2019 claimed that three bladed darrieus turbine configuration exhibits the best performance regarding the moment and energy production interestingly in the work by rezaeiha et al 2018 the performance of the turbines can be irrelevant of the number of blades when the power coefficient c p is measured as a function of σ λ 3 in this subsection we test the statements by studying the effect of the number of the outer darrieus blade with the solidity of the vawt fixed six bladed and nine bladed configurations see fig 2 e and f respectively are implemented to carry out the study the same turbine setting as that used in the solidity effect study i e the diameter d 14 m freestream velocity u 2 5 m s and tsr 2 5 is employed here results in table 6 shows that the c p of the six bladed design is 55 77 and the c p of the nine bladed design is 49 39 both are lower than the c p 57 42 of the original three bladed design with the same solidity this shows the configuration of the original three bladed design hdms vawt has the best energy harvesting performance which agrees with the results in mabrouk and hami 2019 as observed in fig 18 where the normalized vorticity fields in the z direction of the six bladed and nine bladed designs are shown the inferior performance of the nine bladed design may be attributed to intensive interaction between the blades and wakes 3 3 energy harvesting performance analysis of the darrieus vawt using the prescribed motion approach in two phase open channel flows as mentioned in section 1 houlsby and vogel 2017 and whelan et al 2009 have done theoretical derivations based on lmadt and bem theories they stated that the performance of the water turbine in open channel flows can exceed betz s limit we verify the statements by high fidelity cfd simulations a three bladed darrieus vawt is used to perform the study in this section the geometric configuration of the darrieus vawt is identical to the outer darrieus rotor of the hdms design shown in fig 2 a the schematic illustration of the computational domain and boundary conditions are presented in fig 19 the turbine diameter d is fixed to 1 4 m tsr to 2 5 and freestream velocity u to 0 5 m s various blockage ratios b d h have been tested and the variation of blockage ratios is achieved by modifying the water height a k a free surface level h note that the vawt is placed at the middle position in the cross direction of the water flow to avoid any man made geometric asymmetry the volume of fluid vof multiphase model is utilized to conduct open channel flow simulations smith et al 2019 in this method two phases namely air and water are defined by a volume fraction if this value is one it represents water if it is zero it represents air the meshes used in the open channel flow simulation have over one million elements to better capture flow features comparable to that used in other works for open channel flow simulations hocine et al 2019 three different blockage ratios namely b 20 b 40 and b 60 are selected to study vawt s performance in open channel flows fig 20 shows the contour of the air water multiphase flow and the relative position of the vawt dashed circle in the channel table 7 presents the power coefficient c p of all the open channel flow simulations together with that obtained by the corresponding single phase flow we observe that when the tsr is 2 5 the power coefficient c p of the darrieus vawt in the single phase flow is 46 15 which is 2 5 higher than the c p of the hdms vawt in the single phase flow with the same parameters shown in table 3 this agrees well with the observation from the wind turbine in liu et al 2019 that the c p of the hdms turbine is slightly lower than that of the darrieus turbine at its optimal tsr this is due to that the inner savonius rotor has negative effect on the energy harvesting performance although it can enhance the self starting capability of the entire turbine system when the vawt operates in the open channel flow and the blockage ratio b is 20 the c p of the turbine is 46 06 close to that in the single phase flow as seen in fig 21 the moment coefficient histories obtained from the single phase flow and the open channel flow with b 20 are similar to each other we also observe from fig 22 that when t s r 2 5 the normalized vorticity fields in the z direction obtained in single phase flow and open channel flow with b 20 are almost indistinguishable when b is increased from 20 to 40 and 60 as shown in table 7 the c p of the turbine increases significantly with 51 39 for b 40 and 58 78 for b 60 respectively the velocity fields in the x direction for the single phase flow case and open channel flow cases with different blockage ratios are displayed in fig 23 therein we observe that the flow fields around the vawts operating in open channel flows are affected by the free surface on top of the turbine and wall bottom effects the flow around the turbine blades has been gradually accelerated when the blockage ratio becomes larger and the larger the blockage ratio is the more significant the acceleration effect is when the blockage ratio is relatively small b 20 this effect is not apparent thus the velocity field of b 20 is similar to that in the single phase flow see fig 23 a and b when the blockage ratio is relatively large i e b 40 and b 60 this acceleration effect becomes apparent visually see fig 23 c and d this flow speedup results in an increase of the density of the flow hydrokinetic energy extracted by the vawt thus enhancing the energy harvesting efficiency when the tsr reaches 5 0 by increasing the angular velocity of the turbine we see from table 7 that the power coefficients c p s obtained in the single phase flow and open channel flow with b 20 are negative when the blockage ratio increases to 40 the c p reaches 14 42 and it can reach 73 60 with b 60 which exceeds betz s limit note that a negative power coefficient can only be achieved when the motion of the water turbine is driven by a motor instead of the flow araya and dabiri 2015 the moment coefficient histories of all cases are presented in fig 24 and the corresponding velocity fields in the x direction are displayed in fig 25 different from the t s r 2 5 case the moment coefficient history of the open channel flow case with b 20 is shifted towards the positive value compared to that of the single flow case the velocity field of the open channel flow case with b 20 seems to have been affected by the free surface and wall however since the blockage ratio is small the flow acceleration effect is not apparent for the open channel flow cases with b 40 and 60 the water flow speedup phenomenon becomes more apparent compared to that when t s r 2 5 as observed in fig 25 c and d especially for the b 60 case the flow conditions are analogous to those for the ducted turbines see one ducted wind turbine example in kanya and visser 2018 the energy harvesting efficiency of which can exceed betz s limit due to local flow acceleration we mention that the optimal tsrs of the water turbines in open channel flows are affected by the free surface and wall effects and remain to be determined for each blockage ratio this is beyond the scope of this study and results will be reported in our future publications 4 conclusions this study investigates the energy harvesting performance of a family of vawts under single phase water and two phase open channel flow conditions the self starting capability of a recently developed hdms type vawt is studied by a two way coupled fsi approach and its energy harvesting performance at stable operational status is studied by the prescribed motion approach specifically the self starting capability of the hdms vawts is systematically analyzed first using the fsi approach then the energy harvesting efficiency of hdms vawts under various freestream velocities and turbine diameters is studied which gives a comprehensive understanding of the impact of the reynolds number next different geometric configurations are investigated to evaluate the effects of the turbine s solidity and blade number as a last step the darrieus rotor of the water turbine is tested under open channel flow conditions different blockage ratios are studied and the results are compared to those from the simulations in single phase water flows the main conclusions are summarized as follows the hdms vawt has excellent self starting capability and can maintain high power coefficients in single phase water flows the optimal tsr of the water turbine for energy harvesting is around 2 5 and the maximum power coefficient obtained is about 52 the modified savonius rotor has negligible effect on energy harvesting performance when the turbine is under stable operation these features are similar to those observed from hdms wind turbines liu et al 2019 increasing the reynolds number by enlarging the freestream velocity or the turbine diameters can enhance the energy harvesting performance of the hdms vawt the optimal solidity observed for the water turbine in single phase water flows is similar to that observed for wind turbines rezaeiha et al 2018 from the study of blade number effect we find that when the solidity of the turbine is fixed at the optimal value the three bladed darrieus turbine configuration has better energy harvesting performance compared to the six bladed and nine bladed configuration which agrees with the results in mabrouk and hami 2019 this is closely related to blade wake interaction open channel flow conditions can significantly enhance the energy harvesting efficiency of a water turbine when the blockage ratio is large we find that at relatively high tsr 5 0 under which the vawt in single phase water flows cannot extract energy the same vawt under open channel flow conditions with a large blockage ratio i e 60 in this study can achieve a power coefficient exceeding betz s limit we note that previous studies have found that 2d simulations can overestimate the power coefficients under both wind li et al 2013 liu et al 2019 and water conditions maître et al 2013 hwang et al 2009 elbatran et al 2017 due to that the tip loss of the 3d blades howell et al 2010 elkhoury et al 2015 alaimo et al 2015 is not considered therefore in future works 3d numerical simulations and experiments need to be carried out to quantify the tip loss effects of the hdms water turbines we also notice that there is very limited work nishi et al 2017 hocine et al 2019 on the performance analysis of water turbines under open channel flow conditions more experimental and numerical studies are needed to decipher the flow physics there thus better assisting design and control of water turbines operating

20271,fluid resonance within a narrow gap formed by a box in close proximity to a plane wall under cnoidal wave action is investigated using the computational fluid dynamics cfd package openfoam fluid resonance behavior excited by the second order harmonic component of the incident cnoidal waves is concerned numerical simulations show the large second order induced wave height in the gap which increases as the incident wave height gets larger or the water depth gets shallower the large double frequency component of the cnodial waves is the major reason for the phenomenon harmonic analysis indicates that the cfd results can be represented well by a second order approximation and the free surface nonlinearity is an indispensable factor in the action of the cnoidal incident wave similar phenomenon is also found in the horizontal wave force however the second order induced resonance within the gap has insignificant effect on the vertical wave force keywords fluid resonance narrow gap harmonic analysis free surface nonlinearity wave amplitude wave force 1 introduction fluid resonance within a gap formed by closely spaced bodies has attracted considerable attention in the last two decades since it has been a key technical challenge for loading and offloading operations of multiple barges in close proximity miao et al 2001 and zhu et al 2008 simulated the free surface oscillation between multiple floating bodies using a potential flow model faltinsen et al 2007 and molin et al 2018 analyzed the piston and sloshing modal shapes of fluid resonance via solving an eigenvalue equation based on the physical model tests saitoh et al 2006 iwata et al 2007 and peric and swan 2015 studied the wave resonance within a multiple box system the significantly amplified wave elevation in the gap was observed around the natural frequency illustrating that the gap resonance is an important issue for the practical engineering however the application of a potential flow model is reported to over predict the wave resonance around the natural frequency the absence of fluid viscosity might be the major reason therefore the introduction of artificial damping to suppress the exaggerated fluid motion are attempted by some researchers such as newman 2004 chen 2004 and tan et al 2017 among others with the development of numerical and computing technique cfd simulation has been used as an alternative approach lu et al 2010 adopted a finite element method fem to solve the navier stokes ns equations and then investigated the gap resonance behavior within two and three boxes moradi et al 2015 investigated the fluid motion in a gap between twin boxes with sharp and rounded corners respectively fredriksen et al 2014 performed both the model tests and numerical modelling to investigate the wave response within moonpools with rectangular and convex edge profiles this work was extended by jiang et al 2019a for sharp convex and concave edge profiles above works indicated that the edge profiles can obviously affect the vortex motion around gap moonpool bottom and in turn impose an influence on the response amplitude jiang et al 2018 investigated the wave reflection and transmission coefficients as well as the energy loss coefficient for a wide range of wave conditions and discussed the occurrence of gap resonance from the perspective of energy dissipation and transformation pervious studies focused on the influence of energy dissipation on the resonance behavior in the gap in the meantime the influence of the wave nonlinearity arising at the free surface due to the large amplitude free surface oscillation on the gap resonance problem was concerned by some researchers kashiwagi et al 2005 examined the mean drift wave force on two closely spaced ships using a potential flow model feng and bai 2015 investigated the wave action with two closely spaced barges using a fully nonlinear numerical model numerical results showed that the free surface nonlinearity plays a minor role in suppressing the wave resonance ning et al 2018 simulated the wave resonance within a gap between two non identical barges in which the artificial damping was implemented into the boundary condition on the free surface to reduce the resonant wave motion jiang et al 2019b numerically investigated the fluid resonance within a box wall system the harmonic analysis indicated that the higher order components of the wave height in the gap are much smaller than the first order component currently the oscillation behavior of the fluid in a gap around the resonance frequency has been extensively studied however there is still a lack of information about the gap resonance induced by the higher order components this higher order induced resonance phenomena in other scenarios have been investigated by many researchers chen et al 1995 shao and faltinsen 2014 and zhou and wu 2015 investigated the spring and ringing response of multiple leg platforms bai et al 2014 and cong et al 2015 investigated the second order induced near trapping phenomenon in a multiple column system sun et al 2010 investigated the piston and sloshing mode of fluid oscillation in a gap formed by two barges using a second order wave diffraction model diffract however to the best of the authors knowledge an investigation of the higher order induced gap resonance by solving ns equations has rarely been reported it is important to reveal the effect of the free surface nonlinearity and fluid viscosity on the higher order induced gap resonance which is the motivation of this work 2 mathematical formulation a numerical wave flume is adopted to simulate the higher order induced gap resonance the schematic figure is shown in fig 1 which involves an inlet relaxation zone a plane wall and a fixed rectangular box in close proximity to a wall a narrow gap is formed between the wall and the box in which large amplitude free surface oscillation can be excited at specific conditions the definition of the coordinate system is also shown in fig 1 the origin of the coordinate system oxy is located on the undisturbed free surface at the inlet boundary the incident wave propagates along the direction of the positive x axis the positive y axis points upwards in the two dimensional simulation the size of the wave flume thickness is set to one computational cell the ns equations for two phase flows is adopted as the governing equations in addition the flows are assumed to be incompressible in an eulerian reference system the governing equations are then expressed as follows 1a ρ t ρ u 0 1b ρ u t ρ u u t p g x p μ u σ t k α α in which u is the fluid velocity vector x is cartesian coordinate vector p is the pressure without the hydrostatic part g 0 9 81 0 t is the gravitational acceleration σ t is the surface tension coefficient and equals to 0 074 kg s2 at 20 c k α is the surface curvature ρ is the density of the fluid μ is the dynamic viscosity of fluid α is the volume fraction of water in the computational cell when the computational cell is completely occupied by air or water α is set to 0 and 1 respectively a value of α between 0 and 1 represents a mixture of the two flows the governing equations in eq 1 are solved for water and air simultaneously when the volume of fluid vof technique is adopted α satisfies the following advection equation 2 α t α u α 1 α u r 0 in which u r is the relative velocity between water and air the compression term i e the third term on the left hand side of eq 2 is introduced to prevent the interface smearing in numerical simulations α 0 50 is used to denote the interface between the two flows the variation of the density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid is expressed as follows 3a ρ α ρ w 1 ϕ ρ a 3b μ α μ w 1 ϕ μ a in which the subscripts w and a denote the water and air phase respectively we then use the toolbox waves2foam jacobsen et al 2012 to generate the incident wave the following relaxation function 4 φ r χ r 1 exp χ r 3 5 1 exp 1 1 χ r 0 1 is applied within the relaxation zone at the inlet boundary and 5 u α φ r u c α t 1 φ r u c α t in which the subscripts c and t denote the computed and target value respectively the simulations are conducted at the supercomputer center of dalian university of technology by using openfoam package with version 3 0 0 at the initial moment the velocity and hydrostatic pressure are set to zero and then the calculation starts at the inlet boundary the velocity vector is defined according to a cnoidal incident wave and the pressure gradient is specified as zero in addition at the body surface the seabed and the plane wall a no slip boundary condition is imposed at the upper boundary of the numerical wave flume the pressure and velocity satisfy the dirichlet and neumann types of boundary conditions respectively the finite volume method fvm is used to solve the governing equations 1a 1b as well as the advection transport equation 2 the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm issa 1986 is used to decouple the velocity and pressure the time increment is determined automatically by adopting the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition and the largest allowable courant number is set to c r 0 20 besides the cfd simulation a linear potential flow model is also used to achieve a comparison within the framework of a linear potential flow theory the theoretical formulation is well known and hence not shown here 3 description of the numerical wave flume in this study the hydrodynamic behavior of a box wall system in shallow water depth is focused a fixed rectangular box with its breadth b l 0 50 m and draft d 0 153 m situated in front of a wall is considered the gap breadth between the box and the wall is b g 0 050 m three water depths i e h 0 50 m 0 40 m and 0 30 m and two incident wave heights i e h i 0 024 m and 0 048 m are selected the cnoidal wave is adopted as the incident wave since it has enough accuracy for regular waves in shallow depth based on the first order cnoidal wave theory the wave elevation η i x t can be written as 6 η i x t h i cn 2 k m π k x ω t m in which cn θ m is the jacobian elliptic function with θ and m being the argument and the elliptic parameter respectively h i is the wave height k 2π λ is the wave number with λ being the wave length ω 2π t is the angular wave frequency with t being the wave period the dispersion relationship of the cnoidal wave is 7 c 2 g h 1 h i h 1 1 m 2 2 3 e m k m in which c λ t ω k is the phase velocity of the cnoidal wave and k m and e m represent the first and second kinds of the elliptic integral numerical simulations are firstly carried out for the generation and propagation of cnoidal waves without the box wall system in the viscous fluid flow wave flume as shown in table 1 cnoidal waves with three wave heights in three water depths are considered where the wave frequencies are the half of the natural frequency of fluid bulk in the narrow gap the length and height of the wave flume are 120 m and 0 8 m respectively two relaxation zones with 22 m length are situated on the left and right ends for wave generation and absorption respectively after the mesh convergence study the uniform mesh scheme with δx λ n x λ 110 is adopted along the wave propagation direction in the vertical direction the non uniform mesh scheme with 4 the minimal interval δ ymin 0 0045 m is utilized which is equipped near the free surface level fig 2 shows the first three harmonic amplitudes with different incident wave heights including the comparison with the analytical results noted that the harmonic amplitudes are decomposed by eq 8 which would be introduced in sec 5 3 a good agreement is observed indicating the present numerical wave flume performs well in generating the cnoidal wave and simulating its propagation furthermore the first order harmonic component of the cnoidal waves decreases gradually with the increase of the incident wave height however a revered trend is found from the higher order components in addition the amplitudes of the higher order harmonic component also gets enhanced as water depth gets shallower all of these results suggests that the remarkable free surface nonlinearity can be expected with large incident wave height and shallow water depth 4 numerical validation to ensure that the numerical model is reliable for the gap resonance problem numerical validation is conducted a fixed rectangular box with its breadth b l 0 50 m height b h 0 45 m and draft d 0 252 m situated near to a plane wall is considered the gap breadth between the wall and box is b g 0 050 m the discretization of the computational domain is conducted by using the mesh generation utility blockmesh to achieve a reduction in the computational cost the non uniform mesh scheme is adopted see fig 3 to well capture the free surface oscillation as well as the boundary layer effect fine meshes with high resolution is equipped in the vicinity of the box wall system especially within the gap in other regions the meshes with intermediate resolution are utilized the detailed parameters for the mesh generation is tabulated in table 2 where the superscripts w and g stand for the parameters describing the mesh discretization outside and inside the narrow gap respectively the normalized wave height h g h i in the narrow gap and the horizontal and vertical wave forces f h ρgba i and f v ρgba i on the box based on different mesh schemes are illustrated in table 3 the wave frequency is 4 80 rad s which is around the resonance frequency it should be mentioned that the h g f h and f v are computed through analyzing the simulated time series in steady states they are average values of the crest and trough sbetween the duration of 90 120 s the comparisons in table 3 suggest that the amplitudes of wave height and wave forces are generally insensitive to the selected four mesh schemes in this work especially between the results based on mesh 3 and mesh 4 therefore mesh 3 is sufficient to achieve convergent results and hence adopted in the subsequent computations the comparison of the present results with those based on potential flow models is shown in fig 4 besides the present results the experimental data reported in tan et al 2014 2017 the semi analytical solutions in liu and li 2014 and the results using an improved boundary element method in lu et al 2011a b are also given in fig 4 fig 4a shows the present results agree with the experimental results which indicates that the present numerical model is reliable in predicting the free surface oscillation in the narrow gap in the meantime the conventional potential flow model without the introduction of artificial damping tends to over predict the wave height around the resonance frequency by adopting suitable artificial damping coefficients i e f 0 09 and μ 0 50 the semi analytical solutions and the improved boundary element method results are able to generate the wave height at a realistic level fig 4b and c shows the comparison of the horizontal and vertical wave forces on the box based on different methods the present results are generally in agreement with the improved semi analytical and numerical solutions in fig 4b and c the artificial damping with the coefficients calibrated by the experimental data is introduced in the improved potential flow models all these results indicate the present model is reliable in predicting the behavior of fluid resonance in the gap resonance problem 5 numerical results and analysis the validation study in the previous section shows that the present viscous numerical wave flume can reproduce well the scenario of fluid resonance in the narrow gap formed by a box wall system which is adopted to investigate the gap resonance problem with different water depth the geometries introduced in sec 3 are utilized in numerical simulation to achieve a comparison the linear potential flow results are also shown in this section 5 1 general description of the fluid resonance within a narrow gap the discussion begins with the variation of the wave height in the gap see fig 5 the potential flow results show apparent differences between the cfd and the linear potential flow results around not only the resonance frequency but also half of the resonance frequency the peak value around the resonance frequency is induced by the first order harmonic component of the incident cnoidal wave the potential flow model over predicts the wave height in the gap this is mainly owning to the absence of fluid viscosity in the conventional potential flow models around the resonance frequency as the incident wave height increases the normalized wave height h g h i in the gap shows a decrease trend it is due to that as h i increases the energy dissipation related to the fluid viscosity and flow rotation gets enhanced at the resonance frequency around half of the resonance frequency another apparent peak is observed from the cfd results which is induced by the second order harmonic component of the incident cnoidal wave the free surface nonlinearity plays an important role for this apparent peak and such nonlinear behavior cannot be captured by a linear model around this frequency the normalized wave height in the gap shows an increase trend as the incident wave height increases the reinforced second order harmonic component of the wave height in the gap which is related to the free surface nonlinearity is the major reason for the phenomenon fig 6 shows the variation of the wave forces on the box against the incident wave frequency it can be speculated that the large amplitude free surface oscillation in the gap can obviously affect the wave forces exerted on the box around the resonance frequency the conventional potential flow model over predicts the wave forces the cfd results also show a decreased trend of the wave forces with the increase of the incident wave height all these phenomena are similar with the variation of the wave height in the gap where the energy dissipation is the essential reason in the low frequency region an additional peak at half of the resonance frequency is found from the horizontal wave force as the incident wave height increases an increased trend of the normalized horizontal wave force on the box is observed around the additional peak the linear potential flow model fails to simulate this phenomenon implying the free surface nonlinearity is an indispensable factor on the behavior of the horizontal wave force around the additional peak in the meantime the linear potential flow model is found to work well in predicting the vertical wave force around half of the resonance frequency indicating the free surface nonlinearity does not impose significant effect on the vertical wave force 5 2 influence of water depth on the fluid resonance behavior how the water depth affects the fluid resonance is then investigated three wave depths i e h 0 50 0 40 and 0 30 m are concerned in the investigation as shown in fig 7 a a decrease trend of the resonance frequency is observed as the water depth gets shallower in the transitional and shallow water regimes a shallower water depth can entrap more fluid mass attending the resonance more fluid mass is able to decrease the resonance frequency as indicated by a linear spring mass system the potential flow model predicts a similar variation trend of the resonance frequency as that from a viscous fluid flow model in the meantime the wave height in the gap gets enhanced as the water depth gets shallower around the resonance frequency the enhanced wave height is closely relevant to the increase of the water volume injected into the gap which is related to the increased vertical velocity of the fluid at the gap bottom all these variations of resonance frequency and wave height with water depth are analogous with the conclusion in moradi et al 2016 and gao et al 2020 furthermore fig 7b and c shows that the variation of the wave force is generally similar with that of the wave height in the gap that is an increased maximal wave force and a corresponding decreased frequency can be observed as the water depth gets shallower this indicates the large amplitude free surface oscillation in the gap is an important factor affecting the behavior of wave force at the resonance frequency fig 7a shows that at half of the resonance frequency a decrease of the water depth also leads to an enhancement of the wave height in the gap at half of the resonance frequency the horizontal wave force gets increased as the wave height grows however a reversed trend can be found from the water depth the increased nonlinearity of the incident cnoidal wave in the shallow water regime is the major reason for the behavior this can be confirmed by the variation of different constitute components of a cnoidal wave with water depth see table 1 furthermore table 4 tabulated the values of the first and second order induced wave height and the horizontal wave force at the resonance frequency and its half which are denoted by the superscripts ω g and ω g 2 respectively it can be observed that the ratio between the first and second order induced wave heights i e h g ω g 2 h g ω g increases with the decrease of water depth or the increase of incident wave height this implies that when the second order induced resonance occurs the wave height in the narrow gap gets more and more important in shallower waver depths and higher sea states analogous variation can also be observed from the ratio between f g ω g 2 and f g ω g in the table whereas the value of f g ω g 2 f g ω g are generally smaller than that of h g ω g 2 h g ω g implying the effect of wave nonlinearity on the wave height is more significant than that on horizontal wave force as shown in fig 7c at half of the resonance frequency the influence of the water depth and incident wave height on the vertical wave force is insignificant and the enchantment of the vertical wave force at half of the resonance frequency is not obvious 5 3 harmonic analysis in order to achieve a spectral analysis the fast fourier transform fft is then adopted when the simulations become periodic the amplitude of each harmonic component can be computed as follows 8 ψ m 2 n t t t 0 t 0 n t t ψ t e i m ω t d t where ψ t is time series of wave elevation or wave force ψ m is the corresponding amplitudes of the mth order harmonic component t is the period totally more than 50 wave periods of the signals in steady states are extracted from each simulated time series and then used for the analysis firstly the amplitudes of the first three harmonic components around the resonance frequency i e ω 5 10 rad s are shown in fig 8 the water depth h and the incident wave height h i are fixed at 0 30 m and 0 048 m respectively in the analysis fig 8a shows an agreement between the overall wave height and its first order component in addition the first order component is much more significant than other higher order components similar phenomenon is also observed from the results of wave forces shown in fig 8b and c it indicates that at the resonance frequency the first order component is predominated in both the wave elevation and wave forces and the effect of the free surface nonlinearity is not obvious furthermore the spectral analysis is also conducted around half of the resonance frequency as shown in fig 9 again the water depth h and the incident wave height h i are fixed at 0 30 m and 0 048 m respectively in the analysis in addition the incident wave frequency varies from 2 0 to 4 0 rad s as shown in fig 9a the first order component of the total wave height or wave force is almost the same with the linear potential flow results the apparent difference between the linear potential flow results and the cfd results are mainly at the second order harmonic component in this case the ratio between the second order harmonic component and the total wave height i e h g 2 n d h g t o t a l equals to 0 558 in fig 9b the second order harmonic component of the horizontal wave force is even more significant than the first order component and the ratio of between h g 2 n d and h g t o t a l approaches 0 741 as for the vertical wave force see fig 9c the second order component is much less obvious than the first order component in the meantime we also note that there exist an apparent third order component in fig 9c which indicates again that the nonlinearity is an important factor in this problem to highlight the second order induced resonance fig 10 shows the total first and second order harmonic components of the wave elevation and wave force as well as the comparison with the cfd results in the simulation the water depth h incident wave height h i and wave frequency ω are fixed at 0 30 m 0 48 m and 2 60 rad s respectively from fig 10a it can be found that the wave elevation based on the cfd simulation has a non sinusoidal characteristic and the first order component cannot well represent the total wave elevation we also note that wave elevation can be represent more accurately after including the second order component in fig 10b the time series of horizontal wave force shows two oscillations in each period which implies the double frequency components contribute obviously to the total wave force at the wave trough the first order component makes negligible contribution while the second order component generally agrees with total horizontal wave force at the wave crest the first and second order components make opposite contribution while their overall contribution is close to the total horizontal wave force from fig 10c it is noted that the first order component generally agrees with the total vertical wave force the above harmonic analysis in figs 9 and 10 suggests that the second order harmonic component plays the dominating role on the wave elevation in the gap and the horizontal wave force when second order induced resonance happens however the wave resonance induced by the second order component has insignificant effect on the vertical wave force finally we examine the effect of h i on the total first and second order harmonic components of the wave height and wave force around half of the resonance frequency the results of wave elevation in the gap as well as the horizontal wave force are tabulated in table 5 from the results of wave elevation it is found that its first order component is almost independent of h i and the increase of the total wave height is mainly from the increase of the second order component as for the normalized horizontal wave force the comparison in table 5 shows that the first and second order components of the wave force both increase with the increase of h i leading to an increased total wave force on the box to further examine the influence of h i time histories of the total first and second order harmonic components of the wave height and wave force are shown in fig 11 in addition to the difference in the magnitude the phase shift between the results with different incident wave heights is also observed this is owning to that the phase velocity of the cnoidal incident wave dependents on the wave height 6 conclusion fluid resonance within a narrow gap formed by a box in close proximity to a plane wall under cnoidal wave action is investigated the cfd package openfoam is used to conduct the numerical simulation verifications and validations are performed by comparing with the published data confirming that the numerical model is reliable in predicting the hydrodynamic behavior of the box wall system three water depths and two incident wave heights with a wide range of frequencies are considered in the numerical simulation it is shown that the wave resonances can be excited at both the resonance frequency and half of the resonance frequency which are induced by the first and second order harmonic components of the incident wave respectively the conventional linear potential flow model over predicts the free surface oscillation around the resonance frequency it also fails to predict the second order induced resonance phenomenon at half of the resonance frequency the resonance frequency increases as the water depth gets shallower which is due to that more fluid mass can attend the resonance in a shallower water depth a shallower water depth also leads to an enhancement of the wave height in the gap at the resonance frequency in the meantime an increase of the incident wave height can lead to a slight decrease of the normalized first order induced wave height this is mainly due to that a large incident wave height can cause more energy dissipation associated with fluid viscosity the harmonic analysis shows that the effect of the free surface nonlinearity is not significant when the incident wave frequency is around the resonance frequency similar phenomena are also observed from the wave forces around half of the resonance frequency the enhanced normalized wave height in the gap is observed as the incident wave height increases it illustrates that the free surface nonlinearity is an indispensable factor on the second order induced resonance due to the larger second order wave component of the cnoidal incident wave in a shallower water depth the second order induced wave height in the gap increases gradually as the water depth gets shallower it indicates that the second order induced resonance gets more important for a larger incident wave height and a shallower water depth similar phenomena can also be found from the horizontal wave force however the second order induced resonance does not impose significant effect on the vertical wave force the harmonic analysis is conducted to analyze the second order wave component induced resonance behavior around half of the resonance frequency apparent difference is found between the total cfd results and its first order component however after including the second order component the cfd results can be better represented it suggests that an approximation including the first and second order components can be a promising way to represent the time signals of the cfd results for both the wave height and wave force credit authorship contribution statement sheng chao jiang was the main

20271,fluid resonance within a narrow gap formed by a box in close proximity to a plane wall under cnoidal wave action is investigated using the computational fluid dynamics cfd package openfoam fluid resonance behavior excited by the second order harmonic component of the incident cnoidal waves is concerned numerical simulations show the large second order induced wave height in the gap which increases as the incident wave height gets larger or the water depth gets shallower the large double frequency component of the cnodial waves is the major reason for the phenomenon harmonic analysis indicates that the cfd results can be represented well by a second order approximation and the free surface nonlinearity is an indispensable factor in the action of the cnoidal incident wave similar phenomenon is also found in the horizontal wave force however the second order induced resonance within the gap has insignificant effect on the vertical wave force keywords fluid resonance narrow gap harmonic analysis free surface nonlinearity wave amplitude wave force 1 introduction fluid resonance within a gap formed by closely spaced bodies has attracted considerable attention in the last two decades since it has been a key technical challenge for loading and offloading operations of multiple barges in close proximity miao et al 2001 and zhu et al 2008 simulated the free surface oscillation between multiple floating bodies using a potential flow model faltinsen et al 2007 and molin et al 2018 analyzed the piston and sloshing modal shapes of fluid resonance via solving an eigenvalue equation based on the physical model tests saitoh et al 2006 iwata et al 2007 and peric and swan 2015 studied the wave resonance within a multiple box system the significantly amplified wave elevation in the gap was observed around the natural frequency illustrating that the gap resonance is an important issue for the practical engineering however the application of a potential flow model is reported to over predict the wave resonance around the natural frequency the absence of fluid viscosity might be the major reason therefore the introduction of artificial damping to suppress the exaggerated fluid motion are attempted by some researchers such as newman 2004 chen 2004 and tan et al 2017 among others with the development of numerical and computing technique cfd simulation has been used as an alternative approach lu et al 2010 adopted a finite element method fem to solve the navier stokes ns equations and then investigated the gap resonance behavior within two and three boxes moradi et al 2015 investigated the fluid motion in a gap between twin boxes with sharp and rounded corners respectively fredriksen et al 2014 performed both the model tests and numerical modelling to investigate the wave response within moonpools with rectangular and convex edge profiles this work was extended by jiang et al 2019a for sharp convex and concave edge profiles above works indicated that the edge profiles can obviously affect the vortex motion around gap moonpool bottom and in turn impose an influence on the response amplitude jiang et al 2018 investigated the wave reflection and transmission coefficients as well as the energy loss coefficient for a wide range of wave conditions and discussed the occurrence of gap resonance from the perspective of energy dissipation and transformation pervious studies focused on the influence of energy dissipation on the resonance behavior in the gap in the meantime the influence of the wave nonlinearity arising at the free surface due to the large amplitude free surface oscillation on the gap resonance problem was concerned by some researchers kashiwagi et al 2005 examined the mean drift wave force on two closely spaced ships using a potential flow model feng and bai 2015 investigated the wave action with two closely spaced barges using a fully nonlinear numerical model numerical results showed that the free surface nonlinearity plays a minor role in suppressing the wave resonance ning et al 2018 simulated the wave resonance within a gap between two non identical barges in which the artificial damping was implemented into the boundary condition on the free surface to reduce the resonant wave motion jiang et al 2019b numerically investigated the fluid resonance within a box wall system the harmonic analysis indicated that the higher order components of the wave height in the gap are much smaller than the first order component currently the oscillation behavior of the fluid in a gap around the resonance frequency has been extensively studied however there is still a lack of information about the gap resonance induced by the higher order components this higher order induced resonance phenomena in other scenarios have been investigated by many researchers chen et al 1995 shao and faltinsen 2014 and zhou and wu 2015 investigated the spring and ringing response of multiple leg platforms bai et al 2014 and cong et al 2015 investigated the second order induced near trapping phenomenon in a multiple column system sun et al 2010 investigated the piston and sloshing mode of fluid oscillation in a gap formed by two barges using a second order wave diffraction model diffract however to the best of the authors knowledge an investigation of the higher order induced gap resonance by solving ns equations has rarely been reported it is important to reveal the effect of the free surface nonlinearity and fluid viscosity on the higher order induced gap resonance which is the motivation of this work 2 mathematical formulation a numerical wave flume is adopted to simulate the higher order induced gap resonance the schematic figure is shown in fig 1 which involves an inlet relaxation zone a plane wall and a fixed rectangular box in close proximity to a wall a narrow gap is formed between the wall and the box in which large amplitude free surface oscillation can be excited at specific conditions the definition of the coordinate system is also shown in fig 1 the origin of the coordinate system oxy is located on the undisturbed free surface at the inlet boundary the incident wave propagates along the direction of the positive x axis the positive y axis points upwards in the two dimensional simulation the size of the wave flume thickness is set to one computational cell the ns equations for two phase flows is adopted as the governing equations in addition the flows are assumed to be incompressible in an eulerian reference system the governing

hydrostatic part g 0 9 81 0 t is the gravitational acceleration σ t is the surface tension coefficient and equals to 0 074 kg s2 at 20 c k α is the surface curvature ρ is the density of the fluid μ is the dynamic viscosity of fluid α is the volume fraction of water in the computational cell when the computational cell is completely occupied by air or water α is set to 0 and 1 respectively a value of α between 0 and 1 represents a mixture of the two flows the governing equations in eq 1 are solved for water and air simultaneously when the volume of fluid vof technique is adopted α satisfies the following advection equation 2 α t α u α 1 α u r 0 in which u r is the relative velocity between water and air the compression term i e the third term on the left hand side of eq 2 is introduced to prevent the interface smearing in numerical simulations α 0 50 is used to denote the interface between the two flows the variation of the density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid is expressed as follows 3a ρ α ρ w 1 ϕ ρ a 3b μ α μ w 1 ϕ μ a in which the subscripts w and a denote the water and air phase respectively we then use the toolbox waves2foam jacobsen et al 2012 to generate the incident wave the following relaxation function 4 φ r χ r 1 exp χ r 3 5 1 exp 1 1 χ r 0 1 is applied within the relaxation zone at the inlet boundary and 5 u α φ r u c α t 1 φ r u c α t in which the subscripts c and t denote the computed and target value respectively the simulations are conducted at the supercomputer center of dalian university of technology by using openfoam package with version 3 0 0 at the initial moment the velocity and hydrostatic pressure are set to zero and then the calculation starts at the inlet boundary the velocity vector is defined according to a cnoidal incident wave and the pressure gradient is specified as zero in addition at the body surface the seabed and the plane wall a no slip boundary condition is imposed at the upper boundary of the numerical wave flume the pressure and velocity satisfy the dirichlet and neumann types of boundary conditions respectively the finite volume method fvm is used to solve the governing equations 1a 1b as well as the advection transport equation 2 the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm issa 1986 is used to decouple the velocity and pressure the time increment is determined automatically by adopting the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition and the largest allowable courant number is set to c r 0 20 besides the cfd simulation a linear potential flow model is also used to achieve a comparison within the framework of a linear potential flow theory the theoretical formulation is well known and hence not shown here 3 description of the numerical wave flume in this study the

of the incident cnoidal wave the free surface nonlinearity plays an important role for this apparent peak and such nonlinear behavior cannot be captured by a linear model around this frequency the normalized wave height in the gap shows an increase trend as the incident wave height increases the reinforced second order harmonic component of the wave height in the gap which is related to the free surface nonlinearity is the major reason for the phenomenon fig 6 shows the variation of the wave forces on the box against the incident wave frequency it can be speculated that the large amplitude free surface oscillation in the gap can obviously affect the wave forces exerted on the box around the resonance frequency the conventional potential flow model over predicts the wave forces the cfd results also show a decreased trend of the wave forces with the increase of the incident wave height all these phenomena are similar with the variation of the wave height in the gap where the energy dissipation is the essential reason in the low frequency region an additional peak at half of the resonance frequency is found from the horizontal wave force as the incident wave height increases an increased trend of the normalized horizontal wave force on the box is observed around the additional peak the linear potential flow model fails to simulate this phenomenon implying the free surface nonlinearity is an indispensable factor on the behavior of the horizontal wave force around the additional peak in the meantime the linear potential flow model is found to work well in predicting the vertical wave force around half of the resonance frequency indicating the free surface nonlinearity does not impose significant effect on the vertical wave force 5 2 influence of water depth on the fluid resonance behavior how the water depth affects the fluid resonance is then investigated three wave depths i e h 0 50 0 40 and 0 30 m are concerned in the investigation as shown in fig 7 a a decrease trend of the resonance frequency is observed as the water depth gets shallower in the transitional and shallow water regimes a shallower water depth can entrap more fluid mass attending the resonance more fluid mass is able to decrease the resonance frequency as indicated by a linear spring mass system the potential flow model predicts a similar variation trend of the resonance frequency as that from a viscous fluid flow model in the meantime the wave height in the gap gets enhanced as the water depth gets shallower around the resonance frequency the enhanced wave height is closely relevant to the increase of the water volume injected into the gap which is related to the increased vertical velocity of the fluid at the gap bottom all these variations of resonance frequency and wave height with water depth are analogous with the conclusion in moradi et al 2016 and gao et al 2020 furthermore fig 7b and c shows that the variation of the wave force is generally similar with that of the wave height in the gap that is an increased maximal wave force and a corresponding decreased frequency can be observed as the water depth gets shallower this indicates the large amplitude free surface oscillation in the gap is an important factor affecting the behavior of wave force at the resonance frequency fig 7a shows that at half of the resonance frequency a decrease of the water depth also leads to an enhancement of the wave height in the gap at half of the resonance frequency the horizontal wave force gets increased as the wave height grows however a reversed trend can be found from the water depth the increased nonlinearity of the incident cnoidal wave in the shallow water regime is the major reason for the behavior this can be confirmed by the variation of different constitute components of a cnoidal wave with water depth see table 1 furthermore table 4 tabulated the values of the first and second order induced wave height and the horizontal wave force at the resonance frequency and its half which are denoted by the superscripts ω g and ω g 2 respectively it can be observed that the ratio between the first and second order induced wave heights i e h g ω g 2 h g ω g increases with the decrease of water depth or the increase of incident wave height this implies that when the second order induced resonance occurs the wave height in the narrow gap gets more and more important in shallower waver depths and higher sea states analogous variation can also be observed from the ratio between f g ω g 2 and f g ω g in the table whereas the value of f g ω g 2 f g ω g are generally smaller than that of h g ω g 2 h g ω g implying the effect of wave nonlinearity on the wave height is more significant than that on horizontal wave force as shown in fig 7c at half of the resonance frequency the influence of the water depth and incident wave height on the vertical wave force is insignificant and the enchantment of the vertical wave force at half of the resonance frequency is not obvious 5 3 harmonic analysis in order to achieve a spectral analysis the fast fourier transform fft is then adopted when the simulations become periodic the amplitude of each harmonic component can be computed as follows 8 ψ m 2 n t t t 0 t 0 n t t ψ t e i m ω t d t where ψ t is time series of wave elevation or wave force ψ m is the corresponding amplitudes of the mth order harmonic component t is the period totally more than 50 wave periods of the signals in steady states are extracted from each simulated time series and then used for the analysis firstly the amplitudes of the first three harmonic components around the resonance frequency i e ω 5 10 rad s are shown in fig 8 the water depth h and the incident wave height h i are fixed at 0 30 m and 0 048 m respectively in the analysis fig 8a shows an agreement between the overall wave height and its first order component in addition the first order component is much more significant than other higher order components similar phenomenon is also observed from the results of wave forces shown in fig 8b and c it indicates that at the resonance frequency the first order component is predominated in both the wave elevation and wave forces and the effect of the free surface nonlinearity is not obvious furthermore the spectral analysis is also conducted around half of the resonance frequency as shown in fig 9 again the water depth h and the incident wave height h i are fixed at 0 30 m and 0 048 m respectively in the analysis in addition the incident wave frequency varies from 2 0 to 4 0 rad s as shown in fig 9a the first order component of the total wave height or wave force is almost the same with the linear potential flow results the apparent difference between the linear potential flow results and the cfd results are mainly at the second order harmonic component in this case the ratio between the second order harmonic component and the total wave height i e h g 2 n d h g t o t a l equals to 0 558 in fig 9b the second order harmonic component of the horizontal wave force is even more significant than the first order component and the ratio of between h g 2 n d and h g t o t a l approaches 0 741 as for the vertical wave force see fig 9c the second order component is much less obvious than the first order component in the meantime we also note that there exist an apparent third order component in fig 9c which indicates again that the nonlinearity is an important factor in this problem to highlight the second order induced resonance fig 10 shows the total first and second order harmonic components of the wave elevation and wave force as well as the comparison with the cfd results in the simulation the water depth h incident wave height h i and wave frequency ω are fixed at 0 30 m 0 48 m and 2 60 rad s respectively from fig 10a it can be found that the wave elevation based on the cfd simulation has a non sinusoidal characteristic and the first order component cannot well represent the total wave elevation we also note that wave elevation can be represent more accurately after including the second order component in fig 10b the time series of horizontal wave force shows two oscillations in each period which implies the double frequency components contribute obviously to the total wave force at the wave trough the first order component makes negligible contribution while the second order component generally agrees with total horizontal wave force at the wave crest the first and second order components make opposite contribution while their overall contribution is close to the total horizontal wave force from fig 10c it is noted that the first order component generally agrees with the total vertical wave force the above harmonic analysis in figs 9 and 10 suggests that the second order harmonic component plays the dominating role on the wave elevation in the gap and the horizontal wave force when second order induced resonance happens however the wave resonance induced by the second order component has insignificant effect on the vertical wave force finally we examine the effect of h i on the total first and second order harmonic components of the wave height and wave force around half of the resonance frequency the results of wave elevation in the gap as well as the horizontal wave force are tabulated in table 5 from the results of wave elevation it is found that its first order component is almost independent of h i and the increase of the total wave height is mainly from the increase of the second order component as for the normalized horizontal wave force the comparison in table 5 shows that the first and second order components of the wave force both increase with the increase of h i leading to an increased total wave force on the box to further examine the influence of h i time histories of the total first and second order harmonic components of the wave height and wave force are shown in fig 11 in addition to the difference in the magnitude the phase shift between the results with different incident wave heights is also observed this is owning to that the phase velocity of the cnoidal incident wave dependents on the wave height 6 conclusion fluid resonance within a narrow gap formed by a box in close proximity to a plane wall under cnoidal wave action is investigated the cfd package openfoam is used to conduct the numerical simulation verifications and validations are performed by comparing with the published data confirming that the numerical model is reliable in predicting the hydrodynamic behavior of the box wall system three water depths and two incident wave heights with a wide range of frequencies are considered in the numerical simulation it is shown that the wave resonances can be excited at both the resonance frequency and half of the resonance frequency which are induced by the first and second order harmonic components of the incident wave respectively the conventional linear potential flow model over predicts the free surface oscillation around the resonance frequency it also fails to predict the second order induced resonance phenomenon at half of the resonance frequency the resonance frequency increases as the water depth gets shallower which is due to that more fluid mass can attend the resonance in a shallower water depth a shallower water depth also leads to an enhancement of the wave height in the gap at the resonance frequency in the meantime an increase of the incident wave height can lead to a slight decrease of the normalized first order induced wave height this is mainly due to that a large incident wave height can cause more energy dissipation associated with fluid viscosity the harmonic analysis shows that the effect of the free surface nonlinearity is not significant when the incident wave frequency is around the resonance frequency similar phenomena are also observed from the wave forces around half of the resonance frequency the enhanced normalized wave height in the gap is observed as the incident wave height increases it illustrates that the free surface nonlinearity is an indispensable factor on the second order induced resonance due to the larger second order wave component of the cnoidal incident wave in a shallower water depth the second order induced wave height in the gap increases gradually as the water depth gets shallower it indicates that the second order induced resonance gets more important for a larger incident wave height and a shallower water depth similar phenomena can also be found from the horizontal wave force however the second order induced resonance does not impose significant effect on the vertical wave force the harmonic analysis is conducted to analyze the second order wave component induced resonance behavior around half of the resonance frequency apparent difference is found between the total cfd results and its first order component however after including the second order component the cfd results can be better represented it suggests that an approximation including the first and second order components can be a promising way to represent the time signals of the cfd results for both the wave height and wave force credit authorship contribution statement sheng chao jiang was the main

20272,since numerical structural calculations of sailing yachts rigs strictly depend on the dock tuning load dtl it is necessary to evaluate it during vessels normal operations even when it cannot be estimated by load cells installed onboard in this paper a novel approach for the determination of the pre tension load of stays and shrouds for large sailing vessels is presented and it based on the coupling of an analytical approach to the cables dynamics and the evaluation of natural modes by using experimental modal analysis ema the validation of the method herein proposed as been validated by

introduction the structural assessment of rigs of large sailing yachts has become a key concern for new constructions and refitting the present pleasure craft market requires higher performances that can be achieved by lowering the structural weight and by increasing the vessel s stability these two aspects can be accomplished by reducing the mast and rig scantling even lower than the classification societies requirements but they have to be demonstrated by proper finite element calculations rizzo and boote 2010 vergassola et al 2018a in this perspective the application of the correct pre tensioning loads on masts stays and shrouds is a key aspect for obtaining reliable results ocera et al 2017 bel hadj ali and smith 2010 but the onboard control of the correct value is also necessary while for small craft the pretension load can be easily evaluated for larger units over 20 m it cannot be directly evaluated by quick inspections for example by applying load cells on the cables or directly on the masts in fact the so called dock tuning load dtl can be applied by compressing the mast s foot using an hydraulic jack or by tensing each stay and shroud in the first case the overall load is distributed on the entire rig by the welding the spreaders and the connections between the mast and the cables but a differential pre tensile load on each stay cannot be applied in the second scenario the most common for large sailing yacht the load can be applied singularly on each cable with the effect of optimizing the entire structural response of the rig nevertheless the precise pre tensioning cannot be evaluated directly in this paper a novel approach for the determination of the pre tension load of stays and shrouds for large sailing vessels is presented for those units on which a direct estimation of that load on each cable cannot be achieved the herein presented approach is based on the evaluation of cables natural modes and frequencies by using experimental modal analysis ema tests coupled with the analytical solution of a taut cable the experimental campaign has been evaluated also by considering the possible interaction of winds effect on the stay during the trials so as to discard all the measured resonances due to winds that could be misinterpreted as natural frequencies non linear finite element calculation has been carried out on a model cable in order to validate the proposed method by means of a regression equation of the cables natural frequencies based on the initial pre tension of the cable 2 analytical solution of a taut cable a possible approach to the problem of identifying the dynamic loading of a taut cable has been proposed by lagomarsino and calderini 2003 and it is based on the assimilation of the cable to a particular uniform section euler bernoulli beam subject to axial tensile load and constrained at the extremities by fixities that allow the displacement along the cable axis see fig 1 the governing equation of the abovementioned dynamic system is described in eq 1 1 e j 4 y x t x 4 t 2 y x t x 2 ρ 2 y x t t 2 where e is the young s modulus of the material j is the moment of inertia ρ is the material linear density y is the vertical displacement as a function of the abscissa x and the time t t is the tensile load to be determined the variable separation technique is applied to eq 1 and it can be rewritten as 2 e j y i v x t y i i x ω 2 ρ e j y x 0 where y x is spatial solution associated to the circular frequency ω and the roman number in superscript indicates the order of the derivatives the general solution of the spatial equation is a linear combination of sinus cosinus and hyperbolic function as 3 y x c 1 sin α x c 2 cos α x c 3 sinh β x c 4 cosh β x where 4 α t 2 e j 1 4 ω 2 ρ e j t 2 1 β t 2 e j 1 4 ω 2 ρ e j t 2 1 and the integration constants c i can be deduced by applying the correct boundary condition the limitation of this approach for the study of the dynamic pre tension of stays is that the flexural rigidity of the cable is considered that is negligible in the reality in the real study case ej 0 and the axial initial displacement k 0 for this particular boundary condition set a closed type solution can be deduced from eq 2 for determining the initial tension 5 t 4 ρ f n 2 l 2 n 2 in eq 5 n is the natural frequency number with n 1 2 3 fn is the natural frequency of the n th mode expressed in hz ρ is the density of the cable in kg m3 and l the cable s length expressed in m nevertheless the solution proposed in eq 5 suffers the problem that it is independent on the value of t that in the real case can drastically change the shape of the cable from a straight one to a complete developed catenary shape in this perspective the solution proposed in eq 5 must be adapted to consider the modal shape and the static shape of the cable induced by the tensile load t starting from the study of lagomarsino and calderoni lagomarsino and calderini 2003 the research proposed by blevins 1979 can be used to consider the correct t depending on the abovementioned parameters in particular the parameter α must be introduced that reflects as the pre tensile load t influences the natural frequencies and the mode shapes 6 α 8 d l 2 e a t 0 l l e where d is the mean deflection of the cable that can be evaluated at mid length a is the cross section l e is the virtual length that can be considered equal to l as a first attempt t 0 is the mean dynamic tensile load the parameter α can influence the eigenmodes as follows α 2 0 the initial sagging is negligible and the cable can be considered as straight 0 α 2 4 π 2 the first symmetrical natural frequency in the catenary plane is lower than the corresponding asymmetrical one see fig 2 α 2 4 π 2 the symmetrical and asymmetrical natural frequencies are equal α 2 4 π 2 the first symmetrical natural frequency in the catenary plane is greater then the corresponding asymmetrical one different values approximated of t 0 and of natural frequency f n as a function of the α parameter are proposed in tables 1 10 and 11 where n is the natural s frequency order number λ i can be deduced by fig 3 for each natural frequency and t can be calculated by eq 5 the only incognita for the estimation of the tensile load t 0 is become the first natural frequency since the higher order ones are clearly less effective and it can be calculated by experimental modal analyses chen and ou 2011 3 study case the stay of an italian tall ships whose dimensions are reported in table 2 has been assumed as a studycase the stay used for the application of the presented methodology is the 2nd left stay of the foremast as reported in fig 4 for the abovementioned stay the pretensile loads is varied by acting on the turnbuckles in fig 5 4 experimental modal analysis on the selected stay the testing campaign is carried out during rina cs visits for the classification of the entire rig for safety reasons the experimental modal analysis ema on the stay marked in fig 4 is done by using three accelerometers located in the same position at 1 4 of the cable s span fig 6 the three accelerometers one triaxial and two monoaxial have been connected to two different analysers apollo soundbooks in order to calculate the fast fourier transform fft of the signal of the triaxial accelerometer on one side and the frequency response function frf by using the two monoaxial ones if only one analyser is used apart from a problem of analyser s number of channels the fft or the frf would is calculated only by complex post processing function that could have caused distortion on the final signal the extrapolation of the normal frequencies of the stays by the ema is carried out by hitting the cable with an instrumented hammer with soft tip generating an impulsive load as already proofed by the same authors in vergassola and boote 2019 vergassola et al 2018b and calculating the frequency response function in a point in which the displacement is not negligible in this case in order to acquire the response due to both the symmetrical and asymmetrical normal modes the accelerometers have been placed at ¼ of the cable s length in particular the triaxial accelerometer is installed with the x axis along the cable s length the y axis out of the catenary s plane and the z one in the catenary s plane the monoaxial ones is placed in and out of the catenary s plane respectively it is decided to acquire also the fft see fig 4 in order to make a more accurate evaluation of the vibrational behaviour of the stay and also because there aren t certainties that the vibrational return wave would is had no impact in the frf moreover the fft is independent on the impact load and so it can be carried out more easily during daily operation since requires only an accelerometer and the fft could be calculated even in a second moment as it can be seen from fig 7 below 1 hz the signal is dominated by the noise that could be generated by the wind by an electromagnetic field along the stay or by rigid body movement pendulum of the stay itself the first four natural frequencies calculated by the fft s peaks is reported in table 3 for the scope of this research only the first natural frequency are of some interest it is to be confirmed by looking at the frf calculated by the two monoaxial accelerometers fig 8 in fact as it will be shown in the next chapter the wind present during the test could generate unreal peaks in the fft that are filtered in the frf due to the registration of the impact hammer signal as it can be easily seen in the previous fig 8 also the frequency response function shows the same peak in corrispondance of 3 5 hz so it can be considered as the first real natural frequency of the stay since this natural frequency is mainly highlighted in the catenary s plane accelerometer s axis and for the cable under consideration α2 5 6 the formulation of the 4th row of table 1 is used and the pre tension load is calculated as t0 68157 n 6 8 tf 5 wind s effect on the ema tests the effect of wind on the vibration of structures can be split into four different phenomenon the vortex induced the galloping the fluttering and the buffeting di et al 2021 for the problem under consideration it can be easily assumed that a round cable cannot be affected by fluttering since it is caused by a loss of flexural rigidity of the structure that for a cable is zero as a definition matsumotoet al 1990 xu 2013 the same could be stated for the phenomenon of buffeting caused by the turbulent flow around the cable but the wind registered during the test was 9 kn and the reynolds number calculated for the stay is re 7534 so it was clearly in a non turbulent layer a deeper analysis must be carried out for vortex induced and galloping the first phenomenon fig 9 is caused by the generation of vortexes in the cable s wake that cause a fluctuation of pressure around the cross section and consequently a vibration form xu 2013 the frequency fst of stable vortex induced generation can be calculated as 7 f s t s t u d where s c is the strouhal number s t f l v that can be considered equal to 0 2 for cylindrical cables u is the undisturbed wind speed d is the diameter of the cable 20 mm in table 4 the fst hz is calculated for the wind speed present during the test 9 kn as it can be seen from table 4 the frequency of a stable release of vortex in the stay s wake is really higher than the one under consideration 0 10 hz so it can be deduced that also the vortex induced phenomenon is not able to perturbate the modal tests the phenomenon of galloping is due to the fluctuation of the lift force around the cable that could generate high amplitude motions it can be stated that galloping happens if 8 c d c l 0 where c d is the drag coefficient and c l is the first derivative of the lift coefficient when the analytical description of c l and c d is not available as in this case a critical undisturbed wind velocity upon which the galloping is effective can be calculated as 9 u c r i t c f n d s c where s c m ζ ρ d 2 is the scrutal number m is the total mass ζ is the structural damping of the cable ρ is the density and d the diameter of the cable f n is the frequency under consideration and c a parameter that reflects how much the flow is disturbed by the presence of the stay and it can vary between 25 and 60 but it can be assumed equal to 30 for undisturbed cable is tin this case since the wind was at beam in table 5 considering a typical structural damping of 0 001 boote et al 2017 the critical velocity of galloping is calculated as a function of the parameter c as it can be seen the galloping critical velocity is clearly in the range of wind speed under consideration and so it can be stated that if only an fft test is be carried out the natural frequencies would are misinterpreted due to the wind vibration phenomenon the effect of ship s motion during the trial has been considered negligible since the vessel was safely moored in basin 6 numerical solution to the pretensioning problem external influences may have affected the correctness of the measured natural frequencies reported in table 3 in order to validate the results obtained through the experimental method finite element calculation is performed the numerical model is modelled using patran as a pre post processor and nastran as a solver the cable examined has a length of 26 44 m and is made of steel strands the characteristics are reported in table 6 the cables of the structures are slender yang and tsay 2007 therefore they are schematized as one dimensional elements the local phenomena occurring in the section are negligible this allows to study the overall behaviour of the cable which is an intrinsically labile structure as it has zero flexural stiffness infinite axial stiffness and supports only stresses and non compressions the numerical model is created by rod elements with only 2 translational degrees of freedom at the nodes at the end as shown in fig 10 the shroud is blocked at its ends to simulate the interlocking in correspondence of the bridge deck and fastening the foremast for these reasons a local reference system at the end point with x axis coinciding with the curvilinear coordinate is created furthermore the weight force acting on the cable is added but this structure is not able to support a load outside its own plane so an initial elongation is introduced which is made to vary from 5 mm up to 5 cm as typically occurs in slender structures external forces and displacements are not in linear relationship therefore a non linear static analysis is performed in non linear analysis the stiffness of the structure is dependent on both the displacements and the acting forces and varies during the analysis for this reason large deformations are allowed in the analysis settings the numerical methodology used to solve the non linear problem is the incremental one i e the total external load is applied in ten different steps and for each of them the stiffness matrix of the system is updated until the total load is applied and the final convergence is reached after the last step of load application the modal analysis of the structure is performed to obtain its own frequencies only as an example the natural frequencies of the cable obtained with pre tension of 1 cm are reported in table 7 and mode shape with a half wave is shown in fig 11 imposing an initial elongation of 1 cm means assuming that the pre tensioning of the shroud is 6287 n this result is obtained after obtaining the elongation and tension inside the cable with the formulas illustrated below 10 ε i n i t i a l e l o n g a t i o n l 11 σ p a ε e 12 t n σ a therefore collecting the values relative to the natural frequency of each initial elongation for one half wave and two half wave mode shape a regression curve representing the relationship between the pretension t n and the natural frequency f n hz is reported in table 8 the graph in fig 12 shows that the relationship between the natural frequency and the pre tensioning of the cable is linear the coefficient of determination is close to 1 and therefore the line identified accurately approximates the data in possession with dotted line the regression curves are also plotted tables 9 and 11 compares the results obtained through the experimental numerical and the analytical method for the half wave mode shape of the cable in two different condition the first is when the cable is in the reference condition position in which the cable is found at the time of the test the second condition is a different pretension two turns of the turnbuckle are given which correspond to a variation of the reference elongation of the cable equal to 12 mm the comparison is only between the frequencies between 3 hz and 6 hz because the cable at the initial moment of the analysis could not be perfectly still this phenomenon would give rise to a pendulum motion that could be found at low frequencies in the same way frequencies above 6 hz are not considered since these may already be in correspondence with the return wave in addition they correspond to higher mode shape that need more energy to be excited properly the first column shows the frequencies that have been detected through the on board tests described in table 3 the second column includes the pretension values calculated in correspondence with the frequencies measured on board using the equation of the regression curve identified through the relationship described in fig 12 the third column collects the values reported in table 1 the fourth column represents the relationship between the numerical and analytical results and it is possible to note how the pretensioning t calculated through the two methodologies are practically coincident for fn 3 51 hz in this condition an initial elongation of 5 cm is imposed on the cable as can be verified by calculating the δl fem and δl analytic reported in the fifth and sixth columns respectively even the natural frequency of 5 27 hz to be a natural frequency of the structure since the tensioning obtained by the numerical result is 80 of that obtained analytically finally the initial elongations are in both cases numerical and analytical of about 10 cm the same comparison between the results obtained through the experimental numerical and analytical method is carried out for the mode shape with two half waves of the cable is shown in table 10 from the comparison of analytical and numerical results in table 7 it is clear that the analytical method overestimates the pretensioning approximately 4 fold compared to that numeric model for this reason the results obtained considering the two half wave mode cannot be considered reliable in the same way the comparison of the ema numerical and analytical results obtained with the initial elongation of 12 mm are shown in table 10 in this case the correct natural frequency is 3 12 hz in fact by calculating the δt n this has a negative value this means that by giving two turns of the cable turnbuckle is made more slack so also the frequencies will drop see table 11 in conclusion the initial tensioning results obtained with the experimental analytical and numerical methodology converge so the test methodology used to calculate the pre tensioning of the shrouds can be considered reliable however it is important to note how the effect of the wind can dirty the true measurements in particular if it is not possible to carry out frf tests and therefore the fourier transform of the accelerometer signal is available for example for pleasure craft a wind of 7 kn is a condition that can be easily found already on the quay can influence the test methodology the presence of the galloping phenomenon is highly probable it is necessary to counter validate the results obtained with a finite element calculation if the presence of phenomena of galloping or vortex shedding are detected instead flutter is a torsional phenomenon and therefore not applicable to cables 7 conclusions in this paper a novel approach for the determination of the pre tension load of stays and shrouds has been presented based on the coupling of experimental modal analysis tests and an analytical solution of cables this approach has been developed especially for large sailing yachts i e when it is not possible to verify onboard which is the preload of each stays and so to help designers to choose the correct dock tuning load for numerical analysis of rigs it has been proved that it is sufficient the fast fourier transform of the signal of one accelerometer located on a stay and hit with an impulsive load to calculate the natural frequency of the cable and then it is possible by the analytical formulas of table 1 to derive the correct pre tension of the cable itself it has also be highlighted that in case of only fft tests are conduced it must be verified the effect of wind induced vibration since the phenomenon of galloping could be present even in low wind speed condition in fact it is sufficient a wind velocity of 6 7 kn to generate galloping that could cause unwanted vibration on that cable leading to noise and misinterpretation of fft results in that case it is recommended to use the frf testing method in order to obtain reliable results moreover if the measurement campaign is carried out during navigation also the ship s motion has to be considered as they can influence the measurements the numerical non linear finite element calculations have been used for validating the methodology herein proposed and highlighted that the first cable s natural mode with one semi wave is the main responsible of the pre tensioning of the cable itself this research is currently undergoing by applying this technique in fast sailing vessels such as racing ones where the pre tension is sensibly higher then in this tall ship in order to verify if the conclusions carried out for cruising sailing boats can be extended also to those with high tended rigs moreover the data collected by the experimental campaign are being used to set up a finite element model of the entire rig in order to structurally verify if it can withstand aerodynamical and seakeeping loads during long travels since no classification society rules exists for the

can be achieved by lowering the structural weight and by increasing the vessel s stability these two aspects can be accomplished by reducing the mast and rig scantling even lower than the classification societies requirements but they have to be demonstrated by proper finite element calculations rizzo and boote 2010 vergassola et al 2018a in this perspective the application of the correct pre tensioning loads on masts stays and shrouds is a key aspect for obtaining reliable results ocera et al 2017 bel hadj ali and smith 2010 but the onboard control of the correct value is also necessary while for small craft the pretension load can be easily evaluated for larger units over 20 m it cannot be directly evaluated by quick inspections for example by applying load cells on the cables or directly on the masts in fact the so called dock tuning load dtl can be applied by compressing the mast s foot using an hydraulic jack or by tensing each stay and shroud in the first case the overall load is distributed on the entire rig by the welding the spreaders and the connections between the mast and the cables but a differential pre tensile load on each stay cannot be applied in the second scenario the most common for large sailing yacht the load can be applied singularly on each cable with the effect of optimizing the entire structural response of the rig nevertheless the precise pre tensioning cannot be evaluated directly in this paper a novel approach for the determination of the pre tension load of stays and shrouds for large sailing vessels is presented for those units on which a direct estimation of that load on each cable cannot be achieved the herein presented approach is based on the evaluation of cables natural modes and frequencies by using experimental modal analysis ema tests coupled with the analytical solution of a taut cable the experimental campaign has been evaluated also by considering the possible interaction of winds effect on the stay during the trials so as to discard all the measured resonances due to winds that could be misinterpreted as natural frequencies non linear finite element calculation has been carried out on a model cable in order to validate the proposed method by means of a regression equation of the cables natural frequencies based on the initial pre tension of the cable 2 analytical solution of a taut cable a possible approach to the problem of identifying the dynamic loading of a taut cable has been proposed by lagomarsino and calderini 2003 and it is based on the assimilation of the cable to a particular uniform section euler bernoulli beam subject to axial tensile load and constrained at the extremities by fixities that allow the displacement along the cable axis see fig 1 the governing equation of the abovementioned dynamic system is described in eq 1 1 e j 4 y x t x 4 t 2 y x t x 2 ρ 2 y x t t 2 where e is the young s modulus of the material j is the moment of inertia ρ is the material linear density y is the vertical displacement as a function of the abscissa x and the time t t is the tensile load to be determined the variable separation technique is applied to eq 1 and it can be rewritten as 2 e j y i v x t y i i x ω 2 ρ e j y x 0 where y x is spatial solution associated to the circular frequency ω and the roman number in superscript indicates the order of the derivatives the general solution of the spatial equation is a linear combination of sinus cosinus and hyperbolic function as 3 y x c 1 sin α x c 2 cos α x c 3 sinh β x c 4 cosh β x where 4 α t 2 e j 1 4 ω 2 ρ e j t 2 1 β t 2 e j 1 4 ω 2 ρ e j t 2 1 and the integration constants c i can be deduced by applying the correct boundary condition the limitation of this approach for the study of the dynamic pre tension of stays is that the flexural rigidity of the cable is considered that is negligible in the reality in the real study case ej 0 and the axial initial displacement k 0 for this particular boundary condition set a closed type solution can be deduced from eq 2 for determining the initial tension 5 t 4 ρ f n 2 l 2 n 2 in eq 5 n is the natural frequency number with n 1 2 3 fn is the natural frequency of the n th mode expressed in hz ρ is the density of the cable in kg m3 and l the cable s length expressed in m nevertheless the solution proposed in eq 5 suffers the problem that it is independent on the value of t that in the real case can drastically change the shape of the cable from a straight one to a complete developed catenary shape in this perspective the solution proposed in eq 5 must be adapted to consider the modal shape and the static shape of the cable induced by the tensile load t starting from the study of lagomarsino and calderoni lagomarsino and calderini 2003 the research proposed by blevins 1979 can be used to consider the correct t depending on the abovementioned parameters in particular the parameter α must be introduced that reflects as the pre tensile load t influences the natural frequencies and the mode shapes 6 α 8 d l 2 e a t 0 l l e where d is the mean deflection of the cable that can be evaluated at mid length a is the cross section l e is the virtual length that can be considered equal to l as a first attempt t 0 is the mean dynamic tensile load the parameter α can influence the eigenmodes as follows α 2 0 the initial sagging is negligible and the cable can be considered as straight 0 α 2 4 π 2 the first symmetrical natural frequency in the catenary plane is lower than the corresponding asymmetrical one see fig 2 α 2 4 π 2 the symmetrical and asymmetrical natural frequencies are equal α 2 4 π 2 the first symmetrical natural frequency in the catenary plane is greater then the corresponding asymmetrical one different values approximated of t 0 and of natural frequency f n as a function of the α parameter are proposed in tables 1 10 and 11 where n is the natural s frequency order number λ i can be deduced by fig 3 for each natural frequency and t can be calculated by eq 5 the only incognita for the estimation of the tensile load t 0 is become the first natural frequency since the higher order ones are clearly less effective and it can be calculated by experimental modal analyses chen and ou 2011 3 study case the stay of an italian tall ships whose dimensions are reported in table 2 has been assumed as a studycase the stay used for the application of the presented methodology is the 2nd left stay of the foremast as reported in fig 4 for the abovementioned stay the pretensile loads is varied by acting on the turnbuckles in fig 5 4 experimental modal analysis on the selected stay the testing campaign is carried out during rina cs visits for the classification of the entire rig for safety reasons the experimental modal analysis ema on the stay marked in fig 4 is done by using three accelerometers located in the same position at 1 4 of the cable s span fig 6 the three accelerometers one triaxial and two monoaxial have been connected to two different analysers apollo soundbooks in order to calculate the fast fourier transform fft of the signal of the triaxial accelerometer on one side and the frequency response function frf by using the two monoaxial ones if only one analyser is used apart from a problem of analyser s number of channels the fft or the frf would is calculated only by complex post processing function that could have caused distortion on the final signal the extrapolation of the normal frequencies of the stays by the ema is carried out by hitting the cable with an instrumented hammer with soft tip generating an impulsive load as already proofed by the same authors in vergassola and boote 2019 vergassola et al 2018b and calculating the frequency response function in a point in which the displacement is not negligible in this case in order to acquire the response due to both the symmetrical and asymmetrical normal modes the accelerometers have been placed at ¼ of the cable s length in particular the triaxial accelerometer is installed with the x axis along the cable s length the y axis out of the catenary s plane and the z one in the catenary s plane the monoaxial ones is placed in and out of the catenary s plane respectively it is decided to acquire also the fft see fig 4 in order to make a more accurate evaluation of the vibrational behaviour of the stay and also because there aren t certainties that the vibrational return wave would is had no impact in the frf moreover the fft is independent on the impact load and so it can be carried out more easily during daily operation since requires only an accelerometer and the fft could be calculated even in a second moment as it can be seen from fig 7 below 1 hz the signal is dominated by the noise that could be generated by the wind by an electromagnetic field along the stay or by rigid body movement pendulum of the stay itself the first four natural frequencies calculated by the fft s peaks is reported in table 3 for the scope of this research only the first natural frequency are of some interest it is to be confirmed by looking at the frf calculated by the two monoaxial accelerometers fig 8 in fact as it will be shown in the next chapter the wind present during the test could generate unreal peaks in the fft that are filtered in the frf due to the registration of the impact hammer signal as it can be easily seen in the previous fig 8 also the frequency response function shows the same peak in corrispondance of 3 5 hz so it can be considered as the first real natural frequency of the stay since this natural frequency is mainly highlighted in the catenary s plane accelerometer s axis and for the cable under consideration α2 5 6 the formulation of the 4th row of table 1 is used and the pre tension load is calculated as t0 68157 n 6 8 tf 5 wind s effect on the ema tests the effect of wind on the vibration of structures can be split into four different phenomenon the vortex induced the galloping the fluttering and the buffeting di et al 2021 for the problem under consideration it can be easily assumed that a round cable cannot be affected by fluttering since it is caused by a loss of flexural rigidity of the structure that for a cable is zero as a definition matsumotoet al 1990 xu 2013 the same could be stated for the phenomenon of buffeting caused by the turbulent flow around the cable but the wind registered during the test was 9 kn and the reynolds number calculated for the stay is re 7534 so it was clearly in a non turbulent layer a deeper analysis must be carried out for vortex induced and galloping the first phenomenon fig 9 is caused by the generation of vortexes in the cable s wake that cause a fluctuation of pressure around the cross section and consequently a vibration form xu 2013 the frequency fst of stable vortex induced generation can be calculated as 7 f s t s t u d where s c is the strouhal number s t f l v that can be considered equal to 0 2 for cylindrical cables u is the undisturbed wind speed d is the diameter of the cable 20 mm in table 4 the fst hz is calculated for the wind speed present during the test 9 kn as it can be seen from table 4 the frequency of a stable release of vortex in the stay s wake is really higher than the one under consideration 0 10 hz so it can be deduced that also the vortex induced phenomenon is not able to perturbate the modal tests the phenomenon of galloping is due to the fluctuation of the lift force around the cable that could generate high amplitude motions it can be stated that galloping happens if 8 c d c l 0 where c d is the drag coefficient and c l is the first derivative of the lift coefficient when the analytical description of c l and c d is not available as in this case a critical undisturbed wind velocity upon which the galloping is effective can be calculated as 9 u c r i t c f n d s c where s c m ζ ρ d 2 is the scrutal number m is the total mass ζ is the structural damping of the cable ρ is the density and d the diameter of the cable f n is the frequency under consideration and c a parameter that reflects how much the flow is disturbed by the presence of the stay and it can vary between 25 and 60 but it can be assumed equal to 30 for undisturbed cable is tin this case since the wind was at beam in table 5 considering a typical structural damping of 0 001 boote et al 2017 the critical velocity of galloping is calculated as a function of the parameter c as it can be seen the galloping critical velocity is clearly in the range of wind speed under consideration and so it can be stated that if only an fft test is be carried out the natural frequencies would are misinterpreted due to the wind vibration phenomenon the effect of ship s motion during the trial has been considered negligible since the vessel was safely moored in basin 6 numerical solution to the pretensioning problem external influences may have affected the correctness of the measured natural frequencies reported in table 3 in order to validate the results obtained through the experimental method finite element calculation is performed the numerical model is modelled using patran as a pre post processor and nastran as a solver the cable examined has a length of 26 44 m and is made of steel strands the characteristics are reported in table 6 the cables of the structures are slender yang and tsay 2007 therefore they are schematized as one dimensional elements the local phenomena occurring in the section are negligible this allows to study the overall behaviour of the cable which is an intrinsically labile structure as it has zero flexural stiffness infinite axial stiffness and supports only stresses and non compressions the numerical model is created by rod elements with only 2 translational degrees of freedom at the nodes at the end as shown in fig 10 the shroud is blocked at its ends to simulate the interlocking in correspondence of the bridge deck and fastening the foremast for these reasons a local reference system at the end point with x axis coinciding with the curvilinear coordinate is created furthermore the weight force acting on the cable is added but this structure is not able to support a load outside its own plane so an initial elongation is introduced which is made to vary from 5 mm up to 5 cm as typically occurs in slender structures external forces and displacements are not in linear relationship therefore a non linear static analysis is performed in non linear analysis the stiffness of the structure is dependent on both the displacements and the acting forces and varies during the analysis for this reason large deformations are allowed in the analysis settings the numerical methodology used to solve the non linear problem is the incremental one i e the total external load is applied in ten different steps and for each of them the stiffness matrix of the system is updated until the total load is applied and the final convergence is reached after the last step of load application the modal analysis of the structure is performed to obtain its own frequencies only as an example the natural frequencies of the cable obtained with pre tension of 1 cm are reported in table 7 and mode shape with a half wave is shown in fig 11 imposing an initial elongation of 1 cm means assuming that the pre tensioning of the shroud is 6287 n this result is obtained after obtaining the elongation and tension inside the cable with the formulas illustrated below 10 ε i n i t i a l e l o n g a t i o n l 11 σ p a ε e 12 t n σ a therefore collecting the values relative to the natural frequency of each initial elongation for one half wave and two half wave mode shape a regression curve representing the relationship between the pretension t n and the natural frequency f n hz is reported in table 8 the graph in fig 12 shows that the relationship between the natural frequency and the pre tensioning of the cable is linear the coefficient of determination is close to 1 and therefore the line identified accurately approximates the data in possession with dotted line the regression curves are also plotted tables 9 and 11 compares the results obtained through the experimental numerical and the analytical method for the half wave mode shape of the cable in two different condition the first is when the cable is in the reference condition position in which the cable is found at the time of the test the second condition is a different pretension two turns of the turnbuckle are given which correspond to a variation of the reference elongation of the cable equal to 12 mm the comparison is only between the frequencies between 3 hz and 6 hz because the cable at the initial moment of the analysis could not be perfectly still this phenomenon would give rise to a pendulum motion that could be found at low frequencies in the same way frequencies above 6 hz are not considered since these may already be in correspondence with the return wave in addition they correspond to higher mode shape that need more energy to be excited properly the first column shows the frequencies that have been detected through the on board tests described in table 3 the second column includes the pretension values calculated in correspondence with the frequencies measured on board using the equation of the regression curve identified through the relationship described in fig 12 the third column collects the values reported in table 1 the fourth column represents the relationship between the numerical and analytical results and it is possible to note how the pretensioning t calculated through the two methodologies are practically coincident for fn 3 51 hz in this condition an initial elongation of 5 cm is imposed on the cable as can be verified by calculating the δl fem and δl analytic reported in the fifth and sixth columns respectively even the natural frequency of 5 27 hz to be a natural frequency of the structure since the tensioning obtained by the numerical result is 80 of that obtained analytically finally the initial elongations are in both cases numerical and analytical of about 10 cm the same comparison between the results obtained through the experimental numerical and analytical method is carried out for the mode shape with two half waves of the cable is shown in table 10 from the comparison of analytical and numerical results in table 7 it is clear that the analytical method overestimates the pretensioning approximately 4 fold compared to that numeric model for this reason the results obtained considering the two half wave mode cannot be considered reliable in the same way the comparison of the ema numerical and analytical results obtained with the initial elongation of 12 mm are shown in table 10 in this case the correct natural frequency is 3 12 hz in fact by calculating the δt n this has a negative value this means that by giving two turns of the cable turnbuckle is made more slack so also the frequencies will drop see table 11 in conclusion the initial tensioning results obtained with the experimental analytical and numerical methodology converge so the test methodology used to calculate the pre tensioning of the shrouds can be considered reliable however it is important to note how the effect of the wind can dirty the true measurements in particular if it is not possible to carry out frf tests and therefore the fourier transform of the accelerometer signal is available for example for pleasure craft a wind of 7 kn is a condition that can be easily found already on the quay can influence the test methodology the presence of the galloping phenomenon is highly probable it is necessary to counter validate the results obtained with a finite element calculation if the presence of phenomena of galloping or vortex shedding are detected instead flutter is a torsional phenomenon and therefore not applicable to cables 7 conclusions in this paper a novel approach for the determination of the pre tension load of stays and shrouds has been presented based on the coupling of experimental modal analysis tests and an analytical solution of cables this approach has been developed especially for large sailing yachts i e when it is not possible to verify onboard which is the preload of each stays and so to help designers to choose the correct dock tuning load for numerical analysis of rigs it has been proved that it is sufficient the fast fourier transform of the signal of one accelerometer located on a stay and hit with an impulsive load to calculate the natural frequency of the cable and then it is possible by the analytical formulas of table 1 to derive the correct pre tension of the cable itself it has also be highlighted that in case of only fft tests are conduced it must be verified the effect of wind induced vibration since the phenomenon of galloping could be present even in low wind speed condition in fact it is sufficient a wind velocity of 6 7 kn to generate galloping that could cause unwanted vibration on that cable leading to noise and misinterpretation of fft results in that case it is recommended to use the frf testing method in order to obtain reliable results moreover if the measurement campaign is carried out during navigation also the ship s motion has to be considered as they can influence the measurements the numerical non linear finite element calculations have been used for validating the methodology herein proposed and highlighted that the first cable s natural mode with one semi wave is the main responsible of the pre tensioning of the cable itself this research is currently undergoing by applying this technique in fast sailing vessels such as racing ones where the pre tension is sensibly higher then in this tall ship in order to verify if the conclusions carried out for cruising sailing boats can be extended also to those with high tended rigs moreover the data collected by the experimental campaign are being used to set up a finite element model of the entire rig in order to structurally verify if it can withstand aerodynamical and seakeeping loads during long travels since no classification society rules exists for the

20273,environmental contours are useful for designing and assessing risk to offshore structures the inverse first order reliability method iform and the rosenblatt transformation are widely used to calculate environmental contours but have several challenges in this approach the conditional distribution is often expressed in a parametric form with parameters defined as functions of the independent variable the distribution should be accurate for both extreme and frequently occurring values for both the dependent and independent variables and this is a challenging requirement for complex datasets a new iform rosenblatt framework is proposed here to overcome this challenge the framework includes a method to approximate a distribution with a complex form including parametric empirical and mixed parametric empirical forms using a reduced set of parameters that are designed to prioritize accuracy for the quantiles of the distribution that contribute to the contour and a set of metrics to evaluate the goodness of fit of the resulting contour a hindcast dataset is used as an example to calculate the 50 year contour using the proposed framework and a traditional approach the proposed framework is demonstrated to generate accurate contours although it requires more parameters and is more complex than conventional approaches keywords environmental contour iform joint probability metocean extremes 1 introduction environmental contours are used in many design standards for offshore structures c 61400 3 wind turbin 2009 v and recommended practic 2017 i 19901 1 and petroleum an 2015 each point on the contour represents a combination of environmental variables with the same exceedance probability where the exceedance probability of the joint variables can be defined in multiple ways and the iform based definition winterstein et al 1993 is used commonly in practice and usually expressed in terms of a mean return period for example an environmental contour of wind and wave with a 50 year mean return period is used in iec 61400 3 c 61400 3 wind turbin 2009 for the design of offshore wind turbines the 50 year values of wind and wave can be calculated independently following well known practice palutikof et al 1999 muir and elshaarawi 1986 however these two values do not include the effects of correlation between wind and wave a potentially important factor in assessing the risk of failure of offshore structures in contrast the 50 year environmental contour of wind and wave explicitly accounts for the correlation providing a more comprehensive definition of extreme conditions this aspect is particularly important for designing offshore wind turbines which may have design conditions controlled by 1 low or modest wind speeds when the rotor is spinning and blades are pitched for power production combined with extreme waves conditioned on low or modest wind or 2 extreme wind speeds when the rotor is parked and blades are feathered to reduce loads combined with extreme waves conditioned on extreme wind according to iec 61400 3 both situations can be considered through combinations of environmental variables determined by a 50 year environmental contour of wind and wave the first situation which corresponds to design load case 1 6 in iec 61400 3 involves the segment of the 50 year contour that combines low or modest wind speeds with extreme waves conditioned on low or modest wind speeds the second situation which corresponds to design load case 6 1 in iec 61400 3 involves the segment of the contour that combines extreme wind speeds with extreme waves the inverse first order reliability method iform winterstein et al 1993 is a widely used approach for calculating environmental contours based on the joint probability distribution of the environmental variables and the rosenblatt transformation rosenblatt 1952 is a common approach to establish the transformation between the variable space and the standard normal space within which the environmental contour is calculated based on common exceedance probability many approaches have been developed to calculate environmental contours for example the inverse directional simulation approach dimitrov 2020 replaces the linear limit state approximation in the standard normal space with a hypersphere to provide a more conservative contour estimation the highest probability density method haselsteiner et al 2017 provides a clearer interpretation of the resulting contour for multimodal probability distributions the direct iform approach derbanne and de hauteclocque 2019 does not require the construction of joint distributions but instead constructs the contour directly in the variable space through the fitting of univariate distributions in multiple directions in another approach mackay and jonathan 2020 environmental contours are constructed by first estimating the joint distribution of the storm peaks and then recovering the joint distribution of the time series through resampling and rescaling and a direct sampling approach is presented in vanem 2017 to construct the contour in the variable space directly through monte carlo simulations since the period of available measurements for contour estimation is usually shorter than the target return period the implementation of the iform rosenblatt approach requires distribution fitting and extrapolation of both the marginal and conditional probabilities many studies aim to improve accuracy by finding the optimal form of the distribution function for specific environmental variables e g johannessen et al 2001 jonathan et al 2014 li et al 2013 these forms however are usually context specific and are often inaccurate when applied to other contexts i e different sites and different environmental variables in this paper an iform rosenblatt framework that is more flexible is proposed the framework is designed to calculate accurate contours when the marginal and conditional probabilities of the dataset are represented with complex forms including parametric empirical and mixed parametric empirical forms the framework also includes a set of metrics to evaluate the accuracy of the resulting contour this paper is organized as follows first background information on iform and the rosenblatt transformation is provided in section 2 then in section 3 the proposed framework is introduced in detail followed by a numerical example in section 4 using a hindcast dataset haselsteiner et al 2019 finally the conclusions of this study are provided in section 5 2 background assessment of the ultimate demands on structures is an important part of structural design to ensure appropriate safety during extreme environmental conditions modern structural designs are usually performed for environmental conditions with a target mean return period mrp for a univariate random variable x the mrp n in years is expressed as n 1 v 1 f x where f x is the cumulative distribution function cdf of x and v is the annual occurrence rate the value of x corresponding to an n year return period is then 1 x n f 1 1 1 v n where f 1 is the inverse cdf function see fig 1 a for a multivariate random variable x x 1 x 2 x n x n is a series of n variables that form the n year contour with each combination of x 1 x 2 x n representing conditions with the same mrp various approaches have been developed to calculate such a contour winterstein et al 1993 haselsteiner et al 2017 chai and leira 2018 huseby et al 2017 among which iform is widely used in the wind and ocean engineering fields iform is based on a similar idea as the first order reliability method form which assumes a linear failure boundary after transforming the distribution of x into a standard joint normal distribution u g x u 1 u 2 u n the isotropy of u allows eq 1 be extended to the multivariate condition as 2 u n 2 β φ 1 1 1 v n where β is the l2 norm of the vector u n and is often referred to as the reliability index in risk analysis and where φ 1 is the inverse cdf of a standard joint normal distribution see fig 1 b for a bivariate condition as an example the n year contour u n is a hyper sphere in u with a radius equal to β and the corresponding contour for x can be calculated as x n g 1 u n one of the challenges of implementing iform is to establish the transformation g between measurements x and a standard joint normal distribution u for a univariate condition the transformation is obtained through u g x φ 1 f x x which maps one value of x to one value of u such that they have the same cumulative probability for a multivariate condition several approaches are available including the rosenblatt transformation rosenblatt 1952 and the nataf transformation nataf 1962 the rosenblatt transformation is adopted in several design standards for offshore engineering and for a bivariate joint distribution it converts the random variable x from its variable space into the standard normal space following 3 u 1 φ 1 f x 1 x 1 u 2 φ 1 f x 2 x 1 x 2 where x 1 is the independent variable and x 2 is the dependent variable note that the expression of f x 2 x 1 varies as a function of x 1 which can be achieved by expressing f x 2 x 1 as a parametric distribution f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ with parameters defined in θ and expressing θ as a function of x 1 the inverse of this transformation is 4 x 1 f x 1 1 φ u 1 x 2 f x 2 x 1 1 φ u 2 as such an n year contour is calculated with the following steps 1 calculate β using eq 2 which defines the radius of the u contour 2 select a value of x 1 and calculate u 1 using eq 3 3 calculate u 2 as β 2 u 1 2 with u 1 limited to the range of β β and thus with x 1 limited to the range of f x 1 1 1 v n f x 1 1 1 1 v n 4 calculate x 2 using eq 4 to determine the lower and upper values of the contour at x 1 as f x 2 x 1 1 φ β 2 u 1 2 5 repeat steps 2 4 for x 1 between f x 1 1 1 v n and f x 1 1 1 1 v n to form the complete contour several characteristics of the relationship between x and u are worth noting and are illustrated in fig 2 first the right tip of the x contour i e the largest value of the independent variable on the contour matches the right tip of the u contour the red stars in fig 2 the corresponding value of x 1 is f x 1 1 1 1 v n which is equal to the n year value of x 1 calculated in a univariate sense i e applying eq 1 to the marginal distribution f x 1 and is denoted herein as x 1 n the corresponding value of x 2 is the median value of its distribution conditioned on x 1 x 1 n because f x 2 x 1 n x 2 φ u 2 0 0 5 second the top tip of the x contour i e the largest value of the dependent variable on the contour does not correspond to the top tip of the u contour because x 2 is modeled as a variable conditioned on x 1 by the rosenblatt transformation the top tip of the u contour the blue star in fig 2 b represents the median of u 1 which corresponds to the median of x 1 the blue star in fig 2 a while the top tip of the x contour the green star in fig 2 a lies somewhere in the upper right quadrant of the u contour the green star in fig 2 b lastly the rosenblatt transformation even without estimation error of the underlying distributions results in an environmental contour that depends on the order of the variable transformation mackay and haselsteiner 2021 this means that when using the rosenblatt transformation to construct an environmental contour the tip of the environmental contour corresponding to the dependent variable x 2 only approximates the n year value of the marginal distribution of x 2 but does not match exactly as such three important characteristics of an accurate environmental contour i e an x contour are x 1 n the n year value of x 1 is the value of x 1 at the right tip of the x contour x 2 n the n year value of x 2 approximates the value of x 2 at the top tip of the x contour the median of x 2 conditioned on x 1 x 1 n is the value of x 2 at the right tip of the x contour note that similar characteristics can also be deduced for the lower left quadrant of the contour but this quadrant is usually less important from an engineering perspective and is not emphasized in this paper 3 a new iform rosenblatt framework using reparameterization in the traditional approach for constructing a long term environmental contour a single parametric distribution is selected for f x 2 x 1 and the parameters are defined as functions of the independent variable for this approach to generate an accurate environmental contour the conditional distribution must represent the data accurately for quantiles of the dependent variable that span from the left tail to the right tail conditioned on values of the independent variable that span from the left tail to the right tail for many datasets this requirement leads to inaccurate contours when the conditional distribution is restricted to the conventional set of parametric distributions this issue can be overcome by using more complex forms for the distributions potentially parametric empirical or even mixed parametric empirical forms haver 1985 naess et al 2013 however the accuracy of such distributions comes at the cost of needing many parameters to define them i e the dimension of the set of parameters θ becomes large and this becomes problematic and sometimes intractable when these parameters must all be defined as functions of the independent variable a new iform rosenblatt framework is proposed to overcome these issues the main idea is to reduce the complex form of a conditional distribution to a simpler form that is represented by a smaller set of parameters θ this simplification is called reparameterization and the key to this approach is that it is designed to prioritize accuracy specifically for the range of quantiles of the conditional distribution that contribute to the contour after reparameterization θ is defined as a function of the independent variable x 1 and the complex conditional distribution is approximated with a simpler parametric form as f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ in order to better illustrate the challenges of the traditional approach the 50 year environmental contour see fig 3 of mean wind speed v and significant wave height h s for an offshore site near virginia usa is taken as an example here this example is based on data provided at a 1 h interval from a 37 year hindcast study qiao et al 2019 the wind speed v is taken as the independent variable and h s is taken as the dependent variable following the implementation suggested in the iec 61400 3 a weibull distribution is used to estimate f v see fig 4 a and lognormal distributions are fit to the significant wave heights conditioned on a discrete set of wind speeds see fig 4 b and c for two examples the parameters σ and μ of the lognormal distributions are then fit as functions of v using the expression of a v b c see fig 5 a method that allows f h s v to be estimated at high wind speeds where few measurements are available the distribution model has a significant impact on the accuracy of the resulting environmental contour and other models such as the 3 parameter weibull distribution have been suggested for more accurate modeling of the distribution of h s compared to the lognormal distribution vanem 2016 09 the weibull and lognormal distributions are chosen for the example here as these distributions are mentioned specifically for this purpose as an example in the standard iec 61400 3 the weibull and lognormal distributions do not and are not intended to represent the best performance of the traditional iform rosenblatt approach but they do demonstrate the general challenge that an iform contour of h s and v that is accurate over its full span needs to be constructed from distributions that are accurate for both frequently occurring and tail values of h s v over a wide range of v other factors also influence the accuracy of the resulting contour such as the method to estimate the distribution parameters and the form of the function used to fit the parameters of the conditional distribution in terms of the independent variable for the weibull lognormal approach presented in this paper maximum likelihood estimation is used to estimate the distribution parameters for both marginal and conditional distributions this approach is typically accurate for the frequently occurring values but not for the tail values other approaches have been developed e g guedes soares and henriques 1996 vanem 2015 haselsteiner and thoben 2020 that are more accurate for tail values the 50 year contour is calculated following the steps introduced in section 2 and is plotted as the black curve in fig 3 some challenges exhibited through this example are summarized here 1 a wide range of values of v from 0 to over 25 m s is involved in the calculation of the contour the cumulative probability of the marginal distribution f v thus needs to be accurate for both frequently occurring values with a relatively high probability of occurrence and for extreme values with a relatively low probability of occurrence assuming a weibull distribution for the hourly measurements of v is usually accurate for the frequently occurring values but is often not accurate for the extreme values fig 4 a shows the distribution fitting result in terms of lg 1 f v to emphasize the discrepancy of the fit for the extreme values the figure shows that the weibull distribution only matches the empirical estimates of the hourly measurements up to 20 m s f v 0 998 and that for wind speeds greater than 20 m s the weibull distribution underestimates lg 1 f v i e the cumulative probability is overestimated leading to an underestimation of v 50 i e the right tip of the resulting contour 2 the upper part of the contour i e the upper value of the contour for a given value of v corresponds to values from the median to the upper tail of f h s v depending on the value of v however the fitting of the lognormal distribution is heavily influenced by the frequently occurring values and is often inaccurate in the upper tail for example the contour in fig 4 b indicates that the 50 year h s conditioned on v 5 m s is 4 m while the underlying data suggests the value of h s is 5 m at higher wind speeds the lognormal distribution indicates a 50 year h s conditioned on v 20 m s of 7 m while the underlying data in fig 4 c suggests the value is closer to 5 m in addition the parameters of the lognormal distribution are fit as functions of the wind speed see fig 5 where the fitting error of each parameter influences the resulting contour fig 6 presents an overview of the proposed framework which is organized into three primary parts univariate fitting reparameterization and evaluation each of which is described in more detail in the following subsections for the univariate fitting part the framework involves fitting of 1 the marginal distributions of x 1 and x 2 2 the conditional distribution f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ evaluated at a set of discrete samples x 1 s x 1 1 x 1 2 x 1 m for which sufficient measurements of x 2 x 1 are available and 3 a function representing the relationship between the medians of the conditional distributions f x 2 x 1 s 1 0 5 and x 1 for the reparameterization part the distribution f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ is approximated by two parametric distributions f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ upper and f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ lower for the upper and lower tails respectively and the parameters within θ upper and θ lower are then fit as functions of x 1 to separately define the upper and lower parts of the contour for the evaluation part the accuracy of this approach is assessed with several metrics including the value of x 2 corresponding to the top tip of the x contour the right tip of the x contour x 1 n f x 2 x 1 n 1 0 5 and discrete estimates of the x 2 values of the contour at x 1 x 1 s this paper discusses two dimensional contours however in theory this framework can be expanded to contours with more than two dimensions but in practice the same challenges exist as for the traditional iform rosenblatt approach such as data sparsity when estimating f x i 1 x 1 x i x i 1 for distributions conditioned on more than one variable 3 1 univariate fitting the framework proposed here involves the estimation of three univariate distributions f x 1 f x 2 and f x 2 x 1 s and the fitting of the median of x 2 as a function of x 1 a wide range of values of x 1 is required in contour construction so f x 1 needs to be accurate for both frequently occurring and extreme values the authors have developed a hybrid approach for generating distributions that are accurate for both frequently occurring and extreme values of a random variable the approach is used in the numerical example in section 4 and is briefly described here with a more thorough description provided in another manuscript qiao and myers the approach first determines separate distributions for the frequently occurring and extreme values of the random variables and then combines the distributions to obtain a single continuous distribution based on a concept called the normalized exceedance ratio ner the distribution for the frequently occurring values can be either a parametric distribution with its parameters obtained using the maximum likelihood estimation or a non parametric distribution with cdf values determined empirically the distribution for the extreme values is obtained by first applying extreme value theory and then calculating a coefficient to adjust the generalized extreme value gev distribution to account for temporal correlation as a function of the cdf value of the gev distribution the coefficient is obtained by evaluating the ratio of the empirical exceedance probabilities of the raw time series data and the corresponding block maxima as such for time series data where the tail is mostly composed of the block maxima the exceedance probability is similar to the gev distribution while for time series data where the tail is composed significantly of data adjacent to block maxima and therefore exhibits temporal correlation the exceedance probability deviates from the gev distribution the resulting distribution of extreme values is described by six parameters three for the generalized extreme value distribution and three to define the coefficients that adjust the distribution for temporal correlation note that any univariate distribution can be used in this framework as long as the accuracy for the quantiles involved in contour construction is acceptable 3 2 reparameterization of f x 2 x 1 univariate fitting of f x 2 x 1 s x 2 θ using the ner approach presented in section 3 1 is one approach to generate an accurate probability distribution in the ner approach f x 2 x 1 s x 2 θ is expressed using six distribution parameters i e θ θ 1 θ 6 each of which needs to be fit as a function of x 1 the general form θ i a i x 1 b i c i is used in this paper this is a challenging task because 1 not all parameters show a clear trend for the functional form of θ f x 1 and 2 some parameters have a larger influence on the accuracy of the resulting contours than other parameters note these issues are challenging for any parametric distribution not just the ner approach a reparameterization method is introduced here to resolve this challenge this method approximates f x 2 x 1 using a parametric distribution f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ with fewer parameters θ for example if a two parameter weibull distribution is used to approximate f x 2 x 1 the dimension of θ reduces to two and thus only these two parameters need to be fit as functions of x 1 rather than six this method can be used even when f x 2 x 1 is expressed in a non parametric form e g using an empirical cdf which is a case that cannot be handled by the traditional iform rosenblatt approach the reparameterization method should ensure that f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ has similar values of cumulative probability as f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ for the range of quantiles that contribute to the construction of an environmental contour for a target mrp of n years and a particular value of x 1 only two quantiles of f x 2 x 1 are needed to calculate the value of the contour for any particular value of x 1 for example for the median of x 1 the two quantiles are f x 2 x 1 1 v n for the bottom of the contour and f x 2 x 1 1 1 v n for the top of the contour as another example for the n year value of x 1 the two quantiles converge to the value of 0 5 since the lower and upper tails of f x 2 x 1 are reparameterized as f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ lower and f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ upper in the proposed framework these functions only need to be accurate in terms of cumulative probability at a single quantile for a particular value of x 1 however a range of quantiles rather than a single quantile is used for the reparameterization fitting process which makes the estimate of θ available when its dimension is higher than one a simple approach is proposed here to select the range the u contour is stretched vertically into two ellipses see the two red dashed curves in fig 7 a so that for a given value of u 1 a range of u 2 is obtained indicated as the green and blue dots in fig 7 a and thus a range of cdf is determined for x 2 as f x 2 x 1 x 2 and f x 2 x 1 x 2 see the corresponding green and blue dots in fig 7 b as such the intent of this approach is to estimate the parameters θ of a parametric distribution such that a loss function l θ representing the error when using f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ to approximate f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ is minimized for x 2 between x 2 and x 2 since f x 2 x 1 is close to 1 for most points on the upper contour minimizing the difference between f x 2 x 1 and f x 2 x 1 can be challenging for some optimization algorithms and a logarithmic transformation on f x 2 x 1 is helpful for a faster convergence when estimating θ the mean squared logarithmic error of the inverse of exceedance probability is used in this paper and is expressed as 5 l θ 1 n i 1 n ln 1 1 f x 2 x 1 x 2 i θ ln 1 1 f x 2 x 1 x 2 i θ 2 where x 2 i is a discrete set of x 2 between x 2 and x 2 the transformation 1 1 f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ is in a similar form as the mrp calculation and often approximates as a straight line in a logarithmic scale for large mrp values 3 3 contour estimation and evaluation using the reparameterization method introduced in section 3 2 the lower and upper tails of f x 2 x 1 are approximated by a parametric distribution defined by parameters θ lower and θ upper note that f x 2 x 1 θ lower and θ upper are estimated for a discrete set x 1 s and θ lower and θ upper are then fit as functions of x 1 which makes the estimation of f x 2 x 1 available for the entire range of x 1 involved in contour construction since the upper part of the contour is estimated using θ upper and the lower part is estimated using θ lower continuity between the upper and lower parts is not guaranteed at the left connection point x 1 l f x 1 1 1 v n and the right connection point x 1 r f x 1 1 1 1 v n various parametric distributions can be used for the estimation of θ lower and θ upper and the resulting contour can be evaluated using the metrics listed in fig 6 note that the x 1 component of the contour always ends at x 1 n because of the nature of the rosenblatt transformation even though the value of x 2 corresponding to the top tip of the resulting contour does not match x 2 n exactly see section 2 the difference is usually small and thus x 2 n is still a useful evaluation metric the contour should also match the discrete empirical estimates of x 2 at x 1 s in this paper the absolute error is used to quantify the former metric the root mean square error is used for the latter metric and the average of these two metrics is used to represent the overall accuracy of the reparameterized distribution for the upper and lower parts of the contour respectively 4 numerical example the proposed iform rosenblatt framework is applied in this section to the environmental contour benchmarking exercise described in haselsteiner et al 2019 three 24 h datasets corresponding to three offshore sites in the north sea are considered and provide hourly measurements of mean wind speed v averaged over a 10 min window and significant wave height h s corresponding to datasets d e and f in the benchmarking exercise groll and weisse 2016 a more comprehensive comparison for all six datasets is provided in haselsteineraet al 2021 the ner method is used for the univariate fitting of f v f h s and f h s v the fitting of f h s v is presented here for two wind speeds 5 m s and 20 m s where a window of 2 m s is used to extract the data of conditional wave heights i e using wave heights corresponding to wind speeds between 4 m s and 6 m s for the estimation of f h s v 5 m s the results are compared to an approach where the data is modeled with a 2 parameter weibull distribution for wind speeds and a lognormal distribution for significant wave height and the parameters are fit using maximum likelihood estimation the results are shown in figs 8 11 in terms of exceedance probability 1 f x where the results using the ner method are shown as blue curves and the results using the weibull lognormal approach are shown as red curves since the difference between the ner and weibull lognormal methods is mainly for the extreme values where the exceedance probability is close to 0 the results of exceedance probability are shown in logarithmic form the exceedance probabilities calculated from measurements using the empirical cumulative probability are used here as a reference the grey dots in figs 8 11 for the marginal wind speed distribution fig 8 the weibull distribution fits datasets d and e well for dataset f however the weibull distribution overestimates the wind speed above 20 m s 99th percentile and this error influences the calculation of the contour in particular v n is overestimated and thus h s values corresponding to values of v close to v n are also overestimated for the marginal distribution of significant wave height fig 9 the lognormal distribution starts to deviate from the empirical estimation at the 95th percentile for all datasets for the wave height distributions conditioned on v 5 m s the behavior of datasets d and f follows a lognormal distribution but dataset e does not and for the wave height distributions conditioned on v 20 m s the behavior of all three datasets roughly but not precisely follows the lognormal distribution it is apparent that the assumption of an environmental variable following a certain parametric distribution does not always hold and this is especially impactful when the distribution fitting is mainly determined by the frequently occurring values with high probabilities of occurrence and when the tails with low probabilities of occurrence are most important for constructing the environmental contour the ner method see the blue curves in figs 8 11 matches the data more accurately in these cases however it requires four more parameters compared to the weibull and lognormal distributions dataset e is used as an example of the method proposed in this paper to construct a 50 year contour fig 12 shows the evaluation metrics which will be used to evaluate the contour the blue dashed line indicates the independent 50 year wind speed which is obtained by applying eq 1 to f v and the blue dotted line indicates the independent 50 year significant wave height which is obtained by applying eq 1 to f h s the blue dash dotted line indicates the median of h s as a function of v which is obtained by fitting the estimates of the median of h s v evaluated at a discrete set of v using the form a v b c and lastly the blue dots indicate the rough contour positions which are obtained by applying eqs 2 and 4 to f h s v the rough contour positions are jagged because they are estimated independently based on empirical data and they cover only a portion of the contour due to the availability of the measurements for locations on the contour where sufficient measurements are available the ultimate contour should follow the rough contour with its top tip positioned close to the blue dotted line and its right tip coinciding with the intersection of the dashed line and the dash dotted curve following in weibull lognormal approach where a lognormal distribution is fit to f h s v estimated at various values of v using maximum likelihood estimation the parameters of the lognormal distribution are shown in fig 13 a as a function of v the lognormal distribution is expressed using parameters μ and σ as 6 f x 1 x σ 2 π exp ln x ln μ 2 2 σ 2 for the implementation presented in this paper the parameters of f h s v are assumed to follow θ a v b c which fits the data accurately for the lognormal distribution in fig 13 a however the resulting contour shown as the red dashed curve in fig 14 overestimates the 50 year h s for wind speeds below 20 m s for a wind speed of 15 m s the overestimation is about 25 this error arises because the actual conditional wave height does not follow the lognormal distribution well for that range of wind speed as revealed in fig 10 b using the proposed framework various parametric distributions are tested for reparameterizing the upper tail of f h s v and the logistic distribution shows the best result which is defined in terms of parameters μ and s as 7 f x exp x μ s s 1 exp x μ s 2 the two parameters of the logistic distribution are shown in fig 13 b as a function of the wind speed which exhibits more variability compared to the lognormal distribution however since the logistic distribution captures the tail behavior of f h s v better the resulting contour shown as the red solid curve in fig 14 matches the metrics better the independent 50 year wave height is slightly overestimated by the red contour as the value derived from the marginal h s distribution indicated by the blue dotted line is lower than the value estimated at f h s v 21 m s and the resulting contour the contour derived from the lognormal distribution is used as the estimation of the lower part of the resulting contour since it aligns with the empirical estimates a spike appears on the left part of the contour using the lognormal distribution as shown in fig 14 which does not match the trend in the raw data this is due to errors at several stages of the calculation first the lognormal fit for the raw data of h s v 1 m s yields σ r a w 0 60 and μ r a w 0 66 i e the blue triangle and orange circle at v 1 m s in fig 13 a which results in a 50 year conditional h s equal to 6 9 m then after fitting σ r a w and μ r a w as a function of wind speed the parameters of f h s v at v 1 m s are σ f i t 0 68 and μ f i t 0 54 i e the blue and orange curves in fig 13 a which results in a 50 year conditional h s equal to 7 8 m to better visualize the result of the proposed framework the probability density of the joint distribution is plotted in fig 15 where the density of f h s v above the median of h s v follows a logistic distribution and the density below follows a lognormal distribution fig 15 also indicates the discontinuity of probability density that arises when using two distributions to describe the upper and lower parts of the environmental contour there are many factors that influence the accuracy of the traditional approach including the selection of the distribution type the method to estimate distribution parameters and the form of θ f x 1 that is used to define the conditional distribution the intent of this numerical example is not to compare the accuracy of the traditional approach with the proposed framework the intent is to use a specific implementation of both approaches to compare their features 5 conclusions there are several difficulties in constructing environmental contours using the traditional iform rosenblatt framework first accurate estimates of the probability of both the frequently occurring and extreme values of the independent variable are required while a parametric distribution estimated using methods such as the maximum likelihood estimation is often only accurate for frequently occurring values second a parametric distribution is required to provide accurate estimates of probabilities of the dependent variable conditioned on a wide range of the independent variable and in practical situations it is possible that none of the existing parametric distributions are accurate under these conditions and lastly the parameters of the conditional distribution must be fit as a function of the independent variable which becomes challenging and even intractable when the conditional distribution is complex and needs to be expressed using a large number of parameters a new framework is proposed in this paper to overcome these challenges the first challenge is resolved by the normalized exceedance ratio method and the other two challenges are resolved by the distribution reparameterization method which allows the conditional distribution expressed in either a parametric or non parametric form to be approximated by another parametric distribution that yields similar cumulative probabilities for the quantiles that contribute to the construction of the contour in addition a set of metrics are proposed for contour evaluation so that the goodness of fit can be clearly determined the method is implemented for an example dataset and the resulting contour is reasonably accurate according to the proposed evaluation

20273,environmental contours are useful for designing and assessing risk to offshore structures the inverse first order reliability method iform and the rosenblatt transformation are widely used to calculate environmental contours but have several challenges in this approach the conditional distribution is often expressed in a parametric form with parameters defined as functions of the independent variable the distribution should be accurate for both extreme and frequently occurring values for both the dependent and independent variables and this is a challenging requirement for complex datasets a new iform rosenblatt framework is proposed here to overcome this challenge the framework includes a method to approximate a distribution with a complex form including parametric empirical and mixed parametric empirical forms using a reduced set of parameters that are designed to prioritize accuracy for the quantiles of the distribution that contribute to the contour and a set of metrics to evaluate the goodness of fit of the resulting contour a hindcast dataset is used as an example to calculate the 50 year contour using the proposed framework and a traditional approach the proposed framework is demonstrated to generate accurate contours although it requires more parameters and is more complex than conventional approaches keywords environmental contour iform joint probability metocean extremes 1 introduction environmental contours are used in many design standards for offshore structures c 61400 3 wind turbin 2009 v and recommended practic 2017 i 19901 1 and petroleum an 2015 each point on the contour represents a combination of environmental variables with the same exceedance probability where the exceedance probability of the joint variables can be defined in multiple ways and the iform based definition winterstein et al 1993 is used commonly in practice and usually expressed in terms of a mean return period for example an environmental contour of wind and wave with a 50 year mean return period is used in iec 61400 3 c 61400 3 wind turbin 2009 for the design of offshore wind turbines the 50 year values of wind and wave can be calculated independently following well known practice palutikof et al 1999 muir and elshaarawi 1986 however these two values do not include the effects of correlation between wind and wave a potentially important factor in assessing the risk of failure of offshore structures in contrast the 50 year environmental contour of wind and wave explicitly accounts for the correlation providing a more comprehensive definition of extreme conditions this aspect is particularly important for designing offshore wind turbines which may have design conditions controlled by 1 low or modest wind speeds when the rotor is spinning and blades are pitched for power production combined with extreme waves conditioned on low or modest wind or 2 extreme wind speeds when the rotor is parked and blades are feathered to reduce loads combined with extreme waves conditioned on extreme wind according to iec 61400 3 both situations can be considered through combinations of environmental variables determined by a 50 year environmental contour of wind and wave the first situation which corresponds to design load case 1 6 in iec 61400 3 involves the segment of the 50 year contour that combines low or modest wind speeds with extreme waves conditioned on low or modest wind speeds the second situation which corresponds to design load case 6 1 in iec 61400 3 involves the segment of the contour that combines extreme wind speeds with extreme waves the inverse first order reliability method iform winterstein et al 1993 is a widely used approach for calculating environmental contours based on the joint probability distribution of the environmental variables and the rosenblatt transformation rosenblatt 1952 is a common approach to establish the transformation between the variable space and the standard normal space within which the environmental contour is calculated based on common exceedance probability many approaches have been developed to calculate environmental contours for example the inverse directional simulation approach dimitrov 2020 replaces the linear limit state approximation in the standard normal space with a hypersphere to provide a more conservative contour estimation the highest probability density method haselsteiner et al 2017 provides a clearer interpretation of the resulting contour for multimodal probability distributions the direct iform approach derbanne and de hauteclocque 2019 does not require the construction of joint distributions but instead constructs the contour directly in the variable space through the fitting of univariate distributions in multiple directions in another approach mackay and jonathan 2020 environmental contours are constructed by first estimating the joint distribution of the storm peaks and then recovering the joint distribution of the time series through resampling and rescaling and a direct sampling approach is presented in vanem 2017 to construct the contour in the variable space directly through monte carlo simulations since the period of available measurements for contour estimation is usually shorter than the target return period the implementation of the iform rosenblatt approach requires distribution fitting and extrapolation of both the marginal and conditional probabilities many studies aim to improve accuracy by finding the optimal form of the distribution function for specific environmental variables e g johannessen et al 2001 jonathan et al 2014 li et al 2013 these forms however are usually context specific and are often inaccurate when applied to other contexts i e different sites and different environmental variables in this paper an iform rosenblatt framework that is more flexible is proposed the framework is designed to calculate accurate contours when the marginal and conditional probabilities of the dataset are represented with complex forms including parametric empirical and mixed parametric empirical forms the framework also includes a set of metrics to evaluate the accuracy of the resulting contour this paper is organized as follows first background information on iform and the rosenblatt transformation is provided in section 2 then in section 3 the proposed framework is introduced in detail followed by a numerical example in section 4 using a hindcast dataset haselsteiner et al 2019 finally the conclusions of this study are provided in section 5 2 background assessment of the ultimate demands on structures is an important part of structural design to ensure appropriate safety during extreme environmental conditions modern structural designs are usually performed for environmental conditions with a target mean return period mrp for a univariate random variable x the mrp n in years is expressed as n 1 v 1 f x where f x is the cumulative distribution function cdf of x and v is the annual occurrence rate the value of x corresponding to an n year return period is then 1 x n f 1 1 1 v n where f 1 is the inverse cdf function see fig 1 a for a multivariate random variable x x 1 x 2 x n x n is a series of n variables that form the n year contour with each combination of x 1 x 2 x n representing conditions with the same mrp various approaches have been developed to calculate such a contour winterstein et al 1993 haselsteiner et al 2017 chai and leira 2018 huseby et al 2017 among which iform is widely used in the wind and ocean engineering fields iform is based on a similar idea as the first order reliability method form which assumes a linear failure boundary after transforming the distribution of x into a standard joint normal distribution u g x u 1 u 2 u n the isotropy of u allows eq 1 be extended to the multivariate condition as 2 u n 2 β φ 1 1 1 v n where β is the l2 norm of the vector u n and is often referred to as the reliability index in risk analysis and where φ 1 is the inverse cdf of a standard joint normal distribution see fig 1 b for a bivariate condition as an example the n year contour u n is a hyper sphere in u with a radius equal to β and the corresponding contour for x can be calculated as x n g 1 u n one of the challenges of implementing iform is to establish the transformation g between measurements x and a standard joint normal distribution u for a univariate condition the transformation is obtained through u g x φ 1 f x x which maps one value of x to one value of u such that they have the same cumulative probability for a multivariate condition several approaches are available including the rosenblatt transformation rosenblatt 1952 and the nataf transformation nataf 1962 the rosenblatt transformation is adopted in several design standards for offshore engineering and for a bivariate joint distribution it converts the random variable x from its variable space into the standard normal space following 3 u 1 φ 1 f x 1 x 1 u 2 φ 1 f x 2 x 1 x 2 where x 1 is the independent variable and x 2 is the dependent variable note that the expression of f x 2 x 1 varies as a function of x 1 which can be achieved by expressing f x 2 x 1 as a parametric distribution f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ with parameters defined in θ and expressing θ as a function of x 1 the inverse of this transformation is 4 x 1 f x 1 1 φ u 1 x 2 f x 2 x 1 1 φ u 2 as such an n year contour is calculated with the following steps 1 calculate β using eq 2 which defines the radius of the u contour 2 select a value of x 1 and calculate u 1 using eq 3 3 calculate u 2 as β 2 u 1 2 with u 1 limited to the range of β β and thus with x 1 limited to the range of f x 1 1 1 v n f x 1 1 1 1 v n 4 calculate x 2 using eq 4 to determine the lower and upper values of the contour at x 1 as f x 2 x 1 1 φ β 2 u 1 2 5 repeat steps 2 4 for x 1 between f x 1 1 1 v n and f x 1 1 1 1 v n to form the complete contour several characteristics of the relationship between x and u are worth noting and are illustrated in fig 2 first the right tip of the x contour i e the largest value of the independent variable on the contour matches the right tip of the u contour the red stars in fig 2 the corresponding value of x 1 is f x 1 1 1 1 v n which is equal to the n year value of x 1 calculated in a univariate sense i e applying eq 1 to the marginal distribution f x 1 and is denoted herein as x 1 n the corresponding value of x 2 is the median value of its distribution conditioned on x 1 x 1 n because f x 2 x 1 n x 2 φ u 2 0 0 5 second the top tip of the x contour i e the largest value of the dependent variable on the contour does not correspond to the top tip of the u contour because x 2 is modeled as a variable conditioned on x 1 by the rosenblatt transformation the top tip of the u contour the blue star in fig 2 b represents the median of u 1 which corresponds to the median of x 1 the blue star in fig 2 a while the top tip of the x contour the green star in fig 2 a lies somewhere in the upper right quadrant of the u contour the green star in fig 2 b lastly the rosenblatt transformation even without estimation error of the underlying distributions results in an environmental contour that depends on the order of the variable transformation mackay and haselsteiner 2021 this means that when using the rosenblatt transformation to construct an environmental contour the tip of the environmental contour corresponding to the dependent variable x 2 only approximates the n year value of the marginal distribution of x 2 but does not match exactly as such three important characteristics of an accurate environmental contour i e an x contour are x 1 n the n year value of x 1 is the value of x 1 at the right tip of the x contour x 2 n the n year value of x 2 approximates the value of x 2 at the top tip of the x contour the median of x 2 conditioned on x 1 x 1 n is the value of x 2 at the right tip of the x contour note that similar characteristics can also be deduced for the lower left quadrant of the contour but this quadrant is usually less important from an engineering perspective and is not emphasized in this paper 3 a new iform rosenblatt framework using reparameterization in the traditional approach for constructing a long term environmental contour a single parametric distribution is selected for f x 2 x 1 and the parameters are defined as functions of the independent variable for this approach to generate an accurate environmental contour the conditional distribution must represent the data accurately for quantiles of the dependent variable that span from the left tail to the right tail conditioned on values of the independent variable that span from the left tail to the right tail for many datasets this requirement leads to inaccurate contours when the conditional distribution is restricted to the conventional set of parametric distributions this issue can be overcome by using more complex forms for the distributions potentially parametric empirical or even mixed parametric empirical forms haver 1985 naess et al 2013 however the accuracy of such distributions comes at the cost of needing many parameters to define them i e the dimension of the set of parameters θ becomes large and this becomes problematic and sometimes intractable when these parameters must all be defined as functions of the independent variable a new iform rosenblatt framework is proposed to overcome these issues the main idea is to reduce the complex form of a conditional distribution to a simpler form that is represented by a smaller set of parameters θ this simplification is called reparameterization and the key to this approach is that it is designed to prioritize accuracy specifically for the range of quantiles of the conditional distribution that contribute to the contour after reparameterization θ is defined as a function of the independent variable x 1 and the complex conditional distribution is approximated with a simpler parametric form as f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ in order to better illustrate the challenges of the traditional approach the 50 year environmental contour see fig 3 of mean wind speed v and significant wave height h s for an offshore site near virginia usa is taken as an example here this example is based on data provided at a 1 h interval from a 37 year hindcast study qiao et al 2019 the wind speed v is taken as the independent variable and h s is taken as the dependent variable following the implementation suggested in the iec 61400 3 a weibull distribution is used to estimate f v see fig 4 a and lognormal distributions are fit to the significant wave heights conditioned on a discrete set of wind speeds see fig 4 b and c for two examples the parameters σ and μ of the lognormal distributions are then fit as functions of v using the expression of a v b c see fig 5 a method that allows f h s v to be estimated at high wind speeds where few measurements are available the distribution model has a significant impact on the accuracy of the resulting environmental contour and other models such as the 3 parameter weibull distribution have been suggested for more accurate modeling of the distribution of h s compared to the lognormal distribution vanem 2016 09 the weibull and lognormal distributions are chosen for the example here as these distributions are mentioned specifically for this purpose as an example in the standard iec 61400 3 the weibull and lognormal distributions do not and are not intended to represent the best performance of the traditional iform rosenblatt approach but they do demonstrate the general challenge that an iform contour of h s and v that is accurate over its full span needs to be constructed from distributions that are accurate for both frequently occurring and tail values of h s v over a wide range of v other factors also influence the accuracy of the resulting contour such as the method to estimate the distribution parameters and the form of the function used to fit the parameters of the conditional distribution in terms of the independent variable for the weibull lognormal approach presented in this paper maximum likelihood estimation is used to estimate the distribution parameters for both marginal and conditional distributions this approach is typically accurate for the frequently occurring values but not for the tail values other approaches have been developed e g guedes soares and henriques 1996 vanem 2015 haselsteiner and thoben 2020 that are more accurate for tail values the 50 year contour is calculated following the steps introduced in section 2 and is plotted as the black curve in fig 3 some challenges exhibited through this example are summarized here 1 a wide range of values of v from 0 to over 25 m s is involved in the calculation of the contour the cumulative probability of the marginal distribution f v thus needs to be accurate for both frequently occurring values with a relatively high probability of occurrence and for extreme values with a relatively low probability of occurrence assuming a weibull distribution for the hourly measurements of v is usually accurate for the frequently occurring values but is often not accurate for the extreme values fig 4 a shows the distribution fitting result in terms of lg 1 f v to emphasize the discrepancy of the fit for the extreme values the figure shows that the weibull distribution only matches the empirical estimates of the hourly measurements up to 20 m s f v 0 998 and that for wind speeds greater than 20 m s the weibull distribution underestimates lg 1 f v i e the cumulative probability is overestimated leading to an underestimation of v 50 i e the right tip of the resulting contour 2 the upper part of the contour i e the upper value of the contour for a given value of v corresponds to values from the median to the upper tail of f h s v depending on the value of v however the fitting of the lognormal distribution is heavily influenced by the frequently occurring values and is often inaccurate in the upper tail for example the contour in fig 4 b indicates that the 50 year h s conditioned on v 5 m s is 4 m while the underlying data suggests the value of h s is 5 m at higher wind speeds the lognormal distribution indicates a 50 year h s conditioned on v 20 m s of 7 m while the underlying data in fig 4 c suggests the value is closer to 5 m in addition the parameters of the lognormal distribution are fit as functions of the wind speed see fig 5 where the fitting error of each parameter influences the resulting contour fig 6 presents an overview of the proposed framework which is organized into three primary parts univariate fitting reparameterization and evaluation each of which is described in more detail in the following subsections for the univariate fitting part the framework involves fitting of 1 the marginal distributions of x 1 and x 2 2 the conditional distribution f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ evaluated at a set of discrete samples x 1 s x 1 1 x 1 2 x 1 m for which sufficient measurements of x 2 x 1 are available and 3 a function representing the relationship between the medians of the conditional distributions f x 2 x 1 s 1 0 5 and x 1 for the reparameterization part the distribution f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ is approximated by two parametric distributions f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ upper and f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ lower for the upper and lower tails respectively and the parameters within θ upper and θ lower are then fit as functions of x 1 to separately define the upper and lower parts of the contour for the evaluation part the accuracy of this approach is assessed with several metrics including the value of x 2 corresponding to the top tip of the x contour the right tip of the x contour x 1 n f x 2 x 1 n 1 0 5 and discrete estimates of the x 2 values of the contour at x 1 x 1 s this paper discusses two dimensional contours however in theory this framework can be expanded to contours with more than two dimensions but in practice the same challenges exist as for the traditional iform rosenblatt approach such as data sparsity when estimating f x i 1 x 1 x i x i 1 for distributions conditioned on more than one variable 3 1 univariate fitting the framework proposed here involves the estimation of three univariate distributions f x 1 f x 2 and f x 2 x 1 s and the fitting of the median of x 2 as a function of x 1 a wide range of values of x 1 is required in contour construction so f x 1 needs to be accurate for both frequently occurring and extreme values the authors have developed a hybrid approach for generating distributions that are accurate for both frequently occurring and extreme values of a random variable the approach is used in the numerical example in section 4 and is briefly described here with a more thorough description provided in another manuscript qiao and myers the approach first determines separate distributions for the frequently occurring and extreme values of the random variables and then combines the distributions to obtain a single continuous distribution based on a concept called the normalized exceedance ratio ner the distribution for the frequently occurring values can be either a parametric distribution with its parameters obtained using the maximum likelihood estimation or a non parametric distribution with cdf values determined empirically the distribution for the extreme values is obtained by first applying extreme value theory and then calculating a coefficient to adjust the generalized extreme value gev distribution to account for temporal correlation as a function of the cdf value of the gev distribution the coefficient is obtained by evaluating the ratio of the empirical exceedance probabilities of the raw time series data and the corresponding block maxima as such for time series data where the tail is mostly composed of the block maxima the exceedance probability is similar to the gev distribution while for time series data where the tail is composed significantly of data adjacent to block maxima and therefore exhibits temporal correlation the exceedance probability deviates from the gev distribution the resulting distribution of extreme values is described by six parameters three for the generalized extreme value distribution and three to define the coefficients that adjust the distribution for temporal correlation note that any univariate distribution can be used in this framework as long as the accuracy for the quantiles involved in contour construction is acceptable 3 2 reparameterization of f x 2 x 1 univariate fitting of f x 2 x 1 s x 2 θ using the ner approach presented in section 3 1 is one approach to generate an accurate probability distribution in the ner approach f x 2 x 1 s x 2 θ is expressed using six distribution parameters i e θ θ 1 θ 6 each of which needs to be fit as a function of x 1 the general form θ i a i x 1 b i c i is used in this paper this is a challenging task because 1 not all parameters show a clear trend for the functional form of θ f x 1 and 2 some parameters have a larger influence on the accuracy of the resulting contours than other parameters note these issues are challenging for any parametric distribution not just the ner approach a reparameterization method is introduced here to resolve this challenge this method approximates f x 2 x 1 using a parametric distribution f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ with fewer parameters θ for example if a two parameter weibull distribution is used to approximate f x 2 x 1 the dimension of θ reduces to two and thus only these two parameters need to be fit as functions of x 1 rather than six this method can be used even when f x 2 x 1 is expressed in a non parametric form e g using an empirical cdf which is a case that cannot be handled by the traditional iform rosenblatt approach the reparameterization method should ensure that f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ has similar values of cumulative probability as f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ for the range of quantiles that contribute to the construction of an environmental contour for a target mrp of n years and a particular value of x 1 only two quantiles of f x 2 x 1 are needed to calculate the value of the contour for any particular value of x 1 for example for the median of x 1 the two quantiles are f x 2 x 1 1 v n for the bottom of the contour and f x 2 x 1 1 1 v n for the top of the contour as another example for the n year value of x 1 the two quantiles converge to the value of 0 5 since the lower and upper tails of f x 2 x 1 are reparameterized as f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ lower and f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ upper in the proposed framework these functions only need to be accurate in terms of cumulative probability at a single quantile for a particular value of x 1 however a range of quantiles rather than a single quantile is used for the reparameterization fitting process which makes the estimate of θ available when its dimension is higher than one a simple approach is proposed here to select the range the u contour is stretched vertically into two ellipses see the two red dashed curves in fig 7 a so that for a given value of u 1 a range of u 2 is obtained indicated as the green and blue dots in fig 7 a and thus a range of cdf is determined for x 2 as f x 2 x 1 x 2 and f x 2 x 1 x 2 see the corresponding green and blue dots in fig 7 b as such the intent of this approach is to estimate the parameters θ of a parametric distribution such that a loss function l θ representing the error when using f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ to approximate f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ is minimized for x 2 between x 2 and x 2 since f x 2 x 1 is close to 1 for most points on the upper contour minimizing the difference between f x 2 x 1 and f x 2 x 1 can be challenging for some optimization algorithms and a logarithmic transformation on f x 2 x 1 is helpful for a faster convergence when estimating θ the mean squared logarithmic error of the inverse of exceedance probability is used in this paper and is expressed as 5 l θ 1 n i 1 n ln 1 1 f x 2 x 1 x 2 i θ ln 1 1 f x 2 x 1 x 2 i θ 2 where x 2 i is a discrete set of x 2 between x 2 and x 2 the transformation 1 1 f x 2 x 1 x 2 θ is in a similar form as the mrp calculation and often approximates as a straight line in a logarithmic scale for large mrp values 3 3 contour estimation and evaluation using the reparameterization method introduced in section 3 2 the lower and upper tails of f x 2 x 1 are approximated by a parametric distribution defined by parameters θ lower and θ upper note that f x 2 x 1 θ lower and θ upper are estimated for a discrete set x 1 s and θ lower and θ upper are then fit as functions of x 1 which makes the estimation of f x 2 x 1 available for the entire range of x 1 involved in contour construction since the upper part of the contour is estimated using θ upper and the lower part is estimated using θ lower continuity between the upper and lower parts is not guaranteed at the left connection point x 1 l f x 1 1 1 v n and the right connection point x 1 r f x 1 1 1 1 v n various parametric distributions can be used for the estimation of θ lower and θ upper and the resulting contour can be evaluated using the metrics listed in fig 6 note that the x 1 component of the contour always ends at x 1 n because of the nature of the rosenblatt transformation even though the value of x 2 corresponding to the top tip of the resulting contour does not match x 2 n exactly see section 2 the difference is usually small and thus x 2 n is still a useful evaluation metric the contour should also match the discrete empirical estimates of x 2 at x 1 s in this paper the absolute error is used to quantify the former metric the root mean square error is used for the latter metric and the average of these two metrics is used to represent the overall accuracy of the reparameterized distribution for the upper and lower parts of the contour respectively 4 numerical example the proposed iform rosenblatt framework is applied in this section to the environmental contour benchmarking exercise described in haselsteiner et al 2019 three 24 h datasets corresponding to three offshore sites in the north sea are considered and provide hourly measurements of mean wind speed v averaged over a 10 min window and significant wave height h s corresponding to datasets d e and f in the benchmarking exercise groll and weisse 2016 a more comprehensive comparison for all six datasets is provided in haselsteineraet al 2021 the ner method is used for the univariate fitting of f v f h s and f h s v the fitting of f h s v is presented here for two wind speeds 5 m s and 20 m s where a window of 2 m s is used to extract the data of conditional wave heights i e using wave heights corresponding to wind speeds between 4 m s and 6 m s for the estimation of f h s v 5 m s the results are compared to an approach where the data is modeled with a 2 parameter weibull distribution for wind speeds and a lognormal distribution for significant wave height and the parameters are fit using maximum likelihood estimation the results are shown in figs 8 11 in terms of exceedance probability 1 f x where the results using the ner method are shown as blue curves and the results using the weibull lognormal approach are shown as red curves since the difference between the ner and weibull lognormal methods is mainly for the extreme values where the exceedance probability is close to 0 the results of exceedance probability are shown in logarithmic form the exceedance probabilities calculated from measurements using the empirical cumulative probability are used here as a reference the grey dots in figs 8 11 for the marginal wind speed distribution fig 8 the weibull distribution fits datasets d and e well for dataset f however the weibull distribution overestimates the wind speed above 20 m s 99th percentile and this error influences the calculation of the contour in particular v n is overestimated and thus h s values corresponding to values of v close to v n are also overestimated for the marginal distribution of significant wave height fig 9 the lognormal distribution starts to deviate from the empirical estimation at the 95th percentile for all datasets for the wave height distributions conditioned on v 5 m s the behavior of datasets d and f follows a lognormal distribution but dataset e does not and for the wave height distributions conditioned on v 20 m s the behavior of all three datasets roughly but not precisely follows the lognormal distribution it is apparent that the assumption of an environmental variable following a certain parametric distribution does not always hold and this is especially impactful when the distribution fitting is mainly determined by the frequently occurring values with high probabilities of occurrence and when the tails with low probabilities of occurrence are most important for constructing the environmental contour the ner method see the blue curves in figs 8 11 matches the data more accurately in these cases however it requires four more parameters compared to the weibull and lognormal distributions dataset e is used as an example of the method proposed in this paper to construct a 50 year contour fig 12 shows the evaluation metrics which will be used to evaluate the contour the blue dashed line indicates the independent 50 year wind speed which is obtained by applying eq 1 to f v and the blue dotted line indicates the independent 50 year significant wave height which is obtained by applying eq 1 to f h s the blue dash dotted line indicates the median of h s as a function of v which is obtained by fitting the estimates of the median of h s v evaluated at a discrete set of v using the form a v b c and lastly the blue dots indicate the rough contour positions which are obtained by applying eqs 2 and 4 to f h s v the rough contour positions are jagged because they are estimated independently based on empirical data and they cover only a portion of the contour due to the availability of the measurements for locations on the contour where sufficient measurements are available the ultimate contour should follow the rough contour with its top tip positioned close to the blue dotted line and its right tip coinciding with the intersection of the dashed line and the dash dotted curve following in weibull lognormal approach where a lognormal distribution is fit to f h s v estimated at various values of v using maximum likelihood estimation the parameters of the lognormal distribution are shown in fig 13 a as a function of v the lognormal distribution is expressed using parameters μ and σ as 6 f x 1 x σ 2 π exp ln x ln μ 2 2 σ 2 for the implementation presented in this paper the parameters of f h s v are assumed to follow θ a v b c which fits the data accurately for the lognormal distribution in fig 13 a however the resulting contour shown as the red dashed curve in fig 14 overestimates the 50 year h s for wind speeds below 20 m s for a wind speed of 15 m s the overestimation is about 25 this error arises because the actual conditional wave height does not follow the lognormal distribution well for that range of wind speed as revealed in fig 10 b using the proposed framework various parametric distributions are tested for reparameterizing the upper tail of f h s v and the logistic distribution shows the best result which is defined in terms of parameters μ and s as 7 f x exp x μ s s 1 exp x μ s 2 the two parameters of the logistic distribution are shown in fig 13 b as a function of the wind speed which exhibits more variability compared to the lognormal distribution however since the logistic distribution captures the tail behavior of f h s v better the resulting contour shown as the red solid curve in fig 14 matches the metrics better the independent 50 year wave height is slightly overestimated by the red contour as the value derived from the marginal h s distribution indicated by the blue dotted line is lower than the value estimated at f h s v 21 m s and the resulting contour the contour derived from the lognormal distribution is used as the estimation of the lower part of the resulting contour since it aligns with the empirical estimates a spike appears on the left part of the contour using the lognormal distribution as shown in fig 14 which does not match the trend in the raw data this is due to errors at several stages of the calculation first the lognormal fit for the raw data of h s v 1 m s yields σ r a w 0 60 and μ r a w 0 66 i e the blue triangle and orange circle at v 1 m s in fig 13 a which results in a 50 year conditional h s equal to 6 9 m then after fitting σ r a w and μ r a w as a function of wind speed the parameters of f h s v at v 1 m s are σ f i t 0 68 and μ f i t 0 54 i e the blue and orange curves in fig 13 a which results in a 50 year conditional h s equal to 7 8 m to better visualize the result of the proposed framework the probability density of the joint distribution is plotted in fig 15 where the density of f h s v above the median of h s v follows a logistic distribution and the density below follows a lognormal distribution fig 15 also indicates the discontinuity of probability density that arises when using two distributions to describe the upper and lower parts of the environmental contour there are many factors that influence the accuracy of the traditional approach including the selection of the distribution type the method to estimate distribution parameters and the form of θ f x 1 that is used to define the conditional distribution the intent of this numerical example is not to compare the accuracy of the traditional approach with the proposed framework the intent is to use a specific implementation of both approaches to compare their features 5 conclusions there are several difficulties in constructing environmental contours using the traditional iform rosenblatt framework first accurate estimates of the probability of both the frequently occurring and extreme values of the independent variable are required while a parametric distribution estimated using methods such as the maximum likelihood estimation is often only accurate for frequently occurring values second a parametric distribution is required to provide accurate estimates of probabilities of the dependent variable conditioned on a wide range of the independent variable and in practical situations it is possible that none of the existing parametric distributions are accurate under these conditions and lastly the parameters of the conditional distribution must be fit as a function of the independent variable which becomes challenging and even intractable when the conditional distribution is complex and needs to be expressed using a large number of parameters a new framework is proposed in this paper to overcome these challenges the first challenge is resolved by the normalized exceedance ratio method and the other two challenges are resolved by the distribution reparameterization method which allows the conditional distribution expressed in either a parametric or non parametric form to be approximated by another parametric distribution that yields similar cumulative probabilities for the quantiles that contribute to the construction of the contour in addition a set of metrics are proposed for contour evaluation so that the goodness of fit can be clearly determined the method is implemented for an example dataset and the resulting contour is reasonably accurate according to the proposed evaluation

20274,by using a structured analytic technique this paper reviews the development of research on maritime accidents involving human factors hfs first a clear framework is generated for consolidating the main viewpoints on diverse topics it is structured in terms of focus perspective and methodology in particular research focus is further classified into factor identification interaction investigation and regulative intervention second most generic hf related accident models employed in the maritime domain are specialized for specific maritime situations the hf analysis and classification system hfacs is the most commonly used model in factor identification studies the few intervention related studies only propose intervention measures and studies on maritime hf related accidents are more qualitative and retrospective than quantitative and prospective third the following research gaps are identified i inadequate fundamental exploration of nonlinear interaction and intervening mechanisms ii lack of application based conceptualization of maritime specific analytical frameworks and iii methodological limitations regarding data collection and quantitative analysis finally suggestions for future research are proposed including establishing an interlink net rather than only a linear chain to explore interactions among causal factors objectively investigating the effect of an intervention constructing maritime specific integrated models concerning the accident cause interlinkage and intervention applying specific methods in data collection in accordance with the potential and heterogeneity of hfs keywords maritime accident research human factor structured survey state quo future development 1 introduction despite continual improvements in maritime technology and safety management maritime accidents frequently occur with enormous damage to human beings and the environment according to lloyd s list intelligence casualty statistics 26 071 maritime accidents occurred during 2010 2019 951 of which were total loss accidents allianz global corporate and specialty 2020 among the numerous factors causing maritime accidents human factors hfs are a primary cause the european maritime safety agency 2019 revealed that 65 8 of the 4104 marine accidents occurring within the jurisdiction of member states of the european union during 2011 2018 were attributed to human actions trucco et al 2008 demonstrated that based on the data of 15 000 maritime accidents collected by lloyd s shipping information service 70 80 of accidents were caused by human related events and activities the aforementioned findings have spurred considerable research on hf related maritime accidents in web of science more than 400 papers from 1996 to the present can be found specifically publications related to hf related maritime accidents are increasing annually from an annual three or five papers in the past to approximately twenty per year at present for a better understanding of the state quo of research and for targeting future developments up to date literature reviews are required luo and shin 2019 conducted a comprehensive literature review of 522 papers for determining the development of maritime accident research in terms of research topics research methods data sources and publication information such as authors journals and disciplines goerlandt and montewka 2015 explored fundamental issues in maritime transportation risk analysis in terms of risk definitions risk perspectives and risk analysis approaches through a review of 58 publications from 1970 to 2014 despite the aforementioned literature reviews well structured reviews focused on hf related maritime accidents remain scarce with the following research areas meriting attention first a framework should be structured to profile relevant viewpoints and synthesize new developments second distinct features embedded in maritime specific accident research should be characterized third omissions and limitations of the current research should be revealed with a future research agenda proposed this paper has the following research objectives build an inventory of the main viewpoints adopted in hf related maritime accident research distinguish maritime specific hf related accident research from universal hf related accident research and provide new insights for academics exploring potential research questions the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the research design in section 3 a conceptual framework is generated to classify hf related accident models and applications for the maritime domain section 4 describes relevant research topics and similarities and differences among hf related maritime specific accident research and universal hf related accident research section 5 outlines a future research agenda section 6 provides the conclusion 2 research design a literature review can be conducted based on a normalized framework wee and banister 2016 highlighted the difference between a general overview and a critical review with added value general overviews are always pursued using a retrieval approach and emphasize classifications or associated statistical descriptions of general matters such as research topics authors journals and disciplines without specific added value by contrast critical reviews with a thematic approach provide added value in accordance to specific features of the targeted research area such as empirical insights gaps in the literature and research agendas relevance for real world applications or investigations of theories methodologies or conceptual models wee and banister 2016 this paper as a critical thematic review rather than a retrieving overview adopts the thematic perspective considering the main purpose in which the construction of a consolidating framework and the performance of an associated structural analysis are highlighted given the common understanding of the natural action sequence three core themes related to the occurrence of an accident namely cause occurrence and intervention are clarified thus a structured analytical framework is constructed around these three themes as follows first an empirical review of generic and maritime specific hf related accident research is conducted to produce a classification of related accident models and their application in the maritime domain second an investigation of different perspectives and viewpoints regarding the three main themes is undertaken to provide an explicit structured profile and a clear description of the commonalities and differences of diverse views in particular compared with the universal hf related accident research features distinct to maritime specific hf related accident research are identified finally future research directions with respect to fundamental conceptualization applied models and methodological issues are proposed this structured analysis elucidates how dependent and independent research elements are related and how conceptually associated frames are accordingly generated any theoretical or practical research usually starts with the generation of a scientific research problem and continues with the determination of the analytical logic by using suitable theory based research techniques research problem analytical logic and techniques can thus be regarded as the indispensable composition of any research research elements and their selection distinguishes studies from one another the present paper characterizes the current accident research by research problems analytical logic and techniques termed in this paper as focus perspective and methodology respectively table 1 moreover based on woo et al s methodology categories 2011 the methodology which is classified into qualitative and quantitative types in table 1 can be further elaborated into conceptual work math modeling statistical analysis experimental simulations case studies surveys and interviews in accordance with the accident research features the literature search was conducted mainly through web of science using the theme words of maritime or marine or ship or vessel or sea or ocean and accident or casualty or disaster and human 429 papers published before march 2020 were found after pre review a total of 152 articles were selected for further analysis based on the principle of relevance additionally more relevent papers have been supplemented from the scopus journal database due to the relatively small number of articles on hf related maritime accidents table 2 and fig 1 present the distribution of the sampled articles demonstrating the features of maritime hf related accident research as being nascent niche and cross disciplinary 3 a classification of hf related accident research the evolutional development of accidental research has resulted in a cornucopia of accident models explaining why accidents occur qureshi 2008 hollnagel 2002 classified accident models into three categories sequential epidemiological and systemic accidents concerning the relation between hf related causal factors and consequences human reliability analysis hra methods have been generated for specifically evaluating the factors affecting the performance of human operators and are useful for mitigating human errors zhou et al 2017 fig 2 demonstrates the evolution of hra models in fig 2 the evolution of hra methods has occurred in several phases in first generation hra such as the technique for human error rate prediction therp rook 1962 swain 1990 human cognitive reliability hcr hannaman et al 1985 and the human error assessment and reduction technique heart williams 1986 people with our inherent deficiencies naturally fail to perform tasks just as mechanical electrical or structural components do marseguerra et al 2007 the second generation such as a technique for human error analysis atheana cooper et al 1996 the cognitive reliability and error analysis method cream hollnagel 1998 and the connectionism assessment of human reliability cahr sträter 2000 put human error into the context as a critical factor in the accident and these methods tended to analyze the causes of errors from cognitive aspects di pasquale et al 2013 the newly developing hra models pay more attention to the dynamic interlinkage between causal factors and the influence of cognitive factors pan et al 2017 alvarenga and melo 2019 on the basis of the definition of research elements in section 2 table 3 presents the characteristic results of different generic hf related accident models revealing that i most models are interaction focused ii more than half of all models are retrospective iii most proposed models are suitable for qualitative analysis and iv few intervention focused models have been proposed these findings indicate that researchers consider the interaction among different hfs more often than only classifying causal factors in addition due to the irregularity and suddenness of accidents and the difficulty of accessing sufficient reliable data retrospective and qualitative perspectives tend to be adopted with a concurrent lack of intervention related research these models have been widely applied in numerous areas with substantial application in the maritime domain demonstrating similar traits in all respect as other accident research fig 3 however distinct features of maritime accidents identified as uncommonness and severity may distinguish maritime hf related accident research from universal hf related accident research this is fully explored in the next section 4 an examination of hf related accident research 4 1 identification of hf related causal factors on the basis of 17 papers exploring causal factors table 4 summarizes the research results regarding what causal factors are how they are structured and the associated research features the results in table 4 reveal that most hierarchical structures of causal factors are generated by generic models with a few exceptions of self classification among the models employed hfacs which was proposed by shappell and wiegmann 2000 and is based on the four level taxonomy of the swiss cheese model is the most common however other generic models such as tracer are also occasionally used hfacs is widely applied in maritime accident analysis not only because it provides a useful framework for clarifying the main human factors hierarchically but also because its classification can correspond to a certain extent to the human element common terms in resolution a 884 21 of the international maritime organization imo fig 4 presents their comparison generic hfacs has five layers external factors organizational influences unsafe supervision unsafe acts and preconditions for unsafe acts imo s classification also has five layers diminished human performance marine environment safety administration management and mental action although the classification criteria in the first layer differ the further specifications of causal factors are similar given their 92 overlap therefore applying the same classification scheme logic as imo adheres to provide a solid basis for the application of hfacs in the maritime area further review of the relevant literature revealed differences in the specification of causal factors under specific situations for instance celik and cebi 2009 divided personal factors into coordination communication planning factors and self imposed stress whereas zhang et al 2019 divided them into coordination communication planning factors personal readiness ship resource mismanagement communication and bridge resource management another example is organizational influence akhtar and utne 2014 divided organizational influences into safety culture training focus vessel certifications manning recourses and quality control chen et al 2013 divided causal factors only into resources management organizational climate and organizational process differences can also be seen in the case of environmental errors where zhang et al 2019 and akyuz 2017 have used technological environment and infrastructure but akyuz 2017 added another factor namely physical environment thus when considerable efforts have been made to produce situation based specifications of causal factors here many hfs are weakly defined with possibility of misinterpretation a class of research pertaining to categorizing causal factors in terms of the concise and normalize classification has been conducted navas de maya et al 2020 described good representation in overcoming the flaws of the existing taxonomy which used card sorting approach to generate higher level and simpler hf categories based on the european marine casualty information platform nomenclature to summarize factor identification focused models adopted in maritime accident analysis to identify causal hfs follow similar analytical logic and classification schemes as those of generic accident models and mainly concern the generation of a situation based classification that considers specific accident situations despite differences in the situation based specification of causal factors it is also critical to establish concise and normalized terminology for different causal hf categories that are applicable in different situations in this regard the human element common terms of the imo and nomenclature defined by maritime accident agencies are highly recommended 4 2 interaction among hf related causal factors compared with the two other research themes the interaction among hf related causal factors is the priority of current research table 5 presents a summary in table 5 the following findings are identified first most models applied for analyzing the interaction among causal factors are sequential according to hollnagel s classification philosophy 2002 in contrast to factor identification focused research where the hfacs model is intensively used most of the interaction focused models applied in universal accident analysis can be also used in the maritime domain including accimap akyuz 2015 lee et al 2017 bayesian network akhtar and utne 2014 zhang et al 2018 structural equation modeling hu et al 2019 and fault tree senol and sahin 2016 the only difference in these models is in the specification of the accident occurrence path second concerning the perspectives of studies retrospective studies have applied both qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate the occurrence of hf related accidents whereas prospective studies have tended to estimate the probability of human errors in maritime accidents by using quantitative methods in this regard fault tree analysis is frequently used in prospective analysis the hfacs model and accimap are often applied in retrospective analysis and the cream can be employed in both this pattern might be related to the research objective revealing the occurrence mechanism through retrospective analysis versus predicting risk through prospective analysis and research data availability qualitative description in an accident report versus quantitative data from statistics of individual studies in conclusion the interaction focused model adopted in maritime accident analysis is structurally similar to the factor identification focused model generic models should be made more specific to the maritime domain furthermore the deviation between the sequence based analytical approach and the complicated nonlinear relationships among causes behaviors and accidents emphasize that the nonlinear dynamics of causal factors should be considered 4 3 interventions against hf related accidents although relatively little research has been conducted in this direction a number of hf related maritime accident studies have examined the topic of intervention the summary of the relevant research is presented in table 6 three findings were detected first a conceptual analytical framework is lacking in intervention research on maritime accidents the review of 17 articles in table 6 demonstrated little correlation with the mainstream framework applied in universal intervention research table 7 second current intervention focused research in the maritime area mainly is related to describing specific intervention measures adopted in specific situations through case study in retrospective analysis or through conceptual reasoning in prospective analysis third most of the researches involve only two steps identifying risks and proposing intervention measures and strategies in table 6 five types of specific intervention measures are identified modifying organizational policies e g revising operation procedures and providing additional shore based support improving the technological environment e g equipping advanced supportive equipment strengthening supervision arranging training and education and establishing a corporate level safety culture these intervention measures have been considered from both social and technical perspectives in particular the gradual attempts to strengthen the technical intervention such as using a geographic information system that transmits water depth data gao et al 2013 applying an intelligent radar system and collision detection system al ramadhan et al 2017 and employing a timely reminder mechanism xu and wang 2020 to prevent maritime accidents implies a trend of intervening by redesigning the technical environment rather than simply focusing on individual and organization orientated intervention in conclusion compared with factor identification focused and interaction focused models intervention related research in the maritime domain is scant more structured rigorous research is required 5 discussion the review of hf related maritime accident research suggested research gaps including fundamental exploration of nonlinear interaction and intervening mechanisms application based conceptualization of a maritime specific analytical framework and methodological exploration regarding data collection and quantitative analysis in this section these gaps are further investigated 5 1 fundamental based discussion one inadequacy revealed by the review is that relying solely on sequential models to explore interaction among causal factors is too idealistic essentially human influence on the accident acts is often the result of a combination of factors such as technology the environment and management such coupling of multiple factors undoubtedly demonstrates the complex influence on the occurrence of maritime accidents therefore establishing an interlinked net rather than a linear chain is necessary to fully explore the interactions among causal factors due to the distinct features of hfs such as potential and heterogeneity which are discussed in section 5 3 further fundamental research on network based interaction is required as opposed to the current dominated sequential models the other inadequacy is reflected by limited intervention related research which particularly lacks a clear conceptual frame and associated models specific to the maritime domain with respect to intervention research geller 2004 argued it focuses on what people do analyzes why they do it and then applies research supported intervention regulations to improve what people do and proposed a behavior based safety bbs process that consists of four steps defining target behaviors observing target behaviors intervening to improve behaviors and testing the impact of the intervention geller 2001 most studies on the interventions of maritime accidents have focused on two of these steps defining target behaviors and intervening to improve behaviors the step of observing target behaviors is usually based on simple subjective judgment because of the endogenous characteristics of target behaviors and the step of testing the impact of an intervention is mainly measured by comparing changes in accident occurrence before and after the intervention this situation might arise from the difficulty of quantifying interventions and the complexity of the compound effects imposed by interventions a decrease in accident occurrence does not necessarily result from implementing an intervention because accident occurrence is affected by multiple factors therefore further studies should evaluate how the interventions affect target behaviors and accident occurrence and should observe and measure changes in the target behaviors and relevant latent factors that may lead to accidents the difficulty in conducting these types of studies is largely due to the methodology which is discussed in section 5 3 5 2 application based discussion the literature review revealed that hf related maritime accident studies have prioritized the specialization of generic frameworks and models when applied in the maritime domain and any universal framework or principal to be embedded in maritime accident research should be constructed in accordance to maritime features for example despite the numerous diverse causal factors leading to a maritime accident the imo continues to propose guidance with concise and standard definitions for the process and terminology in investigating hfs in maritime accidents thus exploring maritime specific analytical frameworks from the applied aspect is another task for future development in this paper as an attempt at this task an integrated model concerning the three critical accident elements of cause interaction and intervention specific to maritime accidents is presented fig 5 and table 8 as shown in fig 5 the occurrence of an accident always involves the following procedure defects in latent factors create a latent risk condition which later activates hazard triggers and leads to unsafe acts which finally can result in accidents concerning the four accident phases two points need to be highlighted as follows first every phase is influenced by multiple factors herein human element common terms imo resolution a 884 21 are applied and further divided and coded based on the connection between factor categories diminished human performance marine environment safety administration management and mental action and the phases of the accident occurrence process as shown in table 8 second every phase has typical corresponding interventions including modifying the organizational policy improving the technological environment strengthening supervision arranging training and education and establishing a safety culture at the corporate level fig 5 depicts their corresponding relationships moreover the premise of the aforementioned integrated model is that most maritime accidents are caused by hfs accordingly the significance of the social featured intervention measures such as culture policy training and supervision must be highlighted furthermore future studies should redesign the environment to try to eliminate and not just minimize hf related failures an unmanned ship which is a revolutionary innovation to the ship operation environment may be used to realize such an initiative autonomous ship navigation can eliminate the traditional onboard hf related risks such as fatigue and work overload burmeister et al 2014 and can reduce ship accidents caused by crews lack of situation awareness neglect of international regulations for preventing collisions at sea and personal factors wróbel et al 2017 the shore based control technology of remote monitoring can effectively avoid human error caused by the lack of ship sense between shore people and ships man et al 2016 5 3 methodology based discussion the aforementioned findings that maritime hf related accident research is more qualitative and retrospective than quantitative and prospective implies a methodological gap in the research particularly the lack of accurate and complete data collection and lack of quantitative analyses in both retrospective and prospective analysis hetherington et al 2006 also summarized similar problems in shipping related literature small sample sizes survey reliability concerns retrospective designs and lack of outcome measures for the influence of human behaviors or conditions on accidents two main causes of this problem are identified the first cause is the endogenous characteristics of causal hfs during the incubation and occurrence of maritime accidents once conditions are appropriate individual causes may appear without a trace and lead to unsafe acts causing maritime accidents therefore causal hfs are potential moreover considerable intra and inter individual variation such as personality preference expectation ability and motivation exists with regard to the action taken for a given task thus causal hfs are heterogeneous such potential and heterogeneous features are also applicable to the observation of target human behaviors and assessment of intervention effectiveness in addition intervention suggestions such as raising employee safety awareness vederhus et al 2018 and improving the company s safety culture efiok et al 2015 are usually abstract and unquantifiable the aforementioned discussion clarifies the difficulties in obtaining unbiased and quantitative hf related accident data posing considerable challenges to research particularly quantitative analysis the second cause is the uncommonness of maritime accidents because of the high variability in the number of accident situations in terms of the ship type operational patterns context situation and systematic nature of human behavior certain accident situations may have too few samples to represent the entire population inadequate sample size may limit the effectiveness of statistical analysis and other quantitative modeling the inherent defect of hf related accident research poses considerable challenges to conducting quantitative and prospective analysis however efforts should still be made to bridge up the methodological gap as much as possible because quantitative analysis has definitive advantages over qualitative analysis in clarifying accident occurrence mechanism and performing trend analysis thus the following mitigating suggestions can be made 1 the currently available accident related databases and associated investigation reports should be supplemented to satisfy data requirements for hf investigations thus concerning accident database construction and data record reconciliation as proposed by grabowski et al 2009 the imo s human element common terms should be applied in accident investigations as uniform terminology 2 specific methods are required to reveal the potential heterogeneity of expert knowledge to this end chin and debnath 2009 used an ordered probability model to capture the risk perception preferences of port pilots this may provide an opportunity for the application of a discrete choice model in eliciting expert knowledge 3 simulation experiments should be extended to more applications with the aid of a navigation simulator a navigation risk situation can be effectively reproduced and behavior data of the crew under the risk situation can be collected reinhard et al 2019 fan et al 2018 the steering behavior data of experiment participants in different scenarios can also be collected through repeated use kim et al 2007 with the aforementioned improvements in data collection not only quantitative analysis but also perspective analysis can be performed to some extent specifically instead of just proposing several caveats and preventative suggestions the prospective analysis pertaining to intervention measures can be systematically conducted heij and knapp 2018 used past port state control data which are specific to hf deficiencies together with past accident records quantized as risk probability to predict future accidents through logit models thus broader and deeper insights into future accident risk prediction can be obtained by including data beyond the traditional hf related data such as port state control data conducting a comprehensive prospective quantitative analysis and adopting uniform hf related deficiency codes 6 conclusions this paper reviewed the development of hf related maritime accident research it provides several contributions by developing a framework based on focus perspective and methodology to consolidate the main viewpoints on diverse topics that are currently dispersed by clarifying the distinct features associated with maritime specific accident research in terms of the three critical accident elements of course interaction and intervention and by proposing novel areas of future research concerning fundamental applied and methodological aspects several important findings which might have been implied but not explicitly stated in previous studies have been clearly illustrated hfacs is the most commonly used model in factor identification focused studies compared with other hra methods hf related causal factors classification should account for specific maritime accident situations and use concise and normalized terminology in interaction focused research most generic models can be used in the maritime domain in accordance with maritime specific features sequential accident models is the most common in interaction focused studies revealing that nonlinear dynamics of causal factors have been neglected the intervention related studies only propose intervention measures implying the lack of a conceptual analytical framework in the few existing intervention related studies and the negligence of observing the target behavior and assessing the intervention effectiveness other research gaps include application based conceptualization of maritime specific frameworks and methodological exploration of data collection and quantitative analysis accordingly in fundamental research researchers are advised to establish an interlink net rather than only a linear chain to fully explore the interaction among causal factors the effects of an intervention specifically on causal factors or target behaviors should be studied rather than determining an approximate relationship between an intervention and accident occurrence in applied research integrated models concerning the three critical accident elements cause interaction and intervention should be examined in accordance with features specific to the maritime domain to improve our understanding of their corresponding relationships in terms of methodology to improve data analyzability imo s human element common terms should be applied as uniform terminology specific methods are required to reveal the potential heterogeneity of expert knowledge and simulation experiments should be employed in more applications this highly structured study provides a clear classification of diverse views on critical topics and can serve as a crucial reference for scholars and practitioners however because it adopted a more synthetic approach of what is already known rather than an extensive thematic investigation it has limitations such as the lack of detailed elaboration on any one specific theme in other words this study provided an overview of hf related maritime accident research rather than elucidating specific individual problems such as navas de maya et al 2020 who thoroughly examined the literature to establish a concise and normalized classification of causal factors critical issues that warrant comprehensive study include concise and normalized hf identification network structured hf interaction and

20274,by using a structured analytic technique this paper reviews the development of research on maritime accidents involving human factors hfs first a clear framework is generated for consolidating the main viewpoints on diverse topics it is structured in terms of focus perspective and methodology in particular research focus is further classified into factor identification interaction investigation and regulative intervention second most generic hf related accident models employed in the maritime domain are specialized for specific maritime situations the hf analysis and classification system hfacs is the most commonly used model in factor identification studies the few intervention related studies only propose intervention measures and studies on maritime hf related accidents are more qualitative and retrospective than quantitative and prospective third the following research gaps are identified i inadequate fundamental exploration of nonlinear interaction and intervening mechanisms ii lack of application based conceptualization of maritime specific analytical frameworks and iii methodological limitations regarding data collection and quantitative analysis finally suggestions for future research are proposed including establishing an interlink net rather than only a linear chain to explore interactions among causal factors objectively investigating the effect of an intervention constructing maritime specific integrated models concerning the accident cause interlinkage and intervention applying specific methods in data collection in accordance with the potential and heterogeneity of hfs keywords maritime accident research human factor structured survey state quo future development 1 introduction despite continual improvements in maritime technology and safety management maritime accidents frequently occur with enormous damage to human beings and the environment according to lloyd s list intelligence casualty statistics 26 071 maritime accidents occurred during 2010 2019 951 of which were total loss accidents allianz global corporate and specialty 2020 among the numerous factors causing maritime accidents human factors hfs are a primary cause the european maritime safety agency 2019 revealed that 65 8 of the 4104 marine accidents occurring within the jurisdiction of member states of the european union during 2011 2018 were attributed to human actions trucco et al 2008 demonstrated that based on the data of 15 000 maritime accidents collected by lloyd s shipping information service 70 80 of accidents were caused by human related events and activities the aforementioned findings have spurred considerable research on hf related maritime accidents in web of science more than 400 papers from 1996 to the present can be found specifically publications related to hf related maritime accidents are increasing annually from an annual three or five papers in the past to approximately twenty per year at present for a better understanding of the state quo of research and for targeting future developments up to date literature reviews are required luo and shin 2019 conducted a comprehensive literature review of 522 papers for determining the development of maritime accident research in terms of research topics research methods data sources and publication information such as authors journals and disciplines goerlandt and montewka 2015 explored fundamental issues in maritime transportation risk analysis in terms of risk definitions risk perspectives and risk analysis approaches through a review of 58 publications from 1970 to 2014 despite the aforementioned literature reviews well structured reviews focused on hf related maritime accidents remain scarce with the following research areas meriting attention first a framework should be structured to profile relevant viewpoints and synthesize new developments second distinct features embedded in maritime specific accident research should be characterized third omissions and limitations of the current research should be revealed with a future research agenda proposed this paper has the following research objectives build an inventory of the main viewpoints adopted in hf related maritime accident research distinguish maritime specific hf related accident research from universal hf related accident research and provide new insights for academics exploring potential research questions the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the research design in section 3 a conceptual framework is generated to classify hf related accident models and applications for the maritime domain section 4 describes relevant research topics and similarities and differences among hf related maritime specific accident research and universal hf related accident research section 5 outlines a future research agenda section 6 provides the conclusion 2 research design a literature review can be conducted based on a normalized framework wee and banister 2016 highlighted the difference between a general overview and a critical review with added value general overviews are always pursued using a retrieval approach and emphasize classifications or associated statistical descriptions of general matters such as research topics authors journals and disciplines without specific added value by contrast critical reviews with a thematic approach provide added value in accordance to specific features of the targeted research area such as empirical insights gaps in the literature and research agendas relevance for real world applications or investigations of theories methodologies or conceptual models wee and banister 2016 this paper as a critical thematic review rather than a retrieving overview adopts the thematic perspective considering the main purpose in which the construction of a consolidating framework and the performance of an associated structural analysis are highlighted given the common understanding of the natural action sequence three core themes related to the occurrence of an accident namely cause occurrence and intervention are clarified thus a structured analytical framework is constructed around these three themes as follows first an empirical review of generic and maritime specific hf related accident research is conducted to produce a classification of related accident models and their application in the maritime domain second an investigation of different perspectives and viewpoints regarding the three main themes is undertaken to provide an explicit structured profile and a clear description of the commonalities and differences of diverse views in particular compared with the universal hf related accident research features distinct to maritime specific hf related accident research are identified finally future research directions with respect to fundamental conceptualization applied models and methodological issues are proposed this structured analysis elucidates how dependent and independent research elements are related and how conceptually associated frames are accordingly generated any theoretical or practical research usually starts with the generation of a scientific research problem and continues with the determination of the analytical logic by using suitable theory based research techniques research problem analytical logic and techniques can thus be regarded as the indispensable composition of any research research elements and their selection distinguishes studies from one another the present paper characterizes the current accident research by research problems analytical logic and techniques termed in this paper as focus perspective and methodology respectively table 1 moreover based on woo et al s methodology categories 2011 the methodology which is classified into qualitative and quantitative types in table 1 can be further elaborated into conceptual work math modeling statistical analysis experimental simulations case studies surveys and interviews in accordance with the accident research features the literature search was conducted mainly through web of science using the theme words of maritime or marine or ship or vessel or sea or ocean and accident or casualty or disaster and human 429 papers published before march 2020 were found after pre review a total of 152 articles were selected for further analysis based on the principle of relevance additionally more relevent papers have been supplemented from the scopus journal database due to the relatively small number of articles on hf related maritime accidents table 2 and fig 1 present the distribution of the sampled articles demonstrating the features of maritime hf related accident research as being nascent niche and cross disciplinary 3 a classification of hf related accident research the evolutional development of accidental research has resulted in a cornucopia of accident models explaining why accidents occur qureshi 2008 hollnagel 2002 classified accident models into three categories sequential epidemiological and systemic accidents concerning the relation between hf related causal factors and consequences human reliability analysis hra methods have been generated for specifically evaluating the factors affecting the performance of human operators and are useful for mitigating human errors zhou et al 2017 fig 2 demonstrates the evolution of hra models in fig 2 the evolution of hra methods has occurred in several phases in first generation hra such as the technique for human error rate prediction therp rook 1962 swain 1990 human cognitive reliability hcr hannaman et al 1985 and the human error assessment and reduction technique heart williams 1986 people with our inherent deficiencies naturally fail to perform tasks just as mechanical electrical or structural components do marseguerra et al 2007 the second generation such as a technique for human error analysis atheana cooper et al 1996 the cognitive reliability and error analysis method cream hollnagel 1998 and the connectionism assessment of human reliability cahr sträter 2000 put human error into the context as a critical factor in the accident and these methods tended to analyze the causes of errors from cognitive aspects di pasquale et al 2013 the newly developing hra models pay more attention to the dynamic interlinkage between causal factors and the influence of cognitive factors pan et al 2017 alvarenga and melo 2019 on the basis of the definition of research elements in section 2 table 3 presents the characteristic results of different generic hf related accident models revealing that i most models are interaction focused ii more than half of all models are retrospective iii most proposed models are suitable for qualitative analysis and iv few intervention focused models have been proposed these findings indicate that researchers consider the interaction among different hfs more often than only classifying causal factors in addition due to the irregularity and suddenness of accidents and the difficulty of accessing sufficient reliable data retrospective and qualitative perspectives tend to be adopted with a concurrent lack of intervention related research these models have been widely applied in numerous areas with substantial application in the maritime domain demonstrating similar traits in all respect as other accident research fig 3 however distinct features of maritime accidents identified as uncommonness and severity may distinguish maritime hf related accident research from universal hf related accident research this is fully explored in the next section 4 an examination of hf related accident research 4 1 identification of hf related causal factors on the basis of 17 papers exploring causal factors table 4 summarizes the research results regarding what causal factors are how they are structured and the associated research features the results in table 4 reveal that most hierarchical structures of causal factors are generated by generic models with a few exceptions of self classification among the models employed hfacs which was proposed by shappell and wiegmann 2000 and is based on the four level taxonomy of the swiss cheese model is the most common however other generic models such as tracer are also occasionally used hfacs is widely applied in maritime accident analysis not only because it provides a useful framework for clarifying the main human factors hierarchically but also because its classification can correspond to a certain extent to the human element common terms in resolution a 884 21 of the international maritime organization imo fig 4 presents their comparison generic hfacs has five layers external factors organizational influences unsafe supervision unsafe acts and preconditions for unsafe acts imo s classification also has five layers diminished human performance marine environment safety administration management and mental action although the classification criteria in the first layer differ the further specifications of causal factors are similar given their 92 overlap therefore applying the same classification scheme logic as imo adheres to provide a solid basis for the application of hfacs in the maritime area further review of the relevant literature revealed differences in the specification of causal factors under specific situations for instance celik and cebi 2009 divided personal factors into coordination communication planning factors and self imposed stress whereas zhang et al 2019 divided them into coordination communication planning factors personal readiness ship resource mismanagement communication and bridge resource management another example is organizational influence akhtar and utne 2014 divided organizational influences into safety culture training focus vessel certifications manning recourses and quality control chen et al 2013 divided causal factors only into resources management organizational climate and organizational process differences can also be seen in the case of environmental errors where zhang et al 2019 and akyuz 2017 have used technological environment and infrastructure but akyuz 2017 added another factor namely physical environment thus when considerable efforts have been made to produce situation based specifications of causal factors here many hfs are weakly defined with possibility of misinterpretation a class of research pertaining to categorizing causal factors in terms of the concise and normalize classification has been conducted navas de maya et al 2020 described good representation in overcoming the flaws of the existing taxonomy which used card sorting approach to generate higher level and simpler hf categories based on the european marine casualty information platform nomenclature to summarize factor identification focused models adopted in maritime accident analysis to identify causal hfs follow similar analytical logic and classification schemes as those of generic accident models and mainly concern the generation of a situation based classification that considers specific accident situations despite differences in the situation based specification of causal factors it is also critical to establish concise and normalized terminology for different causal hf categories that are applicable in different situations in this regard the human element common terms of the imo and nomenclature defined by maritime accident agencies are highly recommended 4 2 interaction among hf related causal factors compared with the two other research themes the interaction among hf related causal factors is the priority of current research table 5 presents a summary in table 5 the following findings are identified first most models applied for analyzing the interaction among causal factors are sequential according to hollnagel s classification philosophy 2002 in contrast to factor identification focused research where the hfacs model is intensively used most of the interaction focused models applied in universal accident analysis can be also used in the maritime domain including accimap akyuz 2015 lee et al 2017 bayesian network akhtar and utne 2014 zhang et al 2018 structural equation modeling hu et al 2019 and fault tree senol and sahin 2016 the only difference in these models is in the specification of the accident occurrence path second concerning the perspectives of studies retrospective studies have applied both qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate the occurrence of hf related accidents whereas prospective studies have tended to estimate the probability of human errors in maritime accidents by using quantitative methods in this regard fault tree analysis is frequently used in prospective analysis the hfacs model and accimap are often applied in retrospective analysis and the cream can be employed in both this pattern might be related to the research objective revealing the occurrence mechanism through retrospective analysis versus predicting risk through prospective analysis and research data availability qualitative description in an accident report versus quantitative data from statistics of individual studies in conclusion the interaction focused model adopted in maritime accident analysis is structurally similar to the factor identification focused model generic models should be made more specific to the maritime domain furthermore the deviation between the sequence based analytical approach and the complicated nonlinear relationships among causes behaviors and accidents emphasize that the nonlinear dynamics of causal factors should be considered 4 3 interventions against hf related accidents although relatively little research has been conducted in this direction a number of hf related maritime accident studies have examined the topic of intervention the summary of the relevant research is presented in table 6 three findings were detected first a conceptual analytical framework is lacking in intervention research on maritime accidents the review of 17 articles in table 6 demonstrated little correlation with the mainstream framework applied in universal intervention research table 7 second current intervention focused research in the maritime area mainly is related to describing specific intervention measures adopted in specific situations through case study in retrospective analysis or through conceptual reasoning in prospective analysis third most of the researches involve only two steps identifying risks and proposing intervention measures and strategies in table 6 five types of specific intervention measures are identified modifying organizational policies e g revising operation procedures and providing additional shore based support improving the technological environment e g equipping advanced supportive equipment strengthening supervision arranging training and education and establishing a corporate level safety culture these intervention measures have been considered from both social and technical perspectives in particular the gradual attempts to strengthen the technical intervention such as using a geographic information system that transmits water depth data gao et al 2013 applying an intelligent radar system and collision detection system al ramadhan et al 2017 and employing a timely reminder mechanism xu and wang 2020 to prevent maritime accidents implies a trend of intervening by redesigning the technical environment rather than simply focusing on individual and organization orientated intervention in conclusion compared with factor identification focused and interaction focused models intervention related research in the maritime domain is scant more structured rigorous research is required 5 discussion the review of hf related maritime accident research suggested research gaps including fundamental exploration of nonlinear interaction and intervening mechanisms application based conceptualization of a maritime specific analytical framework and methodological exploration

viewpoints on diverse topics that are currently dispersed by clarifying the distinct features associated with maritime specific accident research in terms of the three critical accident elements of course interaction and intervention and by proposing novel areas of future research concerning fundamental applied and methodological aspects several important findings which might have been implied but not explicitly stated in previous studies have been clearly illustrated hfacs is the most commonly used model in factor identification focused studies compared with other hra methods hf related causal factors classification should account for specific maritime accident situations and use concise and normalized terminology in interaction focused research most generic models can be used in the maritime domain in accordance with maritime specific features sequential accident models is the most common in interaction focused studies revealing that nonlinear dynamics of causal factors have been neglected the intervention related studies only propose intervention measures implying the lack of a conceptual analytical framework in the few existing intervention related studies and the negligence of observing the target behavior and assessing the intervention effectiveness other research gaps include application based conceptualization of maritime specific frameworks and methodological exploration of data collection and quantitative analysis accordingly in fundamental research researchers are advised to establish an interlink net rather than only a linear chain to fully explore the interaction among causal factors the effects of an intervention specifically on causal factors or target behaviors should be studied rather than determining an approximate relationship between an intervention and accident occurrence in applied research integrated models concerning the three critical accident elements cause interaction and intervention should be examined in accordance with features specific to the maritime domain to improve our understanding of their corresponding relationships in terms of methodology to improve data analyzability imo s human element common terms should be applied as uniform terminology specific methods are required to reveal the potential heterogeneity of expert knowledge and simulation experiments should be employed in more applications this highly structured study provides a clear classification of diverse views on critical topics and can serve as a crucial reference for scholars and practitioners however because it adopted a more synthetic approach of what is already known rather than an extensive thematic investigation it has limitations such as the lack of detailed elaboration on any one specific theme in other words this study provided an overview of hf related maritime accident research rather than elucidating specific individual problems such as navas de maya et al 2020 who thoroughly examined the literature to establish a concise and normalized classification of causal factors critical issues that warrant comprehensive study include concise and normalized hf identification network structured hf interaction and intervention effectiveness assessment acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 71573172 many thanks also to associate professor shanshan fu
