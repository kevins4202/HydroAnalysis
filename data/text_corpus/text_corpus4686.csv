23430,a proper buoyancy load formulation that complements the continuum formulation with incorporated beam theory in geometrically nonlinear analysis of flexible marine risers is presented for continuous riser pipes the hydrostatic pressure field only covers the circumferential surfaces thus hindering the buoyancy load approach the present buoyancy load formulation is based on a vector calculus approach and essentially agrees with the well known effective tension concept in the direct beam formulation the gradient version of the divergence theorem gvdt is employed onto a continuous pipe segment subjected to circumferential hydrostatic pressure the application of the gvdt results in the body force and cross sectional surface traction which are regarded as the buoyancy load and boundary effect respectively emphasis is placed on the consequences of the boundary effect and the load definition of the buoyancy load in geometrically nonlinear analysis the boundary effect occurs if either boundary end of the pipe system were uncapped further consequences of the boundary effect depends on the corresponding restraining locations and directions furthermore the buoyancy load is ascertained to have weak nonlinearity hence the derivation of the augmented tangent stiffness matrix is deemed unnecessary finite element formulation of the corresponding external nodal load vectors is also presented using the isoparametric beam elements for discretization keywords buoyancy hydrostatic pressure marine riser geometrically nonlinear analysis effective tension 1 introduction flexible marine risers are slender pipes installed in the seawater for ocean engineering applications some engineering aspects of flexible marine risers include design optimization chen et al 2016 and stress analysis tang et al 2015 owing to a high degree of flexibility flexible marine risers may undergo large displacement which necessitates geometrically nonlinear analysis previous works yazdchi and crisfield 2002a 2002b kordkheili et al 2011 aguiar et al 2015 bernitsas et al 1985 chucheepsakul et al 2003 monprapussorn et al 2007 athisakul et al 2011 mcnamara et al 1988 which considered geometrical nonlinearity were based on the definition of a large displacement small strain analysis here the notion of small strain is adopted according to the finite element method bathe 1996 bathe et al 1975 and should not be confused with the consideration of the finite axial strain tensor in the works chucheepsakul et al 2003 monprapussorn et al 2007 athisakul et al 2011 the aforementioned works can be generally classified into two groups according to the formulation approach the first group bernitsas et al 1985 chucheepsakul et al 2003 monprapussorn et al 2007 athisakul et al 2011 mcnamara et al 1988 employed euler bernoulli beam theory as the formulation basis internal forces in the riser pipe such as axial tensile force due to top tensioning effect were directly included in a differential beam element conservation of momentum was enforced based on the established differential beam element appropriate geometric and constitutive relations were thereby used to convert the boundary value problem from force based into displacement based since physical effects can be accounted directly through the differential beam element such approach is termed as direct beam formulation in this paper on the other hand the second group yazdchi and crisfield 2002a 2002b kordkheili et al 2011 aguiar et al 2015 employed continuum mechanics and or finite beam theories as the formulation basis conservation of momentum was enforced in a continuum mechanics setting through appropriate stress and strain definitions in the continuum mechanics setting mechanical forces due to physical effects would be treated as either body forces or surface tractions finite beam theories or their corresponding finite element implementation were thereupon employed to define kinematics and constitutive behavior of the riser pipe as a result the boundary value problem was converted from stress based into displacement based such approach is termed as continuum formulation with incorporated beam theory in this paper in this regard one of the key differences between both formulation approaches is how forces are incorporated amongst others hydrostatic effect is essential in the ocean environment hence a proper incorporation of hydrostatic pressure force in a large displacement context is vital for riser analysis in the large displacement context hydrostatic pressure force should be defined and incorporated in the geometrically nonlinear formulation as follower surface traction for instance augmented tangent stiffness matrices due to linearization of the external virtual work were derived in several finite element literature for pressure follower force hibbit 1979 schweizerhof and ramm 1984 kreja and cywiński 1991 rumpel and schweizerhof 2003 2004 hassler and schweizerhof 2008 for marine risers with extensive spatial domain however evaluation of the hydrostatic pressure force as follower surface traction is computationally cumbersome regardless of the formulation approach in particular the aforementioned works yazdchi and crisfield 2002a 2002b kordkheili et al 2011 aguiar et al 2015 bernitsas et al 1985 chucheepsakul et al 2003 monprapussorn et al 2007 athisakul et al 2011 mcnamara et al 1988 had employed an alternative method which is termed in this paper as the buoyancy load approach archimedes principle to account for the hydrostatic pressure force nevertheless an important limitation of the buoyancy load approach is that the hydrostatic pressure field surrounding the body of interest must be entirely closed for continuous riser pipes the hydrostatic pressure field only covers the circumferential surfaces as shown in fig 1 and is therefore not entirely closed consequently the buoyancy load approach cannot be applied for riser analysis unless the above limitation is properly addressed in the associated formulation such limitation had been properly overcome in the direct beam formulation through a well known method known as the effective tension concept chucheepsakul et al 2003 sparks 2007 the effective tension concept emerged from an intentional introduction of fictitiously equal but opposite hydrostatic pressure forces onto cross sectional segments of the differential beam element superposition of all hydrostatic pressure forces acting on the differential beam element would give rise to a closed hydrostatic pressure field and axial force thus allowing the buoyancy load approach to be valid the effective tension at a particular position of the riser pipe is thereby defined as the sum of the internal axial tensile force due to top tensioning effect and the axial force due to buoyancy load approach whilst the validity of the buoyancy load approach had been justified in the direct beam formulation there had not been a clear method on how the buoyancy load approach can be made valid in the continuum formulation with incorporated beam theory a hypothetical attempt on this quest is to employ the effective tension concept from the former approach however the effective tension concept cannot be directly applied in the continuum formulation with incorporated beam theory since the effective tension concept stems from the force based differential beam element setting the method appears as a built in feature unique to the direct beam formulation only furthermore it is not clear how the theory of superposition accustomed to the differential beam element setting can be equivalently applied in a continuum mechanics setting likewise the notions of axial tensile force or effective tension were understandably not adopted in works that employed the continuum formulation with incorporated beam theory due to the general purpose approach for describing the mechanics for evidence in the aforementioned works yazdchi and crisfield 2002a 2002b kordkheili et al 2011 aguiar et al 2015 the hydrostatic pressure force had been computed as buoyancy load without further justification on the corresponding validity in particular kordkheili et al 2011 mentioned that the computation of hydrostatic pressure force as buoyancy load was an approximation therefore it is evident that the degree of approximation will remain unknown in the continuum formulation with incorporated beam theory without a proper method that makes the buoyancy load approach valid in general forces can vary in magnitude and or direction as the body of interest undergoes large displacement thus the corresponding definition such as whether the loading is nonlinear is vital for computational purpose by comparing the respective buoyancy load formulations among yazdchi and crisfield 2002a 2002b kordkheili et al 2011 aguiar et al 2015 the definition of buoyancy load was in a complete disagreement while yazdchi and crisfield 2002a 2002b partitioned the buoyancy load into several follower components kordkheili et al 2011 and aguiar et al 2015 thought that the buoyancy load should remain vertically upward in direction in spite of that the magnitude of the buoyancy load was defined differently between kordkheili et al 2011 and aguiar et al 2015 in which configuration dependent and configuration independent definitions were respectively employed the above discrepancies suggest that a proper buoyancy load formulation that complements the continuum formulation with incorporated theory is necessary to establish an appropriate definition for buoyancy load in geometrically nonlinear analysis the contributions of this paper are essentially twofold firstly a buoyancy load formulation that is valid for the continuum formulation with incorporated beam theory is presented secondly through the established buoyancy load formulation the definition of buoyancy load in geometrically nonlinear analysis is investigated a novel vector calculus approach inspired by lima 2011 is employed for the present buoyancy load formulation using the gradient version of the divergence theorem gvdt lima showed that a closed surface integral of pressure field can be transformed into a volume integral of pressure gradient in this regard the idea of constructing a closed surface integral is exploited in this paper by means of superposition or addition of surface integrals with non overlapping limits as a result the application of the gvdt for continuous riser pipes essentially agrees with the superposition methodology in the effective tension concept since the formulation is based on a vector calculus approach the corresponding implementation is suitable for finite element discretization using continuum finite elements or structural finite elements furthermore emphasis is placed on the consequences of employing the buoyancy load approach in geometrically nonlinear analysis of flexible marine risers which have not been reported in the literature this paper continues in section 2 with the buoyancy load formulation in the buoyancy load formulation the gvdt is employed onto a continuous pipe segment subjected to circumferential hydrostatic pressure following that the geometrically nonlinear finite element formulation for the buoyancy load and the boundary effect are given in section 3 a few numerical examples are worked and verified against the literature in section 4 discussion on the practical consideration of the boundary effect is presented along with the examples the main findings are summarized and concluded in section 5 2 buoyancy load formulation in the present work the following aspects are considered in the buoyancy load formulation i both internal and external hydrostatic pressure forces are considered and they are in static equilibrium with the pipe material however the fluid can be either compressible or incompressible ii both curved and straight pipe geometries are allowed ii the atmospheric specific weight is considered to be relatively negligible therefore the status of the pipe is either fully submerged or partially submerged also either fully filled or partially filled iv the boundary ends of the pipe system can be either capped or uncapped the end surfaces of the intermediate continuous pipe segments are always uncapped v for clarity the formulation is presented in the continuous form the discrete form is given in the corresponding finite element formulation 2 1 buoyancy load formulation using the gvdt consider a fully submerged curved pipe segment containing internal fluid as shown in fig 2 both internal and external circumferential walls of the pipe segment are subjected to the hydrostatic pressure force for the external fluid column the closed surface s e is defined as s e a s e b where s e a is the external circumferential surface and s e b is the external cross sectional surface moreover s e a s e a since these surfaces are non overlapping surface traction due to the external hydrostatic pressure at time l is given by 1 f e l s e a l p e l n a l d s e a l where n a l is the outward unit normal vector to the circumferential surface at time l and p e l is the external hydrostatic pressure at time l the introduction of the time notation l in the above integral is significant since in the geometrically nonlinear analysis the deformation of a continuum is conventionally addressed through the change of configuration in time bathe 1996 bathe et al 1975 addition of cross sectional surface integrals that cancel out each other into eq 1 gives 2 f e l s e a l p e l n a l d s e a l s e b l p e l n b l d s e b l s e b l p e l n b l d s e b l where n b l is the outward unit normal vector to the cross sectional surface at time l a graphical representation of the superposition method used in arriving at eq 2 is provided in fig 2 since the parenthesized terms in eq 2 form a closed surface integral the gvdt can be applied to these terms leading to 3 f e l s e l p e l n l d l s e s e b l p e l n b l d s e b l v e l p e l d v e l s e b l p e l n b l d s e b l where n l is the outward unit normal vector to the external fluid column surface at time l and v e l is the external fluid column volume at time l for fluid statics the governing ordinary differential equation is given by munson et al 2013 4 p γ e z 0 or d p d z γ where p is the hydrostatic pressure γ is the fluid specific weight and e z is the cartesian unit vector in the vertically upward direction substitution of the pressure gradient from eq 4 into the volume integral in eq 2 1 gives 5 f e l v e l γ e l d v e l e z s e b l p e l n b l d s e b l where γ e l is the external fluid specific weight at time l following the same derivation the surface traction due to internal hydrostatic pressure at time l is given by 6 f i l v i l γ i l d v i l e z s i b l p i l n b l d s i b l where γ i l is the internal fluid specific weight at time l v i l is the internal fluid column volume at time l p i l is the internal hydrostatic pressure at time l and s i b l is the internal cross sectional surface at time l in comparison to eq 5 there are negative signs in eq 6 due to the orientation of the internal hydrostatic pressure note that the left superscript l on γ e l and γ e l indicates that for compressible fluid the fluid specific weight is a function of the pipe s z position at time l however the notation does not imply that the fluid specific weight at a given point changes with time which obviously implies fluid dynamics for an incompressible fluid the notations γ e and γ i are used instead the resultant surface traction at time l due to both internal and external hydrostatic pressure is thus given by 7 f s l f e l f i l f 1 l f 2 l in which 8 f 1 l v e l γ e l d v e l v i l γ i l d v i l e z 9 f 2 l s e b l p e l n b l d s e b l s i b l p i l n b l d s i b l where f 1 l is the resultant body force at time l which points vertically upward if the component is positive and f 2 l is the resultant cross sectional surface traction at time l 2 2 partially submerged filled pipe segment strictly speaking a partially submerged pipe segment is subjected to both atmospheric hydrostatic pressure and liquid hydrostatic pressure the gvdt can be applied by introducing cross sectional surface integrals that cancel out each other at the fluid interface lima 2011 following the same procedure the resultant body forces due to atmospheric pressure and hydrostatic pressure are obtained separately as shown in fig 3 since the specific weight of air is relatively small the atmospheric component of the resultant body force for the unsubmerged region is neglected hereinafter the same methodology is applied for a partially filled pipe segment 2 3 the boundary effect of the riser pipe system the resultant body force in eq 8 is known as the buoyancy load while the resultant cross sectional surface traction in eq 9 can be interpreted as the boundary effect when employing the buoyancy load approach the boundary effect was not considered in the previous works yazdchi and crisfield 2002a 2002b kordkheili et al 2011 aguiar et al 2015 the boundary effect can be viewed from two perspectives of which both would produce the same understanding the first perspective is that for each pipe segment the resultant cross sectional surface traction would be canceled off with the resultant cross sectional surface traction of the neighbouring pipe segments when the riser pipe system is assembled therefore only the resultant cross sectional surface traction at the boundaries of the riser pipe system would appear the second perspective is to directly view the riser pipe system as a whole similarly the resultant cross sectional surface traction appears at the boundaries of the riser pipe system only the resultant cross sectional surface traction is also related to the effective tension concept in the direct beam formulation chucheepsakul et al 2003 sparks 2007 considering the force equilibrium for a differential beam element the resultant cross sectional surface traction is added to the internal axial tensile force thus leading to the effective tension concept in the continuum formulation with incorporated beam theory the resultant cross sectional surface traction is interpreted straightforwardly as the applied force if the boundaries of the riser pipe system were both capped the boundary effect would not appear in the first place because the hydrostatic pressure field gives rise to a closed surface integral fig 3 illustrates a few examples of such a situation for riser pipes supported at the seabed there is also the need for the hydrostatic pressure field to act upon the capped end for the boundary effect to be absent on the other hand the boundary effect exists when either boundary of the riser pipe system is uncapped this is the most common case for marine risers during drilling and production operations furthermore the riser pipe system is usually supported at the boundary ends by excluding the boundary effect the static profile of the riser can still be correctly predicted due to the restraint of motions at the boundary ends however the support reactions may be incorrectly calculated for example consider a perfectly vertical submerged pipe system in static equilibrium as shown in fig 4 both boundary ends are uncapped and clamped in the actual situation there is no resultant force from the external hydrostatic pressure field acting upon the external circumferential walls using the buoyancy load approach the corresponding boundary effect must be considered to achieve the correct support reactions it is worth mentioning that for the case where the top boundary end of the riser pipe system is located above the seawater level the cross sectional surface traction at the top boundary end is relatively negligible therefore in this case only the cross sectional surface traction at the bottom boundary end is significant in addition the cross sectional surface traction always remains normal to the cross sectional surface viz tangential to the pipe as a result the evaluation of the cross sectional surface traction at the boundaries of the riser pipe system also depends on the restraining locations and directions in essence the consequences of the boundary effect vary from case to case the general rule of thumb is to employ the gvdt such that the resulting load model is equivalent to the resultant force from the actual hydrostatic pressure field 2 4 definition of the buoyancy load in geometrically nonlinear analysis according to eq 7 the notion of buoyancy load does not include the self weight of the pipe material the self weight of the submerged body is normally displayed in a fluid mechanics text to introduce the buoyancy concept see for example munson et al 2013 separation of the self weight from the buoyancy load is important because the respective load definitions are different in particular due to the conservation of mass throughout deformation bathe 1996 the self weight is a vertically downward force with configuration independent integrand function on the other hand the buoyancy load i e the resultant body force in eq 8 is a constant directional force with configuration dependent integrand function nevertheless the associated nonlinearity for the buoyancy load is weak because the force direction is constant throughout deformation in other words the buoyancy load can be approximated as a nonfollower force i e a constant directional force with configuration independent integrand function for example the nonfollower force definition was adopted by aguiar et al 2015 and an accurate result was achieved as mentioned before the riser pipe system is often restrained for motions at the boundary ends where the boundary effect appears in this case the advantage of using the buoyancy load approach is that the follower hydrostatic pressure force can be evaluated in an easier way 3 finite element formulation the present buoyancy load formulation is incorporated in the large displacement small strain analysis of flexible marine risers the isoparametric beam elements bathe 1996 dvorkin et al 1988 almeida 1980 also known as the degenerated continuum elements or degenerated isoparametric elements are employed for finite element discretization the nodes are located along the element centroidal axis at each node there are six three translational three rotational degrees of freedom and two orthonormal vectors defined with respect to the stationary global cartesian coordinates x y and z the geometry and the dependent variables are interpolated in term of the usual isoparametric coordinates r s and t in practice the number of nodes per element may range from 2 to 4 depending on the one dimensional lagrange interpolation bathe 1996 the cross sectional shape can be either rectangular or annular here the latter is used see fig 5 the beam deformation hypotheses are given such that bathe 1996 dvorkin et al 1988 i plane cross section remains plane after deformation and ii a straight line normal to the centroidal axis remains straight after deformation but may not necessarily remain normal to the centroidal axis after deformation timoshenko beam theory can be incorporated as a result of the beam deformation hypotheses the small strain condition is implied dvorkin et al 1988 the linear elastic constitutive relationship is employed in the present work as shown in fig 5 the beam deformation behavior is considered using five local components of the green lagrange strain tensor and the second piola kirchhoff stress tensor respectively bathe 1996 dvorkin et al 1988 yoon and lee 2014 finite element formulation for the isoparametric beam elements had been detailed in dvorkin et al 1988 the work by yoon and lee 2014 is also an excellent reference for the formulation details in this work the total lagrangian formulation is employed in the following the focus is dedicated towards the formulation of the external nodal load vector due to the buoyancy load and the cross sectional surface traction the notation used herein follows closely with the standard convention bathe 1996 dvorkin et al 1988 almeida 1980 yoon and lee 2014 3 1 external nodal load vector due to the buoyancy load for a fully submerged and fully filled isoparametric beam element the external nodal load vector due to the buoyancy load at time t δ t is given by 10 r b t δ t v e t δ t h t f e d v e t δ t v i t δ t h t f i d v i t δ t in which 11 f e 0 0 γ e t δ t e z t f i 0 0 γ i t δ t e z t where h is the interpolation matrix for the linear component of the incremental displacement dvorkin et al 1988 yoon and lee 2014 for an isoparametric beam element with uniform cross section the volume integrals in eq 10 can be simplified into a line integral by noting that the cross sectional area remains undeformed due to the beam deformation hypotheses in such a case eq 10 becomes 12 r b t δ t ℓ t δ t h s 0 t 0 t f b d ℓ t δ t with f b 0 0 γ e t δ t a e γ i t δ t a i e z t where ℓ t δ t is the element length at time t δ t and a e and a i are the external and internal cross sectional areas respectively as noted before γ e t δ t and γ i t δ t can be understood as γ e and γ i respectively for an incompressible fluid for a partially submerged or partially filled isoparametric beam element the fluid specific weight is a piecewise defined function which makes evaluation of the external nodal load vector difficult an alternative solution is to assign nodal distribution coefficients to the external nodal load vector of a fully submerged or fully filled isoparametric beam element a more general expression of the external nodal load vector due to the buoyancy load for a q noded isoparametric beam element is given by 13 r b t δ t 0 α k 1 r b k 1 e z 0 α k q r b k q e z t with α k λ k μ k where r b k 1 is the buoyancy load at node k for a fully submerged case α k is the distribution factor for node k λ k is the magnitude allocation factor for node k and μ k is the lagrange interpolation factor for node k during numerical implementation eq 13 can be calculated separately for the internal fluid and external fluid as to distinguish between the degree of submergence and degree of internal fluid occupation respectively in general α k 1 for the fully submerged or fully filled case 0 α k 1 for the partially submerged or partially filled case and α k 0 for the unsubmerged or unfilled case the nodal distribution coefficients for partially submerged isoparametric beam elements with q 2 3 and 4 equally spaced nodes are given in table 1 note that the node numbering sequence in table 1 follows the convention given in fig 6 viz the node at the far submerged end is the first node as mentioned before the associated nonlinearity for the buoyancy load is weak as the force direction remains constant throughout deformation therefore the augmented tangent stiffness matrix for buoyancy load is not derived and the external nodal load vector due to the buoyancy load at time t δ t can be approximated as 14 r b t δ t r b t 3 2 idealization of the cross sectional surface traction as nodal point load vector since the cross sectional surface traction occurs at the boundary ends of the riser pipe system only the isoparametric beam elements at the boundary ends are involved evaluation of the cross sectional surface traction using the surface integral definition in eq 9 becomes challenging when the hydrostatic pressure field is distributed nonuniformly across the cross sectional surface the diameter of a marine riser is normally small relative to the pipe length hence the hydrostatic pressure variation across the cross sectional surface can be neglected in this work the cross sectional surface traction is idealized as a nodal point load vector the nodal point load vector due to the cross sectional surface traction at node k is given by 15 r t k t δ t p e k t δ t a e k p i k t δ t a i k n b k t δ t with n b k t δ t v s k t δ t v t k t δ t where v s k t δ t and v s k t δ t are the two orthonormal vectors of the element node k at time t δ t from the isoparametric beam element point of view the nodal point load vector due to the cross sectional surface traction is a follower tangential load in this work the corresponding augmented tangent stiffness matrix is not derived and the nodal point load vector due to the cross sectional surface traction at time t δ t can be approximated as 16 r t k t δ t r t k t 4 numerical examples the present buoyancy load formulation is applied to a few benchmark problems for verification purpose particular emphasis is placed on the boundary effect in the numerical implementation the integrals required by the finite element matrices and vectors are evaluated using gauss legendre quadrature for the q noded isoparametric beam element the corresponding volume integrals are evaluated using q 1 gauss points along the element axis bathe 1996 two gauss points along the element radial axis and eight gauss points along the element circumferential axis respectively 4 1 fully submerged cantilevered pipe with both ends capped as shown in fig 7 the example concerns static analysis of a fully submerged cantilevered pipe with both ends capped at a water depth of 100 m the cantilevered pipe is allowed to undergo large displacement the problem was proposed by yazdchi and crisfield 2002a 2002b and worked by kordkheili et al 2011 and aguiar et al 2015 the problem has been well designed such that the deeply submerged pipe will always be subjected to external hydrostatic pressure during deformation according to the present buoyancy load formulation there is no boundary effect as both ends of the pipe system are capped in a two dimensional static analysis the fully submerged cantilevered pipe is subjected to its self weight buoyancy load due to external hydrostatic pressure and a vertical point load at the tip p z 3 10 4 n eight 4 noded isoparametric beam elements are employed for discretization of the pipe a summary of the problem definition is given in table 2 fig 8 shows the deformed geometry of the pipe for different loading conditions as shown in the figure the present work is in good agreement with yazdchi and crisfield 2002a and aguiar et al 2015 a third set of data from the results of kordkheili et al 2011 is also provided in the same figure although the buoyancy load calculation and the finite element are the same for both works there are some differences in the results comparison due to the proposed linearization in kordkheili et al 2011 as mentioned before aguiar et al 2015 employed the nonfollower force definition for the buoyancy load to investigate the good agreement between aguiar et al 2015 and present work a separate calculation is made with the buoyancy load evaluated as a nonfollower force fig 9 shows the comparison between the results of this calculation and the original calculation an excellent agreement between the configuration dependent integrand function model and the nonfollower force model is observed the norm of the displacement difference between the two buoyancy load models is reported to be 10 5 m this evidence confirms that the buoyancy load can be approximated accurately as nonfollower force in addition a three dimensional static analysis considering self weight buoyancy load due to external hydrostatic pressure and point loads at the tip p z p y 3 10 4 n is performed the purpose of this analysis is to further verify the present buoyancy load formulation using linearly interpolated isoparametric beam elements in particular the results using twenty 2 noded isoparametric beam elements and eight 4 noded isoparametric beam elements are compared fig 10 shows the in plane and out of deformed geometry of the pipe for both meshes as shown in the figure both meshes produce results that are in a good agreement with yazdchi and crisfield 2002b furthermore it is interesting to note that yazdchi and crisfield s interpretation led to the derivation of the augmented tangent stiffness matrix for buoyancy load in the present buoyancy load formulation the derivation of the augmented tangent stiffness matrix for the buoyancy load is deemed unnecessary because of the weak nonlinearity associated with the buoyancy load definition 4 2 fully submerged cantilevered pipe with the cantilevered end uncapped the two dimensional static analysis of the fully submerged cantilevered pipe in the previous example is now repeated by considering the cantilevered end as uncapped in particular the up ward loading with buoyancy load case is demonstrated according to the present buoyancy load formulation the boundary effect occurs at the cantilevered end due to the restraint of motions at the cantilevered end the static profile remains the same as the previous example however the support reactions are different as reported in table 3 in this example there is a horizontal reaction at the cantilevered end due to the boundary effect the consequence of the boundary effect may seem trivial in this example however the accuracy of the support reactions is crucial for a proper design of the riser system particularly the foundation and anchoring system it is re emphasized herein that the consequences of the boundary effect associated with the uncapped boundary ends depend on the locations and restraining directions of the supports 4 3 riser subjected to steady current as shown in fig 11 the example concerns static analysis of a vertical riser and an inclined riser subjected to steady current the problem was introduced by yazdchi and crisfield 2002a both internal hydrostatic pressure and external hydrostatic pressure are considered in the analysis the risers are tensioned at the top end while pinned at the seabed it was not mentioned clearly if the boundary ends were capped or uncapped it is common for the top tensioned end to be uncapped nevertheless even if the boundary effect exists at the top end the specific weight of the external fluid is relatively negligible and the internal hydrostatic pressure is zero similarly the bottom end is pinned hence the static profile remains the same whether the boundary effect occurs at the bottom end in this analysis the risers are subjected to self weight buoyancy load due to external hydrostatic pressure and internal hydrostatic pressure follower tangential top tension force with constant magnitude and follower current load with a steady horizontal velocity of 1 m s or 2 m s a summary of the problem definition is given in table 4 a hundred load increments are employed here a total of thirty four 2 noded isoparametric beam elements are used for discretization in particular the initially unsubmerged domain is discretized using four isoparametric beam elements each with 5 m in length yazdchi and crisfield 2002a employed the master slave technique for the follower tangential top tension force to account for the change of riser s top end position during deformation here a simplification is made such that the follower tangential top tension force is always applied at the riser s top end furthermore the riser s top end is allowed to slide in the vertical direction fig 12 and fig 13 show deformed geometries of the vertical riser and the inclined riser respectively for different current velocities overall good agreement is observed between present work and yazdchi and crisfield 2002a a slight disagreement appears at the riser s top end region due to difference in the top tension force modelling in essence the good agreement further justifies the present buoyancy load formulation 5 conclusions a proper buoyancy load formulation that complements the continuum formulation with incorporated beam theory in geometrically nonlinear analysis of flexible marine risers has been presented employing the gvdt onto a continuous pipe segment subjected to circumferential hydrostatic pressure the buoyancy load approach is only justified if the associated boundary effect is properly considered the present buoyancy load formulation essentially follows the effective tension concept in the direct beam formulation the boundary effect is implicitly considered via the effective tension concept in the continuum formulation with incorporated beam theory the boundary effect is interpreted straightforwardly as the applied force in addition finite element formulation for the buoyancy load and boundary effect is presented the isoparametric beam elements are employed for finite element discretization a few numerical examples are also worked and verified against the literature the boundary effect occurs if either boundary end of the riser pipe system were uncapped furthermore the consequences of the boundary effect generally depends on the type of supports location of supports and restraining directions at the boundary ends for instance the boundary effect does not affect the static profile of a marine riser with proper restraints at both boundary ends however in such situation the boundary effect should be considered when the support reactions are evaluated the support reactions are important for a proper design of the foundation and anchoring system since the actual conditions of a marine pipe system can be sophisticated the general rule of thumb is to ensure that the gvdt is properly applied such that the use of the buoyancy load approach is justified as marine risers are usually restrained at both boundary ends the buoyancy load approach is computationally favourable because the associated nonlinearity is weak it is ascertained that the approximate evaluation of the buoyancy load as nonfollower force is highly accurate therefore the derivation of the augmented tangent stiffness matrix for buoyancy load is deemed unnecessary acknowledgement the authors are deeply grateful towards dr kyungho yoon the first author of yoon and lee 2014 for his

stress analysis tang et al 2015 owing to a high degree of flexibility flexible marine risers may undergo large displacement which necessitates geometrically nonlinear analysis previous works yazdchi and crisfield 2002a 2002b kordkheili et al 2011 aguiar et al 2015 bernitsas et al 1985 chucheepsakul et al 2003 monprapussorn et al 2007 athisakul et al 2011 mcnamara et al 1988 which considered geometrical nonlinearity were based on the definition of a large displacement small strain analysis here the notion of small strain is adopted according to the finite element method bathe 1996 bathe et al 1975 and should not be confused with the consideration of the finite axial strain tensor in the works chucheepsakul et al 2003 monprapussorn et al 2007 athisakul et al 2011 the aforementioned works can be generally classified into two groups according to the formulation approach the first group bernitsas et al 1985 chucheepsakul et al 2003 monprapussorn et al 2007 athisakul et al 2011 mcnamara et al 1988 employed euler bernoulli beam theory as the formulation basis internal forces in the riser pipe such as axial tensile force due to top tensioning effect were directly included in a differential beam element conservation of momentum was enforced based on the established differential beam element appropriate geometric and constitutive relations were thereby used to convert the boundary value problem from force based into displacement based since physical effects can be accounted directly through the differential beam element such approach is termed as direct beam formulation in this paper on the other hand the second group yazdchi and crisfield 2002a 2002b kordkheili et al 2011 aguiar et al 2015 employed continuum mechanics and or finite beam theories as the formulation basis conservation of momentum was enforced in a continuum mechanics setting through appropriate stress and strain definitions in the continuum mechanics setting mechanical forces due to physical effects would be treated as either body forces or surface tractions finite beam theories or their corresponding finite element implementation were thereupon employed to define kinematics and constitutive behavior of the riser pipe as a result the boundary value problem was converted from stress based into displacement based such approach is termed as continuum formulation with incorporated beam theory in this paper in this regard one of the key differences between both formulation approaches is how forces are incorporated amongst others hydrostatic effect is essential in the ocean environment hence a proper incorporation of hydrostatic pressure force in a large displacement context is vital for riser analysis in the large displacement context hydrostatic pressure force should be defined and incorporated in the geometrically nonlinear formulation as follower surface traction for instance augmented tangent stiffness matrices due to linearization of the external virtual work were derived in several finite element literature for pressure follower force hibbit 1979 schweizerhof and ramm 1984 kreja and cywiński 1991 rumpel and schweizerhof 2003 2004 hassler and schweizerhof 2008 for marine risers with extensive spatial domain however evaluation of the hydrostatic pressure force as follower surface traction is computationally cumbersome regardless of the formulation approach in particular the aforementioned works yazdchi and crisfield 2002a 2002b kordkheili et al 2011 aguiar et al 2015 bernitsas et al 1985 chucheepsakul et al 2003 monprapussorn et al 2007 athisakul et al 2011 mcnamara et al 1988 had employed an alternative method which is termed in this paper as the buoyancy load approach archimedes principle to account for the hydrostatic pressure force nevertheless an important limitation of the buoyancy load approach is that the hydrostatic pressure field surrounding the body of interest must be entirely closed for continuous riser pipes the hydrostatic pressure field only covers the circumferential surfaces as shown in fig 1 and is therefore not entirely closed consequently the buoyancy load approach cannot be applied for riser analysis unless the above limitation is properly addressed in the associated formulation such limitation had been properly overcome in the direct beam formulation through a well known method known as the effective tension concept chucheepsakul et al 2003 sparks 2007 the effective tension concept emerged from an intentional introduction of fictitiously equal but opposite hydrostatic pressure forces onto cross sectional segments of the differential beam element superposition of all hydrostatic pressure forces acting on the differential beam element would give rise to a closed hydrostatic pressure field and axial force thus allowing the buoyancy load approach to be valid the effective tension at a particular position of the riser pipe is thereby defined as the sum of the internal axial tensile force due to top tensioning effect and the axial force due to buoyancy load approach whilst the validity of the buoyancy load approach had been justified in the direct beam formulation there had not been a clear method on how the buoyancy load approach can be made valid in the continuum formulation with incorporated beam theory a hypothetical attempt on this quest is to employ the effective tension concept from the former approach however the effective tension concept cannot be directly applied in the continuum formulation with incorporated beam theory since the effective tension concept stems from the force based differential beam element setting the method appears as a built in feature unique to the direct beam formulation only furthermore it is not clear how the theory of superposition accustomed to the differential beam element setting can be equivalently applied in a continuum mechanics setting likewise the notions of axial tensile force or effective tension were understandably not adopted in works that employed the continuum formulation with incorporated beam theory due to the general purpose approach for describing the mechanics for evidence in the aforementioned works yazdchi and crisfield 2002a 2002b kordkheili et al 2011 aguiar et al 2015 the hydrostatic pressure force had been computed as buoyancy load without further justification on the corresponding validity in particular kordkheili et al 2011 mentioned that the computation of hydrostatic pressure force as buoyancy load was an approximation therefore it is evident that the degree of approximation will remain unknown in the continuum formulation with incorporated beam theory without a proper method that makes the buoyancy load approach valid in general forces can vary in magnitude and or direction as the body of interest undergoes large displacement thus the corresponding definition such as whether the loading is nonlinear is vital for computational purpose by comparing the respective buoyancy load formulations among yazdchi and crisfield 2002a 2002b kordkheili et al 2011 aguiar et al 2015 the definition of buoyancy load was in a complete disagreement while yazdchi and crisfield 2002a 2002b partitioned the buoyancy load into several follower components kordkheili et al 2011 and aguiar et al 2015 thought that the buoyancy load should remain vertically upward in direction in spite of that the magnitude of the buoyancy load was defined differently between kordkheili et al 2011 and aguiar et al 2015 in which configuration dependent and configuration independent definitions were respectively employed the above discrepancies suggest that a proper buoyancy load formulation that complements the continuum formulation with incorporated theory is necessary to establish an appropriate definition for buoyancy load in geometrically nonlinear analysis the contributions of this paper are essentially twofold firstly a buoyancy load formulation that is valid for the continuum formulation with incorporated beam theory is presented secondly through the established buoyancy load formulation the definition of buoyancy load in geometrically nonlinear analysis is investigated a novel vector calculus approach inspired by lima 2011 is employed for the present buoyancy load formulation using the gradient version of the divergence theorem gvdt lima showed that a closed surface integral of pressure field can be transformed into a volume integral of pressure gradient in this regard the idea of constructing a closed surface integral is exploited in this paper by means of superposition or addition of surface integrals with non overlapping limits as a result the application of the gvdt for continuous riser pipes essentially agrees with the superposition methodology in the effective tension concept since the formulation is based on a vector calculus approach the corresponding implementation is suitable for finite element discretization using continuum finite elements or structural finite elements furthermore emphasis is placed on the consequences of employing the buoyancy load approach in geometrically nonlinear analysis of flexible marine risers which have not been reported in the literature this paper continues in section 2 with the buoyancy load formulation in the buoyancy load formulation the gvdt is employed onto a continuous pipe segment subjected to circumferential hydrostatic pressure following that the geometrically nonlinear finite element formulation for the buoyancy load and the boundary effect are given in section 3 a few numerical examples are worked and verified against the literature in section 4 discussion on the practical consideration of the boundary effect is presented along with the examples the main findings are summarized and concluded in section 5 2 buoyancy load formulation in the present work the following aspects are considered in the buoyancy load formulation i both internal and external hydrostatic pressure forces are considered and they are in static equilibrium with the pipe material however the fluid can be either compressible or incompressible ii both curved and straight pipe geometries are allowed ii the atmospheric specific weight is considered to be relatively negligible therefore the status of the pipe is either fully submerged or partially submerged also either fully filled or partially filled iv the boundary ends of the pipe system can be either capped or uncapped the end surfaces of the intermediate continuous pipe segments are always uncapped v for clarity the formulation is presented in the continuous form the discrete form is given in the corresponding finite element formulation 2 1 buoyancy load formulation using the gvdt consider a fully submerged curved pipe segment containing internal fluid as shown in fig 2 both internal and external circumferential walls of the pipe segment are subjected to the hydrostatic pressure force for the external fluid column the closed surface s e is defined as s e a s e b where s e a is the external circumferential surface and s e b is the external cross sectional surface moreover s e a s e a since these surfaces are non overlapping surface traction due to the external hydrostatic pressure at time l is given by 1 f e l s e a l p e l n a l d s e a l where n a l is the outward unit normal vector to the circumferential surface at time l and p e l is the external hydrostatic pressure at time l the introduction of the time notation l in the above integral is significant since in the geometrically nonlinear analysis the deformation of a continuum is conventionally addressed through the change of configuration in time bathe 1996 bathe et al 1975 addition of cross sectional surface integrals that cancel out each other into eq 1 gives 2 f e l s e a l p e l n a l d s e a l s e b l p e l n b l d s e b l s e b l p e l n b l d s e b l where n b l is the outward unit normal vector to the cross sectional surface at time l a graphical representation of the superposition method used in arriving at eq 2 is provided in fig 2 since the parenthesized terms in eq 2 form a closed surface integral the gvdt can be applied to these terms leading to 3 f e l s e l p e l n l d l s e s e b l p e l n b l d s e b l v e l p e l d v e l s e b l p e l n b l d s e b l where n l is the outward unit normal vector to the external fluid column surface at time l and v e l is the external fluid column volume at time l for fluid statics the governing ordinary differential equation is given by munson et al 2013 4 p γ e z 0 or d p d z γ where p is the hydrostatic pressure γ is the fluid specific weight and e z is the cartesian unit vector in the vertically upward direction substitution of the pressure gradient from eq 4 into the volume integral in eq 2 1 gives 5 f e l v e l γ e l d v e l e z s e b l p e l n b l d s e b l where γ e l is the external fluid specific weight at time l following the same derivation the surface traction due to internal hydrostatic pressure at time l is given by 6 f i l v i l γ i l d v i l e z s i b l p i l n b l d s i b l where γ i l is the internal fluid specific weight at time l v i l is the internal fluid column volume at time l p i l is the internal hydrostatic pressure at time l and s i b l is the internal cross sectional surface at time l in comparison to eq 5 there are negative signs in eq 6 due to the orientation of the internal hydrostatic pressure note that the left superscript l on γ e l and γ e l indicates that for compressible fluid the fluid specific weight is a function of the pipe s z position at time l however the notation does not imply that the fluid specific weight at a given point changes with time which obviously implies fluid dynamics for an incompressible fluid the notations γ e and γ i are used instead the resultant surface traction at time l due to both internal and external hydrostatic pressure is thus given by 7 f s l f e l f i l f 1 l f 2 l in which 8 f 1 l v e l γ e l d v e l v i l γ i l d v i l e z 9 f 2 l s e b l p e l n b l d s e b l s i b l p i l n b l d s i b l where f 1 l is the resultant body force at time l which points vertically upward if the component is positive and f 2 l is the resultant cross sectional surface traction at time l 2 2 partially submerged filled pipe segment strictly speaking a partially submerged pipe segment is subjected to both atmospheric hydrostatic pressure and liquid hydrostatic pressure the gvdt can be applied by introducing cross sectional surface integrals that cancel out each other at the fluid interface lima 2011 following the same procedure the resultant body forces due to atmospheric pressure and hydrostatic pressure are obtained separately as shown in fig 3 since the specific weight of air is relatively small the atmospheric component of the resultant body force for the unsubmerged region is neglected hereinafter the same methodology is applied for a partially filled pipe segment 2 3 the boundary effect of the riser pipe system the resultant body force in eq 8 is known as the buoyancy load while the resultant cross sectional surface traction in eq 9 can be interpreted as the boundary effect when employing the buoyancy load approach the boundary effect was not considered in the previous works yazdchi and crisfield 2002a 2002b kordkheili et al 2011 aguiar et al 2015 the boundary effect can be viewed from two perspectives of which both would produce the same understanding the first perspective is that for each pipe segment the resultant cross sectional surface traction would be canceled off with the resultant cross sectional surface traction of the neighbouring pipe segments when the riser pipe system is assembled therefore only the resultant cross sectional surface traction at the boundaries of the riser pipe system would appear the second perspective is to directly view the riser pipe system as a whole similarly the resultant cross sectional surface traction appears at the boundaries of the riser pipe system only the resultant cross sectional surface traction is also related to the effective tension concept in the direct beam formulation chucheepsakul et al 2003 sparks 2007 considering the force equilibrium for a differential beam element the resultant cross sectional surface traction is added to the internal axial tensile force thus leading to the effective tension concept in the continuum formulation with incorporated beam theory the resultant cross sectional surface traction is interpreted straightforwardly as the applied force if the boundaries of the riser pipe system were both capped the boundary effect would not appear in the first place because the hydrostatic pressure field gives rise to a closed surface integral fig 3 illustrates a few examples of such a situation for riser pipes supported at the seabed there is also the need for the hydrostatic pressure field to act upon the capped end for the boundary effect to be absent on the other hand the boundary effect exists when either boundary of the riser pipe system is uncapped this is the most common case for marine risers during drilling and production operations furthermore the riser pipe system is usually supported at the boundary ends by excluding the boundary effect the static profile of the riser can still be correctly predicted due to the restraint of motions at the boundary ends however the support reactions may be incorrectly calculated for example consider a perfectly vertical submerged pipe system in static equilibrium as shown in fig 4 both boundary ends are uncapped and clamped in the actual situation there is no resultant force from the external hydrostatic pressure field acting upon the external circumferential walls using the buoyancy load approach the corresponding boundary effect must be considered to achieve the correct support reactions it is worth mentioning that for the case where the top boundary end of the riser pipe system is located above the seawater level the cross sectional surface traction at the top boundary end is relatively negligible therefore in this case only the cross sectional surface traction at the bottom boundary end is significant in addition the cross sectional surface traction always remains normal to the cross sectional surface viz tangential to the pipe as a result the evaluation of the cross sectional surface traction at the boundaries of the riser pipe system also depends on the restraining locations and directions in essence the consequences of the boundary effect vary from case to case the general rule of thumb is to employ the gvdt such that the resulting load model is equivalent to the resultant force from the actual hydrostatic pressure field 2 4 definition of the buoyancy load in geometrically nonlinear analysis according to eq 7 the notion of buoyancy load does not include the self weight of the pipe material the self weight of the submerged body is normally displayed in a fluid mechanics text to introduce the buoyancy concept see for example munson et al 2013 separation of the self weight from the buoyancy load is important because the respective load definitions are different in particular due to the conservation of mass throughout deformation bathe 1996 the self weight is a vertically downward force with configuration independent integrand function on the other hand the buoyancy load i e the resultant body force in eq 8 is a constant directional force with configuration dependent integrand function nevertheless the associated nonlinearity for the buoyancy load is weak because the force direction is constant throughout deformation in other words the buoyancy load can be approximated as a nonfollower force i e a constant directional force with configuration independent integrand function for example the nonfollower force definition was adopted by aguiar et al 2015 and an accurate result was achieved as mentioned before the riser pipe system is often restrained for motions at the boundary ends where the boundary effect appears in this case the advantage of using the buoyancy load approach is that the follower hydrostatic pressure force can be evaluated in an easier way 3 finite element formulation the present buoyancy load formulation is incorporated in the large displacement small strain analysis of flexible marine risers the isoparametric beam elements bathe 1996 dvorkin et al 1988 almeida 1980 also known as the degenerated continuum elements or degenerated isoparametric elements are employed for finite element discretization the nodes are located along the element centroidal axis at each node there are six three translational three rotational degrees of freedom and two orthonormal vectors defined with respect to the stationary global cartesian coordinates x y and z the geometry and the dependent variables are interpolated in term of the usual isoparametric coordinates r s and t in practice the number of nodes per element may range from 2 to 4 depending on the one dimensional lagrange interpolation bathe 1996 the cross sectional shape can be either rectangular or annular here the latter is used see fig 5 the beam deformation hypotheses are given such that bathe 1996 dvorkin et al 1988 i plane cross section remains plane after deformation and ii a straight line normal to the centroidal axis remains straight after deformation but may not necessarily remain normal to the centroidal axis after deformation timoshenko beam theory can be incorporated as a result of the beam deformation hypotheses the small strain condition is implied dvorkin et al 1988 the linear elastic constitutive relationship is employed in the present work as shown in fig 5 the beam deformation behavior is considered using five local components of the green lagrange strain tensor and the second piola kirchhoff stress tensor respectively bathe 1996 dvorkin et al 1988 yoon and lee 2014 finite element formulation for the isoparametric beam elements had been detailed in dvorkin et al 1988 the work by yoon and lee 2014 is also an excellent reference for the formulation details in this work the total lagrangian formulation is employed in the following the focus is dedicated towards the formulation of the external nodal load vector due to the buoyancy load and the cross sectional surface traction the notation used herein follows closely with the standard convention bathe 1996 dvorkin et al 1988 almeida 1980 yoon and lee 2014 3 1 external nodal load vector due to the buoyancy load for a fully submerged and fully filled isoparametric beam element the external nodal load vector due to the buoyancy load at time t δ t is given by 10 r b t δ t v e t δ t h t f e d v e t δ t v i t δ t h t f i d v i t δ t in which 11 f e 0 0 γ e t δ t e z t f i 0 0 γ i t δ t e z t where h is the interpolation matrix for the linear component of the incremental displacement dvorkin et al 1988 yoon and lee 2014 for an isoparametric beam element with uniform cross section the volume integrals in eq 10 can be simplified into a line integral by noting that the cross sectional area remains undeformed due to the beam deformation hypotheses in such a case eq 10 becomes 12 r b t δ t ℓ t δ t h s 0 t 0 t f b d ℓ t δ t with f b 0 0 γ e t δ t a e γ i t δ t a i e z t where ℓ t δ t is the element length at time t δ t and a e and a i are the external and internal cross sectional areas respectively as noted before γ e t δ t and γ i t δ t can be understood as γ e and γ i respectively for an incompressible fluid for a partially submerged or partially filled isoparametric beam element the fluid specific weight is a piecewise defined function which makes evaluation of the external nodal load vector difficult an alternative solution is to assign nodal distribution coefficients to the external nodal load vector of a fully submerged or fully filled isoparametric beam element a more general expression of the external nodal load vector due to the buoyancy load for a q noded isoparametric beam element is given by 13 r b t δ t 0 α k 1 r b k 1 e z 0 α k q r b k q e z t with α k λ k μ k where r b k 1 is the buoyancy load at node k for a fully submerged case α k is the distribution factor for node k λ k is the magnitude allocation factor for node k and μ k is the lagrange interpolation factor for node k during numerical implementation eq 13 can be calculated separately for the internal fluid and external fluid as to distinguish between the degree of submergence and degree of internal fluid occupation respectively in general α k 1 for the fully submerged or fully filled case 0 α k 1 for the partially submerged or partially filled case and α k 0 for the unsubmerged or unfilled case the nodal distribution coefficients for partially submerged isoparametric beam elements with q 2 3 and 4 equally spaced nodes are given in table 1 note that the node numbering sequence in table 1 follows the convention given in fig 6 viz the node at the far submerged end is the first node as mentioned before the associated nonlinearity for the buoyancy load is weak as the force direction remains constant throughout deformation therefore the augmented tangent stiffness matrix for buoyancy load is not derived and the external nodal load vector due to the buoyancy load at time t δ t can be approximated as 14 r b t δ t r b t 3 2 idealization of the cross sectional surface traction as nodal point load vector since the cross sectional surface traction occurs at the boundary ends of the riser pipe system only the isoparametric beam elements at the boundary ends are involved evaluation of the cross sectional surface traction using the surface integral definition in eq 9 becomes challenging when the hydrostatic pressure field is distributed nonuniformly across the cross sectional surface the diameter of a marine riser is normally small relative to the pipe length hence the hydrostatic pressure variation across the cross sectional surface can be neglected in this work the cross sectional surface traction is idealized as a nodal point load vector the nodal point load vector due to the cross sectional surface traction at node k is given by 15 r t k t δ t p e k t δ t a e k p i k t δ t a i k n b k t δ t with n b k t δ t v s k t δ t v t k t δ t where v s k t δ t and v s k t δ t are the two orthonormal vectors of the element node k at time t δ t from the isoparametric beam element point of view the nodal point load vector due to the cross sectional surface traction is a follower tangential load in this work the corresponding augmented tangent stiffness matrix is not derived and the nodal point load vector due to the cross sectional surface traction at time t δ t can be approximated as 16 r t k t δ t r t k t 4 numerical examples the present buoyancy load formulation is applied to a few benchmark problems for verification purpose particular emphasis is placed on the boundary effect in the numerical implementation the integrals required by the finite element matrices and vectors are evaluated using gauss legendre quadrature for the q noded isoparametric beam element the corresponding volume integrals are evaluated using q 1 gauss points along the element axis bathe 1996 two gauss points along the element radial axis and eight gauss points along the element circumferential axis respectively 4 1 fully submerged cantilevered pipe with both ends capped as shown in fig 7 the example concerns static analysis of a fully submerged cantilevered pipe with both ends capped at a water depth of 100 m the cantilevered pipe is allowed to undergo large displacement the problem was proposed by yazdchi and crisfield 2002a 2002b and worked by kordkheili et al 2011 and aguiar et al 2015 the problem has been well designed such that the deeply submerged pipe will always be subjected to external hydrostatic pressure during deformation according to the present buoyancy load formulation there is no boundary effect as both ends of the pipe system are capped in a two dimensional static analysis the fully submerged cantilevered pipe is subjected to its self weight buoyancy load due to external hydrostatic pressure and a vertical point load at the tip p z 3 10 4 n eight 4 noded isoparametric beam elements are employed for discretization of the pipe a summary of the problem definition is given in table 2 fig 8 shows the deformed geometry of the pipe for different loading conditions as shown in the figure the present work is in good agreement with yazdchi and crisfield 2002a and aguiar et al 2015 a third set of data from the results of kordkheili et al 2011 is also provided in the same figure although the buoyancy load calculation and the finite element are the same for both works there are some differences in the results comparison due to the proposed linearization in kordkheili et al 2011 as mentioned before aguiar et al 2015 employed the nonfollower force definition for the buoyancy load to investigate the good agreement between aguiar et al 2015 and present work a separate calculation is made with the buoyancy load evaluated as a nonfollower force fig 9 shows the comparison between the results of this calculation and the original calculation an excellent agreement between the configuration dependent integrand function model and the nonfollower force model is observed the norm of the displacement difference between the two buoyancy load models is reported to be 10 5 m this evidence confirms that the buoyancy load can be approximated accurately as nonfollower force in addition a three dimensional static analysis considering self weight buoyancy load due to external hydrostatic pressure and point loads at the tip p z p y 3 10 4 n is performed the purpose of this analysis is to further verify the present buoyancy load formulation using linearly interpolated isoparametric beam elements in particular the results using twenty 2 noded isoparametric beam elements and eight 4 noded isoparametric beam elements are compared fig 10 shows the in plane and out of deformed geometry of the pipe for both meshes as shown in the figure both meshes produce results that are in a good agreement with yazdchi and crisfield 2002b furthermore it is interesting to note that yazdchi and crisfield s interpretation led to the derivation of the augmented tangent stiffness matrix for buoyancy load in the present buoyancy load formulation the derivation of the augmented tangent stiffness matrix for the buoyancy load is deemed unnecessary because of the weak nonlinearity associated with the buoyancy load definition 4 2 fully submerged cantilevered pipe with the cantilevered end uncapped the two dimensional static analysis of the fully submerged cantilevered pipe in the previous example is now repeated by considering the cantilevered end as uncapped in particular the up ward loading with buoyancy load case is demonstrated according to the present buoyancy load formulation the boundary effect occurs at the cantilevered end due to the restraint of motions at the cantilevered end the static profile remains the same as the previous example however the support reactions are different as reported in table 3 in this example there is a horizontal reaction at the cantilevered end due to the boundary effect the consequence of the boundary effect may seem trivial in this example however the accuracy of the support reactions is crucial for a proper design of the riser system particularly the foundation and anchoring system it is re emphasized herein that the consequences of the boundary effect associated with the uncapped boundary ends depend on the locations and restraining directions of the supports 4 3 riser subjected to steady current as shown in fig 11 the example concerns static analysis of a vertical riser and an inclined riser subjected to steady current the problem was introduced by yazdchi and crisfield 2002a both internal hydrostatic pressure and external hydrostatic pressure are considered in the analysis the risers are tensioned at the top end while pinned at the seabed it was not mentioned clearly if the boundary ends were capped or uncapped it is common for the top tensioned end to be uncapped nevertheless even if the boundary effect exists at the top end the specific weight of the external fluid is relatively negligible and the internal hydrostatic pressure is zero similarly the bottom end is pinned hence the static profile remains the same whether the boundary effect occurs at the bottom end in this analysis the risers are subjected to self weight buoyancy load due to external hydrostatic pressure and internal hydrostatic pressure follower tangential top tension force with constant magnitude and follower current load with a steady horizontal velocity of 1 m s or 2 m s a summary of the problem definition is given in table 4 a hundred load increments are employed here a total of thirty four 2 noded isoparametric beam elements are used for discretization in particular the initially unsubmerged domain is discretized using four isoparametric beam elements each with 5 m in length yazdchi and crisfield 2002a employed the master slave technique for the follower tangential top tension force to account for the change of riser s top end position during deformation here a simplification is made such that the follower tangential top tension force is always applied at the riser s top end furthermore the riser s top end is allowed to slide in the vertical direction fig 12 and fig 13 show deformed geometries of the vertical riser and the inclined riser respectively for different current velocities overall good agreement is observed between present work and yazdchi and crisfield 2002a a slight disagreement appears at the riser s top end region due to difference in the top tension force modelling in essence the good agreement further justifies the present buoyancy load formulation 5 conclusions a proper buoyancy load formulation that complements the continuum formulation with incorporated beam theory in geometrically nonlinear analysis of flexible marine risers has been presented employing the gvdt onto a continuous pipe segment subjected to circumferential hydrostatic pressure the buoyancy load approach is only justified if the associated boundary effect is properly considered the present buoyancy load formulation essentially follows the effective tension concept in the direct beam formulation the boundary effect is implicitly considered via the effective tension concept in the continuum formulation with incorporated beam theory the boundary effect is interpreted straightforwardly as the applied force in addition finite element formulation for the buoyancy load and boundary effect is presented the isoparametric beam elements are employed for finite element discretization a few numerical examples are also worked and verified against the literature the boundary effect occurs if either boundary end of the riser pipe system were uncapped furthermore the consequences of the boundary effect generally depends on the type of supports location of supports and restraining directions at the boundary ends for instance the boundary effect does not affect the static profile of a marine riser with proper restraints at both boundary ends however in such situation the boundary effect should be considered when the support reactions are evaluated the support reactions are important for a proper design of the foundation and anchoring system since the actual conditions of a marine pipe system can be sophisticated the general rule of thumb is to ensure that the gvdt is properly applied such that the use of the buoyancy load approach is justified as marine risers are usually restrained at both boundary ends the buoyancy load approach is computationally favourable because the associated nonlinearity is weak it is ascertained that the approximate evaluation of the buoyancy load as nonfollower force is highly accurate therefore the derivation of the augmented tangent stiffness matrix for buoyancy load is deemed unnecessary acknowledgement the authors are deeply grateful towards dr kyungho yoon the first author of yoon and lee 2014 for his

23431,this paper presents an alternative and open source methodology based on binary image analysis to measure water elevations in two dimensional hydrodynamic experiments the proposed methodology considers the three main stages of an artificial vision system image digitalization processing and analysis in the image processing stage binary images were obtained by intensity modulation and pseudo color based segmentation the image analysis stage employs simplified morphological operations to measure water elevations at specified regions of interest in the binary images the image processing and analysis stages were developed in scripts for the imagej open source software the applicability of the proposed methodology was verified by comparing measurements of water elevations obtained using the proposed approach and conventional wave probes during experiments of shipping water on a fixed structure the experiments included cases where single valued and double valued water surfaces were observed for all the test cases the water elevation time series obtained using the proposed approach were in good agreement with the experiments before three dimensional effects on flow were significant for the case in which a double valued water surface was observed it was confirmed that the proposed procedure possesses the capability to measure the effective water height at specified regions of interest keywords binary image analysis 2d hydrodynamic experiments image segmentation morphological operations shipping water water elevation measurements 1 introduction water elevation measurements in two dimensional hydrodynamic experiments are essential data for comparing or validating analytical and numerical models in several areas such as coastal ocean and offshore engineering among others a common practice for measuring water elevations is to employ conventional wave probes i e capacitance resistance or conductive probes however there are some issues related to the use of these sensors wave probes are intrusive sensors with a finite size and length which can pose significant installation challenges particularly in small scale experiments the dimensions of these sensors have to be appropriately selected to minimize the disturbance on the flow if the wave probes are not appropriately selected for the application they may cause ventilation and cavitation phenomena particularly in applications where the horizontal velocity at the wave probe is high greco 2001 in addition the wave probes also have to be chosen such that the measurements are not affected by changes in their frequency response koskie et al 1989 a wave probe can only provide time histories of the wave profile at one location thus the use of several probes is necessary for cases where spatial monitoring is required in addition wave probes may provide false water elevation measurements in cases where two or more water surfaces are observed such as in the case of air trapped due to a plunging wave yao and wu 2005 the problems described above have motivated researchers to apply image processing and analysis methods to measure water elevations or related fluid parameters in tests conducted in laboratories erikson and hanson 2005 iglesias et al 2009 wang et al 2012 zhang 1996 yao and wu 2005 kim et al 2011 lee and kwon 2003 the advantages of image based methods are that they are non intrusive and allow spatial and temporal measurements at desired virtual wave probe positions however some of the methods that have been proposed for water elevation measurements are implemented using commercial software require expensive equipment or depend on computer capabilities to process vast amounts of gray scale or color images resulting in time consuming procedures for post processing of the data see for instance erikson and hanson 2005 yao and wu 2005 among the existing image based methods those based on binary images are practical and powerful alternatives that may be employed for water elevation measurements vision systems based on the use of binary images present the advantages of being faster and less expensive than those operating on color or gray level images because of the smaller memory and processing requirements for instance the memory requirements will be up to 8 times higher to analyze an image at 256 levels gray scale than an image of the same size at 2 levels binary ramesh et al 1995 rather than performing integer arithmetic operations systems that operate with binary images may perform logical operations which explains the small processing time required these types of systems can be used when the environment can be controlled to differentiate the object of interest from the remaining components of the scene or when a pattern or silhouette in a region of interest contains sufficient information to perform the logical operations ramesh et al 1995 differentiating between objects of the scene is the key to obtaining binary images this differentiation is possible through a procedure known as segmentation which allows separating foreground from the background commonly by applying a threshold arco et al 2015 image segmentation is a common technique that plays an important role in many areas of research such as medical applications pham et al 2000 chalana and kim 1997 sirisha et al 2013 milewski and govindaraju 2008 pattern recognition yasnoff et al 1977 zhang 1996 and geosciences grove and jerram 2011 among others once the image has been binarized through segmentation it is possible to compute shape properties features of the objects thus morphological operations are among the options that can be considered for implementing the image analysis implementations of binary image analysis using morphological operations are of interest in many applications some examples include periodontal health differentiation shrout et al 1998 blood cell analysis wang et al 2016 biological classification arco et al 2015 and optics wei et al 2009 among others although morphological operations for image analysis have been used in several areas haralick et al 1987 to the best of the authors knowledge there is not an open source image based procedure that includes binary image analysis based on morphological operations to measure water elevations in hydrodynamic applications the aim of the present work is to present an alternative and open source binary image based methodology to measure water elevations for two dimensional hydrodynamic experiments the proposed procedure includes image digitalization processing and analysis stages the image digitalization stage includes image acquisition using a monochromatic high speed camera and lens correction calibration and image stack generation using the open source software opencv and imagej the image processing is based on an intensity modulation operation and a pseudo color based segmentation over input gray scale images which yield the binary images finally in the third stage binary image analysis using basic morphological operations of the free orientation metrics class is performed to measure the wave elevations by area fraction or pixels density of specified regions of interest macro scripts for imagej were developed for the second and third stages of the methodology to verify the performance of the proposed approach shipping water on deck experiments using the wet dam break approach proposed by hernández fontes et al 2017b a were conducted water elevations obtained using the present methodology were compared with conventional wave probe measurements to justify the use of the proposed approach as an alternative method two case studies were considered for application the first case presented a single valued water surface whereas the second case presented a double valued water surface the remainder of this article is structured as follows section 2 presents the materials and methods including the description of the shipping water experiments the test cases conventional water elevation measurements and details of the proposed alternative methodology section 3 presents the results and discussions of the comparisons between the conventional and the virtual wave probe measurements finally the main conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 shipping water on deck experiments the experimental setup was constructed and installed at the ocean technology laboratory laboceano coppe ufrj facilities brazil a dam break type installation prismatic tank that was 1000 mm long 335 mm wide and 450 mm high was used to conduct the experiments a fixed structure was installed inside the tank to represent the deck of a vessel the tank was divided into two regions using a gate located at 505 mm from the internal structure fig 1 two different levels of water were defined downstream h 0 and upstream of the gate h 1 the setup corresponds to the wet dam break approach described by stoker 1957 when the gate is suddenly opened the upstream volume of water interacts with the downstream one forming a bore that travels along the tank and ships into the fixed structure a sketch of the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 more details can be found in hernández fontes et al 2017b a 2 2 test cases from the available experimental data two case studies have been selected to test the methodology proposed in the present study these cases are described in table 1 where h 0 and h 1 correspond to the initial water levels downstream and upstream of the gate respectively and f b represents the initial freeboard fig 1 the types of test cases presented in table 1 correspond to those where single and double valued water surfaces are observed 2 3 conventional water elevation measurements the water elevations of the incoming wave and water propagation on deck were obtained from wp5 and wp1 wp4 respectively using conventional wave probes fig 1 these sensors are conductive wave probes made of two stainless steel rods with a diameter of 2 4 mm placed 9 mm apart a wave probe amplifier model dhi 102e was used and data were acquired at a sampling rate of 500 hz signal conditioning and a d conversion from ni national instruments was used to acquire all the signals further details of the experimental setup can be found in hernández fontes et al 2017b the uncertainty in the calibration of the wave probes was estimated following the recommended procedures for uncertainty analysis and instrument calibration of the ittc international towing tank conference ittc 2008 for all the wave probes the estimated uncertainty was in the range of 2 mm 2 4 alternative water elevation measurements fig 2 shows the three stages of the image based methodology proposed as an alternative for measuring water elevations in the first stage the video images are acquired rectified and saved as calibrated gray scale stacks of images in the second stage these images are processed to obtain binary stacks in the third stage the binary images are analyzed using morphological operations to obtain the desired water elevation time series each of the three stages presented in fig 2 are further described in sections 2 4 1 2 4 3 2 4 1 image digitalization 2 4 1 1 image acquisition camera selection and illumination the evolution of water was captured using a monochromatic high speed qualisys oqus 310 camera with an additional nikon af dc nikkor 105 mm f 2d lens the camera has a cmos sensor with a resolution of 1 3 mpixel video data were captured at 500 fps using the full resolution image size of 1284 h 1024 v the camera was located perpendicularly to the profile view of the tank the software qualisys qtm was used for video acquisition the components of the image acquisition system are schematically shown in fig 3 characterization of the sampling area was performed by placing the camera with the lens at a distance of approximately 3 m from the side of the tank allowing a field of view fov of 500 mm h 450 mm v fig 3 this fov includes the structure and wave probes see for instance a typical frame size in fig 4 the image acquisition stage addresses two important points illumination setup and acquisition rate in the former the natural reflectance of the fluid has to be considered because it may yield irregular intensity values in different regions of the scene in the latter higher acquisition rates correspond to lower exposure times then the use of high gain levels in the acquisition device might be necessary which would increase the signal to noise ratio snr to address the problems described above a low reflectance fluid and an indirect illumination setup were considered in the present study for the former indigo dye blue dye was used to color and differentiate the water from other components of the scene for the latter led illumination was employed as schematically illustrated in fig 3 a 500 400 mm led panel was installed behind the vertical wall of the tank to illuminate the desired fov the light was diffused by a translucent paper sheet attached to the wall of the tank a led lamp was installed on the side of the tank to illuminate the longitudinal direction fig 5 shows the illumination system and the characterized low reflectance fluid 2 4 1 2 lens correction and image calibration lens correction and calibration of the acquired images were performed using a series of images of a circle pattern table lavision type 31 that were captured to cover the entire area of interest fig 4 next the camera lens coefficients were determined and the digitized images were undistorted these steps were performed using the open source computer vision library opencv 2018 then the images were saved as calibrated gray scale stacks of images using imagej 2 4 2 image processing the undistorted gray scale stacks of images were processed using four steps intensity modulation pseudo color transformation pseudo color segmentation and thresholding for binary stack generation as shown in fig 6 these steps were implemented in scripts for the open source software imagej for automated processing in the first step the calibrated gray scale stacks are allocated in the memory for intensity modulation to enhance the region of interest over the remainder of the images this type of approach is suitable when the elements in the image present similar contrast values arco et al 2015 for the present study the intensity range was modulated by increasing the contrast of the pixels within a given window range two parameters were defined prior to the processing using the imagej toolbox level and window which define the middle point and the width of the intensity range respectively the use of both parameters helps to highlight the intensities of pixels in order to facilitate the pseudo color transformation and segmentation fig 7 exemplifies the effects of level and window changes on the intensities of the pixels first the image considered as input fig 7a and the image with the default level and window parameters in the imagej toolbox fig 7b are shown then the effects of level and window variation around the default values on the intensity of the pixels are presented fig 7c f it can be noted that lower values for the level improve the fluid identification fig 7c d whereas lower values for the window enhance the dark elements in the scene fig 7e f thus the level and window values should be chosen by trials according to the user criteria to enhance the desired regions for the application considered a level equal to 219 and a window of 31 were selected for convenience for the present application trial and error and equally propagated to the entire stacks of images in the second step a pseudo color image enhancement is applied this process transforms the gray scale from the images into individual spaces where hue and saturation can also vary gray scale images colored in this manner can make feature identification easier for the observer radewan 1975 in the present study a simple red green blue rgb combination was used to generate the lut lookup table the results were colored images in which every intensity value has a corresponding rgb color resulting in 16 levels of rgb colors in the third step the pseudo colored images are segmented by their colors of channels rgb this process results in three new image stacks where the fluid is well differentiated from the remainder of the scene in at least one of the image stacks for convenience the blue channel color stack was chosen to implement the fourth step where otsu s method otsu 1979 was applied to transform the filtered channel images into a binary stack of images in which the fluid is filtered from the background this method was chosen because it resulted in binarized stacks with low levels of noise however there are other methods available in the imagej thresholder applet that can also be adopted whose results are similar to the one obtained by otsu s method as shown in fig 8 in the figure the results of different methods are compared demonstrating the alternatives for binarization with low levels of noise in the fluid region then the selection of the method must be done according to user s criteria in the present application otsu s method considers the blue range to filter the desired fluid area following a simple procedure an input gray scale image i m n from the segmented blue color channel and an output binary image o m n both with m rows and n columns of pixels are considered local descriptors of intensity are defined as α i j and β i j for the input and output images respectively in both images the indexes in the local descriptors 1 i m and 1 j n describe the coordinates of each pixel thus pixel s intensity values in the output images are defined by setting a threshold intensity parameter θ to the input images as follows 1 β i j 1 if α i j θ 0 otherwise for 1 i m and 1 j n the selection of θ depends on the segmented color range in the scene according to the adopted pseudo color lut 2 4 3 image analysis the processed stacks of binary images were analyzed through morphological operations of the free orientation metrics class e g area and centroid position at specified regions of interest the considered method named area fraction describes the density of pixels with an intensity value of 1 or 0 black or white respectively within a known region of interest roi in general the time variation of the area fraction of the fluid particles density of black color pixels inside rois is used to determine time series of water elevations at desired positions the mathematical interpretation of the followed approach may be expressed by denoting the total number of pixels in a roi by ℛ u v where u and v represent the number of rows and columns of pixels respectively to measure the water elevation h a at a desired position in the image it is necessary to define a roi with known u and v dimensions and to know the total number of black pixels inside the roi a b which is a software output the black pixels density or area fraction a is the ratio a b ℛ and consequently the water elevation h a in the roi i e in a specific point in time can be obtained as 2 h a u a u a b ℛ 2 4 4 error analysis the presence of error in the proposed methodology was identified during the stages of image digitalization and processing for the former stage error is mainly due to the setup location and orientation and lens distortion of the acquisition device for the latter stage error is generated by losing pixels during the image binarization in the present study the root mean square error rmse has been considered for analysis it represents the sample standard deviation of the differences between measured and reference values in other words the rmse corresponds to the standard deviation of the prediction errors i e residuals which allow to idealize how spread are the data points from the best fit line the root mean square error rmse can be calculated as follows 3 rsme 1 n k 1 n v m k v r k 2 1 2 where v m and v r are the measured obtained and reference values respectively and n corresponds to the number of observations the rmse in the image digitalization stage was calculated considering the resultant displacement between the labvision calibration board values reference values vr and the resultant dots positions of a rectified image of this board measured values vm considering n as the number of dots on the other hand the rmse in the image processing stage was evaluated from the differences in pixels between the stack of calibrated images input fig 9 a and the stack of binarized images output fig 9b the binarized images were set as masks over the input images as shown in fig 9c then the masks were subtracted yielding contours in the fluid surfaces fig 9d for each image the maximum number of pixels monitored in the vertical direction of the resultant contour was defined as v m k v r k in eq 3 then the rmse was calculated considering n as the number of images in the stack 3 results and discussion in this section image digitalization and processing errors are presented and data of virtual wave probes vwps obtained using the proposed methodology are compared with the results of the conventional wave probes wps shown in fig 1 the experimental cases of shipping water events have been considered before three dimensional effects on flow occur due to water impact on the vertical wall and backflow for comparison with wps 3 4 the longitudinal positions of the vwps were defined to be approximately 1 mm to the left of the positions of the wps to avoid the superposition of the roi of the vwps with the wps 3 1 image digitalization and processing errors in the image digitalization stage root mean square errors rmse of 9 1 and 3 2 pixels were obtained for the study cases 1 and 2 respectively these errors correspond respectively to 3 6 and 1 2 mm in the real world scale it can be considered based on the obtained rmse for both study cases that the setup and the lens distortion of the camera presented a combined rmse from 1 mm to 4 mm in the digitalization stage of the proposed method on the other hand in the image processing stage estimated rmse values did not exceed 1 64 pixels for cases 1 and 2 which corresponds to 0 6 mm in the real world scale supposing that the addition of the rmse values obtained for the image digitalization and processing is valid it might be assumed a global rmse of 4 2 and 1 8 mm for cases 1 and 2 respectively using the proposed image based methodology 3 2 case study 1 single valued water surface a sequence of representative frames during the shipping water event observed in the first case is presented in fig 10 these frames correspond to different stages of the shipping water including the initial condition before the formation of the wave fig 10a the instant at which the water level reaches the deck level fig 10b the development of a jet type front flow on the structure followed by a bulk body of water fig 10c and d and run up on the vertical wall before the backflow occurs fig 10e in this application case a single valued water surface is observed for all the instants considered fig 11 presents the comparisons of water elevation h time series obtained with the vwps and wps in the figures the highlighted points in time correspond to the stages shown in fig 10 fig 11a shows the comparison between a vwp and wp5 which monitored the water elevation time series of the incoming wave from t 0 s to t 0 4 s the water level corresponds to the initial condition in this interval the difference between the wp and vwp is approximately 0 6 mm it can be observed that the incoming wave elevations started to increase within the interval 0 4 s t 0 6 s then a maximum elevation is observed within 0 8 s t 0 9 s the peak values of the vwp and the wp present an elevation difference of 4 mm and a time shift of 0 026 s after the peak values a minimum occurs at t 1 07 s and both signals presented a closer agreement with a difference of approximately 1 mm fig 11b shows the comparison of water elevations of vwp with wp3 and wp4 which are located at the leading edge of the deck to monitor the freeboard exceedance measurements of the water elevations began within 0 7 s t 0 8 s then maximum h values for the signals were observed from 1 s t 1 2 s the wps presented a difference of approximately 4 mm in their maximum values which may be an indicator of small three dimensional effects on flow at this stage however the maximum value of the vwp was between the maxima of the wps after the peak the vwp again followed the trend of the wps with good agreement fig 11c shows the comparison of the vwp with the wps that are located near the vertical wall of the tank wp1 and wp2 at this part of the deck of the structure measurements of the water elevations began at t 1 s it is observed that the signals of wp1 and wp2 are very close and that the vwp follows their trend the measurements of all signals begin at almost the same point in time but there is overestimation from 5 to 10 mm in the vwp measurements however note that at the region near the vertical wall the camera captured some three dimensional effects on flow fig 10e which may be the main cause for overestimating the results of the wps it can be observed that root mean square error rmse values of water elevation measurements are also shown in fig 11 they were calculated by eq 3 considering the data of the wps as reference values and the data of the vwps as the measured values for the cases when the comparisons of the vwps were made against two wps the average values of the measurements of these last were considered for the calculation the lowest rmse 3 mm was obtained for the probes located outside the structure on the other hand rmse values of 4 mm and 5 mm were obtained for the wave probes located at the beginning and at the end of the structure respectively in fig 11 the measurements given by the vwps seem to be in good agreement with those given by the wps even though the rmse values suggest the presence of error in the comparisons however it can be attributed to the errors identified in the use of the image based methodology and in the calibration of the conventional probes considered as reference furthermore the shift observed between the vwp and wp data curves may be partially attributed to some error caused during the setup of the positions of the vwps also three dimensional effects on flow visualized by the camera may be another source of error that could contribute to the overestimation in measurements 3 3 case study 2 double valued water surface fig 12 presents the main stages of the shipping water event considered for the second application case these stages include the initial condition where water is calm fig 12a the formation of a steep wave approaching the structure fig 12b a fluid arm rising at the bow of the structure and forming a large cavity over the deck fig 12c the plunging wave hitting the deck and the water impact and runup on the vertical wall fig 12d and e respectively this case study presents a single valued water surface during the wave propagation and a double valued water surface case during the shipping water event due to the formation of a large cavity it should be noted that conventional wave probes were located in regions where the free surface is always single valued fig 13 shows the comparison of vwps with wps the main stages presented in fig 12 are indicated in the comparisons for illustrative purposes the comparison of the vwp with wp5 is shown in fig 13a for the initial condition 0s t 0 5 s there is a difference of approximately 1 mm between the wp and the vwp then for t 0 5 s water elevations measured by the wp and vwp gradually increase until reaching a peak value at approximately t 0 8 s at the peaks some oscillations in the data are observed probably due to the irregularity formed at the wave crest observed in fig 12b considering the maximum elevation of both the wp and vwp signals a water elevation difference of 2 5 mm and a time shift of 0 046 s are observed after the peak minimum values are observed for both probes presenting an elevation difference of 1 8 mm and a time shift of 0 01 s fig 13b presents the comparison of vwp with wp3 and wp4 for all the probes measurement of the water elevation began within 0 8 s t 0 85 s then peak values were reached within 0 95 s t 1 0 s the difference between the peak values of wp3 and wp4 is 1 mm whereas the difference between these values and the vwp peak value is approximately 9 mm after the peak the vwp results presented an excellent agreement with the wp results the comparison of the vwp against wp1 and wp2 is shown in fig 13c when t 1 0 the probes began measuring the elevations the vwp results were in good agreement with the wp results even at the maximum values where some oscillations are observed these oscillations may be attributed to drops or irregular water surface measured at the region near the tank wall for this case the method performed well as in case study 1 moreover the differences in the results are also similar to those observed for case 1 small temporal shifts in the vwp signals relative to the wp signals were observed and maximum and minimum values presented differences of some millimeters between them however the trend of wps was closely followed in the comparisons of fig 13 rmse values were also estimated as in the case 1 in the present case the rmse values for all the comparisons are between 6 mm and 10 mm which indicates larger errors than the ones observed in case 1 causes of these errors may be similar to the ones described for the case 1 however as observed from video data the three dimensional effects of flow might have a significant error contribution in the present type of shipping water in general it can be verified from the comparisons that the proposed methodology allows capturing water elevation values that are close to those measured by wps in the regions where three dimensional effects are less excited 3 3 1 double valued water surface apparent and effective water height measuring water elevations using vwps at specified rois in regions where a double valued water surface is presented such as in fig 12c and d requires considering that there is an apparent water elevation assumed from the reference considered e g structure surface to the upper water elevation ul see fig 14 a for details however using this value to estimate the amount of water shipped results in an unreal value because this is not the effective elevation of the water shipped due to the double valued water surface formed by the trapped air this situation may yield false water elevation measurements using conventional wave probes yao and wu 2005 by using the current approach it is possible to define the effective water height as ul ll where ll is the lower water elevation thereby improving the estimation of the shipping water volume the applicability of the proposed approach for measuring the effective water height in the double valued water surface region observed in case 2 has been tested using a vwp located at a distance of x d 30 mm from the deck edge considering the deck as the reference fig 14a because no wp data are available that allow comparing the results at the vwp position time series of ul and ll were measured frame by frame every 0 01 s using imagej tools to obtain the effective water height ul ll which was compared with the results of the proposed approach fig 14b shows the water elevations on the deck h d monitored by the vwp in this figure the time series of ul ll and the effective water height are compared with the results obtained with the proposed method area fraction the results demonstrate that the proposed approach indeed accounts for the effective water height in fig 14b the square markers indicate points in time of six stages that show in detail the cavity evolution from binarized images which are illustrated in fig 15 at t 0 90 s fig 15a the vwp begins measuring the area fraction then the peak value is attained at approximately t 0 98 s fig 15b and the large plunging wave develops on the deck as observed in fig 15c and d subsequently the trapped air starts fragmenting as observed in fig 15e at this stage a jump is observed in the data because the cavity is entrapped by the flow thus it was not possible to define the ll by observation due to the irregular features identified beneath the flow after this stage the double valued water surface disappears and a single valued water surface is recovered as shown in fig 14b the results suggest that the proposed methodology allows accounting for the effective water height in specified rois however if it is desired to account for the lower water elevation ll or cavity height a simple image inversion operation can be applied to the binary stack of images to convert white pixels into black pixels thereby allowing the methodology to be applied by defining adequate roi heights 4 conclusions an open source and practical methodology was proposed as an alternative for measuring water elevations in two dimensional hydrodynamic applications using binary image analysis the proposed method includes image digitalization processing and analysis stages in the image digitalization stage differentiation of the fluid from the other components of the scene was performed through coloring and using a led illumination arrangement then lens correction and calibration were performed on the obtained gray scale images the image processing was based on an intensity equalization operation and a pseudo color based segmentation yielding binarized images next binary image analysis was conducted using morphological operations of the free orientation metrics class this allowed monitoring the time variation of the area fraction or pixel density of specified regions of interest to obtain time series of water elevations at desired positions the complete procedure was implemented using open source software for the image digitalization stage lens correction and image calibration were performed using opencv libraries then calibrated image stacks were generated with imagej subsequently these stacks were used in the image processing and analysis stages for which scripts were developed to be implemented in imagej the performance of the proposed method was verified based on the experimental results of the shipping of water onto a fixed structure using the wet dam break approach in the experiments conductive wave probes at several positions were used to monitor the incoming wave and the shipping water on deck elevations a high speed camera was employed to capture details of the water evolution two types of shipping water were considered as the application cases the first one consisted of a case that presented a single valued water surface the second case presented a double valued water surface during the shipping of water on the structure due to a large cavity formed on the deck from the comparison with experiments it was observed that the measurements obtained using the proposed approach well captured the trend of the conventional sensors in general small time shifts and differences in water elevation measurements were observed in the comparisons possible reasons for these errors in the measurements may be related to small 3d effects presented in the flow and captured by the rois as well as the location of the vwp positions however considering the estimated margin of error the virtual and conventional wave probe measurements were in close agreement the second case study presented a special situation for water elevation measurements depending on the probe location in this case due to the formation of a cavity two water surfaces were observed it was confirmed that the present approach provides the time series of effective water heights defined by the observed lower and upper water elevations the proposed alternative methodology can be applied by using any video camera and differentiating the fluid from the other components of the scene this differentiation may be improved by coloring the fluid and using background illumination in a similar way as employed in the present study however the image processing script should be adapted according to the application updating the parameters for intensity regulation and thresholding the proposed methodology can be extended with other types of morphological operations and adapted to different hydrodynamic applications as future work the authors intend to extend the presented methodology to 3d measurements by considering different cameras views and to use additional morphological operations to extract other flow information such as flow velocities the data related to the presented cases i e calibrated image stacks the portable open source imagej software with the script files for image processing and analysis and a video tutorial of usage are available on the mendeley data repository doi 10 17632 9vwdgv2g5z 1 acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the support of anp and cnpq from

23431,this paper presents an alternative and open source methodology based on binary image analysis to measure water elevations in two dimensional hydrodynamic experiments the proposed methodology considers the three main stages of an artificial vision system image digitalization processing and analysis in the image processing stage binary images were obtained by intensity modulation and pseudo color based segmentation the image analysis stage employs simplified morphological operations to measure water elevations at specified regions of interest in the binary images the image processing and analysis stages were developed in scripts for the imagej open source software the applicability of the proposed methodology was verified by comparing measurements of water elevations obtained using the proposed approach and conventional wave probes during experiments of shipping water on a fixed structure the experiments included cases where single valued and double valued water surfaces were observed for all the test cases the water elevation time series obtained using the proposed approach were in good agreement with the experiments before three dimensional effects on flow were significant for the case in which a double valued water surface was observed it was confirmed that the proposed procedure possesses the capability to measure the effective water height at specified regions of interest keywords binary image analysis 2d hydrodynamic experiments image segmentation morphological operations shipping water water elevation measurements 1 introduction water elevation measurements in two dimensional hydrodynamic experiments are essential data for comparing or validating analytical and numerical models in several areas such as coastal ocean and offshore engineering among others a common practice for measuring water elevations is to employ conventional wave probes i e capacitance resistance or conductive probes however there are some issues related to the use of these sensors wave probes are intrusive sensors with a finite size and length which can pose significant installation challenges particularly in small scale experiments the dimensions of these sensors have to be appropriately selected to minimize the disturbance on the flow if the wave probes are not appropriately selected for the application they may cause ventilation and cavitation phenomena particularly in applications where the horizontal velocity at the wave probe is high greco 2001 in addition the wave probes also have to be chosen such that the measurements are not affected by changes in their frequency response koskie et al 1989 a wave probe can only provide time histories of the wave profile at one location thus the use of several probes is necessary for cases where spatial monitoring is required in addition wave probes may provide false water elevation measurements in cases where two or more water surfaces are observed such as in the case of air trapped due to a plunging wave yao and wu 2005 the problems described above have motivated researchers to apply image processing and analysis methods to measure water elevations or related fluid parameters in tests conducted in laboratories erikson and hanson 2005 iglesias et al 2009 wang et al 2012 zhang 1996 yao and wu 2005 kim et al 2011 lee and kwon 2003 the advantages of image based methods are that they are non intrusive and allow spatial and temporal measurements at desired virtual wave probe positions however some of the methods that have been proposed for water elevation measurements are implemented using commercial software require expensive equipment or depend on computer capabilities to process vast amounts of gray scale or color images resulting in time consuming procedures for post processing of the data see for instance erikson and hanson 2005 yao and wu 2005 among the existing image based methods those based on binary images are practical and powerful alternatives that may be employed for water elevation measurements vision systems based on the use of binary images present the advantages of being faster and less expensive than those operating on color or gray level images because of the smaller memory and processing requirements for instance the memory requirements will be up to 8 times higher to analyze an image at 256 levels gray scale than an image of the same size at 2 levels binary ramesh et al 1995 rather than performing integer arithmetic operations systems that operate with binary images may perform logical operations which explains the small processing time required these types of systems can be used when the environment can be controlled to differentiate the object of interest from the remaining components of the scene or when a pattern or silhouette in a region of interest contains sufficient information to perform the logical operations ramesh et al 1995 differentiating between objects of the scene is the key to obtaining binary images this differentiation is possible through a procedure known as segmentation which allows separating foreground from the background commonly by applying a threshold arco et al 2015 image segmentation is a common technique that plays an important role in many areas of research such as medical applications pham et al 2000 chalana and kim 1997 sirisha et al 2013 milewski and govindaraju 2008 pattern recognition yasnoff et al 1977 zhang 1996 and geosciences grove and jerram 2011 among others once the image has been binarized through segmentation it is possible to compute shape properties features of the objects thus morphological operations are among the options that can be considered for implementing the image analysis implementations of binary image analysis using morphological operations are of interest in many applications some examples include periodontal health differentiation shrout et al 1998 blood cell analysis wang et al 2016 biological classification arco et al 2015 and optics wei et al 2009 among others although morphological operations for image analysis have been used in several areas haralick et al 1987 to the best of the authors knowledge there is not an open source image based procedure that includes binary image analysis based on morphological operations to measure water elevations in hydrodynamic applications the aim of the present work is to present an alternative and open source binary image based methodology to measure water elevations for two dimensional hydrodynamic experiments the proposed procedure includes image digitalization processing and analysis stages the image digitalization stage includes image acquisition using a monochromatic high speed camera and lens correction calibration and image stack generation using the open source software opencv and imagej the image processing is based on an intensity modulation operation and a pseudo color based segmentation over input gray scale images which yield the binary images finally in the third stage binary image analysis using basic morphological operations of the free orientation metrics class is performed to measure the wave elevations by area fraction or pixels density of specified regions of interest macro scripts for imagej were developed for the second and third stages of the methodology to verify the performance of the proposed approach shipping water on deck experiments using the wet dam break approach proposed by hernández fontes et al 2017b a were conducted water elevations obtained using the present methodology were compared with conventional wave probe measurements to justify the use of the proposed approach as an alternative method two case studies were considered for application the first case presented a single valued water surface whereas the second case presented a double valued water surface the remainder of this article is structured as follows section 2 presents the materials and methods including the description of the shipping water experiments the test cases conventional water elevation measurements and details of the proposed alternative methodology section 3 presents the results and discussions of the comparisons between the conventional and the virtual wave probe measurements finally the main conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 shipping water on deck experiments the experimental setup was constructed and installed at the ocean technology laboratory laboceano coppe ufrj facilities brazil a dam break type installation prismatic tank that was 1000 mm long 335 mm wide and 450 mm high was used to conduct the experiments a fixed structure was installed inside the tank to represent the deck of a vessel the tank was divided into two regions using a gate located at 505 mm from the internal structure fig 1 two different levels of water were defined downstream h 0 and upstream of the gate h 1 the setup corresponds to the wet dam break approach described by stoker 1957 when the gate is suddenly opened the upstream volume of water interacts with the downstream one forming a bore that travels along the tank and ships into the fixed structure a sketch of the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 more details can be found in hernández fontes et al 2017b a 2 2 test cases from the available experimental data two case studies have been selected to test the methodology proposed in the present study these cases are described in table 1 where h 0 and h 1 correspond to the initial water levels downstream and upstream of the gate respectively and f b represents the initial freeboard fig 1 the types of test cases presented in table 1 correspond to those where single and double valued water surfaces are observed 2 3 conventional water elevation measurements the water elevations of the incoming wave and water propagation on deck were obtained from wp5 and wp1 wp4 respectively using conventional wave probes fig 1 these sensors are conductive wave probes made of two stainless steel rods with a diameter of 2 4 mm placed 9 mm apart a wave probe amplifier model dhi 102e was used and data were acquired at a sampling rate of 500 hz signal conditioning and a d conversion from ni national instruments was used to acquire all the signals further details of the experimental setup can be found in hernández fontes et al 2017b the uncertainty in the calibration of the wave probes was estimated following the recommended procedures for uncertainty analysis and instrument calibration of the ittc international towing tank conference ittc 2008 for all the wave probes the estimated uncertainty was in the range of 2 mm 2 4 alternative water elevation measurements fig 2 shows the three stages of the image based methodology proposed as an alternative for measuring water elevations in the first stage the video images are acquired rectified and saved as calibrated gray scale stacks of images in the second stage these images are processed to obtain binary stacks in the third stage the binary images are analyzed using morphological operations to obtain the desired water elevation time series each of the three stages presented in fig 2 are further described in sections 2 4 1 2 4 3 2 4 1 image digitalization 2 4 1 1 image acquisition camera selection and illumination the evolution of water was captured using a monochromatic high speed qualisys oqus 310 camera with an additional nikon af dc nikkor 105 mm f 2d lens the camera has a cmos sensor with a resolution of 1 3 mpixel video data were captured at 500 fps using the full resolution image size of 1284 h 1024 v the camera was located perpendicularly to the profile view of the tank the software qualisys qtm was used for video acquisition the components of the image acquisition system are schematically shown in fig 3 characterization of the sampling area was performed by placing the camera with the lens at a distance of approximately 3 m from the side of the tank allowing a field of view fov of 500 mm h 450 mm v fig 3 this fov includes the structure and wave probes see for instance a typical frame size in fig 4 the image acquisition stage addresses two important points illumination setup and acquisition rate in the former the natural reflectance of the fluid has to be considered because it may yield irregular intensity values in different regions of the scene in the latter higher acquisition rates correspond to lower exposure times then the use of high gain levels in the acquisition device might be necessary which would increase the signal to noise ratio snr to address the problems described above a low reflectance fluid and an indirect illumination setup were considered in the present study for the former indigo dye blue dye was used to color and differentiate the water from other components of the scene for the latter led illumination was employed as schematically illustrated in fig 3 a 500 400 mm led panel was installed behind the vertical wall of the tank to illuminate the desired fov the light was diffused by a translucent paper sheet attached to the wall of the tank a led lamp was installed on the side of the tank to illuminate the longitudinal direction fig 5 shows the illumination system and the characterized low reflectance fluid 2 4 1 2 lens correction and image calibration lens correction and calibration of the acquired images were performed using a series of images of a circle pattern table lavision type 31 that were captured to cover the entire area of interest fig 4 next the camera lens coefficients were determined and the digitized images were undistorted these steps were performed using the open source computer vision library opencv 2018 then the images were saved as calibrated gray scale stacks of images using imagej 2 4 2 image processing the undistorted gray scale stacks of images were processed using four steps intensity modulation pseudo color transformation pseudo color segmentation and thresholding for binary stack generation as shown in fig 6 these steps were implemented in scripts for the open source software imagej for automated processing in the first step the calibrated gray scale stacks are allocated in the memory for intensity modulation to enhance the region of interest over the remainder of the images this type of approach is suitable when the elements in the image present similar contrast values arco et al 2015 for the present study the intensity range was modulated by increasing the contrast of the pixels within a given window range two parameters were defined prior to the processing using the imagej toolbox level and window which define the middle point and the width of the intensity range respectively the use of both parameters helps to highlight the intensities of pixels in order to facilitate the pseudo color transformation and segmentation fig 7 exemplifies the effects of level and window changes on the intensities of the pixels first the image considered as input fig 7a and the image with the default level and window parameters in the imagej toolbox fig 7b are shown then the effects of level and window variation around the default values on the intensity of the pixels are presented fig 7c f it can be noted that lower values for the level improve the fluid identification fig 7c d whereas lower values for the window enhance the dark elements in the scene fig 7e f thus the level and window values should be chosen by trials according to the user criteria to enhance the desired regions for the application considered a level equal to 219 and a window of 31 were selected for convenience for the present application trial and error and equally propagated to the entire stacks of images in the second step a pseudo color image enhancement is applied this process transforms the gray scale from the images into individual spaces where hue and saturation can also vary gray scale images colored in this manner can make feature identification easier for the observer radewan 1975 in the present study a simple red green blue rgb combination was used to generate the lut lookup table the results were colored images in which every intensity value has a corresponding rgb color resulting in 16 levels of rgb colors in the third step the pseudo colored images are segmented by their colors of channels rgb this process results in three new image stacks where the fluid is well differentiated from the remainder of the scene in at least one of the image stacks for convenience the blue channel color stack was chosen to implement the fourth step where otsu s method otsu 1979 was applied to transform the filtered channel images into a binary stack of images in which the fluid is filtered from the background this method was chosen because it resulted in binarized stacks with low levels of noise however there are other methods available in the imagej thresholder applet that can also be adopted whose results are similar to the one obtained by otsu s method as shown in fig 8 in the figure the results of different methods are compared demonstrating the alternatives for binarization with low levels of noise in the fluid region then the selection of the method must be done according to user s criteria in the present application otsu s method considers the blue range to filter the desired fluid area following a simple procedure an input gray scale image i m n from the segmented blue color channel and an output binary image o m n both with m rows and n columns of pixels are considered local descriptors of intensity are defined as α i j and β i j for the input and output images respectively in both images the indexes in the local descriptors 1 i m and 1 j n describe the coordinates of each pixel thus pixel s intensity values in the output images are defined by setting a threshold intensity parameter θ to the input images as follows 1 β i j 1 if α i j θ 0 otherwise for 1 i m and 1 j n the selection of θ depends on the segmented color range in the scene according to the adopted pseudo color lut 2 4 3 image analysis the processed stacks of binary images were analyzed through morphological operations of the free orientation metrics class e g area and centroid position at specified regions of interest the considered method named area fraction describes the density of pixels with an intensity value of 1 or 0 black or white respectively within a known region of interest roi in general the time variation of the area fraction of the fluid particles density of black color pixels inside rois is used to determine time series of water elevations at desired positions the mathematical interpretation of the followed approach may be expressed by denoting the total number of pixels in a roi by ℛ u v where u and v represent the number of rows and columns of pixels respectively to measure the water elevation h a at a desired position in the image it is necessary to define a roi with known u and v dimensions and to know the total number of black pixels inside the roi a b which is a software output the black pixels density or area fraction a is the ratio a b ℛ and consequently the water elevation h a in the roi i e in a specific point in time can be obtained as 2 h a u a u a b ℛ 2 4 4 error analysis the presence of error in the proposed methodology was identified during the stages of image digitalization and processing for the former stage error is mainly due to the setup location and orientation and lens distortion of the acquisition device for the latter stage error is generated by losing pixels during the image binarization in the present study the root mean square error rmse has been considered for analysis it represents the sample standard deviation of the differences between measured and reference values in other words the rmse corresponds to the standard deviation of the prediction errors i e residuals which allow to idealize how spread are the data points from the best fit line the root mean square error rmse can be calculated as follows 3 rsme 1 n k 1 n v m k v r k 2 1 2 where v m and v r are the measured obtained and reference values respectively and n corresponds to the number of observations the rmse in the image digitalization stage was calculated considering the resultant displacement between the labvision calibration board values reference values vr and the resultant dots positions of a rectified image of this board measured values vm considering n as the number of dots on the other hand the rmse in the image processing stage was evaluated from the differences in pixels between the stack of calibrated images input fig 9 a and the stack of binarized images output fig 9b the binarized images were set as masks over the input images as shown in fig 9c then the masks were subtracted yielding contours in the fluid surfaces fig 9d for each image the maximum number of pixels monitored in the vertical direction of the resultant contour was defined as v m k v r k in eq 3 then the rmse was calculated considering n as the number of images in the stack 3 results and discussion in this section image digitalization and processing errors are presented and data of virtual wave probes vwps obtained using the proposed methodology are compared with the results of the conventional wave probes wps shown in fig 1 the experimental cases of shipping water events have been considered before three dimensional effects on flow occur due to water impact on the vertical wall and backflow for comparison with wps 3 4 the longitudinal positions of the vwps were defined to be approximately 1 mm to the left of the positions of the wps to avoid the superposition of the roi of the vwps with the wps 3 1 image digitalization and processing errors in the image digitalization stage root mean square errors rmse of 9 1 and 3 2 pixels were obtained for the study cases 1 and 2 respectively these errors correspond respectively to 3 6 and 1 2 mm in the real world scale it can be considered based on the obtained rmse for both study cases that the setup and the lens distortion of the camera presented a combined rmse from 1 mm to 4 mm in the digitalization stage of the proposed method on the other hand in the image processing stage estimated rmse values did not exceed 1 64 pixels for cases 1 and 2 which corresponds to 0 6 mm in the real world scale supposing that the addition of the rmse values obtained for the image digitalization and processing is valid it might be assumed a global rmse of 4 2 and 1 8 mm for cases 1 and 2 respectively using the proposed image based methodology 3 2 case study 1 single valued water surface a sequence of representative frames during the shipping water event observed in the first case is presented in fig 10 these frames correspond to different stages of the shipping water including the initial condition before the formation of the wave fig 10a the instant at which the water level reaches the deck level fig 10b the development of a jet type front flow on the structure followed by a bulk body of water fig 10c and d and run up on the vertical wall before the backflow occurs fig 10e in this application case a single valued water surface is observed for all the instants considered fig 11 presents the comparisons of water elevation h time series obtained with the vwps and wps in the figures the highlighted points in time correspond to the stages shown in fig 10 fig 11a shows the comparison between a vwp and wp5 which monitored the water elevation time series of the incoming wave from t 0 s to t 0 4 s the water level corresponds to the initial condition in this interval the difference between the wp and vwp is approximately 0 6 mm it can be observed that the incoming wave elevations started to increase within the interval 0 4 s t 0 6 s then a maximum elevation is observed within 0 8 s t 0 9 s the peak values of the vwp and the wp present an elevation difference of 4 mm and a time shift of 0 026 s after the peak values a minimum occurs at t 1 07 s and both signals presented a closer agreement with a difference of approximately 1 mm fig 11b shows the comparison of water elevations of vwp with wp3 and wp4 which are located at the leading edge of the deck to monitor the freeboard exceedance measurements of the water elevations began within 0 7 s t 0 8 s then maximum h values for the signals were observed from 1 s t 1 2 s the wps presented a difference of approximately 4 mm in their maximum values which may be an indicator of small three dimensional effects on flow at this stage however the maximum value of the vwp was between the maxima of the wps after the peak the vwp again followed the trend of the wps with good agreement fig 11c shows the comparison of the vwp with the wps that are located near the vertical wall of the tank wp1 and wp2 at this part of the deck of the structure measurements of the water elevations began at t 1 s it is observed that the signals of wp1 and wp2 are very close and that the vwp follows their trend the measurements of all signals begin at almost the same point in time but there is overestimation from 5 to 10 mm in the vwp measurements however note that at the region near the vertical wall the camera captured some three dimensional effects on flow fig 10e which may be the main cause for overestimating the results of the wps it can be observed that root mean square error rmse values of water elevation measurements are also shown in fig 11 they were calculated by eq 3 considering the data of the wps as reference values and the data of the vwps as the measured values for the cases when the comparisons of the vwps were made against two wps the average values of the measurements of these last were considered for the calculation the lowest rmse 3 mm was obtained for the probes located outside the structure on the other hand rmse values of 4 mm and 5 mm were obtained for the wave probes located at the beginning and at the end of the structure respectively in fig 11 the measurements given by the vwps seem to be in good agreement with those given by the wps even though the rmse values suggest the presence of error in the comparisons however it can be attributed to the errors identified in the use of the image based methodology and in the calibration of the conventional probes considered as reference furthermore the shift observed between the vwp and wp data curves may be partially attributed to some error caused during the setup of the positions of the vwps also three dimensional effects on flow visualized by the camera may be another source of error that could contribute to the overestimation in measurements 3 3 case study 2 double valued water surface fig 12 presents the main stages of the shipping water event considered for the second application case these stages include the initial condition where water is calm fig 12a the formation of a steep wave approaching the structure fig 12b a fluid arm rising at the bow of the structure and forming a large cavity over the deck fig 12c the plunging wave hitting the deck and the water impact and runup on the vertical wall fig 12d and e respectively this case study presents a single valued water surface during the wave propagation and a double valued water surface case during the shipping water event due to the formation of a large cavity it should be noted that conventional wave probes were located in regions where the free surface is always single valued fig 13 shows the comparison of vwps with wps the main stages presented in fig 12 are indicated in the comparisons for illustrative purposes the comparison of the vwp with wp5 is shown in fig 13a for the initial condition 0s t 0 5 s there is a difference of approximately 1 mm between the wp and the vwp then for t 0 5 s water elevations measured by the wp and vwp gradually increase until reaching a peak value at approximately t 0 8 s at the peaks some oscillations in the data are observed probably due to the irregularity formed at the wave crest observed in fig 12b considering the maximum elevation of both the wp and vwp signals a water elevation difference of 2 5 mm and a time shift of 0 046 s are observed after the peak minimum values are observed for both probes presenting an elevation difference of 1 8 mm and a time shift of 0 01 s fig 13b presents the comparison of vwp with wp3 and wp4 for all the probes measurement of the water elevation began within 0 8 s t 0 85 s then peak values were reached within 0 95 s t 1 0 s the difference between the peak values of wp3 and wp4 is 1 mm whereas the difference between these values and the vwp peak value is approximately 9 mm after the peak the vwp results presented an excellent agreement with the wp results the comparison of the vwp against wp1 and wp2 is shown in fig 13c when t 1 0 the probes began measuring the elevations the vwp results were in good agreement with the wp results even at the maximum values where some oscillations are observed these oscillations may be attributed to drops or irregular water surface measured at the region near the tank wall for this case the method performed well as in case study 1 moreover the differences in the results are also similar to those observed for case 1 small temporal shifts in the vwp signals relative to the wp signals were observed and maximum and minimum values presented differences of some millimeters between them however the trend of wps was closely followed in the comparisons of fig 13 rmse values were also estimated as in the case 1 in the present case the rmse values for all the comparisons are between 6 mm and 10 mm which indicates larger errors than the ones observed in case 1 causes of these errors may be similar to the ones described for the case 1 however as observed from video data the three dimensional effects of flow might have a significant error contribution in the present type of shipping water in general it can be verified from the comparisons that the proposed methodology allows capturing water elevation values that are close to those measured by wps in the regions where three dimensional effects are less excited 3 3 1 double valued water surface apparent and effective water height measuring water elevations using vwps at specified rois in regions where a double valued water surface is presented such as in fig 12c and d requires considering that there is an apparent water elevation assumed from the reference considered e g structure surface to the upper water elevation ul see fig 14 a for details however using this value to estimate the amount of water shipped results in an unreal value because this is not the effective elevation of the water shipped due to the double valued water surface formed by the trapped air this situation may yield false water elevation measurements using conventional wave probes yao and wu 2005 by using the current approach it is possible to define the effective water height as ul ll where ll is the lower water elevation thereby improving the estimation of the shipping water volume the applicability of the proposed approach for measuring the effective water height in the double valued water surface region observed in case 2 has been tested using a vwp located at a distance of x d 30 mm from the deck edge considering the deck as the reference fig 14a because no wp data are available that allow comparing the results at the vwp position time series of ul and ll were measured frame by frame every 0 01 s using imagej tools to obtain the effective water height ul ll which was compared with the results of the proposed approach fig 14b shows the water elevations on the deck h d monitored by the vwp in this figure the time series of ul ll and the effective water height are compared with the results obtained with the proposed method area fraction the results demonstrate that the proposed approach indeed accounts for the effective water height in fig 14b the square markers indicate points in time of six stages that show in detail the cavity evolution from binarized images which are illustrated in fig 15 at t 0 90 s fig 15a the vwp begins measuring the area fraction then the peak value is attained at approximately t 0 98 s fig 15b and the large plunging wave develops on the deck as observed in fig 15c and d subsequently the trapped air starts fragmenting as observed in fig 15e at this stage a jump is observed in the data because the cavity is entrapped by the flow thus it was not possible to define the ll by observation due to the irregular features identified beneath the flow after this stage the double valued water surface disappears and a single valued water surface is recovered as shown in fig 14b the results suggest that the proposed methodology allows accounting for the effective water height in specified rois however if it is desired to account for the lower water elevation ll or cavity height a simple image inversion operation can be applied to the binary stack of images to convert white pixels into black pixels thereby allowing the methodology to be applied by defining adequate roi heights 4 conclusions an open source and practical methodology was proposed as an alternative for measuring water elevations in two dimensional hydrodynamic applications using binary image analysis the proposed method includes image digitalization processing and analysis stages in the image digitalization stage differentiation of the fluid from the other components of the scene was performed through coloring and using a led illumination arrangement then lens correction and calibration were performed on the obtained gray scale images the image processing was based on an intensity equalization operation and a pseudo color based segmentation yielding binarized images next binary image analysis was conducted using morphological operations of the free orientation metrics class this allowed monitoring the time variation of the area fraction or pixel density of specified regions of interest to obtain time series of water elevations at desired positions the complete procedure was implemented using open source software for the image digitalization stage lens correction and image calibration were performed using opencv libraries then calibrated image stacks were generated with imagej subsequently these stacks were used in the image processing and analysis stages for which scripts were developed to be implemented in imagej the performance of the proposed method was verified based on the experimental results of the shipping of water onto a fixed structure using the wet dam break approach in the experiments conductive wave probes at several positions were used to monitor the incoming wave and the shipping water on deck elevations a high speed camera was employed to capture details of the water evolution two types of shipping water were considered as the application cases the first one consisted of a case that presented a single valued water surface the second case presented a double valued water surface during the shipping of water on the structure due to a large cavity formed on the deck from the comparison with experiments it was observed that the measurements obtained using the proposed approach well captured the trend of the conventional sensors in general small time shifts and differences in water elevation measurements were observed in the comparisons possible reasons for these errors in the measurements may be related to small 3d effects presented in the flow and captured by the rois as well as the location of the vwp positions however considering the estimated margin of error the virtual and conventional wave probe measurements were in close agreement the second case study presented a special situation for water elevation measurements depending on the probe location in this case due to the formation of a cavity two water surfaces were observed it was confirmed that the present approach provides the time series of effective water heights defined by the observed lower and upper water elevations the proposed alternative methodology can be applied by using any video camera and differentiating the fluid from the other components of the scene this differentiation may be improved by coloring the fluid and using background illumination in a similar way as employed in the present study however the image processing script should be adapted according to the application updating the parameters for intensity regulation and thresholding the proposed methodology can be extended with other types of morphological operations and adapted to different hydrodynamic applications as future work the authors intend to extend the presented methodology to 3d measurements by considering different cameras views and to use additional morphological operations to extract other flow information such as flow velocities the data related to the presented cases i e calibrated image stacks the portable open source imagej software with the script files for image processing and analysis and a video tutorial of usage are available on the mendeley data repository doi 10 17632 9vwdgv2g5z 1 acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the support of anp and cnpq from

23432,autonomous underwater glider aug equips with limited battery capacity and needs to optimize the shape of aug to reduce power consumption and improve voyage this paper presents a new method of the multi objective optimization of aug shape based on the fast elitist non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii the slender ellipsoid line is chosen as the reference model and the volume of the model is constrained to keep 100 l the hull drag and the hull surface pressure are two key technical performance indicators variables are used for sensitivity analysis based on one at a time oat method comparisons between towing tank experiments and numerical simulation method is conducted to prove that this method is used for hydrodynamic analysis the original shape the nsga ii optimization shape the spray shape and the multi island genetic algorithm miga optimization shape are analyzed to verify the validity of the optimization method in this paper by comparing hydrodynamic performance and power conversion efficiency the simulation results indicate that the nsga ii shape obtains a better hydrodynamic performance than the others at the same wing configuration and gliding depth the voyage of the nsga ii shape is more than the original shape 12 which has great significance for reducing power consumption keywords autonomous underwater glider shape optimization multi objectives nsga ii genetic algorithm hydrodynamic power conversion efficiency 1 introduction underwater glider has a fixed horizontal wing and tail through the internal mass regulating device adjustment posture through the buoyancy regulating device to move vertically and horizontally in a saw tooth pattern through the water due to their ease of operation and low operational cost some typical gliders have already been successfully used in ocean environmental survey and resource detection hussain et al 2011 such as slocum schofield et al 2007 spray sherman et al 2001 seaglider eriksen et al 2001 and deepglider osse and eriksen 2007 as the demand for ocean exploration increases for some large scale longer lasting ocean phenomena the glider is required a long range and long time to continuously observe the oceanic phenomena and obtain more detailed and accurate data stuntz et al 2016 due to the limited internal volume of the glider it is not enough to achieve this technical indicator only to increase the battery capacity but also need to improve efficiency and reduce power consumption shape optimization is an important way this paper will study a multi objective shape optimization of glider which can provide technical support for the underwater glider with low drag high efficiency low power consumption and long voyage the traditional optimization method of the glider shape is mainly dependent on the experience of the designer based on the computational fluid dynamics cfd the slight change of glider shape parameters need to be re modeling meshing and numerical calculation with the drawback is that the workload is large and the efficiency is low s yamaguchi et al 2002 made calculations of the outflow field around the hull based on cfd and the shape was optimized to reduce the drag and to improve efficiency of the propeller in contrast some researchers have conducted a study of procedural design ting gao et al 2016 studied the myring type shape of hull by using the miga and the particle swarm optimization pso method only the drag was used as the optimization target the results proved the miga method get the better hull shape sun et al 2015 studied the parametric geometric model and shape optimization of a blended wing body underwater glider by using the kriging based genetic algorithm and the maximum gliding range was used as the optimization some bionics research also has begun zhengxing et al 2015 studied the shape of a dolphin which has a high mobility high speed and long range according to the principle of bionics the drag of the glider reduction can ensure a larger voyage and higher speed save the space occupied by the battery and increase the load capacity of the glider the hull pressure curve tends to be flatter can reduce the pressure extremum and postpone the boundary layer separation to avoid cavitation on the shell and reduce the form drag the hull drag and the hull surface pressure are the key technical indicators of the glider shape optimization which is a multi objective optimization problem in the traditional study of the optimal design of the glider shape one of the optimization goals is usually set as the objective function and the other as a constraint or multi objective optimization problem is decomposed into multiple single objective functions however it is difficult to obtain satisfactory optimization effect coello et al 2007 dhanalakshmi et al 2011 since the 1980s with the increasing demand for optimization of large scale complex systems the research and application of multi objective genetic algorithm moga have been widely carried out schaffer 1985 proposed a multi objective genetic algorithm which is called vector evaluated genetic algorithm vega fonseca and fleming 1993 proposed a multi objective genetic algorithm moga based on pareto rank ranking horn et al 1994 proposed niched pareto genetic algorithm npga based on pareto dominance deb et al 2002 developed the idea of goldberg and proposed a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga and put forward an improved version of nsga a classic algorithm which is named nsga ii combining the individual crowding distance cd and the non dominant sorting which makes the whole algorithm more perfect and has more superior performance this paper is divided into five sections section 2 briefly introduces the multi objective optimization problem of the aug shape section 3 describes the design and implementation of nsga ii algorithm section 4 verifies the accuracy of the numerical simulation method by comparing with the towing tank experiments and compares the hydrodynamic performance and power conversion efficiency of the four shapes section 5 provides the conclusion 2 multi objective optimization problem for aug shape 2 1 parametric model of slender elliptical line the slender ellipsoid line is widely used in underwater vehicles because of its good hydrodynamic performance and manufacture characteristics such as the spray stephen 2009 fig 1 shows the parametric model of the slender ellipsoid line which is divided into three lengths l b l c l t for bow central and tail part and d is the diameter at the central part and two shape exponents n p and n q the origin of the coordinate system is located at the head of the glider the x axis coincides with the glider axis and points to the tail the z axis points vertically upwards and the y axis follows the right handed system the bow the central and the tail radius follow from alvarez et al 2009 1 r b d 2 1 l b x l b n p 1 1 n q 1 r c d 2 r t d 2 1 x l b l c l t n p 2 1 n q 2 where r b is the y axis coordinate at the bow position x r c is the y axis coordinate at the central part r t is the y axis coordinate at the tail position x 2 2 optimization objective and decision variables the volume of the glider is kept at 100 l at the optimization processing because the glider internal energy load is limited hull drag should be as small as possible to achieve the long range this is the primary optimization target hull surface pressure on the glider power consumption will also have great impact in which too fast change of bow pressure will lead to premature separation of the boundary layer and fast change of tail pressure will produce a flow separation and finally produce tail vortex the distribution of the hull surface pressure should be flatter when sailing underwater the glider produces a pressure extremum in the bow and tail part which forms the pressure bipolar structure the optimization of glider shape should reduce the curvature

population until the number of the new parent populations pt 1 reaches n 3 2 mathematical formulation of the hull drag traditionally the glider hull drag is split up into three part frictional form and wave drag components because the glider most of its time sailing in the deep sea there is no consideration of wave drag generated when sailing near the surface the friction drag is caused by viscosity the no slip fluid mass on the wall is subject to shearing deformation by the action of its adjacent moving mass resulting in shear stress which is in the direction of the relative velocity on the integral which plays the role of the viscous frictional drag on the object in this paper the frictional drag coefficient c f is calculated by the ittc 1987 standard which is used to predict the surface friction drag coefficient of the hull arribas 2007 5 c f 0 075 lg re 2 2 under the condition that the fluid viscosity is constant due to the bow pressure exceeding the tail pressure the form drag is a resultant force acting on the object in relation to the direction of movement of the fluid the form drag is related to the shape which changes greatly compared to the frictional drag and for the streamlined object the form drag is small and the pressure change from the bow to the tail is so slow that the whole process of the boundary layer to the tail is not stalled hendrix et al 2001 proposed the form factor 1 k as a function of the glider hull length l h and hull diameter d as follows 6 1 k 1 1 5 d l h 1 5 7 d l h 3 the hull total drag is calculated in eq 7 7 f 1 ρ v 2 a s c f 1

solving the three dimensional objects in the incompressible and non viscous flow field the model follows the work of hess and smith percival et al 2001 the basic method is to divide the face on the surface of the three dimensional object and set a density of particles on the face by simulating the boundary conditions the normal velocity of the surface is 0 and the integral equation about the intensity of the particle is obtained the integral equation is transformed into a series of linear equations to obtain the law of the distribution of the density of the particles on the object surface and the velocity and pressure distribution of the flow field can be obtained djojodihardjo and widnall 2015 assuming the steady irrotational flow of an inviscid and incompressible fluid past the

reads the file and generates the initial 3d mesh in order to carry out a primary simulation in fluent according to the simulation data analyze the hydrodynamic and power conversion efficiency to determine whether the need for further optimization the nsga ii genetic algorithm is implemented by matlab software the matlab script is divided into the genetic algorithms and the objective functions the genetic algorithms include the initialization script the genetic operator script and the elitist policy script the objective functions include the drag model and the surface pressure model the nsga ii optimization process is shown follows step 1 input variables and parameters step 2 randomly initialize a parent population with n individuals step 3 rank the population by non dominated and calculate the cd so that each individual gets two criteria which are non dominated and cd select the individual with lower rank and higher cd to the mating pool produce the off spring populations of n

from all pareto front sets table 2 describe comparison of the parameters of the original and optimized glider shape the results show that optimized shape increases the diameter the bow increased from 0 4 m to 0 65 m the tail increased from 0 4 m to 0 8 m and wet surface area reduction percentage is 22 1 3 6 sensitivity analysis in order to distinguish the influence of variables on the objective function the sensitivity analysis of the variable is carried out sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the effect of variable changes on the model the high sensitivity parameters have a more important effect on the model the low sensitivity parameter has a little effect on the model when the coefficient is negative it has negative influence on the model when the coefficient is positive the model has a positive impact oat method is the simplest and most representative local method which evaluates variable sensitivity by sequentially perturbing one parameter at a time while keeping the other variables at their baseline values and it is easy to implement computationally inexpensive and useful to provide a glimpse at the model behavior saltelli 1999 castillo et al 2004 the sensitivity coefficient is defined as 19 s i k y k x i f n e t k j 1 n u m w i j v j k f n e t j where s i k is the sensitivity coefficient of the i th variable to the k th objective function y k is the k th objective function x i is the i th variable f n e t k and f n e t j are the partial derivatives of the k th activation function at the output layer the j th activation function at the hidden layer num is the number of hidden neurons w i j and v j k are the weight connecting input layer with a hidden layer and the weight connecting hidden layer with an output layer it is noted that the hidden layer has the same activation function as does the output layer fig 7 shows sensitivity coefficient for drag and pressure extremum coefficient it is demonstrated that d l c have a large positive effect on the drag which means that the drag can increase with the variable l b l t n q 1 n q 2 have a little negative effect on the drag and n p 1 n p 2 can be ignored the effect d n p 1 n q 1 and n p 2 have positive effects on the pressure extremum coefficient and d has the greatest positive effect the effects of other variables can be ignored it is noted that d has a significant positive effect on the two objectives and far more than in the influence of other variables the hull length variables have a large effect on the drag and the shape exponents have a large effect on the pressure extremum coefficient 4 numerical simulation validation and analysis 4 1 frame definition and experiments model fig 8 shows the definition of body frame and inertial frame the inertial frame e e1e2e3 is taken an earth frame and accelerations may be neglected the e1 axis lies in the horizontal plane and the e3 axis lies in the gravity the e2 axis obey the right hand rule assuming the glider to be ellipsoidal the body frame o xyz reference point at the center of buoyancy cb the x axis lies along the long axis of the glider the y axis lies in the plane of the right wing and the z axis obey the right hand rule the pitch angle θ is the is the angle between the x axis and the e1 axis the angle of attack α is the angle between the gliding velocity v and the x axis the gliding angle γ is the angle between v and the e1 axis when gliding down γ and θ are defined as negative and α is positive when gliding up γ and θ are defined as positive and α is negative drag d in the opposite direction of v lift l in the vertical direction of v δ b is the net buoyancy in order to verify the validity of the optimization method in this paper the original shape the nsga ii optimization shape the spray shape and the miga optimization shape will be analyzed and the volume are maintained at 100 l the spray glider aimed to achieve a range of 4700 km and a depth of 1500 m it was designed primarily for long time long range and deep sea applications paying particular attention to low drag and power conversion efficiency with 50 lower drag than the slocum glider stephen 2009 gao et al 2016 studied the myring type shape of hull by using the miga algorithm and pso algorithm the shape drag was the optimization indicator the results shown that the minimum drag shape obtained using the miga is 3 4 less than the shape obtained using the pso the details of four typical shapes for comparison are shown in fig 9 4 2 numerical simulation validation in this paper numerical simulation is used to predict the hydrodynamic performance of the optimized shape and need to verify the accuracy of numerical simulation method regarding the problem of outflow field simulation the field setting should be large enough to avoid the influence of the field boundary as shown in fig 10 the field is a cylinder that surrounds the glider with a length of 5 5 l h l h is the total length of the glider and has a diameter of 3 l h the rotation axis coincides with the axis of symmetry of the glider and obeys the right handed system the distance between the inlet and the bow of glider is 1 5 l h the distance between the outlet and the tail of glider is 3 l h according to icem software meshing uses a structure gird to ensure the quality of the mesh of which the total number of meshes is 2 4 million the rng k ε realizable k ε and sst k ω turbulence model are selected to simulate incompressible flows joung et al 2012 wilcox 2006 the pressure coupling equations is solved by the algorithm of simplec and choose the second order upwind scheme the inlet is set as the velocity inlet the outlet is set as the pressure outlet the field wall is set as the slip wall and the underwater glider hull wall is set to no slip original glider has completed the tank towing experiment as shown in fig 11 the original model is manufactured in a 1 1 ratio and the model uses a metallic material to ensure that the model does not have a large deformation in 2 3 years the accuracy of the model is guaranteed to be 0 5 mm and the surface of the model is guaranteed to be smooth and has sufficient rigidity to prevent deformation experiment the drag point under the water 0 8 m to reduce the interference of water waves on the experimental data six axis dynamometer installed in the hull and support rod connection department used to measure glider force and moment the velocity of the glider is affected by factors such as gliding angles and net buoyancy generally speaking the velocity of the glider is slow to stay in the range of 0 5 to 2kn rudnick et al 2004 in order to validate the accuracy of the numerical simulation the numerical simulation results of the original glider are compared with the results of the tank towing experiment at the velocity of 0 5 to 3kn the results are as shown in fig 12 from the comparison of the simulation results and the experimental results it is indicated that the realizable k ε turbulence model with the experimental results of the maximum error is 9 2 at 1 5kn the sst k ω turbulence model with the experimental results of the maximum error is 12 5 at 1 5kn the rng k ε turbulence model are closest to the experiment results the maximum error is 4 5 at 2kn and the other errors are controlled below 5 in addition the experimental results are larger than the results of the rng k ε turbulence model the reason is that when the velocity increases the experiment water waves larger and glider drag is increased by the impact of wave drag the results calculated using the rng k ε turbulence model is reliable and this method can provide an effective way to predict the hydrodynamic performance of glider 4 3 hydrodynamic analysis fig 13 shows the simulation results of the four models at direct velocity of 0 5 to 3kn at the same velocity the drag of the shape is ordered as the original the miga the spray and the nsga ii where the drag of original shape is the largest and nsga ii shape is the lowest compared to the original the drag of the nsga ii shape is significantly reduced by 26 7 at 0 5kn 13 1 at 1kn 12 4 at 1 5kn 12 1 at 2kn 15 2 at 2 5kn and 15 8 at 3kn this is a significant reduction of drag for glider and the power consumption is reduced table 3 and fig 14 show the hull surface pressure results of the four shapes at the velocity of 0 5kn 0 angle of attack in comparison with the original shape the drag of the nsga ii reduction percentage is 26 7 and the shape drag reduction percentage is 47 8 which proves to be effective in optimizing the shape of the glider the friction drag and form drag of the spray slightly larger than the nsga ii the form drag of the miga is 2 5 times the nsga ii in comparison with the original shape the hull surface pressure extremum coefficient of the bow part c p b of the nsga is reduced 0 05 and the pressure extremum point shifted backwards 0 08 m the pressure extremum coefficient of the tail part c p t of the nsga ii is reduced 0 07 and the pressure extremum point forwards 0 3 m the c p b of the spray is better than the nsga ii but taking into account the bow part usually installs the sensor and needs more space the c p t of the nsga ii and the spray is little difference the c p b and the c p t of the miga is the maximum the reason is that the miga has the largest diameter and has the shape profile changes quickly fig 15 shows the streamline of the tail part it is known that if the streamline changes too fast it can cause particles in the boundary layer separation according to the fluid continuity requirements the tail fluid backflow take place under the action of the reverse pressure gradient the fluid particles away from the glider wall resulting in a vortex since the vortex is required to consume a large amount of kinetic energy the pressure of the tail is reduced and the pressure of the bow exceeds the pressure of the tail which result in the drag increasing along the direction of the flow direction in comparison with the original shape the fluid particles of the nsga ii in close contact with the boundary layer and no boundary layer separation and tail flow large vortex phenomenon effectively reducing the form drag there is no boundary layer separation and tail flow large vortex phenomenon between the spray and the miga from eq 20 it can be seen that γ and l d negatively related the higher l d is the smaller γ is and the farther the horizontal gliding distance is for the same gliding depth 20 tan γ tan θ α l d 1 2 h s where s is the single cycle horizontal gliding distance h is the gliding depth fig 16 shows the l d of the four shape at the same velocity 0 5kn and different angle of attack 0 10 in comparison with the original shape the l d of the nsga ii is improved 67 2 at 2 46 6 at 4 43 1 at 6 31 8 at 8 26 2 at 10 it is clear that the l d of the glider is also related to the configuration of the wing but from the hull shape of the glider optimization effect the l d has been significantly improved this is of great significance for the realization of the long range aug the l d of the spray and the miga is lower than the nsga ii the spray is lower 8 at 2 the miga is lower 7 8 at 10 4 4 power conversion efficiency analysis hull drag and surface pressure are important indicators of glider performance but the power consumption of glider needs to be analyzed the power conversion efficiency is proposed which characterizes the ratio of the power consumption in the horizontal direction to the net buoyancy potential output in the vertical direction the larger the ratio is the higher the power conversion efficiency is chen yijun et al 2015 the kinematic and equilibrium relations of the steady state gliding motion can be expressed as 21 m g x g cos θ z g sin θ m l sin γ d cos γ 0 l cos γ d sin γ δ b where m is the quality of mass regulating block m is the pitch torque x g z g is the centroid coordinates based on eq 20 22 γ arctan d l velocity is decomposed as 23 u v cos γ w v sin γ where u is the horizontal gliding velocity w is the vertical gliding velocity the power conversion can be expressed as 24 η f x s f z h f x u t f z w t l sin γ cos γ l cos γ d sin γ sin γ where f x is the horizontal force f z is the vertical force t is the single gliding cycle l is mainly provided by the horizontal wing in order to ensure a single variable the four hull using the same horizontal wing selection and layout wing profile is naca0012 horizontal wingspan is 1 m chord length is 0 1 m aspect ratio 10 sweep angle is 40 the installation location locate 1 3 m away from the head from eq 24 shows that the power conversion has nothing to do with gliding velocity simulation velocity at 0 5kn fig 17 is the pressure distribution of the glider fig 18 shows the gliding angle the l d and the power conversion at different angle of attack the gliding angle with the angle of attack first reduced and then slowly increased where the minimum gliding angle at 6 the original is 18 3 the nsga ii is 16 5 the spray is 17 4 and the miga is 17 6 the l d with the angle of attack first increased and then slowly reduced where the maximum l d at 6 or 7 the original is 3 03 the nsga ii is 3 37 the spray is 3 20 and the miga is 3 16 the power conversion with the angle of attack first increased and then slowly reduced where the maximum power conversion efficiency at 6 the original is 90 1 the nsga ii is 92 3 the spray is 91 1 and the miga is 90 9 the simulation results are consistent with eq 20 it shows that the smaller the gliding angle is the bigger the l d is and the higher the power conversion efficiency is at the same wing configuration and gliding depth the voyage of the nsga ii shape is more than the original shape 12 5 conclusion in this paper the multi objective optimization strategy is used to optimize the slender ellipsoid shape of glider by using the nsga ii algorithm the objective function of the hull drag and the surface pressure are established and the multi objective optimization algorithm is realized with the application of matlab software the four typical glider shape are chosen for hydrodynamic analysis by using the validated numerical simulation method at the same wing configuration the power conversion of four shape was compared conclusions are as follows 1 sensitivity analysis shows that the different variables have different influence on the objectives the hull diameter and the hull length have a greater positive effect on the drag increasing while hull diameter and the shape exponents have a greater positive effect on the change of the hull pressure extremum coefficient and point 2 comparison with the tank towing experiment the maximum error of the rng k ε turbulence model is 4 5 at 2kn which proves the accuracy of the numerical simulation method the hydrodynamic analysis shows that the nsga ii algorithm obtains a better shape than the other methods compared with the original shape the drag of the nsga ii shape is reduced 26 7 at 0 5kn of which the form drag reduction percentage is 47 8 the pressure distribution is flatter the boundary layer is not separated and the tail vortex is not generated the l d is improved 67 2 at 2 3 at the same wing configuration and gliding depth the power conversion efficiency of the shape is ordered as the nsga

nsga ii genetic algorithm hydrodynamic power conversion efficiency 1 introduction underwater glider has a fixed horizontal wing and tail through the internal mass regulating device adjustment posture through the buoyancy regulating device to move vertically and horizontally in a saw tooth pattern through the water due to their ease of operation and low operational cost some typical gliders have already been successfully used in ocean environmental survey and resource detection hussain et al 2011 such as slocum schofield et al 2007 spray sherman et al 2001 seaglider eriksen et al 2001 and deepglider osse and eriksen 2007 as the demand for ocean exploration increases for some large scale longer lasting ocean phenomena the glider is required a long range and long time to continuously observe the oceanic phenomena and obtain more detailed and accurate data stuntz et al 2016 due to the limited internal volume of the glider it is not enough to achieve this technical indicator only to increase the battery capacity but also need to improve efficiency and reduce power consumption shape optimization is an important way this paper will study a multi objective shape optimization of glider which can provide technical support for the underwater glider with low drag high efficiency low power consumption and long voyage the traditional optimization method of the glider shape is mainly dependent on the experience of the designer based on the computational fluid dynamics cfd the slight change of glider shape parameters need to be re modeling meshing and numerical calculation with the drawback is that the workload is large and the efficiency is low s yamaguchi et al 2002 made calculations of the outflow field around the hull based on cfd and the shape was optimized to reduce the drag and to improve efficiency of the propeller in contrast some researchers have conducted a study of procedural design ting gao et al 2016 studied the myring type shape of hull by using the miga and the particle swarm optimization pso method only the drag was used as the optimization target the results proved the miga method get the better hull shape sun et al 2015 studied the parametric geometric model and shape optimization of a blended wing body underwater glider by using the kriging based genetic algorithm and the maximum gliding range was used as the optimization some bionics research also has begun zhengxing et al 2015 studied the shape of a dolphin which has a high mobility high speed and long range according to the principle of bionics the drag of the glider reduction can ensure a larger voyage and higher speed save the space occupied by the battery and increase the load capacity of the glider the hull pressure curve tends to be flatter can reduce the pressure extremum and postpone the boundary layer separation to avoid cavitation on the shell and reduce the form drag the hull drag and the hull surface pressure are the key technical indicators of the glider shape optimization which is a multi objective optimization problem in the traditional study of the optimal design of the glider shape one of the optimization goals is usually set as the objective function and the other as a constraint or multi objective optimization problem is decomposed into multiple single objective functions however it is difficult to obtain satisfactory optimization effect coello et al 2007 dhanalakshmi et al 2011 since the 1980s with the increasing demand for optimization of large scale complex systems the research and application of multi objective genetic algorithm moga have been widely carried out schaffer 1985 proposed a multi objective genetic algorithm which is called vector evaluated genetic algorithm vega fonseca and fleming 1993 proposed a multi objective genetic algorithm moga based on pareto rank ranking horn et al 1994 proposed niched pareto genetic algorithm npga based on pareto dominance deb et al 2002 developed the idea of goldberg and proposed a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga and put forward an improved version of nsga a classic algorithm which is named nsga ii combining the individual crowding distance cd and the non dominant sorting which makes the whole algorithm more perfect and has more superior performance this paper is divided into five sections section 2 briefly introduces the multi objective

towing tank experiments and compares the hydrodynamic performance and power conversion efficiency of the four shapes section 5 provides the conclusion 2 multi objective optimization problem for aug shape 2 1 parametric model of slender elliptical line the slender ellipsoid line is widely used in underwater vehicles because of its good hydrodynamic performance and manufacture characteristics such as the spray stephen 2009 fig 1 shows the parametric model of the slender ellipsoid line which is divided into three lengths l b l c l t for bow central and tail part and d is the diameter at the central part and two shape exponents n p and n q the origin of the coordinate system is located at the head of the glider the x axis coincides with the glider axis and points to the tail the z axis points vertically upwards and the y axis follows the right handed system the bow the central and the tail radius follow from alvarez et al 2009 1 r b d 2 1 l b x l b n p 1 1 n q 1 r c d 2 r t d 2 1 x

objective and decision variables the volume of the glider is kept at 100 l at the optimization processing because the glider internal energy load is limited hull drag should be as small as possible to achieve the long range this is the primary optimization target hull surface pressure on the glider power consumption will also have great impact in which too fast change of bow pressure will lead to premature separation of the boundary layer and fast change of tail pressure will produce a flow separation and finally produce tail vortex the distribution of the hull surface pressure should be flatter when sailing underwater the glider produces a pressure extremum in the bow and tail part which forms the pressure bipolar structure the optimization of glider shape should reduce the curvature of the line so that the pressure extremum position is delayed and the hull pressure distribution tends to be flat n p n q determine the curvature of the line which mainly affects the hull pressure distribution usually 1 n p 3 1 n q 3 the glider geometry model contains many parameters and these parameters affect hydrodynamic performance and navigation characteristics considering the advantages and disadvantages the following eight controlled parameters are selected as decision variables table 1 lists the boundaries of this variables 3 design and implementation of nsga ii genetic algorithm the basic idea and operation method of nsga ii genetic algorithm has been very standardized however the multi objective optimization problem of the aug shape needs to center around the initial parameter setting and the object function design 3 1 initial parameters the population size and iteration times of the nsga ii algorithm affect the optimization performance and optimization efficiency the small number of populations and the smaller number of iterations lead to the poor performance of the algorithm and tend to get the local optimal solution and error solution the large number of

size and number of iterations is crucial to the optimization results and optimization efficiency of the algorithm in this paper the population size is 300 and the number of iterations is 180 because

population until the number of the new parent populations pt 1 reaches n 3 2 mathematical formulation of the hull drag traditionally the glider hull drag is split up into three part frictional form and wave drag components because the glider most of its time sailing in the deep sea there is no consideration of wave drag generated when sailing near the surface the friction drag is caused by viscosity the no slip fluid mass on the wall is subject to shearing deformation by the action of its adjacent moving mass resulting in shear stress which is in the direction of the relative velocity on the integral which plays the role of the viscous frictional drag on the object in this paper the frictional drag coefficient c f is calculated by the ittc 1987 standard which is used to predict the surface friction drag coefficient of the hull arribas 2007 5 c f 0 075 lg re 2 2 under the condition that the fluid viscosity is constant due to the bow pressure exceeding the tail pressure the form drag is a resultant force acting on the object in relation to the direction of movement of the fluid the form drag is related to the shape which changes greatly compared to the frictional drag and for the streamlined object the form drag is small and the pressure change from the bow to the tail is so slow that the whole process of the boundary layer to the tail is not stalled hendrix et al 2001 proposed the form factor 1 k as a function of the glider hull length l h and hull diameter d as follows 6 1 k 1 1 5 d l h 1 5 7 d l h 3 the hull total drag is calculated in eq 7 7 f 1 ρ v 2 a s c f 1

solving the three dimensional objects in the incompressible and non viscous flow field the model follows the work of hess and smith percival et al 2001 the basic method is to divide the face on the surface of the three dimensional object and set a density of particles on the face by simulating the boundary conditions the normal velocity of the surface is 0 and the integral equation about the intensity of the particle is obtained the integral equation is transformed into a series of linear equations to obtain the law of the distribution of the density of the particles on the object surface and the velocity and pressure distribution of the flow field can be obtained djojodihardjo and widnall 2015 assuming the steady irrotational flow of an inviscid and incompressible fluid past the

reads the file and generates the initial 3d mesh in order to carry out a primary simulation in fluent according to the simulation data analyze the hydrodynamic and power conversion efficiency to determine whether the need for further optimization the nsga ii genetic algorithm is implemented by matlab software the matlab script is divided into the genetic algorithms and the objective functions the genetic algorithms include the initialization script the genetic operator script and the elitist policy script the objective functions include the drag model and the surface pressure model the nsga ii optimization process is shown follows step 1 input variables and parameters step 2 randomly initialize a parent population with n individuals step 3 rank the population by non dominated and calculate the cd so that each individual gets two criteria which are non dominated and cd select the individual with lower rank and higher cd to the mating pool produce the off spring populations of n individuals by selecting crossing and mutating step 4 merger the parent and the offspring population select the new parent population based on the elitist strategy and replace the old population step 5 the new parent population is selected crossed and mutated to form a new off spring population with n individuals cycling to the step 3 the cross operator value is 0 9 and the mutate operator value is 0 1 step 6 when the maximum generation is satisfied the loop ends and its output is the solution 3 5 optimization solution considering the related factors a best compromise solution is selected from all pareto front sets table 2 describe comparison of the parameters of the original and optimized glider shape the results show that optimized shape increases the diameter the bow increased from 0 4 m to 0 65 m the tail increased from 0 4 m to 0 8 m and wet surface area reduction percentage is 22 1 3 6 sensitivity analysis in order to distinguish the influence of variables on the objective function the sensitivity analysis of the variable is carried out sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the effect of variable changes on the model the high sensitivity parameters have a more important effect on the model the low sensitivity parameter has a little effect on the model when the coefficient is negative it has negative influence on the model when the coefficient is positive the model has a positive impact oat method is the simplest and most representative local method which evaluates variable sensitivity by sequentially perturbing one parameter at a time while keeping the other variables at their baseline values and it is easy to implement computationally inexpensive and useful to provide a glimpse at the model behavior saltelli 1999 castillo et al 2004 the sensitivity coefficient is defined as 19 s i k y k x i f n e t k j 1 n u m w i j v j k f n e t j where s i k is the sensitivity coefficient of the i th variable to the k th objective function y k is the k th objective function x i is the i th variable f n e t k and f n e t j are the partial derivatives of the k th activation function at the output layer the j th activation function at the hidden layer num is the number of hidden neurons w i j and v j k are the weight connecting input layer with a hidden layer and the weight connecting hidden layer with an output layer it is noted that the hidden layer has the same activation function as does the output layer fig 7 shows sensitivity coefficient for drag and pressure extremum coefficient it is demonstrated that d l c have a large positive effect on the drag which means that the drag can increase with the variable l b l t n q 1 n q 2 have a little negative effect on the drag and n p 1 n p 2 can be ignored the effect d n p 1 n q 1 and n p 2 have positive effects on the pressure extremum coefficient and d has the greatest positive effect the effects of other variables can be ignored it is noted that d has a significant positive effect on the two objectives and far more than in the influence of other variables the hull length variables have a large effect on the drag and the shape exponents have a large effect on the pressure extremum coefficient 4 numerical simulation validation and analysis 4 1 frame definition and experiments model fig 8 shows the definition of body frame and inertial frame the inertial frame e e1e2e3 is taken an earth frame and accelerations may be neglected the e1 axis lies in the horizontal plane and the e3 axis lies in the gravity the e2 axis obey the right hand rule assuming the glider to be ellipsoidal the body frame o xyz reference point at the center of buoyancy cb the x axis lies along the long axis of the glider the y axis lies in the plane of the right wing and the z axis obey the right hand rule the pitch angle θ is the is the angle between the x axis and the e1 axis the angle of attack α is the angle between the gliding velocity v and the x axis the gliding angle γ is the angle between v and the e1 axis when gliding down γ and θ are defined as negative and α is positive when gliding up γ and θ are defined as positive and α is negative drag d in the opposite direction of v lift l in the vertical direction of v δ b is the net buoyancy in order to verify the validity of the optimization method in this paper the original shape the nsga ii optimization shape the spray shape and the miga optimization shape will be analyzed and the volume are maintained at 100 l the spray glider aimed to achieve a range of 4700 km and a depth of 1500 m it was designed primarily for long time long range and deep sea applications paying particular attention to low drag and power conversion efficiency with 50 lower drag than the slocum glider stephen 2009 gao et al 2016 studied the myring type shape of hull by using the miga algorithm and pso algorithm the shape drag was the optimization indicator the results shown that the minimum drag shape obtained using the miga is 3 4 less than the shape obtained using the pso the details of four typical shapes for comparison are shown in fig 9 4 2 numerical simulation validation in this paper numerical simulation is used to predict the hydrodynamic performance of the optimized shape and need to verify the accuracy of numerical simulation method regarding the problem of outflow field simulation the field setting should be large enough to avoid the influence of the field boundary as shown in fig 10 the field is a cylinder that surrounds the glider with a length of 5 5 l h l h is the total length of the glider and has a diameter of 3 l h the rotation axis coincides with the axis of symmetry of the glider and obeys the right handed system the distance between the inlet and the bow of glider is 1 5 l h the distance between the outlet and the tail of glider is 3 l h according to icem software meshing uses a structure gird to ensure the quality of the mesh of which the total number of meshes is 2 4 million the rng k ε realizable k ε and sst k ω turbulence model are selected to simulate incompressible flows joung et al 2012 wilcox 2006 the pressure coupling equations is solved by the algorithm of simplec and choose the second order upwind scheme the inlet is set as the velocity inlet the outlet is set as the pressure outlet the field wall is set as the slip wall and the underwater glider hull wall is set to no slip original glider has completed the tank towing experiment as shown in fig 11 the original model is manufactured in a 1 1 ratio and the model uses a metallic material to ensure that the model does not have a large deformation in 2 3 years the accuracy of the model is guaranteed to be 0 5 mm and the surface of the model is guaranteed to be smooth and has sufficient rigidity to prevent deformation experiment the drag point under the water 0 8 m to reduce the interference of water waves on the experimental data six axis dynamometer installed in the hull and support rod connection department used to measure glider force and moment the velocity of the glider is affected by factors such as gliding angles and net buoyancy generally speaking the velocity of the glider is slow to stay in the range of 0 5 to 2kn rudnick et al 2004 in order to validate the accuracy of the numerical simulation the numerical simulation results of the original glider are compared with the results of the tank towing experiment at the velocity of 0 5 to 3kn the results are as shown in fig 12 from the comparison of the simulation results and the experimental results it is indicated that the realizable k ε turbulence model with the experimental results of the maximum error is 9 2 at 1 5kn the sst k ω turbulence model with the experimental results of the maximum error is 12 5 at 1 5kn the rng k ε turbulence model are closest to the experiment results the maximum error is 4 5 at 2kn and the other errors are controlled below 5 in addition the experimental results are larger than the results of the rng k ε turbulence model the reason is that when the velocity increases the experiment water waves larger and glider drag is increased by the impact of wave drag the results calculated using the rng k ε turbulence model is reliable and this method can provide an effective way to predict the hydrodynamic performance of glider 4 3 hydrodynamic analysis fig 13 shows the simulation results of the four models at direct velocity of 0 5 to 3kn at the same velocity the drag of the shape is ordered as the original the miga the spray and the nsga ii where the drag of original shape is the largest and nsga ii shape is the lowest compared to the original the drag of the nsga ii shape is significantly reduced by 26 7 at 0 5kn 13 1 at 1kn 12 4 at 1 5kn 12 1 at 2kn 15 2 at 2 5kn and 15 8 at 3kn this is a significant reduction of drag for glider and the power consumption is reduced table 3 and fig 14 show the hull surface pressure results of the four shapes at the velocity of 0 5kn 0 angle of attack in comparison with the original shape the drag of the nsga ii reduction percentage is 26 7 and the shape drag reduction percentage is 47 8 which proves to be effective in optimizing the shape of the glider the friction drag and form drag of the spray slightly larger than the nsga ii the form drag of the miga is 2 5 times the nsga ii in comparison with the original shape the hull surface pressure extremum coefficient of the bow part c p b of the nsga is reduced 0 05 and the pressure extremum point shifted backwards 0 08 m the pressure extremum coefficient of the tail part c p t of the nsga ii is reduced 0 07 and the pressure extremum point forwards 0 3 m the c p b of the spray is better than the nsga ii but taking into account the bow part usually installs the sensor and needs more space the c p t of the nsga ii and the spray is little difference the c p b and the c p t of the miga is the maximum the reason is that the miga has the largest diameter and has the shape profile changes quickly fig 15 shows the streamline of the tail part it is known that if the streamline changes too fast it can cause particles in the boundary layer separation according to the fluid continuity requirements the tail fluid backflow take place under the action of the reverse pressure gradient the fluid particles away from the glider wall resulting in a vortex since the vortex is required to consume a large amount of kinetic energy the pressure of the tail is reduced and the pressure of the bow exceeds the pressure of the tail which result in the drag increasing along the direction of the flow direction in comparison with the original shape the fluid particles of the nsga ii in close contact with the boundary layer and no boundary layer separation and tail flow large vortex phenomenon effectively reducing the form drag there is no boundary layer separation and tail flow large vortex phenomenon between the spray and the miga from eq 20 it can be seen that γ and l d negatively related the higher l d is the smaller γ is and the farther the horizontal gliding distance is for the same gliding depth 20 tan γ tan θ α l d 1 2 h s where s is the single cycle horizontal gliding distance h is the gliding depth fig 16 shows the l d of the four shape at the same velocity 0 5kn and different angle of attack 0 10 in comparison with the original shape the l d of the nsga ii is improved 67 2 at 2 46 6 at 4 43 1 at 6 31 8 at 8 26 2 at 10 it is clear that the l d of the glider is also related to the configuration of the wing but from the hull shape of the glider optimization effect the l d has been significantly improved this is of great significance for the realization of the long range aug the l d of the spray and the miga is lower than the nsga ii the spray is lower 8 at 2 the miga is lower 7 8 at 10 4 4 power conversion efficiency analysis hull drag and surface pressure are important indicators of glider performance but the power consumption of glider needs to be analyzed the power conversion efficiency is proposed which characterizes the ratio of the power consumption in the horizontal direction to the net buoyancy potential output in the vertical direction the larger the ratio is the higher the power conversion efficiency is chen yijun et al 2015 the kinematic and equilibrium relations of the steady state gliding motion can be expressed as 21 m g x g cos θ z g sin θ m l sin γ d cos γ 0 l cos γ d sin γ δ b where m is the quality of mass regulating block m is the pitch torque x g z g is the centroid coordinates based on eq 20 22 γ arctan d l velocity is decomposed as 23 u v cos γ w v sin γ where u is the horizontal gliding velocity w is the vertical gliding velocity the power conversion can be expressed as 24 η f x s f z h f x u t f z w t l sin γ cos γ l cos γ d sin γ sin γ where f x is the horizontal force f z is the vertical force t is the single gliding cycle l is mainly provided by the horizontal wing in order to ensure a single variable the four hull using the same horizontal wing selection and layout wing profile is naca0012 horizontal wingspan is 1 m chord length is 0 1 m aspect ratio 10 sweep angle is 40 the installation location locate 1 3 m away from the head from eq 24 shows that the power conversion has nothing to do with gliding velocity simulation velocity at 0 5kn fig 17 is the pressure distribution of the glider fig 18 shows the gliding angle the l d and the power conversion at different angle of attack the gliding angle with the angle of attack first reduced and then slowly increased where the minimum gliding angle at 6 the original is 18 3 the nsga ii is 16 5 the spray is 17 4 and the miga is 17 6 the l d with the angle of attack first increased and then slowly reduced where the maximum l d at 6 or 7 the original is 3 03 the nsga ii is 3 37 the spray is 3 20 and the miga is 3 16 the power conversion with the angle of attack first increased and then slowly reduced where the maximum power conversion efficiency at 6 the original is 90 1 the nsga ii is 92 3 the spray is 91 1 and the miga is 90 9 the simulation results are consistent with eq 20 it shows that the smaller the gliding angle is the bigger the l d is and the higher the power conversion efficiency is at the same wing configuration and gliding depth the voyage of the nsga ii shape is more than the original shape 12 5 conclusion in this paper the multi objective optimization strategy is used to optimize the slender ellipsoid shape of glider by using the nsga ii algorithm the objective function of the hull drag and the surface pressure are established and the multi objective optimization algorithm is realized with the application of matlab software the four typical glider shape are chosen for hydrodynamic analysis by using the validated numerical simulation method at the same wing configuration the power conversion of four shape was compared conclusions are as follows 1 sensitivity analysis shows that the different variables have different influence on the objectives the hull diameter and the hull length have a greater positive effect on the drag increasing while hull diameter and the shape exponents have a greater positive effect on the change of the hull pressure extremum coefficient and point 2 comparison with the tank towing experiment the maximum error of the rng k ε turbulence model is 4 5 at 2kn which proves the accuracy of the numerical simulation method the hydrodynamic analysis shows that the nsga ii algorithm obtains a better shape than the other methods compared with the original shape the drag of the nsga ii shape is reduced 26 7 at 0 5kn of which the form drag reduction percentage is 47 8 the pressure distribution is flatter the boundary layer is not separated and the tail vortex is not generated the l d is improved 67 2 at 2 3 at the same wing configuration and gliding depth the power conversion efficiency of the shape is ordered as the nsga ii the spray the miga and the original where the maximum power conversion efficiency at 6 the voyage of the nsga ii shape is more than the original shape 12 the multi objective optimization strategy based on naga ii algorithm has great significance for improvement the glider hydrodynamic performance and reducing power consumption acknowledgements this paper is supported by the national key r d

23433,this paper presents a straightforward implementation of cell based smoothed finite element method cs fem into fluid structure interaction from the arbitrary lagriangian eulerian perspective identical to the practice in solid mechanics cs fem is directly applied to viscous stress and pressure poisson equation in fluid problem minimum programming efforts are thus required to modify existing in house codes following an efficient grid moving strategy partitioned implicit coupling scheme based upon fixed point iterations is adopted to interconnect individual fields the proposed approach is validated against previously published data for several benchmarks visible improvements are exposed in predicted results along with flow induced phenomena keywords smoothed finite element method fluid structure interaction ale cbs incompressible fluid 1 introduction gradient smoothing is a helpful technique to stabilize nodal integration in galerkin meshless methods chen et al 2001 yoo et al 2004 liu and his colleagues liu et al 2007 proposed the smoothed finite element method sfem by incorporation of gradient smoothing into the traditional fem the essential idea behind sfem consists in modification of the compatible strain field whereby a galerkin model may deliver some superior properties this technique is saliently featured by its softened stiffness matrix which yields more accurate solution to discrete partial differential equations than fem at the expense of easy implementation and nearly equal cost after more than a decade of development a family of sfem models have been fostered on account of different smoothing domain modes the monograph liu and nguyen 2010 and the review article zeng and liu 1007 deeply inspect sfem s theoretical bases deliberately highlight its advantageous traits and vividly depict its versatility in a variety of disciplines computational fluid dynamics cfd as it stands probably becomes another subject of interest to sfem practitioners indeed steps are taken to study cfd related problems such as fluid structure interaction fsi zhang et al 2012 yao et al 2012 wang et al 2014 he 2016 however these scenarios simply deploy an outreach success in solid mechanics rather than a settlement customized for the navier stokes ns equations apparently the ns equations which constitute the principle of the majority of cfd problems do not suit sfem after introducing divergence theorem for this reason the underlying investments may be discouraged in cfd analyses to overcome this dilemma jiang et al 2018 proposed three schemes to interpolate nodal quantities of the convective acceleration for the cell based smoothed fem cs fem liu et al 2007 for the first time in jiang et al 2018 the incompressible fluid flows within the laminar region are attempted on the eulerian mesh the objective of this paper is to develop a simple smoothing treatment for fsi computation differing from jiang et al 2018 the fluid stress tensor is partially smoothed and thus the resultant implementation is as same as that in solid mechanics to make minimum modifications in available fe codes the natural preference is given to the simplest cs fem that is initiated on four node quadrilateral q4 element mesh the characteristic based split cbs scheme zienkiewicz et al 1999 nithiarasu et al 2006 is utilized to decouple the fluid velocity and pressure partitioned implicit coupling strategy he and zhang 2017 is preferred to interconnect individual fields due to its attractive simplicity furthermore sfem may diminish pressure sensitivity on dynamic boundaries for the fractional step method the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the basis of cs fem is briefly recalled in section 2 the equations governing fluid and solid media are depicted in sections 3 and 4 the mesh updating method is summarized in section 5 section 6 describes the partitioned implicit coupling algorithm numerical examples are investigated in section 7 and conclusions are drawn in the final section 2 brief on cs fem let us discretize a two dimensional computational domain ω into n el q4 elements exactly as in the standard fem such that ω ω 1 ω 2 ω n el and ω i ω j i j a q4 element is further subdivided into a set of complementary smoothing cells scs namely ω i ω i 1 ω i 2 ω i n s c where n s c is the number of scs within the element the gradient of a field variable q smoothing at a point x c within an sc is approximated in the form of 1 q x c ω q x φ x x c dω where means the gradient operator ω designates the sc and the heaviside type kernel φ fulfills yoo et al 2004 2 φ 0 and ω φ dω 1 applying gauss theorem into the right hand side of eq 1 yields 3 q x c γ q x n x φ x x c dγ ω q x φ x x c dω where γ is the boundary of ω and n is the unit outward normal of γ the smoothing kernel φ is given by 4 φ x x c 1 a c x ω 0 x ω where a c ω dω is the area of the sc substituting eq 4 into eq 3 we have 5 q x c γ q x n x φ x x c dγ 1 a c γ q x n x dγ where the gradient of a constant automatically vanishes the galerkin procedure gives the following approximation of q 6 q n i q i where n i is the shape function at node i the underline indicates a nodal quantity and einstein s summation is applied with the aid of eq 6 one can immediately rewrite eq 5 as 7 q x c n i x c q i 1 a c γ n i x n x dγ q i since one point gaussian quadrature is sufficiently accurate for line integral along each segment of γ the item enclosed within external brackets on the right hand side of eq 7 can be transformed to its algebraic form 8 n i x c 1 a c i 1 4 n i x i gp n x i gp l i where x i gp is the gaussian point of the boundary segment γ i and l i is the length of the i th segment as of now no coordinate transformation is involved and only shape functions are invoked to calculate the smoothed gradients a q4 element is partitioned into four quadrilateral scs relying on the stability condition liu et al 2007 the construction of shape functions for cs fem is illustrated in fig 1 of total nine nodes extra five nodes are generated to compute the smoothed shape functions by simply averaging those values at four corners liu et al 2007 dai and liu 2007 therefore no additional degrees of freedom are introduced into cs fem 3 fluid problem 3 1 governing equations let ω f ℝ 2 and 0 t be the fluid and temporal domains respectively ω f is bounded

solid the elastodynamics equation governing the conservation law of linear momentum reads as follow 27 ρ s d f s σ s 0 where ρ s is the structural density f s is the structural body force σ s is the cauchy stress and the structural damping is omitted material constants contain young s modulus e and poisson s ratio ν the plane stress assumption is made for the two dimensional case to accommodate the geometrical nonlinearity the saint venant kirchhoff constitutive model is assumed below 28 s d e and e 1 2 f t f i where s is the second piola kirchhoff stress tensor d stands for the constitutive

procedure is used with the finite element approximation to the displacement velocity and acceleration 32 d n d d n d d n d which generates the incremental equilibrium equation for dynamic analysis below 33 k n δ d r n 1 p n m s d n 1 where k represents the tangent stiffness matrix m s is the mass matrix δ d d n 1 d n is the increment of nodal displacement r is the external force and p is the internal force depending upon the geometrical nonlinearity it is necessary to iterate eq 33 in each load step until a required tolerance is satisfied this linearization is carried out by the modified newton raphson procedure using total lagrangian formulation bathe et al 1975 the mass of the body considered is assumed to be conserved in dynamic analysis hence the smoothed equilibrium iteration equation is written as 34 k n δ d k r n 1 p n 1 k 1 m s d n 1 k where k mean the k th iteration at the current time step and the tangent stiffness matrix is decomposed into linear and nonlinear parts namely k k l k nl the resultant matrices and vectors admit the following representation δ d k δ d k 1 δ d k m s m ˆ ω 0 s n t n dω r m ˆ ω s n t f s dω γ n s n t h s dγ k l ω 0 s b l t d b l dω k nl ω

procedure considering specific time discretization methods can be found in bathe et al 1975 braun and awruch 2009 4 4 time marching method the widespread availability of step by step time integration algorithms is seen in computational analyses of structural dynamics in this paper the structural movement is integrated in time with the generalized α method chung and hulbert 1993 to do this the semi discrete equation of motion is applied to a general midpoint within a time interval implying that the following modified equation holds 35 m s d n 1 α m c d n 1 α f k d n 1 α f r n 1 α f where m s c and k represent the mass damping and stiffness matrices respectively and 36a d n 1 α m 1 α m d n 1 α m d n 36b d n 1 α f 1 α f d n 1 α f d n 36c d n 1 α f 1 α f d n 1 α f d n 36d r n 1 α f 1 α f r n 1

2 β 2 β d n 38 d n 1 γ β δ t d n 1 d n γ β β d n γ 2 β 2 β δ t d n accordingly the generalized midpoint acceleration and velocity are given by 39 d n 1 α m 1 α m β δ t 2 d n 1 d n 1 α m β δ t d n 1 α

the rigid body dettmer and perić 2006a and ρ 0 5 for the elastic solid dettmer and perić 2006b in addition the smoothed internal force is calculated by kuhl and crisfield 1999 42 p n 1 α f 1 α f p n 1 α f p n 1 α f p d n 1 α f p d n while working on the elastic solid 5 mesh deformation method the imposition of interface conditions in time requires that the position of moving interface is accurately captured in the ale domain whilst maintaining the satisfactory mesh quality the present mesh deformation method adopts a blend of moving submesh approach msa lefrançois 2008 and the ortho semi torsional spring analogy model markou et al 2007 its fundamental principle comprises the following two stages spring analogy method assimilates the three node triangular t3 submesh to the structural motion msa creates a mapping between submesh s deformation and that of ale mesh in comparison with spring analogy methods our approach is capable of depressing time consumption of mesh updating while preserving the mesh topology the reader is referred to he et al 2012 2014 for thorough implementation 6 partitioned solution procedure 6 1 interface coupling conditions in partitioned scheme the interplay between the fluid and structure is accomplished via separately enforcing the velocity continuity and traction equilibrium on σ as follows 43 u d and t f t s where t f σ f n s and t s σ s n s are the fluid and structural tractions respectively n s represents the unit outward normal of σ pointing from the structure to the fluid and n f n s since the external force acting on the immersed rigid body is a concentrated load vector the stress equilibrium on σ becomes 44 σ t f dγ σ t s dγ and σ δ x t f dγ σ δ x t s dγ where δ x is the distance between surface point p and center of gravity g see fig 2 also the geometrical continuity is supplemented thanks to the dynamic mesh motion 45 x d and w d 6 2 partitioned implicit coupling algorithm the entire fsi system constitutes a coupled set of nonlinear algebraic equations to be solved for each time step we implicitly couple all interacting fields by the aid of fixed point iterations which compulsively enforce kinematic and kinetic compatibilities on σ for stability the present algorithm is elaborated below step 1 initialize all variables and set k 0 step 2 extrapolate the interface x σ n 1 k d σ n 3 2 d σ n 1 2 d σ n 1 δ t step

example an elastically mounted circular cylinder is allowed to freely oscillate under fully laminar flow condition the problem definition is plotted in fig 3 system parameters are identical to jaiman et al 2016 f r 0 2 ξ 0 r e 100 and 0 298 m ˆ 0 471 in fig 3 the computational domain is divided into the eulerian subdomain a1 the ale subdomain a2 and the lagrangian subdomain a3 for the sake of efficiency the nodes keep fixed in a1 while those in a3 move along with the cylinder only the nodes in a2 are continuously updated in fig 4 a the finite element mesh is composed of 8880 q4 elements and 9090 nodes and the corresponding submesh is demonstrated in fig 4 b the time step is δ t 1 0 10 2 and the relaxation factor is ω 0 5 the flow past the cylinder at m ˆ 0 471 is considered to study the mesh sensitivity two finite element meshes m1 8880 q4 elements and 9090 nodes and m2 15744 q4 elements and 16028 nodes are adopted to calculate several aerodynamic parameters the computed results are listed in table 1 including the mean value of horizontal amplitude d mean 1 and its root mean square error rmse d rmse 1 the peak of vertical amplitude d max 2 the mean value of drag coefficient c d mean and its rmse c d rmse the amplitude of lift coefficient c l max and the strouhal number s t the good agreement between the two sets of data establishes the validation for further calculations as a consequence m1 is selected for the purpose of accuracy and efficiency fig 5 shows the time history of fluid force coefficients and cylinder displacement for m ˆ 0 408 at which the failure of the strong staggered coupling ssc scheme based on the block iterative newton method is reported jaiman et al 2016 the present method has established highly stable and smooth responses of the light cylinder for long in the pictures fig 6 compares the present lift coefficient with that of jaiman et al 2016 at the same m ˆ both graphs evidently reveal that our c l is in excellent accordance with that computed by the nonlinear interface force correction nfic approach jaiman et al 2016 howbeit ssc method entirely fails at such a low mass ratio even more nonlinear subiterations are enforced between the incompressible fluid and rigid body attention shifts to the m ˆ 0 393 case now the comparison is made in fig 7 a with respect to d 2 at the very beginning because of the strong nature of fluid structure coupling the inherent instability in ssc scheme cannot be cured by reducing the time step size however the present coupling method completely avoids such an instability when the calculation is initialized seen from fig 7 b the admirable d 2 is convincingly produced throughout the vortex induced vibrations viv of the bluff body in sum the developed method never introduces loss of computational accuracy fig 8 shows the x 1 x 2 trajectory of the cylinder at different mass ratios illustrating that the present viv is a self limiting process zhou et al 1999 as subjected to uniform flows at low r e the circular cylinder takes on the nearly symmetrical trajectory that shapes the classical lissajous figure of 8 according to sarpkaya 2004 when a circular cylinder vibrates in both horizontal and vertical directions the common frequencies of the cylinder and driving forces in their respective directions may result in lock in and the cylinder s axis traces the path of the lissajous figure the eight type loops are caused by the significant variation of drag force during large amplitude oscillations the equilibrium position of the cylinder s oscillations is not situated at the origin in the in line direction since the mean drag force from the surrounding fluid is imposed on the circular cylinder it is seen from fig 8 that these lissajous figures are basically distributed along the x 1 axis and the magnitude of in line oscillation is far smaller than that of cross flow oscillation the vorticity field for m ˆ 0 393 in the lock in regime is displayed in fig 9 as expected the 2s vortex shedding mode williamson and roshko 1988 is seen in the wake at low r e 7 2 flutter of an h shaped bridge deck the collapse of the old tacoma narrows bridge in the 1940s clearly manifests the significance of investigations on flutter instability many numerical wind tunnel simulations try to replicate this problem on account of simplified models dettmer and perić 2006a hübner et al 2001 fourestey and piperno 2004 cebral and löhner 2005 filippini et al 2008 although the considered reynolds number is unrealistic for natural wind the vortex shedding phenomena which are essential for the system behavior are almost independent of r e hübner et al 2001 the problem definition is graphically demonstrated in fig 10 the h shaped deck experices the coupled motion of vertical translation and rotation thanks to the uniform fluid flows physical properties are specified as filippini et al 2008 ρ f 1 25 μ 0 1 m 2 3 0 10 3 m θ 2 53 10 4 c 2 1 0 10 2 c θ 2 2 10 3 k 2 2

976 r e 1500 f n 2 0 1299 and f n θ 0 2001 the domain decomposition is plotted in fig 10 as well in the first panel of fig 11 the finite element mesh consists of 3380 q4 elements and 3522 nodes whereas the submesh is demonstrated in the second panel the time step is δ t 1 0 10 2 the simple geometry of the problem does not mean that the comparable data can be easily acquired by different researchers let us go over the case of zero damping where the computed data vary significantly dettmer and perić 2006a hübner et al 2001 fourestey and piperno 2004 cebral and löhner 2005 for instance cebral and löhner 2005 gave a rather small rotation whereas a large amplitude is seen in dettmer and perić 2006a the simulation is even terminated at t 55 s in hübner et al 2001 table 2 records the maximal amplitudes d max 2 and d max θ and the oscillation frequencies f o 2 and f o θ this table reveals that the two computed amplitudes are larger than those of filippini et al 2008 but nearly identical with the data from he and zhang 2015 in all cases except filippini et al 2008 f o 2 perfectly coincides with f o θ time history of two components of the deck displacement is shown in fig 12 it is seen that the deck oscillation takes a stable pattern shortly it is found in table 2 and fig 12 that the rotational oscillation frequency is quite close to its rotational natural frequency and the vertical oscillation is very feeble given this reality the rotation is identified as the dominant motion and the flutter phenomenon is obviously exposed actually bluff bodies in oscillatory motions shed wakes at both oscillation and strouhal frequencies it is the former that predominates at high amplitude oscillation billah and scanlan 1991 most recently lee et al 2016 drew the same conclusion in their numerical simulation force coefficients are illustrated in fig 13 as a function of nondimensional time the secondary fluctuations along the curves are possibly responsible for the tiny deviation between the present oscillation frequency and that of he and zhang 2015 besides we are aware of similar time history of fluid forces presented by hübner et al 2001 three typical vorticity contours are displayed in fig 14 where the vortex pattern over the vibrating deck is in full agreement with the early documented explanation billah and scanlan 1991 7 3 a flexible cantilever attached to a square cylinder this benchmark problem is originally proposed by wall and ramm wall and ramm 1998 and now is extensively used to demonstrate the capability of an fsi solver fig 15 schematically demonstrates the geometry and boundary conditions of the problem the measuring point is placed in the middle of the right edge of the cantilever material parameters are specified as ρ f 1 18 10 3 μ 1 82 10 4 ρ s 1 0 10 1 e 2 5 10 6 ν 0 35 l 1 u 51 3 and r e 332 6 the fluid field is decomposed into the eulerian subdomain a1 and the ale subdomain a2 the meshing information is listed in table 3 the associated mesh and submesh are exhibited in fig 16 the time step is δ t 1 0 10 2 in this subsection table 4 compares d 2 and f o with those documented in the open literature he 2016 braun and awruch 2009 dettmer and perić 2006b hübner et al 2001 he and zhang 2015 wall and ramm 1998 teixeira and awruch 2005 liew et al 2007 yamada and yoshimura 2008 bazilevs et al 2008 olivier et al 2009 wood et al 2010 habchi et al 2013 the obtained results are in reasonable agreement with the available data on this occasion viv of the beam is fully excited such that the vertical amplitude reaches a rather large value of d 2 1 34 the oscillation frequency f o 0 0582 is very close to the first eigenfrequency of the cantilever f 1 s 0 0591 which predominates the structural oscillations it is worth pointing out that fewer finite elements and msa zones are used to gain such good results against previously published work he 2016 fig 17 a plots the smooth and undamped time history of the tip displacement in accordance with dettmer and perić 2006b yamada and yoshimura 2008 the violent vibrations of the cantilever commences roughly at dimensionless time 100 or real time of 2 s in contrast the unsteady long periodic structural response is established much later in liew et al 2007 in fig 17 b the tip displacement is compared against the graph of case 2 he 2016 the latter requires the slightly longer time to reach the smaller characteristic amplitude we notice that olivier et al 2009 habchi et al 2013 engenders small amplitudes even if denser spatial discretization or higher order interpolation is adopted for the cantilever in the present situation the swirling vortices shed from the square cylinders salient edges with a certain frequency due to the unsteady separation of incompressible viscous flows past the obstacle the vortex formation in the cylinder wake generates time dependent drag and lift forces which excite the flexible cantilever to freely vibrate in the fluid field according to liew et al 2007 the displacement history is partitioned into two stages lock in and beating the structural displacement is gradually amplified at the first stage the cantilever s oscillation frequency gets close to its first eigenfrequency at the same time inspiring lock in or resonance at the second stage the structural response converges to the stable long term oscillatory motion forming beating or modulation during the whole viv course vortex shedding induces lock in and thereby drives the cantilever to oscillate sharply correspondingly the violent structural oscillations significantly alter the vortex shedding mode whose frequency deviates from the cantilever s first eigenfrequency in turn when the structural oscillations are fully built up three typical snapshots of vorticity and pressure fields are graphically displayed in fig 18 it is seen that the unsteady features of flow patterns and structural oscillations are evidently distinguished in different phases during one oscillation period in fig 18 a the vortices act on the cantilever s surface while being alternatively shed from two lateral sides of the obstacle the considerable oscillations are therefore motivated for the cantilever it is noticed that the vortices on one side towards which the cantilever starts to move are weakened and are eventually suppressed by the flows nearby as a result of that high compression in the vicinity is perceived on this side however on the opposite side the vortices are strengthened and advect downstream from the cantilever these vortices are generated by velocity gradient resulting from the tip of the flapping cantilever habchi et al 2013 in fig 18 b pressure distribution on the frontal side of the square cylinder is positive due to the immediate exposure to the flows but high suction the blue zone is detected along the lateral sides of the square cylinder pressure distribution on the cantilever s surface opposite to the direction of motion is also negative but causes lower suction 7 4 a restrictor flap in a uniform channel flow the last example is a flexible restrictor flap vibrating in a uniform channel flow olivier et al 2009 the problem is sketched in fig 19 where the measuring point is located at the flap s upper left corner systematic properties are set as follows ρ f 1 0 μ 1 0 10 3 ρ s 1 0 10 3 e 6 0 10 4 ν 0 45 u 1 l 1 and r e 1000 likewise the fluid domain is divided into the eulerian subdomain a1 and the ale subdomain a2 the meshing information is summarized in table 5 the fluid mesh and msa submesh are disclosed in fig 20 the time step δ t 5 0 10 3 is adopted the time evolution of horizontal displacement is depicted in fig 21 consistent with he 2016 olivier et al 2009 the obtained magnitude of tip deflection is approximately 0 6 and the general trends are nearly identical among all curves we obviously observe the decaying oscillations while taking a close look at fig 21 this phenomenon is explained by the well known fact that under condition of large structural density the elastic restrictor flap s vibrations are largely excited by the structural inertia whereas the fluid serves as a damped oscillator fig 22 illustrates the longer evolution of horizontal displacement in time from this picture we note that the initial response of the flap is gradually damped but the remaining oscillations sustained by the tip vortex shedding are still rather significant as implied in olivier et al 2009 to further assess the performance of our approach several statistic indicators in regard to d 1 are listed in table 6 including d max 1 d mean 1 d rms 1 and d rmse 1 the deviation is judged by the percent error 46 ϑ y comput y olivier y olivier 100 where the values of olivier et al 2009 are regarded as references it is seen from table 6 that the difference between the present study and olivier et al 2009 is smallest in all cases in particular the difference in d rmse 1 is up to 38 50 between he 2016 and olivier et al 2009 whereas the figure sinks to only 4 64 here the above observation indicates that the calculated results agree better with those of olivier et al 2009 compared with our earlier paper he 2016 moreover the saving on time consumption is certainly made with fewer finite elements and msa zones typical contours of horizontal velocity and pressure at three time slices are displayed in fig 23 visually reflecting the features of variations within the flowing fluid field 8 conclusions this paper has reported a simple application of cs fem into fsi within the ale framework as inspired by gradient smoothing the ns equations are partially smoothed through cs fem that combines with the traditional fem the easy s cbs scheme is hence proposed for the fluid

msa in conjunction with spring analogy method the partitioned implicit coupling algorithm based upon fixed point iterations is realized without any accelerators trivial revision is demanded in the conventional fe code to execute the present technique the proposed method overcomes some deficiencies in partitioned coupling schemes and predicts improved results acknowledgement support from

23433,this paper presents a straightforward implementation of cell based smoothed finite element method cs fem into fluid structure interaction from the arbitrary lagriangian eulerian perspective identical to the practice in solid mechanics cs fem is directly applied to viscous stress and pressure poisson equation in fluid problem minimum programming efforts are thus required to modify existing in house codes following an efficient grid moving strategy partitioned implicit coupling scheme based upon fixed point iterations is adopted to interconnect individual fields the proposed approach is validated against previously published data for several benchmarks visible improvements are exposed in predicted results along with flow induced phenomena keywords smoothed finite element method fluid structure interaction ale cbs incompressible fluid 1 introduction gradient smoothing is a helpful technique to stabilize nodal integration in galerkin meshless methods chen et al 2001 yoo et al 2004 liu and his colleagues liu et al 2007 proposed the smoothed finite element method sfem by incorporation of gradient smoothing into the traditional fem the essential idea behind sfem consists in modification of the compatible strain field whereby a galerkin model may deliver some superior properties this technique is saliently featured by its softened stiffness matrix which yields more accurate solution to discrete partial differential equations than fem at the expense of easy implementation and nearly equal cost after more than a decade of development a family of sfem models have been fostered on account of different smoothing domain modes the monograph liu and nguyen 2010 and the review article zeng and liu 1007 deeply inspect sfem s theoretical bases deliberately highlight its advantageous traits and vividly depict its versatility in a variety of disciplines computational fluid dynamics cfd as it stands probably becomes another subject of interest to sfem practitioners indeed steps are taken to study cfd related problems such as fluid structure interaction fsi zhang et al 2012 yao et al 2012 wang et al 2014 he 2016 however these scenarios simply deploy an outreach success in solid mechanics rather than a settlement customized for the navier stokes ns equations apparently the ns equations which constitute the principle of the majority of cfd problems do not suit sfem after introducing divergence theorem for this reason the underlying investments may be discouraged in cfd analyses to overcome this dilemma jiang et al 2018 proposed three schemes to interpolate nodal quantities of the convective acceleration for the cell based smoothed fem cs fem liu et al 2007 for the first time in jiang et al 2018 the incompressible fluid flows within the laminar region are attempted on the eulerian mesh the objective of this paper is to develop a simple smoothing treatment for fsi computation differing from jiang et al 2018 the fluid stress tensor is partially smoothed and thus the resultant implementation is as same as that in solid mechanics to make minimum modifications in available fe codes the natural preference is given to the simplest cs fem that is initiated on four node quadrilateral q4 element mesh the characteristic based split cbs scheme zienkiewicz et al 1999 nithiarasu et al 2006 is utilized to decouple the fluid velocity and pressure partitioned implicit coupling strategy he and zhang 2017 is preferred to interconnect individual fields due to its attractive simplicity furthermore sfem may diminish pressure sensitivity on dynamic boundaries for the fractional step method the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the basis of cs fem is briefly recalled in section 2 the equations governing fluid and solid media are depicted in sections 3 and 4 the mesh updating method is summarized in section 5 section 6 describes the partitioned implicit coupling algorithm numerical examples are investigated in section 7 and conclusions are drawn in the final section 2 brief on cs fem let us discretize a two dimensional computational domain ω into n el q4 elements exactly as in the standard fem such that ω ω 1 ω 2 ω n el and ω i ω j i j a q4 element is further subdivided into a set of complementary smoothing cells scs namely ω i ω i 1 ω i 2 ω i n s c where n s c is the number of scs within the element the gradient of a field variable q smoothing at a point x c within an sc is approximated in the form of 1 q x c ω q x φ x x c dω where means the gradient operator ω designates the sc and the heaviside type kernel φ fulfills yoo et al 2004 2 φ 0 and ω φ dω 1 applying gauss theorem into the right hand side of eq 1 yields 3 q x c γ q x n x φ x x c dγ ω q x φ x x c dω where γ is the boundary of ω and n is the unit outward normal of γ the smoothing kernel φ is given by 4 φ x x c 1 a c x ω 0 x ω where a c ω dω is the area of the sc substituting eq 4 into eq 3 we have 5 q x c γ q x n x φ x x c dγ 1 a c γ q x n x dγ where the gradient of a constant automatically vanishes the galerkin procedure gives the following approximation of q 6 q n i q i where n i is the shape function at node i the underline indicates a nodal quantity and einstein s summation is applied with the aid of eq 6 one can immediately rewrite eq 5 as 7 q x c n i x c q i 1 a c γ n i x n x dγ q i since one point gaussian quadrature is sufficiently accurate for line integral along each segment of γ the item enclosed within external brackets on the right hand side of eq 7 can be transformed to its algebraic form 8 n i x c 1 a c i 1 4 n i x i gp n x i gp l i where x i gp is the gaussian point of the boundary segment γ i and l i is the length of the i th segment as of now no coordinate transformation is involved and only shape functions are invoked to calculate the smoothed gradients a q4 element is partitioned into four quadrilateral scs relying on the stability condition liu et al 2007 the construction of shape functions for cs fem is illustrated in fig 1 of total nine nodes extra five nodes are generated to compute the smoothed shape functions by simply averaging those values at four corners liu et al 2007 dai and liu 2007 therefore no additional degrees of freedom are introduced into cs fem 3 fluid problem 3 1 governing equations let ω f ℝ 2 and 0 t be the fluid and temporal domains respectively ω f is bounded

modeled as a spring damper mass system due to the fluctuating fluid force the equation of motion is expressed in the lagrangian description with proper initial and boundary conditions the isotropic assumption is made for the structural problem 4 1 rigid body dynamics in the case of a single rigid body undergoing both translation and rotation see fig 2 the structural displacement is represented

below 33 k n δ d r n 1 p n m s d n 1 where k represents the tangent stiffness matrix m s is the mass matrix δ d d n 1 d n is the increment of nodal displacement r is the external force and p is the internal force depending upon the geometrical nonlinearity it is necessary to iterate eq 33 in each load step until a required tolerance is satisfied this linearization is carried out by the modified newton raphson procedure using total lagrangian formulation bathe et al 1975 the mass of the body considered is assumed to be conserved in dynamic analysis hence the smoothed equilibrium iteration equation is written as 34 k n δ d k r n 1 p n 1 k 1 m s d n 1 k where k mean the k th iteration at the current time step and the tangent stiffness matrix is decomposed into linear and nonlinear parts

procedure considering specific time discretization methods can be found in bathe et al 1975 braun and awruch 2009 4 4 time marching method the widespread availability of step by step time integration algorithms is seen in computational analyses of structural dynamics in this paper the structural movement is integrated in time with the generalized α method chung and hulbert 1993 to do this the semi discrete equation of motion is applied to a general midpoint within a time interval implying that the following modified equation holds 35 m s d n 1 α m c d n 1 α f k d n 1 α f r n 1 α f where m s c

α f p n 1 α f p d n 1 α f p d n while working on the elastic solid 5 mesh deformation method the imposition of interface conditions in time requires that the position of moving interface is accurately captured in the ale domain whilst maintaining the satisfactory mesh quality the present mesh deformation method adopts a blend of moving submesh approach msa lefrançois 2008 and the ortho semi torsional spring analogy model markou et al 2007 its fundamental principle comprises the following two stages spring analogy method assimilates the three node triangular t3 submesh to the structural motion msa creates a mapping between submesh s deformation and that of ale mesh in comparison with spring analogy methods our approach is capable of depressing time consumption of mesh updating while preserving the mesh topology the reader is referred to he et al 2012 2014 for thorough implementation 6 partitioned solution procedure 6 1 interface coupling conditions in partitioned scheme the interplay between the fluid and structure is accomplished via separately enforcing the velocity continuity and traction equilibrium on σ as follows 43 u d and t f t s where t f σ f n s and t s σ s n s are the fluid and structural tractions respectively n s represents the unit outward normal of σ pointing from the structure to the fluid and n f n s since the external force acting on the immersed rigid body is a concentrated load vector the stress equilibrium on σ becomes 44 σ t f dγ σ t s dγ and σ δ x t f dγ σ δ x t s dγ where δ x is the distance between surface point p and center of gravity g see fig 2 also the geometrical continuity is supplemented thanks to the dynamic mesh motion 45 x d and w d 6 2 partitioned implicit coupling algorithm the entire fsi system constitutes a coupled set of nonlinear algebraic equations to be solved for each time step we implicitly couple all interacting fields by the aid of fixed point iterations which compulsively enforce kinematic and kinetic compatibilities on σ for stability the present algorithm is elaborated below step 1 initialize all variables and set k 0 step 2 extrapolate the interface x σ n 1 k d σ n 3 2 d σ n 1 2 d σ n 1 δ t step

example an elastically mounted circular cylinder is allowed to freely oscillate under fully laminar flow condition the problem definition is plotted in fig 3 system parameters are identical to jaiman et al 2016 f r 0 2 ξ 0 r e 100 and 0 298 m ˆ 0 471 in fig 3 the computational domain is divided into the eulerian subdomain a1 the ale subdomain a2 and the lagrangian subdomain a3 for the sake of efficiency the nodes keep fixed in a1 while those in a3 move along with the cylinder only the nodes in a2 are continuously updated in fig 4 a the finite element mesh is composed of 8880 q4 elements and 9090 nodes and the corresponding submesh is demonstrated in fig 4 b the time step is δ t 1 0 10 2 and the relaxation factor is ω 0 5 the flow past the cylinder at m ˆ 0 471 is considered to study the mesh sensitivity two finite element meshes m1 8880 q4 elements and 9090 nodes and m2 15744 q4 elements and 16028 nodes are adopted to calculate several aerodynamic parameters the computed results are listed in table 1 including the mean value of horizontal amplitude d mean 1 and its root mean square error rmse d rmse 1 the peak of vertical amplitude d max 2 the mean value of drag coefficient c d mean and its rmse c d rmse the amplitude of lift coefficient c l max and the strouhal number s t the good agreement between the two sets of data establishes the validation for further calculations as a consequence m1 is selected for the purpose of accuracy and efficiency fig 5 shows the time history of fluid force coefficients and cylinder displacement for m ˆ 0 408 at which the failure of the strong staggered coupling ssc scheme based on the block iterative newton method is reported jaiman et al 2016 the present method has established highly stable and smooth responses of the light cylinder for long in the pictures fig 6 compares the present lift coefficient with that of jaiman et al 2016 at the same m ˆ both graphs evidently reveal that our c l is in excellent accordance with that computed by the nonlinear interface force correction nfic approach jaiman et al 2016 howbeit ssc method entirely fails at such a low mass ratio even more nonlinear subiterations are enforced between the incompressible fluid and rigid body attention shifts to the m ˆ 0 393 case now the comparison is made in fig 7 a with respect to d 2 at the very beginning because of the strong nature of fluid structure coupling the inherent instability in ssc scheme cannot be cured by reducing the time step size however the present coupling method completely avoids such an instability when the calculation is initialized seen from fig 7 b the admirable d 2 is convincingly produced throughout the vortex induced vibrations viv of the bluff body in sum the developed method never introduces loss of computational accuracy fig 8 shows the x 1 x 2 trajectory of the cylinder at different mass ratios illustrating that the present viv is a self limiting process zhou et al 1999 as subjected to uniform flows at low r e the circular cylinder takes on the nearly symmetrical trajectory that shapes the classical lissajous figure of 8 according to sarpkaya 2004 when a circular cylinder vibrates in both horizontal and vertical directions the common frequencies of the cylinder and driving forces in their respective directions may result in lock in and the cylinder s axis traces the path of the lissajous figure the eight type loops are caused by the significant variation of drag force during large amplitude oscillations the equilibrium position of the cylinder s oscillations is not situated at the origin in the in line direction since the mean drag force from the surrounding fluid is imposed on the circular cylinder it is seen from fig 8 that these lissajous figures are basically distributed along the x 1 axis and the magnitude of in line oscillation is far smaller than that of cross flow oscillation the vorticity field for m ˆ 0 393 in the lock in regime is displayed in fig 9 as expected the 2s vortex shedding mode williamson and roshko 1988 is seen in the wake at low r e 7 2 flutter of an h shaped bridge deck the collapse of the old tacoma narrows bridge in the 1940s clearly manifests the significance of investigations on flutter instability many numerical wind tunnel simulations try to replicate this problem on account of simplified models dettmer and perić 2006a hübner et al 2001 fourestey and piperno 2004 cebral and löhner 2005 filippini et al 2008 although the considered reynolds number is unrealistic for natural wind the vortex shedding phenomena which are essential for the system behavior are almost independent of r e hübner et al 2001 the problem definition is graphically demonstrated in fig 10 the h shaped deck experices the coupled motion of vertical translation and rotation thanks to the uniform fluid flows physical properties are specified as filippini et al 2008 ρ f 1 25 μ 0 1 m 2 3 0 10 3 m θ 2 53 10 4 c 2 1 0 10 2 c θ 2 2 10 3 k 2 2

976 r e 1500 f n 2 0 1299 and f n θ 0 2001 the domain decomposition is plotted in fig 10 as well in the first panel of fig 11 the finite element mesh consists of 3380 q4 elements and 3522 nodes whereas the submesh is demonstrated in the second panel the time step is δ t 1 0 10 2 the simple geometry of the problem does not mean that the comparable data can be easily acquired by different researchers let us go over the case of zero damping where the computed data vary significantly dettmer and perić 2006a hübner et al 2001 fourestey and piperno 2004 cebral and löhner 2005 for instance cebral and löhner 2005 gave a rather small rotation whereas a large amplitude is seen in dettmer and perić 2006a the simulation is even terminated at t 55 s in hübner et al 2001 table 2 records the maximal amplitudes d max 2 and d max θ and the oscillation frequencies f o 2 and f o θ this table reveals that the two computed amplitudes are larger than those of filippini et al 2008 but nearly identical with the data from he and zhang 2015 in all cases except filippini et al 2008 f o 2 perfectly coincides with f o θ time history of two components of the deck displacement is shown in fig 12 it is seen that the deck oscillation takes a stable pattern shortly it is found in table 2 and fig 12 that the rotational oscillation frequency is quite close to its rotational natural frequency and the vertical oscillation is very feeble given this reality the rotation is identified as the dominant motion and the flutter phenomenon is obviously exposed actually bluff bodies in oscillatory motions shed wakes at both oscillation and strouhal frequencies it is the former that predominates at high amplitude oscillation billah and scanlan 1991 most recently lee et al 2016 drew the same conclusion in their numerical simulation force coefficients are illustrated in fig 13 as a function of nondimensional time the secondary fluctuations along the curves are possibly responsible for the tiny deviation between the present oscillation frequency and that of he and zhang 2015 besides we are aware of similar time history of fluid forces presented by hübner et al 2001 three typical vorticity contours are displayed in fig 14 where the vortex pattern over the vibrating deck is in full agreement with the early documented explanation billah and scanlan 1991 7 3 a flexible cantilever attached to a square cylinder this benchmark problem is originally proposed by wall and ramm wall and ramm 1998 and now is extensively used to demonstrate the capability of an fsi solver fig 15 schematically demonstrates the geometry and boundary conditions of the problem the measuring point is placed in the middle of the right edge of the cantilever material parameters are specified as ρ f 1 18 10 3 μ 1 82 10 4 ρ s 1 0 10 1 e 2 5 10 6 ν 0 35 l 1 u 51 3 and r e 332 6 the fluid field is decomposed into the eulerian subdomain a1 and the ale subdomain a2 the meshing information is listed in table 3 the associated mesh and submesh are exhibited in fig 16 the time step is δ t 1 0 10 2 in this subsection table 4 compares d 2 and f o with those documented in the open literature he 2016 braun and awruch 2009 dettmer and perić 2006b hübner et al 2001 he and zhang 2015 wall and ramm 1998 teixeira and awruch 2005 liew et al 2007 yamada and yoshimura 2008 bazilevs et al 2008 olivier et al 2009 wood et al 2010 habchi et al 2013 the obtained results are in reasonable agreement with the available data on this occasion viv of the beam is fully excited such that the vertical amplitude reaches a rather large value of d 2 1 34 the oscillation frequency f o 0 0582 is very close to the first eigenfrequency of the cantilever f 1 s 0 0591 which predominates the structural oscillations it is worth pointing out that fewer finite elements and msa zones are used to gain such good results against previously published work he 2016 fig 17 a plots the smooth and undamped time history of the tip displacement in accordance with dettmer and perić 2006b yamada and yoshimura 2008 the violent vibrations of the cantilever commences roughly at dimensionless time 100 or real time of 2 s in contrast the unsteady long periodic structural response is established much later in liew et al 2007 in fig 17 b the tip displacement is compared against the graph of case 2 he 2016 the latter requires the slightly longer time to reach the smaller characteristic amplitude we notice that olivier et al 2009 habchi et al 2013 engenders small amplitudes even if denser spatial discretization or higher order interpolation is adopted for the cantilever in the present situation the swirling vortices shed from the square cylinders salient edges with a certain frequency due to the unsteady separation of incompressible viscous flows past the obstacle the vortex formation in the cylinder wake generates time dependent drag and lift forces which excite the flexible cantilever to freely vibrate in the fluid field according to liew et al 2007 the displacement history is partitioned into two stages lock in and beating the structural displacement is gradually amplified at the first stage the cantilever s oscillation frequency gets close to its first eigenfrequency at the same time inspiring lock in or resonance at the second stage the structural response converges to the stable long term oscillatory motion forming beating or modulation during the whole viv course vortex shedding induces lock in and thereby drives the cantilever to oscillate sharply correspondingly the violent structural oscillations significantly alter the vortex shedding mode whose frequency deviates from the cantilever s first eigenfrequency in turn when the structural oscillations are fully built up three typical snapshots of vorticity and pressure fields are graphically displayed in fig 18 it is seen that the unsteady features of flow patterns and structural oscillations are evidently distinguished in different phases during one oscillation period in fig 18 a the vortices act on the cantilever s surface while being alternatively shed from two lateral sides of the obstacle the considerable oscillations are therefore motivated for the cantilever it is noticed that the vortices on one side towards which the cantilever starts to move are weakened and are eventually suppressed by the flows nearby as a result of that high compression in the vicinity is perceived on this side however on the opposite side the vortices are strengthened and advect downstream from the cantilever these vortices are generated by velocity gradient resulting from the tip of the flapping cantilever habchi et al 2013 in fig 18 b pressure distribution on the frontal side of the square cylinder is positive due to the immediate exposure to the flows but high suction the blue zone is detected along the lateral sides of the square cylinder pressure distribution on the cantilever s surface opposite to the direction of motion is also negative but causes lower suction 7 4 a restrictor flap in a uniform channel flow the last example is a flexible restrictor flap vibrating in a uniform channel flow olivier et al 2009 the problem is sketched in fig 19 where the measuring point is located at the flap s upper left corner systematic properties are set as follows ρ f 1 0 μ 1 0 10 3 ρ s 1 0 10 3 e 6 0 10 4 ν 0 45 u 1 l 1 and r e 1000 likewise the fluid domain is divided into the eulerian subdomain a1 and the ale subdomain a2 the meshing information is summarized in table 5 the fluid mesh and msa submesh are disclosed in fig 20 the time step δ t 5 0 10 3 is adopted the time evolution of horizontal displacement is depicted in fig 21 consistent with he 2016 olivier et al 2009 the obtained magnitude of tip deflection is approximately 0 6 and the general trends are nearly identical among all curves we obviously observe the decaying oscillations while taking a close look at fig 21 this phenomenon is explained by the well known fact that under condition of large structural density the elastic restrictor flap s vibrations are largely excited by the structural inertia whereas the fluid serves as a damped oscillator fig 22 illustrates the longer evolution of horizontal displacement in time from this picture we note that the initial response of the flap is gradually damped but the remaining oscillations sustained by the tip vortex shedding are still rather significant as implied in olivier et al 2009 to further assess the performance of our approach several statistic indicators in regard to d 1 are listed in table 6 including d max 1 d mean 1 d rms 1 and d rmse 1 the deviation is judged by the percent error 46 ϑ y comput y olivier y olivier 100 where the values of olivier et al 2009 are regarded as references it is seen from table 6 that the difference between the present study and olivier et al 2009 is smallest in all cases in particular the difference in d rmse 1 is up to 38 50 between he 2016 and olivier et al 2009 whereas the figure sinks to only 4 64 here the above observation indicates that the calculated results agree better with those of olivier et al 2009 compared with our earlier paper he 2016 moreover the saving on time consumption is certainly made with fewer finite elements and msa zones typical contours of horizontal velocity and pressure at three time slices are displayed in fig 23 visually reflecting the features of variations within the flowing fluid field 8 conclusions this paper has reported a simple application of cs fem into fsi within the ale framework as inspired by gradient smoothing the ns equations are partially smoothed through cs fem that combines with the traditional fem the easy s cbs scheme is hence proposed for the fluid subproblem cs fem is readily applicable to dynamic analysis of a geometrically nonlinear solid the structural equation is advanced in time by the generalized α method the dynamic mesh is updated via msa in conjunction with spring analogy method the partitioned implicit coupling algorithm based upon fixed point iterations is realized without any accelerators trivial revision is demanded in the conventional fe code to execute the present technique the proposed method overcomes some deficiencies in partitioned coupling schemes and predicts improved results acknowledgement support from

23434,the problem of wave structure seabed interactions wssi around impermeable slope breakwater head is numerically investigated with a three dimensional 3d integrated model the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations are adopted to simulate the wave induced fluid motion and biot s theory for poro elastic medium is employed to describe the seabed behaviour under wave loading a calculation scheme is established to integrate both wave motion and seabed response the numerical results reveal that wave induced flow field in the vicinity of breakwater heads is significantly disturbed by the existence of the structure leading to wave reflection diffraction and overtopping furthermore the wave induced negative pore pressure and liquefaction near the front of the breakwater heads is significant the parametric study concludes that the increase of breakwater slope intensifies the seabed response and liquefaction around the breakwater head and therefore it is proposed to design breakwaters with a mild slope keywords wssi rans biot s theory slope breakwater head liquefaction 1 introduction the phenomenon of the wave structure seabed interactions wssi has attracted

seabed when it exceeds certain limit seabed liquefaction and shear failure might happen and further lead to structure failure oumeraci 1994 rahman 1991 based on laboratory experiments and field studies two mechanisms of wave induced pore pressures have been reported in the literature i e the oscillatory mechanism and residual mechanism zen and yamazaki 1990 nago et al 1993 jeng 2013 the oscillatory mechanism is the basic feature of wave induced pore pressure which is caused by the cycling excitation of wave trains however the residual mechanism is induced by the contraction of relatively loose soil seed and rahman 1978 sassa and sekiguchi 1999 and mainly occurs when the seabed is enduring extreme loadings such as storm and tsunami the importance and applicable range of both mechanisms have been reported in jeng and seymour 2007 in this study we focus on the oscillatory soil response and its resultant momentary liquefaction breakwater is one of the most common coastal structures which is used to protect the coastal facilities such as a harbour from strong wave and storm loading hence breakwater is susceptible to wave induced failure and gains lots of attention from coastal engineers and researchers recently focusing on the wave induced seabed response many efforts are being devoted to deal with wssi around breakwaters including field monitoring dean et al 1997 guler et al 2015 analytical solutions jeng 1997 physical modelling kudella et al 2006 and numerical simulation jeng et al 2001 mostafa et al 1999 ulker et al 2010 jeng et al 2013 ye et al 2012 2016 however most of the studies only consider the wssi in front of the breakwater trunk as a matter of fact wssi in vicinity of breakwater heads is different from that around breakwater trunk vidal et al 1991 experimentally studied the stability of a slope breakwater s head and trunk and found that the head and trunk display different behaviour when damage grows and the head section is more vulnerable than trunk section the major reason for this difference is supposed to be that the flow regime around breakwater head is different from trunk section when wave reaches the breakwater head it causes steady streaming plunging breaker streamline contraction and lee wake vortices giving rise to complex effects on seabed and thus resulting in seabed destruction such as scour fredsøe and sumer 1997 recently a few researchers have paid attention to wssi in vicinity of breakwater head li and jeng 2008 and jeng and ou 2010 numerically simulated the wave induced seabed response around breakwater head taking into account of incident reflected and diffracted waves however the breakwater used in their model is simplified as a single line without width and height and only linear wave theory is used in their model zhao et al 2013 then studied the wave induced seabed response around a vertical breakwater head using a 3d integrated numerical model taking into account of turbulence as a matter of fact breakwater configuration such as shape significantly affects the wave diffraction around the breakwater head thus determining the wave loading acting on seabed therefore wave induced seabed response varies with breakwater configuration in this paper a 3d integrated numerical scheme consisting of wave sub model and seabed sub model is proposed to explore the seabed response around slope breakwater head reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans with k ε turbulent model are used to describe the wave motion thus the wave induced turbulence in the vicinity of breakwater could be appropriately modelled under ordinary wave loadings the quasi static qs equations proposed by biot 1941 is sufficient and efficient for modelling seabed response ulker et al 2009 and is adopted to model the seabed response in the present study the realization of the proposed numerical scheme is performed using openfoam and comsol scripts comsol with matlab firstly in wave sub model the rans equations with k ε turbulence closure in openfoam is employed to calculate the wave pressure in the first two wave periods in the present study we study the oscillatory seabed response to wave loading correspondingly residual seabed response is not considered therefore the seabed response in the first wave period could reflect the seabed response to a newly coming wave which has not been dealt with in the previous studies the seabed response in the second wave period corresponds to the seabed response to the succeeding wave train then in seabed sub model we compiled the biot s equations into comsol scripts via the pde partial differential equation module to govern the seabed response 2 theoretical formulations in this section the theoretical formulation of the proposed 3d model is firstly presented including the wave model seabed model boundary condition and numerical scheme the model of wssi in the present study is sketched in fig 1 the breakwater is a slope breakwater with an underlying cushion the breakwater head is a semicircle in top view and its slope is identical to that of the trunk the seabed is taken as sandy deposits thus biot s theory for poro elastic medium is available to model the seabed behaviour in this study the breakwater is considered to be armoured with impermeable layers hence in this study the breakwater is taken as an impermeable rigid object the origin of cartesian coordinates point o is located at the centre of aforementioned semicircle of the breakwater head points a b c d and e are in the seabed with identical varying radius r and wave induced pore pressure at these points are used as indicators to reveal seabed response around the breakwater head the ocean wave is propagating along the positive x direction 2 1 wave model in the model the 3d rans equations are solved for two incompressible phases using a finite volume discretization by openfoam according to mass and momentum conservation the incompressible fluid motion due to wave could be expressed in the form of einstein summation convention 1 u f i x f i 0 2 ρ f u f i t ρ f u f i u f j x j p f x i x j μ u f i x j u f j x i x j ρ f u f i u f j ρ f g i where u f i i 1 2 3

fluid density t is the time and g i i 1 2 3 is the body force in the x y and z direction respectively in the present study the only body force is gravity in z direction g 9 80665 m s 2 the term ρ f u f i u f j in eq 2 represents the so called reynolds stress which can be estimated by eddy viscosity model 3 ρ f u f i u f j μ t u f i x j u f j x i 2 3 ρ f k μ t u i x i δ i j where μ t is the turbulent viscosity k 1 2 u f i u f i and is the turbulent kinematic energy and δ i j is the kronecker delta by substituting eq 3 into eq 2 eq 2 could be expressed as 4 ρ f u f i t ρ f u f i u f j x j p f 2 3 ρ f k x i x j μ e f f u f i x j u f j x i ρ f g i 2 3 μ t x j u i x i δ i j where μ e f f μ μ t is the total effective viscosity to solve eq 1 and eq 4 k ε turbulence model launder and spalding 1974 is adopted firstly a variable called turbulent dissipation rate ε is introduced into the model 5 ε μ ρ f u f i x k u f i x k hence a connection between ε and turbulent kinematic energy k could be established as 6 ε c d k 2 3 l k in which c d is a constant l k is a length characterizing the macroscale of turbulence eventually the k ε turbulence model is deduced as 7 ρ f k t ρ f k u f i

stresses free surface pressure and advection are explicitly solved while the pressure is solved implicitly with generalized minimal residual algorithm 2 2 seabed model in this study the porous seabed is considered as isotropic homogeneous sandy seabed with the same permeability k s in all directions x y and z accordingly the conservation of mass could be expressed as 11 δ p s γ w n s β s k s p s t γ w k s ε s t 0 where δ 2 x 2 2 y 2 2 z 2 is the laplace operator p s is the wave induced pore water pressure γ w is the unit weight of pore water n s is the soil porosity β s is the compressibility of pore fluid and ε s is the volume strain which are defined as the follows 12 ε s u s x v s y w s z 13 β s 1 k w 1 s r p w o where u s v s w s are soil displacements in the x y and z direction respectively k w is true elasticity modulus of water taken as 2 10 9 n m 2 yamamoto et al 1978 p w o is the absolute water pressure atmosphere plus hydrostatic pressure on the seabed surface and s r is the degree of saturation according to terzaghi s principle of effective stress the total stress of soil σ i j could be decomposed into effective stress σ i j and pore pressure p s 14 σ i j σ i j δ i j p s where δ i j is the kronecker delta in general there are two body forces involved in this study i e the gravity and inertia force before the action of water waves the seabed usually reaches equilibrium under gravity loading when exploring small amplitude wave induced seabed response the effect of inertia forces is commonly excluded therefore the body forces are usually excluded in the previous studies on wssi chang and jeng 2014 lin et al 2016 2017 zhao et al 2017a 2017b for the effect of inertia force on seabed response it is referred to the works of jeng and his coworkers jeng et al 1999 jeng and rahman 2000 luan et al 2008 herein leaving out the body forces and inertia terms the equilibrium equations could be expressed in the following partial differential equations pdes 15 g δ u s i g 1 2 μ s ε s x i p s x i in which g is the shear modulus u si is the soil displacement δ is the laplace operator and μ s is the poisson s ratio in the present study the poro elastic constitutive relationship is applied to describe the seabed soil behaviour hence the effective normal stress and shear stress can be expressed in terms of soil displacements as 16 σ i j g δ i k δ j l μ s 1 2 μ s δ i j δ k l u k x l u l x k equations 11 15 and 16 with appropriate boundary conditions are capable of capturing the wave induced pore pressure displacements and effective stresses in a porous seabed 2 3 boundary conditions as shown in fig 1 the wssi in the present study involves seawater seabed and breakwater thus is a complex boundary value problem bvp herein the boundary conditions used in the present study is a vital issue in the wave model cartesian coordinate system is adopted and the wave is generated at x 0 5 l l is the model length with airy wave theory as a matter of fact wave reflection takes place from the frontal side of the breakwater which would give rise to secondary wave reflection from the wave maker boundary to eliminate the secondary wave reflection chen and hsiao 2016 proposed a novel wave generating method using a mass source wave maker in the present study the wssi in the first a few wave cycles is examined therefore the influence of secondary reflected wave from the wave maker boundary could be avoided with a large domain size of which the distance of breakwater from the wave maker boundary exceeds one thus it would be of efficiency to leave out the secondary reflection from the wave maker boundary for outflow condition at x 0 5 l sommerfeld radiation boundary condition is applied as 17 q t c q x 0 where q is any given quantity c is the local phase speed of the wavelike flow at the two side surfaces zero gradient and zero velocity conditions normal to the two surfaces are applied 18 p f y u f i y 0 at the sea floor no slip and zero velocity conditions are applied 19 u f i 0 at the air fluid interface volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 is used to track the free surface elevation in the seabed model the horizontal displacements of the four lateral boundaries are set as zero 20 u s v s 0 the seabed bottom is taken as impermeable rigid bedrock 21 u s i p s z 0 at the seabed surface the water wave pressure p wv extracted from the wave model is applied 22 p s p w v p f γ w h w the breakwater is taken as impermeable rigid body and no flow boundary is applied on its surface i e the gradient of pore pressure is zero 23 p s n 0 where n is the normal to breakwater surface with above boundary conditions the governing equations for wave model and seabed model are closed and corresponding results are got in this study 2 4 numerical scheme in this study the proposed model consists of two separate submodels wave model and seabed model in the wave model the wave motion is continuously calculated thus wave induced wave pressure at any given moment could be obtained as a dynamic loading to be applied on the seabed to implement the simulation a series of calculations are carried out in the present study to integrate the wave model with the seabed model as shown in fig 2 at the beginning the wave motion is activated first in wave model using openfoam which is a generic cfd program solved by finite volume method then the wave pressure p 1 at a given moment t t 1 n n is a given integer that divides a wave period into n sub periods is extracted and applied to the seabed model which is developed in the comsol scripts comsol with matlab via its user defined pde module in the seabed model the solution of the former moment t t i n is set as the initial condition of the following step t t i 1 n thus the present model could be able to simulate the seabed response more realistically 3 model validation the proposed model will be calibrated against available existing experimental data in this section including those of jeng et al 2005 zang et al 2010 and liu et al 2015 the input data adopted in the validation are the same as those used in the experiments as tabulated in table 1 3 1 wave model validation jeng et al 2005 conducted a series of flume tests to examine the water surface elevation and pore pressure inside the seabed when ocean waves propagating over a submerged slope breakwater in front of a vertical seawall more details could be found in the literature in their experiment the wave profiles at four sections are recorded denoted as section 1 2 3 and 4 in the present study we calibrated the present model using the experiment data of test 2 of these tests with a grid size of 1 mm the results of the present numerical model and the experiment are shown in fig 3 in test 2 the wave period t 1 s wave height h 1 02 cm water depth h w 17 cm in the figure t is time η 1 η 2 η 3 and η 4 are the time series of free surface elevation at section 1 2 3 and 4 respectively a 0 5h is the wave amplitude it can be seen from fig 3 that the result of the present model overall agrees well with the experiment in the first three wave periods after meeting the first wave at section 1 2 and 3 there is a slight phase difference between the two curves and at section 4 it is more significant this might be induced by the fact that the wave generator in the experiment is a rocking paddle which makes the wave generating boundary indeterminate and hence the phase difference is generated in the succeeding wave periods the amplitude of the wave profile is significantly intensified due to wave reflection from the seawall however due to the defect of wall boundary used in the present model this phenomenon is not properly modelled in this paper we focus on the wave induced impact on seabed around breakwater head during the first two wave periods without wave reflection from the outlet boundary hence the present model could be a sufficient expedient to tackle the wave motion zang et al 2010 carried out laboratory tests to examine the steep wave interaction with a vertical circular cylinder in their experiments a cylinder with diameter of 0 25 m is installed 7 8 m from the wave paddle in a wave flume with a mean water depth of 0 505 m and more details about the experiment setup could be found in chen et al 2014 among the experiments the test with wave height 0 14 m and wave period 1 22 s is employed to validate the capacity of the present model to simulate wave diffraction with cell size of 0 015 m 0 015 m 0 01 m as shown in fig 4 in the figure wave gauge 1 is located 0 77 m from the wave paddle and wave gauge 2 is 0 002 m from the frontal surface of the cylinder along the centerline it is seen that the results of the present model reach an overall good agreement with the experiment data hence the present model should be capable of modelling the wssi around breakwater head 3 2 seabed model validation liu et al 2015 performed one dimensional 1d experiments to probe into the pore pressure response under wave loading in sandy seabed in their experiments they measured pore pressure evolution in the seabed with different depths we numerically modelled their experiments with element size of 0 2 mm 0 1 m and the result of pore pressure cycling with seabed depth z 26 7 cm are shown in fig 5 in the figure t is the time t is the wave period and p s is the wave induced pore pressure in seabed it can be observed that the present model simulated the experiments fairly well the prediction of the present model is almost identical to the analytical solution of hsu and jeng 1994 it can be observed that the calculated amplitude of pore pressure is slightly smaller than that of the experiment this might be caused by the gravity that makes the seabed loose near seabed surface and dense in the deep range while in our model the seabed is assumed to be homogenized thus the calculated results would be smaller in the shallow range and larger in the deep range after all this discrepancy is negligible hence the present model is an adequate approach to model seabed response under wave actions 4 results and discussion in this section the features of wave motion dynamic wave pressures on seabed and wave induced pore pressures will be presented in section 4 1 4 2 and 4 3 respectively then the effect of breakwater slope on seabed response and liquefaction around breakwater head is parametrically studied the input data used in this section is tabulated in table 2 ye and jeng 2012 pointed out the domain length has to be at least two times wavelength to eliminate the influence of the fixed boundary hence the domain plane size is set as 3 5l w 3 5l w of which the wavelength l w is 34 7 m therefore the seabed size is 121 6 m 121 6 m 12 m in previous studies parametric study of wave and seabed characteristics has been widely performed jeng and ou 2010 li and jeng 2008 ulker et al 2010 ye et al 2014 2016 zhang et al 2011 zhao and jeng 2015 therefore in the present study only the parametric study of breakwater slope α is carried out in subsection 4 4 with breakwater crest width w varying from 2 to 7 m in the rest subsections w 2 m 4 1 wave characteristics around breakwater head in this subsection the wave motion mainly free surface elevation and wave pressure acting on seabed surface during the wssi of the first two wave cycles will be presented fig 6 and fig 7 display the development of free surface elevation during wave propagation it can be observed that the first wave crest η 5 m η is the wave profile comes into being at the wave generation boundary when t t 0 25 generating a maximum wave pressure of ca 6 33 kpa on seafloor fig 8 a thereafter the wave crest propagates towards the breakwater after over a wave period of propagation when t t 1 50 the front of the first wave comes across the breakwater giving rise to higher wave pressure fig 8f due to obstruction of breakwater on wave propagation then with wave crest approaching the breakwater the maximum free surface elevation goes up reaching a maximum of 6 m when t t 1 750 fig 7b due to the fact that the breakwater top is only 1 m beyond the still water surface when the wave crest reaches the breakwater t t 1 625 wave overtopping arises as shown in fig 7a it can be seen that the breakwater is completely submerged by the wave set up when t t 1 875 meanwhile wave diffraction around the breakwater head and wave reflection from the breakwater are also observed at t t 1 25 the second wave crest emerges and moves towards the breakwater however it can be observed that the second wave crest significantly differs from that of the first wave due to the reflected wave from t t 2 000 on the plunging breaker is gradually developed by interaction of the second wave and the reflected wave when the fully developed plunging breaker approaches the breakwater at t t 2 375 wave breaking occurs in front of the breakwater then at t t 2 500 wave breaking in front of the breakwater head e g point o is observed figs 8 and 9 illustrate the wave induced pressure impacting on seabed surface which excludes the hydrostatic pore pressure ca 39 kpa it can be concluded that the maximum wave pressure is induced beneath the wave crest and has similar developing pattern as the wave crest with the emergence of the first wave crest the wave pressure exceeds 6 kpa fig 8a after a half wave period t t 0 750 the first wave crest comes into being and generates a negative wave pressure of 7 33 kpa fig 8c when the wave front approaches the breakwater at t t 1 25 fig 8e a slight increase of maximum wave pressure is observed making the maximum wave pressure reach 6 42 kpa this implies that the breakwater starts to exert effect on wave motion then at the next moment t t 1 50 the maximum wave pressure is induced in front of the breakwater as the wave motion is obstructed by the breakwater and it reaches a value of ca 7 8 kpa fig 8f however the wave induces pore pressure in front of the breakwater head e g point o is relatively insignificant when the wave crest reaches the breakwater completely at t t 1 750 fig 9b the wave pressure reaches a maximum of ca 6 3 kpa in front of the breakwater head finally at the end of the first wave cycle t t 2 125 intense wave pressure is generated at the leeside of the breakwater head however with a relatively small amplitude fig 9e 4 2 wave induced pore pressure around breakwater head fig 10 and fig 11 demonstrate the wave induced pore pressure distribution on the plane x 0 it can be seen that significant pore pressure is induced in front of the breakwater head within a seabed depth of ca 1 5 m at the first five moments t t 0 25 0 50 0 75 1 00 and 1 25 even though the wave front is away from the plane slight negative pore pressure is observed on the plane with a amplitude of nearly 2 kpa fig 10a e this is due to the conservation of fluid in the wave domain when the wave crest comes into being the elevation around the wave crest increases thus leading to elevation reduction in the rest wave region besides the wave pressure applied on the seabed surface has subtracted a fixed value of 39 224 kpa which represents the hydrostatic pressure induced by 4 m deep water as a result the elevation reduction will induce negative wave pressure on the seabed before the arrival of the first wave crest as shown in fig 10 f fig 11 b when the wave crest approaches the y z plane x 0 the wave induced pore pressure on the plane gradually increased with an amplitude of 6 13 kpa at all the shown moments it can be also observed that wave induced pore pressure under the breakwater is nearly zero at the following two moments t t 1 875 2 000 the leeside of the first wave crest is still above the plane causing positive wave pressure on the plane however at t t 2 000 there is suction generated three meters away from the breakwater head as shown in fig 11 d it can be seen that the seabed response under the wave trough have the similar developing pattern in comparison with that under wave crest after the departure of the first wave crest from the plane the first wave trough arrives the plane and creates suction in the seabed t t 2 125 2 500 notably the amplitude of wave induced suction on the plane is ca 4 51 kpa which is quite smaller than that of the aforementioned wave induced positive pore pressure ca 6 13 kpa as shown in fig 11 b this might be induced by the fact that the genuine mean water level is lower than the prescribed still water level 4 m due to fluid mass conservation as mentioned before to give a deeper insight into wave induced pore pressure around the breakwater head fig 12 is adopted to show the vertical distribution of pore pressure at point a c and e when r 11 m these three points are next to the toe of the breakwater head among which a is at the frontal side of the breakwater c is right in front of the breakwater head and e is at the leeside of the breakwater as shown in fig 1 as shown in the figure the amplitude of the pore pressure decreases dramatically versus seabed depth when z 2 m and almost keeps a constant in the deeper soil range this implies that the impact of wave on seabed response is strongly localized in shallow soil range for all the three points pore pressure at the beginning of the first wave period is negative and the reason has been presented above as the mass conservation of fluid in the wave domain from t t 1 25 on pore pressure at location a turns positive whereas the at the shallow soil range of c and e pore pressure still keeps negative with time going on at t t 2 000 pore pressure at c and e turns positive completely at t t 1 5 1 750 and 2 125 pore pressure at a c and e reaches their maximum respectively then pore pressure at these three points gradually goes down and turns negative at t t 1 875 2 125 and 2 375 respectively in general it can be seen that maximum wave induced pore pressure at point a is quite higher than that of the c or e however the negative pore pressure at location c is larger than those at a and e which indicates that the seabed liquefaction in front of the breakwater head location c should be severer than those in the frontal and lee sides of the breakwater particularly it can be seen in fig 12 that the amplitude of pore pressure at location a and e increase slightly in a soil depth of 0 5 1 m however this phenomenon is not observed at c this might be induced by the fixed boundary condition at these locations at location a and e the direction of wave propagation is perpendicular to the fixed boundary while at c it is parallel to the boundary due to the fact that the cushion is one meter thick under depth of 1 m the magnitude of pore pressure drops again 4 3 effect of breakwater slope on seabed response and liquefaction it is well known that seabed consolidation would take place under the breakwater after the construction due to gravity hence additional effective stresses would be induced under the breakwater and is eventually equal to the vertical pressure of breakwater at the seabed breakwater interface when the excessive pore pressure dissipates completely hence it should be taken into consideration in estimating seabed liquefaction in this section the liquefaction criterion proposed by jeng 1997 is employed to characterize the seabed liquefaction around the breakwater head in jeng s criterion seabed liquefaction occurs when the uplifting stress p s p b p b is the negative pore pressure on seabed surface overcomes the vertical effective stress σ z 24 σ z p s p b for the subsoil of the breakwater the overburden load of breakwater weight is taken into account to indicate the anti liquefaction capacity provided of the additional effective stress due to consolidation hence the vertical effective stress σ z is composed of the additional effective stress γ b h b γ b is the unit weight of breakwater and h b is the height of breakwater and the effective stress account for the submerged weight of the seabed soil 1 3 γ s γ w 1 2 k 0 z h c 25 σ z γ b h b 1 3 γ s γ w 1 2 k 0 z h c where γ s γ w are the unit weight of soil and water respectively γ w 9807 n m 3 and γ s 1 5 γ w 14710 n m 3 is adopted in line with chang and jeng 2014 k 0 is the coefficient of earth pressure at rest and is taken as 0 5 in the present study for sandy seabed with effective friction angle φ 30 by empirical formula k 0 1 s i n φ γ b is the unit weight of breakwater taken as 23536 n m3 in this study h c 1 m is the thickness of the cushion for the rest part of seabed soil only the submerged weight of the soil is considered σ z 1 3 γ s γ w 1 2 k 0 z wave field around the breakwater head is significantly altered by wssi as discussed above resulting in complexity of wave loading on the seabed it is well recognized that seabed liquefaction will occur underneath wave trough rather than wave crest as shown in fig 8 the wave trough evolution in the vicinity of breakwater head presents a complex pattern consequently the potential seabed liquefaction around breakwater head is going to have distinctive characteristics fig 13 shows the breakwater section with different slopes among which the case of slope 1 2 case a is the standard case that has been used to discuss the wave characteristics wave loading and seabed response around the breakwater head in the above three subsections from a to c breakwater crest width w increase from 2 to 7 m and breakwater slope decreases monotonically from 1 2 to 1 1 5 fig 14 presents the vertical distribution of pore pressure with various breakwater slopes when t t 2 375 it is observed that with the increase of breakwater slope the wave induced pore pressure tends to increase in the whole soil depth this indicates that the increase of breakwater slope intensifies the wave diffraction around the breakwater head with a milder breakwater slope the wave energy might be dissipated more significantly due to the larger area of water bed friction besides increase of breakwater slope narrows the cross section of wave in front of the breakwater head which also contributes to the increase of seabed response fig 15 illustrates the liquefaction depth at y z section x 0 with various breakwater slopes it is shown that the liquefaction depth in the vicinity of breakwater head y 11 21 m is significant and the maximum liquefaction depth reaches up to 1 35 m when breakwater slope is 1 1 5 when y exceeds 21 m the liquefaction depth is relatively insignificant obviously the increase of breakwater slope deepens the liquefaction depth in the proximity of breakwater head 11 m y 21 m when y surpasses 21 m the influence of breakwater and its slope on seabed liquefaction is negligible as shown on this section to ensure the stability of breakwater countermeasures such as replacing the seabed with coarser sand chang and jeng 2014 should be taken to protect the breakwater head from liquefaction induced damage also in the design of breakwater it is suggested to make the breakwater slope as mild as possible 5 conclusion this paper proposed a 3d integrated numerical scheme to explore wssi problems around slope breakwater head wave induced oscillatory seabed response is explored the main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the turbulent wave motion is successfully modelled wave incidence reflection diffraction overtopping and plunging breaker are observed in this study after the strong wssi in the vicinity of breakwater head the wave trains behind the breakwater present significant irregularity the wave pressure on seabed surface and pore pressure in the seabed are highest in front of the breakwater and decreases with the process of diffraction around the breakwater head due to wave energy depletion 2 the maximum wave induced negative pore pressure in front of the breakwater head tends to be larger than those in the frontal and lee sides of the breakwater leading to severer seabed liquefaction 3 existence of breakwater aggravates the seabed liquefaction in the vicinity of breakwater head and breakwater slope has significant effect on seabed response and liquefaction when the slope increases the magnitude of wave induced pore pressure around the breakwater head increases and it aggravates the seabed liquefaction in the proximity of the breakwater head therefore it is suggested to make the breakwater slope as mild as possible in design acknowledgements the authors are grateful for the financial

23434,the problem of wave structure seabed interactions wssi around impermeable slope breakwater head is numerically investigated with a three dimensional 3d integrated model the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations are adopted to simulate the wave induced fluid motion and biot s theory for poro elastic medium is employed to describe the seabed behaviour under wave loading a calculation scheme is established to integrate both wave motion and seabed response the numerical results reveal that wave induced flow field in the vicinity of breakwater heads is significantly disturbed by the existence of the structure leading to wave reflection diffraction and overtopping furthermore the wave induced negative pore pressure and liquefaction near the front of the breakwater heads is significant the parametric study concludes that the increase of breakwater slope intensifies the seabed response and liquefaction around the breakwater head and therefore it is proposed to design breakwaters with a mild slope keywords wssi rans biot s theory slope breakwater head liquefaction 1 introduction the phenomenon of the wave structure seabed interactions wssi has attracted great concern from researchers and practical engineers in the field of ocean engineering involving the design of marine infrastructure such as pipelines sumer 2014 breakwaters ye et al 2013a b 2016 2017 and pile foundations lin et al 2017 sui et al 2017 zhao et al 2017a b there have been numerous reports on the wave induced structure failure worldwide such as the sines breakwater failure smith and gordon 1983 and offshore platform failure of mississippi river delta bea et al 1983 the failure of sines is directly induced by breakage of dolosse silvester and hsu 1989 while the latter is mainly caused by seabed movement among the reasons for marine structure failures seabed instability plays a critical role under the action of wave loading pore water pressure would be generated in the seabed when it exceeds certain limit seabed liquefaction and shear failure might happen and further lead to structure failure oumeraci 1994 rahman 1991 based on laboratory experiments and field studies two mechanisms of wave induced pore pressures have been reported in the literature i e the oscillatory mechanism and residual mechanism zen and yamazaki 1990 nago et al 1993 jeng 2013 the oscillatory mechanism is the basic feature of wave induced pore pressure which is caused by the cycling excitation of wave trains however the residual mechanism is induced by the contraction of relatively loose soil seed and rahman 1978 sassa and sekiguchi 1999 and mainly occurs when the seabed is enduring extreme loadings such as storm and tsunami the importance and applicable range of both mechanisms have been reported in jeng and seymour 2007 in this study we focus on the oscillatory soil response and its resultant momentary liquefaction breakwater is one of the most common coastal structures which is used to protect the coastal facilities such as a harbour from strong wave and storm loading hence breakwater is susceptible to wave induced failure and gains lots of attention from coastal engineers and researchers recently focusing on the wave induced seabed response many efforts are being devoted to deal with wssi around breakwaters including field monitoring dean et al 1997 guler et al 2015 analytical solutions jeng 1997 physical modelling kudella et al 2006 and numerical simulation jeng et al 2001 mostafa et al 1999 ulker et al 2010 jeng et al 2013 ye et al 2012 2016 however most of the studies only consider the wssi in front of the breakwater trunk as a matter of fact wssi in vicinity of breakwater heads is different from that around breakwater trunk vidal et al 1991 experimentally studied the stability of a slope breakwater s head and trunk and found that the head and trunk display different behaviour when damage grows and the head section is more vulnerable than trunk section the major reason for this difference is supposed to be that the flow regime around breakwater head is different from trunk section when wave reaches the breakwater head it causes steady streaming plunging breaker streamline contraction and lee wake vortices giving rise to complex effects on seabed and thus resulting in seabed destruction such as scour fredsøe and sumer 1997 recently a few researchers have paid attention to wssi in vicinity of breakwater head li and jeng 2008 and jeng and ou 2010 numerically simulated the wave induced seabed response around breakwater head taking into account of incident reflected and diffracted waves however the breakwater used in their model is simplified as a single line without width and height and only linear wave theory is used in their model zhao et al 2013 then studied the wave induced seabed response around a vertical breakwater head using a 3d integrated numerical model taking into account of turbulence as a matter of fact breakwater configuration such as shape significantly affects the wave diffraction around the breakwater head thus determining the wave loading acting on seabed therefore wave induced seabed response varies with breakwater configuration in this paper a 3d integrated numerical scheme consisting of wave sub model and seabed sub model is proposed to explore the seabed response around slope breakwater head reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans with k ε turbulent model are used to describe the wave motion thus the wave induced turbulence in the vicinity of breakwater could be appropriately modelled under ordinary wave loadings the quasi static qs equations proposed by biot 1941 is sufficient and efficient for modelling seabed response ulker et al 2009 and is adopted to model the seabed response in the present study the realization of the proposed numerical scheme is performed using openfoam and comsol scripts comsol with matlab firstly in wave sub model the rans equations with k ε turbulence closure in openfoam is employed to calculate the wave pressure in the first two wave periods in the present study we study the oscillatory seabed response to wave loading correspondingly residual seabed response is not considered therefore the seabed response in the first wave period could reflect the seabed response to a newly coming wave which has not been dealt with in the previous studies the seabed response in the second wave period corresponds to the seabed response to the succeeding wave train then in seabed sub model we compiled the biot s equations into comsol scripts via the pde partial differential equation module to govern the seabed response 2 theoretical formulations in this section the theoretical formulation of the proposed 3d model is firstly presented including the wave model seabed model boundary condition and numerical scheme the model of wssi in the present study is sketched in fig 1 the breakwater is a slope breakwater with an underlying cushion the breakwater head is a semicircle in top view and its slope is identical to that of the trunk the seabed is taken as sandy deposits thus biot s theory for poro elastic medium is available to model the seabed behaviour in this study the breakwater is considered to be armoured with impermeable layers hence in this study the breakwater is taken as an impermeable rigid object the origin of cartesian coordinates point o is located at the centre of aforementioned semicircle of the breakwater head points a b c d and e are in the seabed with identical varying radius r and wave induced pore pressure at these points are used as indicators to reveal seabed response around the breakwater head the ocean wave is propagating along the positive x direction 2 1 wave model in the model the 3d rans equations are solved for two incompressible phases using a finite volume discretization by openfoam according to mass and momentum conservation the incompressible fluid motion due to wave could be expressed in the form of einstein summation convention 1 u f i x f i 0 2 ρ f u f i t ρ f u f i u f j x j p f x i x j μ u f i x j u f j x i x j ρ f u f i u f j ρ f g i where u f i i 1 2 3

fluid density t is the time and g i i 1 2 3 is the body force in the x y and z direction respectively in the present study the only body force is gravity in z direction g 9 80665 m s 2 the term ρ f u

turbulent viscosity k 1 2 u f i u f i and is the turbulent kinematic energy and δ i j is the kronecker delta by substituting eq 3 into eq 2 eq 2 could be expressed as 4 ρ f u f i t ρ f u f i u f j x j p f 2 3 ρ f k x i x j μ e f f u f i x j u f j x i ρ f g i 2 3 μ t x j u i x i δ i j where μ e f f μ μ t is the total effective viscosity to solve eq 1 and eq 4 k ε turbulence model launder and spalding 1974 is adopted firstly a variable called turbulent dissipation rate ε is introduced into the model 5 ε μ ρ f u f i x k u f i x k hence a connection between ε and turbulent kinematic energy k could be established as 6 ε c d k 2 3 l k in which c d is a constant l k is a length characterizing the macroscale of turbulence eventually the k ε turbulence model is deduced as 7 ρ f k t ρ f k u f i

stresses free surface pressure and advection are explicitly solved while the pressure is solved implicitly with generalized minimal residual algorithm 2 2 seabed model in this study the porous seabed is considered as isotropic homogeneous sandy seabed with the same permeability k s in all directions x y and z accordingly the conservation of mass could be expressed as 11 δ p s γ w n s β s k s p s t γ w k s ε s t 0 where δ 2 x 2 2 y 2 2 z 2 is the laplace operator p s is the wave induced pore water pressure γ w is the unit weight of pore water n s is the soil porosity β s is the compressibility of pore fluid and ε s is the volume strain which are defined as the follows 12 ε s u s x v s y w s z 13 β s 1 k w 1 s r p w o where u s v s w s are soil displacements in the x y and z direction respectively k w is true elasticity modulus of water taken as 2 10 9 n m 2 yamamoto et al 1978 p w o is the absolute water pressure atmosphere plus hydrostatic pressure on the seabed surface and s r is the degree of saturation according to terzaghi s principle of effective stress the total stress of soil σ i j could be decomposed into effective stress σ i j and pore pressure p s 14 σ i j σ i j δ i j p s where δ i j is the kronecker delta in general there are two body forces involved in this study i e the gravity and inertia force before the action of water waves the seabed usually reaches equilibrium under gravity loading when exploring small amplitude wave induced seabed response the effect of inertia forces is commonly excluded therefore the body forces are usually excluded in the previous studies on wssi chang and jeng 2014 lin et al 2016 2017 zhao et al 2017a 2017b for the effect of inertia force on seabed response it is referred to the works of jeng and his coworkers jeng et al 1999 jeng and rahman 2000 luan et al 2008 herein leaving out the body forces and inertia terms the equilibrium equations could be expressed in the following partial differential equations pdes 15 g δ u s i g 1 2 μ s ε s x i p s x i in which g is the shear modulus u si is the soil displacement δ is the laplace operator and μ s is the poisson s ratio in the present study the poro elastic constitutive relationship is applied to describe the seabed soil behaviour hence the effective normal stress and shear stress can be expressed in terms of soil displacements as 16 σ i j g δ i k δ j l μ s 1 2 μ s δ i j δ k l u k x l u l x k equations 11 15 and 16 with appropriate boundary conditions are capable of capturing the wave induced pore pressure displacements and effective stresses in a porous seabed 2 3 boundary conditions as shown in fig 1 the wssi in the present study involves seawater seabed and breakwater thus is a complex boundary value problem bvp herein the boundary conditions used in the present study is a vital issue in the wave model cartesian coordinate system is adopted and the wave is generated at x 0 5 l l is the model length with airy wave theory as a matter of fact wave reflection takes place from the frontal side of the breakwater which would give rise to secondary wave reflection from the wave maker boundary to eliminate the secondary wave reflection chen and hsiao 2016 proposed a novel wave generating method using a mass source wave maker in the present study the wssi in the first a few wave cycles is examined therefore the influence of secondary reflected wave from the wave maker boundary could be avoided with a large domain size of which the distance of breakwater from the wave maker boundary exceeds one thus it would be of efficiency to leave out the secondary reflection from the wave maker boundary for outflow condition at x 0 5 l sommerfeld radiation boundary condition is applied as 17 q t c q x 0 where q is any given quantity c is the local phase speed of the wavelike flow at the two side surfaces zero gradient and zero velocity conditions normal to the two surfaces are applied 18 p f y u f i y 0 at the sea floor no slip and zero velocity conditions are applied 19 u f i 0 at the air fluid interface volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 is used to track the free surface elevation in the seabed model the horizontal displacements of the four lateral boundaries are set as zero 20 u s v s 0 the seabed bottom is taken as impermeable rigid bedrock 21 u s i p s z 0 at the seabed surface the water wave pressure p wv extracted from the wave model is applied 22 p s p w v p f γ w h w the breakwater is taken as impermeable rigid body and no flow boundary is applied on its surface i e the gradient of pore pressure is zero 23 p s n 0 where n is the normal to breakwater surface with above boundary conditions the governing equations for wave model and seabed model are closed and corresponding results are got in this study 2 4 numerical scheme in this study the proposed model consists of two separate submodels wave model and seabed model in the wave model the wave motion is continuously calculated thus wave induced wave pressure at any given moment could be obtained as a dynamic loading to be applied on the seabed to implement the simulation a series of calculations are carried out in the present study to integrate the wave model with the seabed model as shown in fig 2 at the beginning the wave motion is activated first in wave model using openfoam which is a generic cfd program solved by finite volume method then the wave pressure p 1 at a given moment t t 1 n n is a given integer that divides a wave period into n sub periods is extracted and applied to the seabed model which is developed in the comsol scripts comsol with matlab via its user defined pde module in the seabed model the solution of the former moment t t i n is set as the initial condition of the following step t t i 1 n thus the present model could be able to simulate the seabed response more realistically 3 model validation the proposed model will be calibrated against available existing experimental data in this section including those of jeng et al 2005 zang et al 2010 and liu et al 2015 the input data adopted in the validation are the same as those used in the experiments as tabulated in table 1 3 1 wave model validation jeng et al 2005 conducted a series of flume tests to examine the water surface elevation and pore pressure inside the seabed when ocean waves propagating over a submerged slope breakwater in front of a vertical seawall more details could be found in the literature in their experiment the wave profiles at four sections are recorded denoted as section 1 2 3 and 4 in the present study we calibrated the present model using the experiment data of test 2 of these tests with a grid size of 1 mm the results of the present numerical model and the experiment are shown in fig 3 in test 2 the wave period t 1 s wave height h 1 02 cm water depth h w 17 cm in the figure t is time η 1 η 2 η 3 and η 4 are the time series of free surface elevation at section 1 2 3 and 4 respectively a 0 5h is the wave amplitude it can be seen from fig 3 that the result of the present model overall agrees well with the experiment in the first three wave periods after meeting the first wave at section 1 2 and 3 there is a slight phase difference between the two curves and at section 4 it is more significant this might be induced by the fact that the wave generator in the experiment is a rocking paddle which makes the wave generating boundary indeterminate and hence the phase difference is generated in the succeeding wave periods the amplitude of the wave profile is significantly intensified due to wave reflection from the seawall however due to the defect of wall boundary used in the present model this phenomenon is not properly modelled in this paper we focus on the wave induced impact on seabed around breakwater head during the first two wave periods without wave reflection from the outlet boundary hence the present model could be a sufficient expedient to tackle the wave motion zang et al 2010 carried out laboratory tests to examine the steep wave interaction with a vertical circular cylinder in their experiments a cylinder with diameter of 0 25 m is installed 7 8 m from the wave paddle in a wave flume with a mean water depth of 0 505 m and more details about the experiment setup could be found in chen et al 2014 among the experiments the test with wave height 0 14 m and wave period 1 22 s is employed to validate the capacity of the present model to simulate wave diffraction with cell size of 0 015 m 0 015 m 0 01 m as shown in fig 4 in the figure wave gauge 1 is located 0 77 m from the wave paddle and wave gauge 2 is 0 002 m from the frontal surface of the cylinder along the centerline it is seen that the results of the present model reach an overall good agreement with the experiment data hence the present model should be capable of modelling the wssi around breakwater head 3 2 seabed model validation liu et al 2015 performed one dimensional 1d experiments to probe into the pore pressure response under wave loading in sandy seabed in their experiments they measured pore pressure evolution in the seabed with different depths we numerically modelled their experiments with element size of 0 2 mm 0 1 m and the result of pore pressure cycling with seabed depth z 26 7 cm are shown in fig 5 in the figure t is the time t is the wave period and p s is the wave induced pore pressure in seabed it can be observed that the present model simulated the experiments fairly well the prediction of the present model is almost identical to the analytical solution of hsu and jeng 1994 it can be observed that the calculated amplitude of pore pressure is slightly smaller than that of the experiment this might be caused by the gravity that makes the seabed loose near seabed surface and dense in the deep range while in our model the seabed is assumed to be homogenized thus the calculated results would be smaller in the shallow range and larger in the deep range after all this discrepancy is negligible hence the present model is an adequate approach to model seabed response under wave actions 4 results and discussion in this section the features of wave motion dynamic wave pressures on seabed and wave induced pore pressures will be presented in section 4 1 4 2 and 4 3 respectively then the effect of breakwater slope on seabed response and liquefaction around breakwater head is parametrically studied the input data used in this section is tabulated in table 2 ye and jeng 2012 pointed out the domain length has to be at least two times wavelength to eliminate the influence of the fixed boundary hence the domain plane size is set as 3 5l w 3 5l w of which the wavelength l w is 34 7 m therefore the seabed size is 121 6 m 121 6 m 12 m in previous studies parametric study of wave and seabed characteristics has been widely performed jeng and ou 2010 li and jeng 2008 ulker et al 2010 ye et al 2014 2016 zhang et al 2011 zhao and jeng 2015 therefore in the present study only the parametric study of breakwater slope α is carried out in subsection 4 4 with breakwater crest width w varying from 2 to 7 m in the rest subsections w 2 m 4 1 wave characteristics around breakwater head in this subsection the wave motion mainly free surface elevation and wave pressure acting on seabed surface during the wssi of the first two wave cycles will be presented fig 6 and fig 7 display the development of free surface elevation during wave propagation it can be observed that the first wave crest η 5 m η is the wave profile comes into being at the wave generation boundary when t t 0 25 generating a maximum wave pressure of ca 6 33 kpa on seafloor fig 8 a thereafter the wave crest propagates towards the breakwater after over a wave period of propagation when t t 1 50 the front of the first wave comes across the breakwater giving rise to higher wave pressure fig 8f due to obstruction of breakwater on wave propagation then with wave crest approaching the breakwater the maximum free surface elevation goes up reaching a maximum of 6 m when t t 1 750 fig 7b due to the fact that the breakwater top is only 1 m beyond the still water surface when the wave crest reaches the breakwater t t 1 625 wave overtopping arises as shown in fig 7a it can be seen that the breakwater is completely submerged by the wave set up when t t 1 875 meanwhile wave diffraction around the breakwater head and wave reflection from the breakwater are also observed at t t 1 25 the second wave crest emerges and moves towards the breakwater however it can be observed that the second wave crest significantly differs from that of the first wave due to the reflected wave from t t 2 000 on the plunging breaker is gradually developed by interaction of the second wave and the reflected wave when the fully developed plunging breaker approaches the breakwater at t t 2 375 wave breaking occurs in front of the breakwater then at t t 2 500 wave breaking in front of the breakwater head e g point o is observed figs 8 and 9 illustrate the wave induced pressure impacting on seabed surface which excludes the hydrostatic pore pressure ca 39 kpa it can be concluded that the maximum wave pressure is induced beneath the wave crest and has similar developing pattern as the wave crest with the emergence of the first wave crest the wave pressure exceeds 6 kpa fig 8a after a half wave period t t 0 750 the first wave crest comes into being and generates a negative wave pressure of 7 33 kpa fig 8c when the wave front approaches the breakwater at t t 1 25 fig 8e a slight increase of maximum wave pressure is observed making the maximum wave pressure reach 6 42 kpa this implies that the breakwater starts to exert effect on wave motion then at the next moment t t 1 50 the maximum wave pressure is induced in front of the breakwater as the wave motion is obstructed by the breakwater and it reaches a value of ca 7 8 kpa fig 8f however the wave induces pore pressure in front of the breakwater head e g point o is relatively insignificant when the wave crest reaches the breakwater completely at t t 1 750 fig 9b the wave pressure reaches a maximum of ca 6 3 kpa in front of the breakwater head finally at the end of the first wave cycle t t 2 125 intense wave pressure is generated at the leeside of the breakwater head however with a relatively small amplitude fig 9e 4 2 wave induced pore pressure around breakwater head fig 10 and fig 11 demonstrate the wave induced pore pressure distribution on the plane x 0 it can be seen that significant pore pressure is induced in front of the breakwater head within a seabed depth of ca 1 5 m at the first five moments t t 0 25 0 50 0 75 1 00 and 1 25 even though the wave front is away from the plane slight negative pore pressure is observed on the plane with a amplitude of nearly 2 kpa fig 10a e this is due to the conservation of fluid in the wave domain when the wave crest comes into being the elevation around the wave crest increases thus leading to elevation reduction in the rest wave region besides the wave pressure applied on the seabed surface has subtracted a fixed value of 39 224 kpa which represents the hydrostatic pressure induced by 4 m deep water as a result the elevation reduction will induce negative wave pressure on the seabed before the arrival of the first wave crest as shown in fig 10 f fig 11 b when the wave crest approaches the y z plane x 0 the wave induced pore pressure on the plane gradually increased with an amplitude of 6 13 kpa at all the shown moments it can be also observed that wave induced pore pressure under the breakwater is nearly zero at the following two moments t t 1 875 2 000 the leeside of the first wave crest is still above the plane causing positive wave pressure on the plane however at t t 2 000 there is suction generated three meters away from the breakwater head as shown in fig 11 d it can be seen that the seabed response under the wave trough have the similar developing pattern in comparison with that under wave crest after the departure of the first wave crest from the plane the first wave trough arrives the plane and creates suction in the seabed t t 2 125 2 500 notably the amplitude of wave induced suction on the plane is ca 4 51 kpa which is quite smaller than that of the aforementioned wave induced positive pore pressure ca 6 13 kpa as shown in fig 11 b this might be induced by the fact that the genuine mean water level is lower than the prescribed still water level 4 m due to fluid mass conservation as mentioned before to give a deeper insight into wave induced pore pressure around the breakwater head fig 12 is adopted to show the vertical distribution of pore pressure at point a c and e when r 11 m these three points are next to the toe of the breakwater head among which a is at the frontal side of the breakwater c is right in front of the breakwater head and e is at the leeside of the breakwater as shown in fig 1 as shown in the figure the amplitude of the pore pressure decreases dramatically versus seabed depth when z 2 m and almost keeps a constant in the deeper soil range this implies that the impact of wave on seabed response is strongly localized in shallow soil range for all the three points pore pressure at the beginning of the first wave period is negative and the reason has been presented above as the mass conservation of fluid in the wave domain from t t 1 25 on pore pressure at location a turns positive whereas the at the shallow soil range of c and e pore pressure still keeps negative with time going on at t t 2 000 pore pressure at c and e turns positive completely at t t 1 5 1 750 and 2 125 pore pressure at a c and e reaches their maximum respectively then pore pressure at these three points gradually goes down and turns negative at t t 1 875 2 125 and 2 375 respectively in general it can be seen that maximum wave induced pore pressure at point a is quite higher than that of the c or e however the negative pore pressure at location c is larger than those at a and e which indicates that the seabed liquefaction in front of the breakwater head location c should be severer than those in the frontal and lee sides of the breakwater particularly it can be seen in fig 12 that the amplitude of pore pressure at location a and e increase slightly in a soil depth of 0 5 1 m however this phenomenon is not observed at c this might be induced by the fixed boundary condition at these locations at location a and e the direction of wave propagation is perpendicular to the fixed boundary while at c it is parallel to the boundary due to the fact that the cushion is one meter thick under depth of 1 m the magnitude of pore pressure drops again 4 3 effect of breakwater slope on seabed response and liquefaction it is well known that seabed consolidation would take place under the breakwater after the construction due to gravity hence additional effective stresses would be induced under the breakwater and is eventually equal to the vertical pressure of breakwater at the seabed breakwater interface when the excessive pore pressure dissipates completely hence it should be taken into consideration in estimating seabed liquefaction in this section the liquefaction criterion proposed by jeng 1997 is employed to characterize the seabed liquefaction around the breakwater head in jeng s criterion seabed liquefaction occurs when the uplifting stress p s p b p b is the negative pore pressure on seabed surface overcomes the vertical effective stress σ z 24 σ z p s p b for the subsoil of the breakwater the overburden load of breakwater weight is taken into account to indicate the anti liquefaction capacity provided of the additional effective stress due to consolidation hence the vertical effective stress σ z is composed of the additional effective stress γ b h b γ b is the unit weight of breakwater and h b is the height of breakwater and the effective stress account for the submerged weight of the seabed soil 1 3 γ s γ w 1 2 k 0 z h c 25 σ z γ b h b 1 3 γ s γ w 1 2 k 0 z h c where γ s γ w are the unit weight of soil and water respectively γ w 9807 n m 3 and γ s 1 5 γ w 14710 n m 3 is adopted in line with chang and jeng 2014 k 0 is the coefficient of earth pressure at rest and is taken as 0 5 in the present study for sandy seabed with effective friction angle φ 30 by empirical formula k 0 1 s i n φ γ b is the unit weight of breakwater taken as 23536 n m3 in this study h c 1 m is the thickness of the cushion for the rest part of seabed soil only the submerged weight of the soil is considered σ z 1 3 γ s γ w 1 2 k 0 z wave field around the breakwater head is significantly altered by wssi as discussed above resulting in complexity of wave loading on the seabed it is well recognized that seabed liquefaction will occur underneath wave trough rather than wave crest as shown in fig 8 the wave trough evolution in the vicinity of breakwater head presents a complex pattern consequently the potential seabed liquefaction around breakwater head is going to have distinctive characteristics fig 13 shows the breakwater section with different slopes among which the case of slope 1 2 case a is the standard case that has been used to discuss the wave characteristics wave loading and seabed response around the breakwater head in the above three subsections from a to c breakwater crest width w increase from 2 to 7 m and breakwater slope decreases monotonically from 1 2 to 1 1 5 fig 14 presents the vertical distribution of pore pressure with various breakwater slopes when t t 2 375 it is observed that with the increase of breakwater slope the wave induced pore pressure tends to increase in the whole soil depth this indicates that the increase of breakwater slope intensifies the wave diffraction around the breakwater head with a milder breakwater slope the wave energy might be dissipated more significantly due to the larger area of water bed friction besides increase of breakwater slope narrows the cross section of wave in front of the breakwater head which also contributes to the increase of seabed response fig 15 illustrates the liquefaction depth at y z section x 0 with various breakwater slopes it is shown that the liquefaction depth in the vicinity of breakwater head y 11 21 m is significant and the maximum liquefaction depth reaches up to 1 35 m when breakwater slope is 1 1 5 when y exceeds 21 m the liquefaction depth is relatively insignificant obviously the increase of breakwater slope deepens the liquefaction depth in the proximity of breakwater head 11 m y 21 m when y surpasses 21 m the influence of breakwater and its slope on seabed liquefaction is negligible as shown on this section to ensure the stability of breakwater countermeasures such as replacing the seabed with coarser sand chang and jeng 2014 should be taken to protect the breakwater head from liquefaction induced damage also in the design of breakwater it is suggested to make the breakwater slope as mild as possible 5 conclusion this paper proposed a 3d integrated numerical scheme to explore wssi problems around slope breakwater head wave induced oscillatory seabed response is explored the main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the turbulent wave motion is successfully modelled wave incidence reflection diffraction overtopping and plunging breaker are observed in this study after the strong wssi in the vicinity of breakwater head the wave trains behind the breakwater present significant irregularity the wave pressure on seabed surface and pore pressure in the seabed are highest in front of the breakwater and decreases with the process of diffraction around the breakwater head due to wave energy depletion 2 the maximum wave induced negative pore pressure in front of the breakwater head tends to be larger than those in the frontal and lee sides of the breakwater leading to severer seabed liquefaction 3 existence of breakwater aggravates the seabed liquefaction in the vicinity of breakwater head and breakwater slope has significant effect on seabed response and liquefaction when the slope increases the magnitude of wave induced pore pressure around the breakwater head increases and it aggravates the seabed liquefaction in the proximity of the breakwater head therefore it is suggested to make the breakwater slope as mild as possible in design acknowledgements the authors are grateful for the financial
