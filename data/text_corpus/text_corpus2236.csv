11180,maintain high agriculture production levels while reducing environmental impacts is of primordial importance in intensive irrigated areas adequate management of water and nitrogen are critical for a sustainable agriculture the objectives of this work were to i calibrate and validate dssat model for maize under different nitrogen availability conditions and ii assess the effect of best management practices on irrigation water needs and nitrogen losses by leaching using different scenarios in an intensive irrigated area for model calibration and validation three field experiments were conducted with a total of 134 plots then the model application was performed in three soil types in the del reguero watershed spain considering i real irrigation applied by farmers and dssat automatic irrigation and ii a recommended dose of n fertilizer 250 kg n ha 1 compared to a traditional dose of 390 kg n ha 1 among all plots the model simulated reasonably well grain yield with a root mean square error rmse lower than 708 kg ha 1 and high willmott agreement index d statistic 0 9 very similar trends were observed for total biomass and total n uptake with a rmse of 2018 kg ha 1 and 36 6 kg n ha 1 the prediction of residual nitrate in soil was acceptable with a rmse of 43 kg n ha 1 modeling results showed that adjusted irrigation would reduce on average for different soil types the total amount of seasonal irrigation water by 31 and the nitrate leaching by 97 without a significant reduction in grain yield regarding to n fertilizer scenarios results showed that farmers can

model calibration irrigation management fertilizer managements nutrients losses 1 introduction nutrient pollution is currently the major environmental problem of surface water bodies vitousek et al 2009 reducing nutrient losses from agricultural soils to surface and groundwater resources is one of the greatest challenges facing agricultural systems in intensive irrigated areas this is especially relevant in maize fields where nitrogen n is the most limiting nutrient nivong et al 2007 and farmers tended to overfertilize with n to ensure maximum yields avoiding yield reductions associated to n deficiency gaudin et al 2015 liu et al 2012 moreover maize has long been recognized as a major contributor of irrigated areas diffuse pollution in the world klocke et al 1999 pratt et al 1984 and similarly in several irrigated areas in spain barros et al 2011 cavero et al 2012 especially in the ebro river basin the n pollution has been found to be a concern and in particular in irrigation return flows isidoro et al 2006 nitrogen is applied at rates of over 300 kg n ha 1 in fields that are only fertilized with mineral n and at more than 400 kg n ha 1 in those fertilized with manure sisquella et al 2004 furthermore cavero et al 2003 found that the nitrate loads exported per unit area in the irrigation return flows of two sprinkler irrigation districts predominantly grown to maize vary depending on irrigation and n fertilization management between 18 and 49 kg no3 n ha 1 year 1 within this area the ground waters are frequently polluted with nitrate ferrer et al 2003 with concentrations often exceeding 50 mg no 3 l 1 the maximum level permitted by the european union 1991 for drinking water quality several experimental studies have been conducted at district level in order to analyze and quantify n contamination induced by irrigation and fertilization management in irrigation return flows barros et al 2011 2012 isidoro et al 2006 however most of these studies were performed for short periods of time and did not allow identifying the effects of long term agronomic changes and climate variability on irrigation and n losses trends furthermore there is a need for further studies to assess agronomic practices that would enable these areas to increase the efficiency of their n fertilization while at the same time reducing nitrate leaching from maize plots to water bodies the key strategy to reduce off site nutrient pollution is to optimize irrigation and fertilization practices cavero et al 2012 klocke et al 1999 salmerón et al 2014 crop models have been developed and used worldwide as operational and strategic research and decision support tools in crop production and resources management mourice et al 2014 however continuous calibration and validation of a crop model is extremely important when it is applied for new locations with new crop varieties lópez cedrón et al 2008 concerning maize modelling ceres maize included into dssat model decision support system for agrotechnologie transfer hoogenboom et al 2010 has been used extensively worldwide amarala et al 2015 jones et al 2003 to crop simulation under different management

climate change araya et al 2015 farhangfar et al 2015 ngwira et al 2014 and fertilizer n management li et al 2015 proved that dssat was a useful and reliable tool for simulating long term trends of maize grain yield soil organic c and soil organic n based over 14 years from temperate semi arid to semi humid weather conditions in northwestern china salmerón et al 2014 used dssat to simulate the impact of including winter cover crops in maize monoculture on yields and n leaching for a range of soil types and irrigation managements during a 14 years rotation crop in la violada watershed spain the model simulated successfully crop n uptake but was less accurate simulating the evolution of inorganic soil n thorp et al 2007 simulated the long term effects of different n application rates on maize production and sub surface nitrate n concentration in drainage water in iowa usa and concluded that reducing long term n rates from 180 to 130 kg n ha 1 corresponded to an 18 reduction in n mass lost to water resources liu et al 2011 simulated the crop yield and nitrogen dynamics under 50 continuous years maize production experiment in canada soler et al 2011 evaluated the performances of the dssat csm and century based soil modules in predicting crop yield and soil organic carbon dynamics for different crop rotations and fertilizer levels using the observed data set from an experiment conducted in a semi arid region of west africa during 1993 to 2004 period however studies dealing with long term analysis of irrigation and nitrogen performance at the irrigation district level and its evolution are lacking moreover applying the dssat model is a useful for supplementing field experiments allowing to identify the best management strategies in a particular area of study therefore the main objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the dssat performance to predict maize yield n uptake grain and plant and residual soil mineral n under different soil mineral n availability conditions and 2 determine the best management practices of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization under different management scenarios in intensive semi arid irrigated mediterranean conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental data for model calibration and validation data were collected from three field experiments located in the ebro valley northeast spain in the locations of montañana 41 44 n 0 49 w 225 m a s l and almudévar 42 02 n 0 34 w 400 m a s l these experiments were performed during 2010 in montañana exp 1 2011 and 2012 in almudévar exp 2 and exp 3 respectively and were part of a study to evaluate the comparison of different strategies in order to manage the nitrogen fertilizer in irrigated areas isla et al 2012 a total of 38 plots from exp 1 47 from exp 2 and 49 from exp 3 were used in this study for ceres maize calibration and validation processes in each experiment the elementary plot size was 4 5 m by 12 5 m with a total of 6 plants rows per plot the study area is characterized by mediterranean semiarid climate with annual maximum and minimum daily air temperatures of 19 6 and 5 7 c in montañana and 21 and 8 1 c in almudévar respectively the yearly average precipitation 1981 2010 is 347 mm and 443 mm and the yearly average evapotranspiration et0 is 1230 mm and 1331 mm in montañana and almudévar respectively the main soil characteristics for both locations are presented in table 1 a maize crop zea mays l cv pioneer pr34n43 was sown with row spacing of 0 75 m and an average final plant density of 74 000 plant ha 1 in fields managed using conventional equipment maize crop was irrigated using solid set sprinkler irrigation system triangular layout of 18 m x 18 m using an application rate of 5 mm h 1 the weekly irrigation requirements were calculated from the daily values of reference evapotranspiration et0 calculated using the fao penman monteith equation and the martinez cob 2008 crop coefficients kc following the fao methodology allen et al 1998 the irrigation efficiency was set to 85 main characteristics of crop management and key dates for exp 1 2 and 3 are presented in table 2 in each experiment the previous year of the study three clearly different doses of n fertilizer were applied to a maize crop in different areas of the field to create different initial soil mineral nitrogen smn content in addition and during the crop season the plots included in the study received different amounts of n fertilizer ranging from 0 control to 400 kg n ha 1 overfertilized providing a wide variation of crop n availability among the different plots table 2 therefore averaging over experiments the minimum and maximum mineral nitrogen available estimated as the initial smn plus the n fertilizer ranged from 93 to 744 kg ha 1 all the ears in 2 rows of 8 m length per plot 12 m2 were hand harvested to determine yield number of plants number of grains per square meter and unit kernel mass km at each experimental plot the plants contained in an area of 3 m2 were harvested to estimate the total plant biomass a subsample of grain and plants were dried at 65 c weighed and ground prior to analyses of total n by dry combustion method truspec cn leco st joseph mi usa grain and plant total n uptake was calculated as the product of grain or plant biomass and n content at each experimental plot the soil was sampled every year after maize harvest three soil samples from each experimental plot were taken using a 5 cm diameter hand auger and the three samples were combined for each 0 3 m until 1 2 m depth the soil was fresh sieved to pass a 2 mm sieve and 10 g were extracted with 30 ml of kcl 2 n solution for determination of no3 n and nh4 n concentrations by colorimetry with a continuous flow analyzer aa3 bran luebbe norderstedt germany another soil subsample was dried at 105 c to constant weight for gravimetric water content determination gravimetric water content was converted to volumetric water content using a bulk density of 1 5 g cm 3 2 2 model calibration and validation the version dssat 4 5 was used in this study hoogenboom et al 2010 ceres maize cultivar calibration

physiological maturity g3 potential kernel growth rate g2 potential kernel number per plant and phint phyllochron interval the model calibration was performed using crop data obtained under non limiting growth conditions using 20 overfertilized plots from exp 2 9 plots and exp 3 11 plots initially the cultivar coefficients of the same maize cultivar previously calibrated by salmerón et al 2014 under similar environmental conditions were tested and considered as a starting point for our calibration process then an iterative approach was used to obtain acceptable genetic coefficients through trial and error adjustments until an adequate match between measured and simulated productivity crop data was found the soil fertility factor slpf was also manually adjusted as it is an input parameter that affects the overall growth rate of simulated total biomass by modifying daily canopy photosynthesis and is attributed to soil fertility differences and soil based pests a calibrated value of 0 69 was applied in exp 1 based on the best fit between potential simulated yield under adjusted condition and observed values in addition the n concentration coefficient ctcnp2 is an input parameter defined in the species file related the change of plant n concentration as a function of growth stage as recommended by liu et al 2012 the ctcnp2 was also calibrated in the ceres maize model to ensure the accuracy of the model simulations for both grain and biomass n uptake the ecotype coefficients values considered in the model were dsgft 180 growing degree days from silking to effective grain filling period rue 2 8 radiation use efficiency and light extinction coefficient kcan in the maize ecotype file was set to 0 5 as this value improved ceres maize simulations in northwestern spain lópez cedrón et al 2008 and is similar to that measured under similar growing conditions cavero et al 2000 the method of penman monteith fao 56 allen et al 1998 was selected in ceres maize to compute daily potential evapotranspiration once the model was calibrated it was validated using the field data from the rest of the three experiments no considered in the calibration process 114 plots in total the model was evaluated for grain yield gy total biomass tb grain number per ear gne grain weight gw grain n uptake total biomass n uptake grains stems leaves and residual nitrate in the soil after maize harvest to assess the performance of the model the following parameters were considered the bias defined as the difference between simulated and observed values 1 b i a s 1 n i 0 n y i x i

applied to determine the best management practices for maize crop in del reguero watershed drw 41 54 n and 3 34 w by assessing the effect of different irrigation and nitrogen management scenarios del reguero stream is an affluent of the alcanadre river located in the left bank of the middle ebro river basin in spain drw is a sprinkler irrigated area of 1865 ha in which maize is the predominant summer crop according to skhiri and dechmi 2012 the irrigation coefficient of uniformity cu of this area ranged between 60 and 94 with an average value of 79 according to clemmens and dedrick 1994 this cu average value was not considered acceptable three different type of soils can be found in drw 1 terrace soils which represent 38 of the total area characterized by shallow depth 0 6 m on average presence of calcareous horizon and high content of stones 2 shallow alluvial soils mostly stone free and with soil depth varying from 0 6 m to 0 9 m and 3 deep alluvial soils similar to the precedent but with soil depths ranging from 0 9 to 1 2 m a more detailed characterization of the study area and the soils can be found in skhiri and dechmi 2012 2 3 1 irrigation management scenarios irrigation simulations were schedule using two approaches for the three different soils in the first approach a set of irrigation schedules based on actual maize irrigation calendar dates and irrigation doses applied by farmers during the 2008 and 2009 irrigation seasons in the second approach an adjusted irrigation scheduled by using the automatic irrigation option included in the dssat model in which the crop is irrigated when it is needed to avoid water stress when 70 of the available water in the root zone was depleted supplemental irrigation was triggered to refill the soil reservoir for both scenarios the model was run considering the common values in the study area of sowing date april 15th and plant density 85 000 plants ha 1 the 2008 and 2009 daily meteorological records were obtained from a meteorological station located close to the watershed 41 56 n and 00 08 w farmer surveys were carried out in 2008 16 farmer surveys and 2009 17 surveys to assess the dates of the first and the last irrigation event number of irrigations number of days between two irrigations and volume of water applied for each type of soil as the difference in irrigation water use between soil type was not significant in the study area skhiri and dechmi 2012 and all the irrigation schedules were quite similar for the farmers interviewed only one representative farmer s irrigation management practice date and dose of each irrigation event was considered to simulate the current farmer practices in each year rather than using average values from the surveys this representative irrigation schedule was provided by the alconadre irrigation district collective irrigation network other farmers management practices necessary as inputs to run the model were obtained from the same farmers surveys conducted during the considered years 2008 and 2009 the main information collected from the farmers surveys was relative to the type and the amounts of organic and inorganic fertilizers applied the dates of application and the crop yields obtained in this case average values were considered for each study case the analyzed variables were grain yield kg ha 1 nitrogen uptake by the plant kg n ha 1 nitrate leached below the root zone kg n ha 1 and the amount of residual nitrate in the soil kg n ha 1 2 3 2 nitrogen fertilization management scenarios two fertilization approaches were compared actual vs optimized during 10 years from 2003 to 2014 with an adjusted irrigation amounts to crop requirements first an optimal recommended rate of 250 kg n ha 1 isla et al 2008 was splitted as 50 kg n ha 1 at pre planting april 100 kg ha 1 in the first sidedress 15th june and 100 kg n ha 1 in the second sidedress 10th july second an actual rate of 390 kg n ha 1 averaged rate according to farmers surveys performed in drw corresponding to 2008 to 2012 crop seasons was splitted in three applications of 70 250 and 70 kg n ha 1 at preplanting april first sidedress beginning of june and second sidedress beginning of july respectively for both approaches three different scenarios of initial smn were considered to take into account different potential conditions at pre planting soil mineral n 1 low level of mineral n varied from 50 to 70 kg n ha 1 for shallow soil to deep soils 2 medium level of mineral n varied from 100 to 140 kg n ha 1 for shallow soil to deep soils and 3 high level of mineral n varied from 150 to 210 kg n ha 1 for shallow soil to deep soils in total 180 simulations were performed considering 3 n mineral levels in the soil before maize seeding 3 soil types 2 fertilization management approaches and 10 years for model input data of each considered year an adjusted irrigation schedule was determined by adjusting irrigation water to the crop net irrigation requirement nir the nir was increased by 10 in order to take into account different potential losses the daily nir for maize was calculated as follow 5 nir mm kc et0 pe 1 1 where et0 is the reference evapotranspiration kc is the crop coefficient and pe is the effective precipitation daily values of pe were considered equal to 75 of precipitation the et0 was calculated using the fao penman monteith method described by allen et al 1998 and kc values were obtained from martínez cob et al 1998 once the daily nir was calculated for each year the daily nir values were added until the day on which the sum amounted to an accepted value as an irrigation dose in general the irrigation frequency considered was 2 to 3 times per week and was increased during the maize critical stages to the water stress two indices were used to evaluate management practices in the drw for irrigation and nitrogen scenarios 1 irrigation water use efficiency i wue defined as the ratio between maize grain yield and irrigation water applied during the crop season per hectare kg mm 1 2 nitrogen use efficiency nue expressed as the ratio between maize grain yield and the fertilizer n amount applied per hectare kg kg 1 n 3 results and discussion 3 1 dssat model calibration maize cultivar pioneer pr34n43 was previously calibrated by salmerón et al 2014 in the same region and the obtained cultivar coefficients were 243 0 6 837 959 6 77 and 51 2 for p1 p2 p5 g2 g3 and phint respectively applying these genetic coefficients to our experimental fields gave a rmse of 1400 kg ha 1 which is considered high and therefore not acceptable results for an accurate model scenarios application thus an adjustment of those cultivar coefficients was done in order to obtain more accurate results the new calibrated genetic coefficients resulted are 243 0 2 800 800 8 75 and 59 9 for p1 p2 p5 g2 g3 and phint respectively the model overestimated the grain yield in both experiment considered exp 1 and 2 with positive bias and the average of observed and simulated grain yield were 13001 and 13331 kg ha 1 respectively the model performance was considered good with a rmse of 553 and 663 kg ha 1 in exp 1 and 2 respectively these values are in the range of other published works such as salmerón et al 2014 who obtained a value of 530 kg ha 1 moreover same trend was observed comparing the nrmse averaging the two experiments 6 to that obtained by liu et al 2012 nrmse 4 3 these results confirmed that the ceres maize cultivar was successfully calibrated in the study area with a reliable result 3 2 dssat model validation 3 2 1 yield and yield components validation results indicate an excellent agreement between simulated and observed maize grain yield of the three experiments with an average of rmse and nrmse of 703 kg ha 1 and 7 respectively and with high d statistic d 0 9 table 3 in general the model tended to overpredict grain yield with a positive bias analyzing each experiment separately results show also an excellent performance of ceres maize to simulate grain yield with a rmse nrmse of 811 9 764 6 535 5 kg ha 1 in exp 1 2 and 3 respectively similar trend was observed for total biomass by averaging all the experiments with rmse nrmse of 2018 kg ha 1 10 also the model tended to overpredict the total biomass for both yield variables the coefficients of determination r2 pooling data of all experiments were considered good higher than 0 9 for grain yield and 0 81 for total biomass the slope of the regression between simulated and observed values was significantly p 0 05 different from one in all cases fig 1 a and b the best fit between observed and simulated values for both grain yield and total biomass was obtained in exp 3 compared with the other locations table 3 subsequently ceres maize model could be reliably used for predicting maize grain yield and total biomass supported by the obtained statistics in our study compared with other published studies for instance yakoub et al 2017 found higher rmse than obtained in our results for both grain yield and total biomass with a 1313 kg ha 1 and 3324 kg ha 1 respectively in addition a lower d statistic value 0 8 and a higher nrmse 9 5 were observed for grain yield and a lower d statistic of 0 7 and nrmse of 11 4 for biomass furthermore similar performance of ceres maize model was obtained for grain yield by liu et al 2012 in northeast china with nrmse value of 5 results obtained by liu et al 2011 showed also less accuracy for grain yield prediction with a higher rmse 1945 kg ha 1 and nrmse 19 2 regarding the grain number per ear gne results the corresponding bias values presented in table 3 indicated that the ceres maize underestimated this yield component better results were obtained in exp 2 and exp 3 with a rmse of 38 and 68 respectively and the nrmse were lower than 12 in both experiments however in exp 1 a higher rmse was observed 168 on average the observed gne in exp 1 was lower than the remaining experiments exp 2 and exp 3 indicating some crop limiting conditions the same behavior was observed for the simulated gne in each experiment this difference could be compensated by the grain weight gw for predicting final grain yield results indicate also that the model overestimated gw in exp 1 and exp 3 but underestimated such variable in exp 2 moreover the rmse for gw was reasonably acceptable ranging between 0 035 and 0 045 g a good agreement was observed for the gne with r2 greater than 0 8 however a small r2 0 2 in the case of gw fig 1 c and d 3 2 2 nitrogen uptake results indicate a good agreement between simulated and observed total n grain uptake fig 1 e the ceres maize model simulated reasonably well the total n uptake with an average of rmse and nrmse across all the experiments of 37 kg ha 1 and 17 respectively table 3 analyzing the three experiments separately the model overestimated the total n uptake in exp 1 and exp 2 while underestimating it in exp 3 in addition a good d statistic was obtained greater than 0 8 in each field experiment a significant relationship was observed between simulated and observed total n uptake with a r2 of 0 57 fig 1 e the most accurate prediction of plant n uptake was obtained in exp 3 with a rmse of 30 kg n ha 1 and a d statistic of 0 92 which is very similar to the study of salmerón et al 2014 who found a rmse of 25 kg n ha 1 however our results are better than those obtained by yakoub et al 2017 who found a rmse and d statistic of 41 kg n ha 1 and 0 88 respectively an accurate prediction of plant n content depends on the correct calculation of total biomass and n concentration in plant tissues this result can be associated with the overestimation of the total biomass already described previously yakoub et al 2017 suspected that the ceres maize simulated n concentration in the grain is higher than grain n concentration of modern hybrids moreover many reports indicate that due to the efforts to increase grain yield by genetic improvement grain n content of recent maize hybrids have decreased compared to older materials duvick 2005 other studies bowen et al 1993 also showed that ceres maize model overestimated the plant n uptake due to an overestimation in the release of mineral n from soil organic matter in some studies such as asadi and clemente 2003 and carberry et al 1989 also found a tendency of the ceres maize to overestimate the n uptake in maize 3 2 3 soil residual nitrate statistics of residual nitrate n analyzed by 0 30 m depth intervals upon to 1 20 m are presented in table 4 a reasonable performance of residual nitrate was observed in the location of exp 3 with a rmse varying between 14 and 38 kg n ha 1 moreover a high d static was obtained greater than 0 7 and in this experiment the model overestimated the residual nitrate n in all layers except in the first layer 0 3 m meanwhile in exp 1 and exp 2 the model underestimated the residual nitrate n in soil except in the deeper layers 0 6 1 2 m of exp 2 the rmse ranged from 50 to 69 kg n ha 1 in exp 1 and from 41 to 53 kg n ha 1 in exp 2 this suggests inadequate estimation of n root absorption by the model in the surface layer up to 0 3 m or difficulties to estimate n mineralization rates 3 2 4 improving total n uptake estimation following liu et al 2012 suggestion to improve the plant n estimation the new results derived from the calibrated ctcnp2 value ctcnp2 0 25 indicated that the rmse of grain n uptake was improved by 34 while total plant n uptake by 10 considering all the plots the rmse decreased from 28 to 20 kg n ha 1 and from 36 to 32 kg n ha 1 for grain and total biomass n uptake respectively nevertheless there is no significant difference on rmse of grain yield an increase of the rmse by 153 kg ha 1 also figs 1e and f shows the same relationship between simulated and observed total n uptake regarding residual n the rmse pooling all the plots from 0 to 1 2 m is reasonably acceptable with 47 kg n ha 1 using the new calibrated ctcnp2 value meanwhile a rmse of 43 kg n ha 1 was obtained using the standard value defined in the species file ctcnp2 0 16 therefore there is a slight differences between value of ctcnp2 regarding the residual n in soil after harvest that vary with depth a better adjustment of ctcnp2 parameter to specific environmental conditions is important to improve maize n uptake estimation however the n plant uptake improvement are not clearly reflected on the residual nitrogen in the soil due to the complexity of the nitrogen balance in the soil and other parameters that may be mainly due to the model s lack of sensitivity to small changes in the soil nitrogen balance and the simulation errors generated in each plot 3 3 dssat model application 3 3 1 irrigation management scenarios on average and according to surveys farmers applied 818 and 862 mm of water irrigation for maize crop during 2008 and 2009 seasons respectively however the application of the model using automatic irrigation provided a total of 518 and 646 mm for the same seasons respectively the higher water requirements estimated by the model during the 2009 were associated to a lower precipitation p 208 mm in comparison with 2008 irrigation season p 292 mm these results indicate the possibility to reduce a significant amount of irrigation water 313 and 216 mm in 2008 and 2009 respectively when the irrigation is adjusted to the real evapotranspiration needs although there is an online irrigation service from the regional government that allows farmers to calculate the weekly water irrigation needs according to the fao methodology it is barely used by maize growers and the tendency is to over irrigate the maize crop on the other hand and for each year the dssat model simulated similar irrigation doses for the three different soil types fig 2 a this is because the model applies the needed water to re fill the soil profile until field capacity increasing the frequency of irrigation events for soils having less water capacity retention as the terrace soils so the total dose is not affected thus the model simulated a total of 23 irrigations to the terrace soils and 20 irrigation events for alluvial soils results indicated no significant differences in simulated maize grain yields between real irrigation and dssat automatic irrigation doses across the different years and soil types fig 2b indicating that the model estimates similar yields using less amounts of irrigation water therefore adjusting irrigation taking into account the soil water holding capacity and the actual evapotranspiration values allows increasing the water use efficiency compared to the real management of maize growers in the watershed table 5 averaging across soil types i wue corresponding to real situation was 19 kg mm 1 and 14 kg mm 1 for 2008 and 2009 respectively while i wue of the adjusted irrigation scenario was 30 kg mm 1 and 19 kg mm 1 for 2008 and 2009 respectively in addition deep percolation simulated using actual irrigation was on average 165 mm and 134 mm for 2008 and 2009 respectively while with the automatic irrigation option the volume of water drained below the root zone was very small or zero depending on soil types and years table 5 the amount of total n uptake by maize presented similar value of 274 kg n ha 1 for both irrigation managements in 2009 and a very small difference in 2008 291 kg n ha 1 for actual situation vs 294 kg n ha 1 for adjusted irrigation scenario however nitrate leaching was high in the scenario of real irrigation management ranging from 90 to190 kg no3 ha 1 depending on soil type and year fig 3 a the model showed lower n leaching in the deep alluvial soils compared to the shallower soils in the case of actual irrigation practices the average nitrate loss below the root zone including all soils considered in the case of actual irrigation management was 34 kg ha 1 no3 n this amount is similar to that measured in the same region where annual amounts of nitrogen losses by drainage ranged between 25 to 50 kg no3 n ha 1 under well managed sprinkler irrigated systems tedeschi et al 2001 cavero et al 2003 however it is important to mention that the presented results includes only n losses during the crop season period april to october while the cited studies included n annual losses the combined lower n leaching and similar crop n uptake in the automatic irrigation scenario has leaded to higher soil residual nitrate fig 3b in all cases for automatic irrigation scenario values were similar for both year and soil type and higher for alluvial soils 206 kg no3 ha 1 in average than terrace soils 154 kg no3 ha 1 in average in the case of real irrigation management and all soil types the residual nitrate was 33 kg no3 ha 1 in average the automatic irrigation management results show very small n leaching losses in deep soils while the real farmer s irrigation management induces important subsurface n leaching losses below the root zone during maize growing season 3 3 2 nitrogen fertilizer scenarios according to the model the differences in grain yield between real traditional fertilization and recommended fertilization adjusted were not significant fig 4 a the average of simulated crop yield for the real fertilization management was 14041 kg ha 1 while with the adjusted fertilization scenario the yield was 14028 kg ha 1 according to the simulations performed during the 2004 2013 period under the two n fertilization scenarios fig 4b plant n uptake tended to increase as the amount initial soil mineral nitrogen increased no increase was observed in the scenario of real farmer s dose probably due to an excess of n availability in all situations n uptake is simulated in ceres maize by contrasting potential soil n supply with crop n demand to estimate crop n demand the model compares the concentration of n in plant tissues with a target concentration called critical n nc the model assumes that if the concentration of n in tissues is greater than or equal to nc growth proceeds without any n limitation however if the concentration of n falls below nc then the crop experiences n deficit and growth is reduced accordingly at the same time the n uptake demand is limited by a maximum n concentration subsequently the n uptake varies between critical n and maximum n according to the model and in our study soil n supply was greater than the critical n across all soil types and scenarios and therefore no significant difference in grain yield were found nevertheless the amounts of n uptake is significantly affected by the availability of soil mineral n the leached nitrate during the growing season increased proportionally to the initial amounts of soil mineral nitrogen low medium and high and decreases with soil depth fig 5 a adjusting the n rate the total mass of n leached was 58 15 and 3 kg no3 ha 1 for the terrace shallow alluvial and deep alluvial soils respectively this results point out the importance of adequate n management in shallow soils to decrease the negative environmental effects of n leaching as 38 of soils in the drw are terrace soils 0 6 m depth most of the n losses occur mainly in those soils averaging across soil types and initial soil mineral nitrogen smn the simulated residual soil mineral n range from 174 kg no3 ha 1 in the traditional n management scenario rate of 390 kg n ha 1 to 52 kg no3 ha 1 adjusted rate of 250 kg n ha 1 fig 5b the alluvial soils have similar values of residual smn but higher than terrace soils the figs 6 a and b shows the cumulative leached and residual nitrate n in soil over10 year s seasonal maize crop both of these cumulative variables are based on the sum of the final values after each maize harvest we assumed that the cumulative variables represent the minimum amounts of leached nitrate n and residual nitrate n because the nitrate n released from mineralization processes was not considered during the winter intercrop periods long term analysis of the cumulative leached n after 10 years simulations shows that the leached n is always higher in the real farmer s fertilization than in the adjusted fertilization negligible amount of leached n for the deep alluvial soil was observed and therefore was not included in the figure 6 a on the other hand a remarkable discrepancy between the two managements was observed for cumulative residual n with more than 1500 kg n ha 1 after 10 years fig 6b similar behavior was observed for the different soil types but it was more pronounced in alluvial soils the traditional behavior of fertilization followed by farmers in the study area shows a serious problem of management practices that leads to environmental contamination problems and a negative economic effect due the unnecessary expenses in n fertilizer besides nitrogen efficiency was significantly higher 56 kg grain kg 1 n applied in the scenario of adjusted n fertilization compared to the traditional scenario 36 kg grain kg 1 n applied performed by farmers in the study area testing smn levels before seeding and during early stages of maize growth can help to obtain more accurate n fertilizer recommendations cela et al 2013 taking into account the already available smn in the soil derived from mineralization or from preceding crops soils with high smn after harvest can supply part of the nitrogen needed by maize in the following crop year the proposed adjusted rate of 250 kg n ha 1 used in this study is a good starting point derived from regional studies but can be refined or site specific adjusted using soil or plant analysis during the maize growing season 4 conclusions in this work we evaluated first the performance of the dssat ceres maize model to predict grain yield total biomass grain number per ear kernel weight crop n uptake under a broad range of soil mineral nitrogen availability conditions a good performance of the model was demonstrated in this study by a rmse less than 703 kg ha 1 and 37 kg n ha 1 for grain yield and total n uptake among all the experiments a good agreement was obtained for total biomass yield components gne and grain weight and reasonably accuracy for residual n in soil the application of calibrated and validated model is a useful tool to assess management practices for reducing n leaching in intensive irrigated areas the simulation of different scenarios of water management indicate that irrigation management could be significantly improved adjusting the irrigation water applied according the actual evapotranspiration needs instead a fixed irrigation calendar normally used by most maize growers in the area this adjustment would reduce on average for different types of soil the total amount of seasonal irrigation water by 31 and the nitrate leaching by 97 without a significant reduction of grain yield similarly the simulation of different n management scenarios showed the feasibility to reduce significantly the n fertilizer dose currently applied to maize by farmers maintaining grain yield this reduction in the n fertilizer decrease the n leached between 33 and 53 depending on soil types even though the dssat have showed some uncertainties associated with inputs and model parameters the

11180,maintain high agriculture production levels while reducing environmental impacts is of primordial importance in intensive irrigated areas adequate management of water and nitrogen are critical for a sustainable agriculture the objectives of this work were to i calibrate and validate dssat model for maize under different nitrogen availability conditions and ii assess the effect of best management practices on irrigation water needs and nitrogen losses by leaching using different scenarios in an intensive irrigated area for model calibration and validation three field experiments were conducted with a total of 134 plots then the model application was performed in three soil types in the del reguero watershed spain considering i real irrigation applied by farmers and dssat automatic irrigation and ii a recommended dose of n fertilizer 250 kg n ha 1 compared to a traditional dose of 390 kg n ha 1 among all plots the model simulated reasonably well grain yield with a root mean square error rmse lower than 708 kg ha 1 and high willmott agreement index d statistic 0 9 very similar trends were observed for total biomass and total n uptake with a rmse of 2018 kg ha 1 and 36 6 kg n ha 1 the prediction of residual nitrate in soil was acceptable with a rmse of 43 kg n ha 1 modeling results showed that adjusted irrigation would reduce on average for different soil types the total amount of seasonal irrigation water by 31 and the nitrate leaching by 97 without a significant reduction in grain yield regarding to n fertilizer scenarios results showed that farmers can

model calibration irrigation management fertilizer managements nutrients losses 1 introduction nutrient pollution is currently the major environmental problem of surface water bodies vitousek et al 2009 reducing nutrient losses from agricultural soils to surface and groundwater resources is one of the greatest challenges facing agricultural systems in intensive irrigated areas this is especially relevant in maize fields where nitrogen n is the most limiting nutrient nivong et al 2007 and farmers tended to overfertilize with n to ensure maximum yields avoiding yield reductions associated to n deficiency gaudin et al 2015 liu et al 2012 moreover maize has long been recognized as a major contributor of irrigated areas diffuse pollution in the world klocke et al 1999 pratt et al 1984 and similarly in several irrigated areas in spain barros et al 2011 cavero et al 2012 especially in the ebro river basin the n pollution has been found to be a concern and in particular in irrigation return flows isidoro et al 2006 nitrogen is applied at rates of over 300 kg n ha 1 in fields that are only fertilized with mineral n and at more than 400 kg n ha 1 in those fertilized with manure sisquella et al 2004 furthermore cavero et al 2003 found that the nitrate loads exported per unit area in the irrigation return flows of two sprinkler irrigation districts predominantly grown to maize vary depending on irrigation and n fertilization management between 18 and 49 kg no3 n ha 1 year 1 within this area the ground waters are frequently polluted with nitrate ferrer et al 2003 with concentrations often exceeding 50 mg no 3 l 1 the maximum level permitted by the european union 1991 for drinking water quality several experimental studies have been conducted at district level in order to analyze and quantify n contamination induced by irrigation and fertilization management in irrigation return flows barros et al 2011 2012 isidoro et al 2006 however most of these studies were performed for short periods of time and did not allow identifying the effects of long term agronomic changes and climate variability on irrigation and n losses trends furthermore there is a need for further studies to assess agronomic practices that would enable these areas to increase the efficiency of their n fertilization while at the same time reducing nitrate leaching from maize plots to water bodies the key strategy to reduce off site nutrient pollution is to optimize irrigation and fertilization practices cavero et al 2012 klocke et al 1999 salmerón et al 2014 crop models have been developed and used worldwide as operational and strategic research and decision support tools in crop production and resources management mourice et al 2014 however continuous calibration and validation of a crop model is extremely important when it is applied for new locations with new crop varieties lópez cedrón et al 2008 concerning maize modelling ceres maize included into dssat model

climate change araya et al 2015 farhangfar et al 2015 ngwira et al 2014 and fertilizer n management li et al 2015 proved that dssat was a useful and reliable tool for simulating long term trends of maize grain yield soil organic c and soil organic n based over 14 years from temperate semi arid to semi humid weather conditions in northwestern china salmerón et al 2014 used dssat to simulate the impact of including winter cover crops in maize monoculture on yields and n leaching for a range of soil types and irrigation managements during a 14 years rotation crop in la violada watershed spain the model simulated successfully crop n uptake but was less accurate simulating the evolution of inorganic soil n thorp et al 2007 simulated the long term effects of different n application rates on maize production and sub surface nitrate n concentration in drainage water in iowa usa and concluded that reducing long term n rates from 180 to 130 kg n ha 1 corresponded to an 18 reduction in n mass lost to water resources liu et al 2011 simulated the crop yield and nitrogen dynamics under 50 continuous years maize production experiment in canada soler et al 2011 evaluated the performances of the dssat csm and century based soil modules in predicting crop yield and soil organic carbon dynamics for different crop rotations and fertilizer levels using the observed data set from an experiment conducted in a semi arid region of west africa during 1993 to 2004 period however studies dealing with long term analysis of irrigation and nitrogen performance at the irrigation district level and its evolution are lacking moreover applying the dssat model is a useful for supplementing field experiments allowing to identify the best management strategies in a particular area of study therefore the main objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the dssat performance to predict maize yield n uptake grain and plant and residual soil mineral n under different soil mineral n availability conditions and 2 determine the best management practices of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization under different management scenarios in intensive semi arid irrigated mediterranean conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental data for model calibration and validation data were collected from three field experiments located in the ebro valley northeast spain in the locations of montañana 41 44 n 0 49 w 225 m a s l and almudévar 42 02 n 0 34 w 400 m a s l these experiments were performed during 2010 in montañana exp 1 2011 and 2012 in almudévar exp 2 and exp 3 respectively and were part of a study to evaluate the comparison of different strategies in order to manage the nitrogen fertilizer in irrigated areas isla et al 2012 a total of 38 plots from exp 1 47 from exp 2 and 49 from exp 3 were used in this study for ceres maize calibration and validation processes in each experiment the elementary plot size was 4 5 m by 12 5 m with a total of 6 plants rows per plot the study area is characterized by mediterranean semiarid climate with annual maximum and minimum daily air temperatures of 19 6 and 5 7 c in montañana and 21 and 8 1 c in almudévar respectively the yearly average precipitation 1981 2010 is 347 mm and 443 mm and the yearly average evapotranspiration et0 is 1230 mm and 1331 mm in montañana and almudévar respectively the main soil characteristics for both locations are presented in table 1 a maize crop zea mays l cv pioneer pr34n43 was sown with row spacing of 0 75 m and an average final plant density of 74 000 plant ha 1 in fields managed using conventional equipment maize crop was irrigated using solid set sprinkler irrigation system triangular layout of 18 m x 18 m using an application rate of 5 mm h 1 the weekly irrigation requirements were calculated from the daily values of reference evapotranspiration et0 calculated using the fao penman monteith equation and the martinez cob 2008 crop coefficients kc following the fao methodology allen et al 1998 the irrigation efficiency was set to 85 main characteristics of crop management and key dates for exp 1 2 and 3 are presented in table 2 in each experiment the previous year of the study three clearly different doses of n fertilizer were applied to a maize crop in different areas of the field to create different initial soil mineral nitrogen smn content in addition and during the crop season the plots included in the study received different amounts of n fertilizer ranging from 0 control to 400 kg n ha 1 overfertilized providing a wide variation of crop n availability among the different plots table 2 therefore averaging over experiments the minimum and maximum mineral nitrogen available estimated as the initial smn plus the n fertilizer ranged from 93 to 744 kg ha 1 all the ears in 2 rows of 8 m length per plot 12 m2 were hand harvested to determine yield number of plants number of grains per square meter and unit kernel mass km at each experimental plot the plants contained in an area of 3 m2 were harvested to estimate the total plant biomass a subsample of grain and plants were dried at 65 c weighed and ground prior to analyses of total n by dry combustion method truspec cn leco st joseph mi usa grain and plant total n uptake was calculated as the product of grain or plant biomass and n content at each experimental plot the soil was sampled every year after maize harvest three soil samples from each experimental plot were taken using a 5 cm diameter hand auger and the three samples were combined for each 0 3 m until 1 2 m depth the soil was fresh sieved to pass a 2 mm sieve and 10 g were extracted with 30 ml of kcl 2 n solution for determination of no3 n and nh4 n concentrations by colorimetry with a continuous flow analyzer aa3 bran luebbe norderstedt germany another soil subsample was dried at 105 c to constant weight for gravimetric water content determination gravimetric water content was converted to volumetric water content using a bulk density of 1 5 g cm 3 2 2 model calibration and validation the version dssat 4 5 was used in this study hoogenboom et al 2010 ceres maize cultivar calibration

physiological maturity g3 potential kernel growth rate g2 potential kernel number per plant and phint phyllochron interval the model calibration was performed using crop data obtained under non limiting growth conditions using 20 overfertilized plots from exp 2 9 plots and exp 3 11 plots initially the cultivar coefficients of the same maize cultivar previously calibrated by salmerón et al 2014 under similar environmental conditions were tested and considered as a starting point for our calibration process then an iterative approach was used to obtain acceptable genetic coefficients through trial and error adjustments until an adequate match between measured and simulated productivity crop data was found the soil fertility factor slpf was also manually adjusted as it is an input parameter that affects the overall growth rate of simulated total biomass by modifying daily canopy photosynthesis and is attributed to soil fertility differences and soil based pests a calibrated value of 0 69 was applied in exp 1 based on the best fit between potential simulated yield under adjusted condition and observed values in addition the n concentration coefficient ctcnp2 is an input parameter defined in the species file related the change of plant n concentration as a function of growth stage as recommended by liu et al 2012 the ctcnp2 was also calibrated in the ceres maize model to ensure the accuracy of the model simulations for both grain and biomass n uptake the ecotype coefficients values considered in the model were dsgft 180 growing degree days from silking to effective grain filling period rue 2 8 radiation use efficiency and light extinction coefficient kcan in the maize ecotype file was set to 0 5 as this value improved ceres maize simulations in northwestern spain lópez cedrón et al 2008 and is similar to that measured under similar growing conditions cavero et al 2000 the method of penman monteith fao 56 allen et al 1998 was selected in ceres maize to compute daily potential evapotranspiration once the model was calibrated it was validated using the field data from the rest of the three experiments no considered in the calibration process 114 plots in total the model was evaluated for grain yield gy total biomass tb grain number per ear gne grain weight gw grain n uptake total biomass n uptake grains stems leaves and residual nitrate in the soil

applied to determine the best management practices for maize crop in del reguero watershed drw 41 54 n and 3 34 w by assessing the effect of different irrigation and nitrogen management scenarios del reguero stream is an affluent of the alcanadre river located in the left bank of the middle ebro river basin in spain drw is a sprinkler irrigated area of 1865 ha in which maize is the predominant summer crop according to skhiri and dechmi 2012 the irrigation coefficient of uniformity cu of this area ranged between 60 and 94 with an average value of 79 according to clemmens and dedrick 1994 this cu average value was not considered acceptable three different type of soils can be found in drw 1 terrace soils which represent 38 of the total area characterized by shallow depth 0 6 m on average presence of calcareous horizon and high content of stones 2 shallow alluvial soils mostly stone free and with soil depth varying from 0 6 m to 0 9 m and 3 deep alluvial soils similar to the precedent but with soil depths ranging from 0 9 to 1 2 m a more detailed characterization of the study area and the soils can be found in skhiri and dechmi 2012 2 3 1 irrigation management scenarios irrigation simulations were schedule using two approaches for the three different soils in the first approach a set of irrigation schedules based on actual maize irrigation calendar dates and irrigation doses applied by farmers during the 2008 and 2009 irrigation seasons in the second approach an adjusted irrigation scheduled by using the automatic irrigation option included in the dssat model in which the crop is irrigated when it is needed to avoid water stress when 70 of the available water in the root zone was depleted supplemental irrigation was triggered to refill the soil reservoir for both scenarios the model was run considering the common values in the study area of sowing date april 15th and plant density 85 000 plants ha 1 the 2008 and 2009 daily meteorological records were obtained from a meteorological station located close to the watershed 41 56 n and 00 08 w farmer surveys were carried out in 2008 16 farmer surveys and 2009 17 surveys to assess the dates of the first and the last irrigation event number of irrigations number of days between two irrigations and volume of water applied for each type of soil as the difference in irrigation water use between soil type was not significant in the study area skhiri and dechmi 2012 and all the irrigation schedules were quite similar for the farmers interviewed only one representative farmer s irrigation management practice date and dose of each irrigation event was considered to simulate the current farmer practices in each year rather than using average values from the surveys this representative irrigation schedule was provided by the alconadre irrigation district collective irrigation network other farmers management practices necessary as inputs to run the model were obtained from the same farmers surveys conducted during the considered years 2008 and 2009 the main information collected from the farmers surveys was relative to the type and the amounts of organic and inorganic fertilizers applied the dates of application and the crop yields obtained in this case average values were considered for each study case the analyzed variables were grain yield kg ha 1 nitrogen uptake by the plant kg n ha 1 nitrate leached below the root zone kg n ha 1 and the amount of residual nitrate in the soil kg n ha 1 2 3 2 nitrogen fertilization management scenarios two fertilization approaches were compared actual vs optimized during 10 years from 2003 to 2014 with an adjusted irrigation amounts to crop requirements first an optimal recommended rate of 250 kg n ha 1 isla et al 2008 was splitted as 50 kg n ha 1 at pre planting april 100 kg ha 1 in the first sidedress 15th june and 100 kg n ha 1 in the second sidedress 10th july second an actual rate of 390 kg n ha 1 averaged rate according to farmers surveys performed in drw corresponding to 2008 to 2012 crop seasons was splitted in three applications of 70 250 and 70 kg n ha 1 at preplanting april first sidedress beginning of june and second sidedress beginning of july respectively for both approaches three different scenarios of initial smn were considered to take into account different potential conditions at pre planting soil mineral n 1 low level of mineral n varied from 50 to 70 kg n ha 1 for shallow soil to deep soils 2 medium level of mineral n varied from 100 to 140 kg n ha 1 for shallow soil to deep soils and 3 high level of mineral n varied from 150 to 210 kg n ha 1 for shallow soil to deep soils in total 180 simulations were performed considering 3 n mineral levels in the soil before maize seeding 3 soil types 2 fertilization management approaches and 10 years for model input data of each considered year an adjusted irrigation schedule was determined by adjusting irrigation water to the crop net irrigation requirement nir the nir was increased by 10 in order to take into account different potential losses the daily nir for maize was calculated as follow 5 nir mm kc et0 pe 1 1 where et0 is the reference evapotranspiration kc is the crop coefficient and pe is the effective precipitation daily values of pe were considered equal to 75 of precipitation the et0 was calculated using the fao penman monteith method described by allen et al 1998 and kc values were obtained from martínez cob et al 1998 once the daily nir was calculated for each year the daily nir values were added until the day on which the sum amounted to an accepted value as an irrigation dose in general the irrigation frequency considered was 2 to 3 times per week and was increased during the maize critical stages to the water stress two indices were used to evaluate management practices in the drw for irrigation and nitrogen scenarios 1 irrigation water use efficiency i wue defined as

fertilizer n amount applied per hectare kg kg 1 n 3 results and discussion 3 1 dssat model calibration maize cultivar pioneer pr34n43 was previously calibrated by salmerón et al 2014 in the same region and the obtained cultivar coefficients were 243 0 6 837 959 6 77 and 51 2 for p1 p2 p5 g2 g3 and phint respectively applying these genetic coefficients to our experimental fields gave a rmse of 1400 kg ha 1 which is considered high and therefore not acceptable results for an accurate model scenarios application thus an adjustment of those cultivar coefficients was done in order to obtain more accurate results the new calibrated genetic coefficients resulted are 243 0 2 800 800 8 75 and 59 9 for p1 p2 p5 g2 g3 and phint respectively the model overestimated the grain yield in both experiment considered exp 1 and 2 with positive bias and the average of observed and simulated grain yield were 13001 and 13331 kg ha 1 respectively the model performance was considered good with a rmse of 553 and 663 kg ha 1 in exp 1 and 2 respectively these values are in the range of other published works such as salmerón et al 2014 who obtained a value of 530 kg ha 1 moreover same trend was observed comparing the nrmse averaging the two experiments 6 to that obtained by liu et al 2012 nrmse 4 3 these results confirmed that the ceres maize cultivar was successfully calibrated in the study area with a reliable result 3 2 dssat model validation 3 2 1 yield and yield components validation results indicate an excellent agreement between simulated and observed maize grain yield of the three experiments with an average of rmse and nrmse of 703 kg ha 1 and 7 respectively and with high d statistic d 0 9 table 3 in general the model tended to overpredict grain yield with a positive bias analyzing each experiment separately results show also an excellent performance of ceres maize to simulate grain yield with a rmse nrmse of 811 9 764 6 535 5 kg ha 1 in exp 1 2 and 3 respectively similar trend was observed for total biomass by averaging all the experiments with rmse nrmse of 2018 kg ha 1 10 also the model tended to overpredict the total biomass for both yield variables the coefficients of determination r2 pooling data of all experiments were considered good higher than 0 9 for grain yield and 0 81 for total biomass the slope of the regression between simulated and observed values was significantly p 0 05 different from one in all cases fig 1 a and b the best fit between observed and simulated values for both grain yield and total biomass was obtained in exp 3 compared with the other locations table 3 subsequently ceres maize model could be reliably used for predicting maize grain yield and total biomass supported by the obtained statistics in our study compared with other published studies for instance yakoub et al 2017 found higher rmse than obtained in our results for both grain yield and total biomass with a 1313 kg ha 1 and 3324 kg ha 1 respectively in addition a lower d statistic value 0 8 and a higher nrmse 9 5 were observed for grain yield and a lower d statistic of 0 7 and nrmse of 11 4 for biomass furthermore similar performance of ceres maize model was obtained for grain yield by liu et al 2012 in northeast china with nrmse value of 5 results obtained by liu et al 2011 showed also less accuracy for grain yield prediction with a higher rmse 1945 kg ha 1 and nrmse 19 2 regarding the grain number per ear gne results the corresponding bias values presented in table 3 indicated that the ceres maize underestimated this yield component better results were obtained in exp 2 and exp 3 with a rmse of 38 and 68 respectively and the nrmse were lower than 12 in both experiments however in exp 1 a higher rmse was observed 168 on average the observed gne in exp 1 was lower than the remaining experiments exp 2 and exp 3 indicating some crop limiting conditions the same behavior was observed for the simulated gne in each experiment this difference could be compensated by the grain weight gw for predicting final grain yield results indicate also that the model overestimated gw in exp 1 and exp 3 but underestimated such variable in exp 2 moreover the rmse for gw was reasonably acceptable ranging between 0 035 and 0 045 g a good agreement was observed for the gne with r2 greater than 0 8 however a small r2 0 2 in the case of gw fig 1 c and d 3 2 2 nitrogen uptake results indicate a good agreement between simulated and observed total n grain uptake fig 1 e the ceres maize model simulated reasonably well the total n uptake with an average of rmse and nrmse across all the experiments of 37 kg ha 1 and 17 respectively table 3 analyzing the three experiments separately the model overestimated the total n uptake in exp 1 and exp 2 while underestimating it in exp 3 in addition a good d statistic was obtained greater than 0 8 in each field experiment a significant relationship was observed between simulated and observed total n uptake with a r2 of 0 57 fig 1 e the most accurate prediction of plant n uptake was obtained in exp 3 with a rmse of 30 kg n ha 1 and a d statistic of 0 92 which is very similar to the study of salmerón et al 2014 who found a rmse of 25 kg n ha 1 however our results are better than those obtained by yakoub et al 2017 who found a rmse and d statistic of 41 kg n ha 1 and 0 88 respectively an accurate prediction of plant n content depends on the correct calculation of total biomass and n concentration in plant tissues this result can be associated with the overestimation of the total biomass already described previously yakoub et al 2017 suspected that the ceres maize simulated n concentration in the grain is higher than grain n concentration of modern hybrids moreover many reports indicate that due to the efforts to increase grain yield by genetic improvement grain n content of recent maize hybrids have decreased compared to older materials duvick 2005 other studies bowen et al 1993 also showed that ceres maize model overestimated the plant n uptake due to an overestimation in the release of mineral n from soil organic matter in some studies such as asadi and clemente 2003 and carberry et al 1989 also found a tendency of the ceres maize to overestimate the n uptake in maize 3 2 3 soil residual nitrate statistics of residual nitrate n analyzed by 0 30 m depth intervals upon to 1 20 m are presented in table 4 a reasonable performance of residual nitrate was observed in the location of exp 3 with a rmse varying between 14 and 38 kg n ha 1 moreover a high d static was obtained greater than 0 7 and in this experiment the model overestimated the residual nitrate n in all layers except in the first layer 0 3 m meanwhile in exp 1 and exp 2 the model underestimated the residual nitrate n in soil except in the deeper layers 0 6 1 2 m of exp 2 the rmse ranged from 50 to 69 kg n ha 1 in exp 1 and from 41 to 53 kg n ha 1 in exp 2 this suggests inadequate estimation of n root absorption by the model in the surface layer up to 0 3 m or difficulties to estimate n mineralization rates 3 2 4 improving total n uptake estimation following liu et al 2012 suggestion to improve the plant n estimation the new results derived from the calibrated ctcnp2 value ctcnp2 0 25 indicated that the rmse of grain n uptake was improved by 34 while total plant n uptake by 10 considering all the plots the rmse decreased from 28 to 20 kg n ha 1 and from 36 to 32 kg n ha 1 for grain and total biomass n uptake respectively nevertheless there is no significant difference on rmse of grain yield an increase of the rmse by 153 kg ha 1 also figs 1e and f shows the same relationship between simulated and observed total n uptake regarding residual n the rmse pooling all the plots from 0 to 1 2 m is reasonably acceptable with 47 kg n ha 1 using the new calibrated ctcnp2 value meanwhile a rmse of 43 kg n ha 1 was obtained using the standard value defined in the species file ctcnp2 0 16 therefore there is a slight differences between value of ctcnp2 regarding the residual n in soil after harvest that vary with depth a better adjustment of ctcnp2 parameter to specific environmental conditions is important to improve maize n uptake estimation however the n plant uptake improvement are not clearly reflected on the residual nitrogen in the soil due to the complexity of the nitrogen balance in the soil and other parameters that may be mainly due to the model s lack of sensitivity to small changes in the soil nitrogen balance and the simulation errors generated in each plot 3 3 dssat model application 3 3 1 irrigation management scenarios on average and according to surveys farmers applied 818 and 862 mm of water irrigation for maize crop during 2008 and 2009 seasons respectively however the application of the model using automatic irrigation provided a total of 518 and 646 mm for the same seasons respectively the higher water requirements estimated by the model during the 2009 were associated to a lower precipitation p 208 mm in comparison with 2008 irrigation season p 292 mm these results indicate the possibility to reduce a significant amount of irrigation water 313 and 216 mm in 2008 and 2009 respectively when the irrigation is adjusted to the real evapotranspiration needs although there is an online irrigation service from the regional government that allows farmers to calculate the weekly water irrigation needs according to the fao methodology it is barely used by maize growers and the tendency is to over irrigate the maize crop on the other hand and for each year the dssat model simulated similar irrigation doses for the three different soil types fig 2 a this is because the model applies the needed water to re fill the soil profile until field capacity increasing the frequency of irrigation events for soils having less water capacity retention as the terrace soils so the total dose is not affected thus the model simulated a total of 23 irrigations to the terrace soils and 20 irrigation events for alluvial soils results indicated no significant differences in simulated maize grain yields between real irrigation and dssat automatic irrigation doses across the different years and soil types fig 2b indicating that the model estimates similar yields using less amounts of irrigation water therefore adjusting irrigation taking into account the soil water holding capacity and the actual evapotranspiration values allows increasing the water use efficiency compared to the real management of maize growers in the watershed table 5 averaging across soil types i wue corresponding to real situation was 19 kg mm 1 and 14 kg mm 1 for 2008 and 2009 respectively while i wue of the adjusted irrigation scenario was 30 kg mm 1 and 19 kg mm 1 for 2008 and 2009 respectively in addition deep percolation simulated using actual irrigation was on average 165 mm and 134 mm for 2008 and 2009 respectively while with the automatic irrigation option the volume of water drained below the root zone was very small or zero depending on soil types and years table 5 the amount of total n uptake by maize presented similar value of 274 kg n ha 1 for both irrigation managements in 2009 and a very small difference in 2008 291 kg n ha 1 for actual situation vs 294 kg n ha 1 for adjusted irrigation scenario however nitrate leaching was high in the scenario of real irrigation management ranging from 90 to190 kg no3 ha 1 depending on soil type and year fig 3 a the model showed lower n leaching in the deep alluvial soils compared to the shallower soils in the case of actual irrigation practices the average nitrate loss below the root zone including all soils considered in the case of actual irrigation management was 34 kg ha 1 no3 n this amount is similar to that measured in the same region where annual amounts of nitrogen losses by drainage ranged between 25 to 50 kg no3 n ha 1 under well managed sprinkler irrigated systems tedeschi et al 2001 cavero et al 2003 however it is important to mention that the presented results includes only n losses during the crop season period april to october while the cited studies included n annual losses the combined lower n leaching and similar crop n uptake in the automatic irrigation scenario has leaded to higher soil residual nitrate fig 3b in all cases for automatic irrigation scenario values were similar for both year and soil type and higher for alluvial soils 206 kg no3 ha 1 in average than terrace soils 154 kg no3 ha 1 in average in the case of real irrigation management and all soil types the residual nitrate was 33 kg no3 ha 1 in average the automatic irrigation management results show very small n leaching losses in deep soils while the real farmer s irrigation management induces important subsurface n leaching losses below the root zone during maize growing season 3 3 2 nitrogen fertilizer scenarios according to the model the differences in grain yield between real traditional fertilization and recommended fertilization adjusted were not significant fig 4 a the average of simulated crop yield for the real fertilization management was 14041 kg ha 1 while with the adjusted fertilization scenario the yield was 14028 kg ha 1 according to the simulations performed during the 2004 2013 period under the two n fertilization scenarios fig 4b plant n uptake tended to increase as the amount initial soil mineral nitrogen increased no increase was observed in the scenario of real farmer s dose probably due to an excess of n availability in all situations n uptake is simulated in ceres maize by contrasting potential soil n supply with crop n demand to estimate crop n demand the model compares the concentration of n in plant tissues with a target concentration called critical n nc the model assumes that if the concentration of n in tissues is greater than or equal to nc growth proceeds without any n limitation however if the concentration of n falls below nc then the crop experiences n deficit and growth is reduced accordingly at the same time the n uptake demand is limited by a maximum n concentration subsequently the n uptake varies between critical n and maximum n according to the model and in our study soil n supply was greater than the critical n across all soil types and scenarios and therefore no significant difference in grain yield were found nevertheless the amounts of n uptake is significantly affected by the availability of soil mineral n the leached nitrate during the growing season increased proportionally to the initial amounts of soil mineral nitrogen low medium and high and decreases with soil depth fig 5 a adjusting the n rate the total mass of n leached was 58 15 and 3 kg no3 ha 1 for the terrace shallow alluvial and deep alluvial soils respectively this results point out the importance of adequate n management in shallow soils to decrease the negative environmental effects of n leaching as 38 of soils in the drw are terrace soils 0 6 m depth most of the n losses occur mainly in those soils averaging across soil types and initial soil mineral nitrogen smn the simulated residual soil mineral n range from 174 kg no3 ha 1 in the traditional n management scenario rate of 390 kg n ha 1 to 52 kg no3 ha 1 adjusted rate of 250 kg n ha 1 fig 5b the alluvial soils have similar values of residual smn but higher than terrace soils the figs 6 a and b shows the cumulative leached and residual nitrate n in soil over10 year s seasonal maize crop both of these cumulative variables are based on the sum of the final values after each maize harvest we assumed that the cumulative variables represent the minimum amounts of leached nitrate n and residual nitrate n because the nitrate n released from mineralization processes was not considered during the winter intercrop periods long term analysis of the cumulative leached n after 10 years simulations shows that the leached n is always higher in the real farmer s fertilization than in the adjusted fertilization negligible amount of leached n for the deep alluvial soil was observed and therefore was not included in the figure 6 a on the other hand a remarkable discrepancy between the two managements was observed for cumulative residual n with more than 1500 kg n ha 1 after 10 years fig 6b similar behavior was observed for the different soil types but it was more pronounced in alluvial soils the traditional behavior of fertilization followed by farmers in the study area shows a serious problem of management practices that leads to environmental contamination problems and a negative economic effect due the unnecessary expenses in n fertilizer besides nitrogen efficiency was significantly higher 56 kg grain kg 1 n applied in the scenario of adjusted n fertilization compared to the traditional scenario 36 kg grain kg 1 n applied performed by farmers in the study area testing smn levels before seeding and during early stages of maize growth can help to obtain more accurate n fertilizer recommendations cela et al 2013 taking into account the already available smn in the soil derived from mineralization or from preceding crops soils with high smn after harvest can supply part of the nitrogen needed by maize in the following crop year the proposed adjusted rate of 250 kg n ha 1 used in this study is a good starting point derived from regional studies but can be refined or site specific adjusted using soil or plant analysis during the maize growing season 4 conclusions in this work we evaluated first the performance of the dssat ceres maize model to predict grain yield total biomass grain number per ear kernel weight crop n uptake under a broad range of soil mineral nitrogen availability conditions a good performance of the model was demonstrated in this study by a rmse less than 703 kg ha 1 and 37 kg n ha 1 for grain yield and total n uptake among all the experiments a good agreement was obtained for total biomass yield components gne and grain weight and reasonably accuracy for residual n in soil the application of calibrated and validated model is a useful tool to assess management practices for reducing n leaching in intensive irrigated areas the simulation of different scenarios of water management indicate that irrigation management could be significantly improved adjusting the irrigation water applied according the actual evapotranspiration needs instead a fixed irrigation calendar normally used by most maize growers in the area this adjustment would reduce on average for different types of soil the total amount of seasonal irrigation water by 31 and the nitrate leaching by 97 without a significant reduction of grain yield similarly the simulation of different n management scenarios showed the feasibility to reduce significantly the n fertilizer dose currently applied to maize by farmers maintaining grain yield this reduction in the n fertilizer decrease the n leached between 33 and 53 depending on soil types even though the dssat have showed some uncertainties associated with inputs and model parameters the

11181,agricultural water productivity awp model is an essential tool for irrigation water management that is highly dependent on soil water processes soil hydrological models based on numeric solution to the richards equation are time consuming and difficult to measure and models based on soil water balance approach are favored especially for crop water simulation because of the less parameters requirement and higher operational efficiency in most of the soil water balance models such as williams ritchie water balance model aquacrop model and hydrobal model the under field capacity redistribution the redistribution during the period of soil water content below the field capacity is omitted and this treatment does not adequately simulate awp for arid and semi arid areas with deep groundwater in these areas awp is the ratio between crop yield achieved and the sum of actual evapotranspiration and deep percolation at field scale since no more water supply for crop growth except for low frequency irrigation and tiny amount of precipitation high evapotranspiration will aggravate an upward flow that can enhance transpiration and thus benefit crop growth while deep percolation not available for crop is sustainably accumulated to a considerable volume in under field capacity redistribution process to take into consideration the beneficial effects of upward flow on crop growth and the considerable under field capacity deep percolation loss a conceptual soil hydrological model considering under field capacity redistribution cshmur is developed and coupled with the epic crop growth model in cshmur model soil water redistribution is characterized by two sequential water flows downward flows affected by the gradient of gravitational potential and upward flows affected by the gradient of matric potential these two flows are mainly used to simulate deep percolation occurring in redistribution processes and upward flows resulting from matric potential respectively the cshmur epic model is calibrated and validated with field data for a typical arid area of northwestern china and it is then applied for the simulation of seven irrigation scenarios the study highlights that the upward flows aggravated by drought conditions and the under field capacity deep percolation are remarkable enough and should not be neglected in the awp estimation for arid and semi arid areas with deep groundwater the developed cshmur epic model can effectively simulate upward flows and the under field capacity deep percolation and thus soil water content swc both in lower and upper soil profiles actual evapotranspiration and crop growth resulting in an precise estimation of awp as upward flows and the under field capacity deep percolation vary with irrigation schedule the model is also helpful in exploring various irrigation schedule to obtain a sustainable agricultural water resources management keywords agricultural water productivity the under field capacity redistribution conceptual soil hydrological model deep groundwater arid and semi arid areas 1 introduction water is a fundamental and irreplaceable resource for agricultural development and ecological systems in recent years under the dual impacts of climate change and human activity water scarcity has arisen all over the world guo and shen 2016 siska and takara 2015 huo et al 2013 cosgrove and loucks 2015 this scarcity relates primarily to water required for food production rather than to water requirements for domestic or industrial purposes which are relative minute rijsberman 2006 sauer et al 2010 mclaughlin and kinzelbach 2015 globally irrigation accounts for more than 70 of total water withdrawals and for more than 90 of total consumptive water use siebert et al 2010 scanlon et al 2002 from a water safety and food security perspective water resource must be managed more efficiently and agricultural water productivity awp levels should be improved assouline et al 2015 amarasingha et al 2017 baker et al 2012 vaghefi et al 2017 masikati et al 2014 defined as production achieved per amount of water used water productivity reflects the relationship between water inputs and outputs and can be adopted as a useful indicator for assessing water resource management pereira et al 2012 the accurate estimation of water productivity can help guide the sustainable management of water resources and especially for those of arid and semi arid regions where water is scarce and crop production is critical for economic development evans and sadler 2008 widely used for water resources management process based agricultural water productivity awp simulations can be used as a tool for investigating and predicting crop productivity under various irrigation management conditions karandish and simunek 2016 for the simulation of water productivity a coupled model relating soil hydrology to crop growth processes quantitatively and bridging the boundaries of the two subjects is superior to a single model zhou et al 2012 as commonly used physical models crop growth models often simulate crop growth based on empirical functions or model underlying physiological processes of crop growth in relation to a surrounding environment liu 2009 substantial crop growth models have been developed and widely used e g epic williams et al 1989 wofost hijmans et al 1994 cropsyst stockle et al 1994 dssat jones et al 2003 and aquacrop steduto et al 2009 over the past few decades of these models the epic crop growth model offers high levels of simulation precision with less demanding data input requirements and thus catch the attention of hydrologists xu et al 2013 wang et al 2014 there are two main means of simulating the soil hydrology of an unsaturated zone numerical solutions to the richards equation and the soil water balance approach models based on the richards equation are often restricted to evaluating small areas and estimates generated can be highly uncertain because functional relationships applied through the richards equation are time consuming and difficult to measure especially at low water content in contrast a soil water balance approach can be applied to large areas with little experimental data flint et al 2002 scanlon et al 2002 gao et al 2017 xue et al 2018 as a result almost all soil hydrology modules considered in crop growth models such as epic cropsyst dssat aquacrop and so on adopt a soil water balance approach to simulate soil water movement in view of the indication that unsaturated hydraulic conductivity below the field capacity are so low that soil water flows are usually assumed to be zero most of soil water balance models such as williams ritchie water balance model used in epic ceres and perfect models littleboy et al 1992 aquacrop raes et al 2009 and hydrobal model bellot and chirino 2013 only simulate water flows during the period hydraulic conductivity in excess of field capacity the over field capacity redistribution as follows but not consider water flows when hydraulic conductivity below the field capacity the under field capacity redistribution as follows these models have something in common 1 they limit percolation simulations to the 1 3 day period following saturation and 2 they neglect upward flows resulting from matric potential in soil water redistribution processes however the redistribution process is in fact continuous and can persist at an appreciable rate for many days or even months after precipitation or irrigation hillel 1982 kendy et al 2003 it is considered to be a passive process that occurs in a variety of directions i e downward upward and even laterally through soil profiles mendel et al 2002 richards and caldwell 1987 although proven successful when applied to wet regions these models do not adequately simulate soil water flows occurring in drought conditions as crop growth is more sensitive to deep percolation and upward flows even low levels of deep percolation the under field capacity deep percolation no longer supporting crop growth may sustainably accumulate to a considerable volume kendy et al 2003 2004 provided a method to manage the under field capacity deep percolation and successfully estimated the long term deep percolation occurring in luancheng count of the western north china plain unfortunately it cannot effectively simulate the upper half of a soil moisture profile causing an adverse impact on the simulation of evapotranspiration crop production and awp jones et al 2003 indicated that continuous evapotranspiration can spur upward flows in entering water limited layers containing large roots upward flows can enhance transpiration and benefit crop growth during rainless periods scott et al 2008 guswa 2005 lee et al 2005 quijano and kumar 2015 without water supply for crop growth except for low frequency irrigation and tiny amount of precipitation in arid and semi arid areas with deep groundwater high and continuous evapotranspiration will substantially aggravate upward flows produced and the aggravated upward flows probably should not be neglected in the simulation of awp in this paper a conceptual soil hydrological model considering under field capacity redistribution cshmur was proposed and coupled with the epic crop growth model to investigate the effect of the under field capacity deep percolation and upward flows on the awp estimation for arid and semi arid area with deep groundwater with field data from a typical arid area in northwestern china the coupled awp model cshmur epic model was calibrated and validated and the simulation effects were evaluated in addition in order to explore the practical application in sustainable agricultural water resources management the developed model was used in the simulation of several irrigation scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the model as discussed by pereira et al 2012 the term wp should be used rather than the term water use efficiency wue the total water productivity is the ratio between the achieved yield and the water used to produce that yield agricultural water productivity awp herein refers to the total water productivity of agricultural crops and it can be used at farm scale or regional scale the total water use consists of actual evapotranspiration from crops and deep percolation at field scale at regional scale canal conveyance operational loss is also included in the total water use in addition to the water use at field the developed cshmur epic model is designed to simulate the farm scale awp and can also provide main inputs for regional scale awp estimation at farm scale awp kg m3 is calculated from the following equation 1 a w p y e t a d p where eta is the actual season evapotranspiration where dp is deep percolation and where y is the crop yield kg the dynamic response relationship between soil water content and crop growth is central to assessing and predicting awp in this study the awp model is established by coupling a conceptual soil hydrological model considering under field capacity redistribution cshmur and the epic crop growth model to take full advantage of the characteristics of these two models and to reduce the number of input parameters used under field capacity redistribution is considered in the soil hydrological model by regarding soil water redistribution as the mixing of two separate and sequential water flows downward flows affected by the gradient of gravitational potential and upward flows affected by the gradient of matric potential downward and upward flows are mainly used to simulate deep percolation occurring through redistribution processes and water movements due to evapotranspiration respectively crop growth indicators e g the leaf area index and root depth the epic crop growth model can provide must be input into cshmur and in turn soil moisture levels simulated through cshmur serve as essential input data for the epic crop growth model specifically as the main output parameters of the epic crop growth model the leaf area index and root depth vary in using the leaf area index root depth and soil moisture level as an interface and by applying information exchange on a daily basis these two models are coupled and a model cshmur epic simulating awp for arid and semi arid areas with deep groundwater is developed a schematic diagram of the coupling structure is presented in fig 1 the model code was written in matlab 2014a and requires the use of microsoft excel data to run outputs of actual evapotranspiration eta deep percolation dp and crop yields y generated from the model are used to calculate the total agricultural water productivity awp level kg m3 2 2 soil hydrology in arid and semi arid areas with flat terrain surface runoff on irrigated land can be assumed negligible but processes such as those of infiltration evapotranspiration and redistribution must be considered in relation to soil hydrology infiltration and redistribution processes mentioned in this paper refer to the water movement process before and after all the water entry into soil following a rainfall or irrigation event respectively the division is only for calculation purpose and the water flow simulated in the model is continuous process in deed as the process are simulated step by step and there is no interval between their calculations in redistribution process soil water movement is driven by the gradient of soil water potential which includes gravitational potential and matric potential as numerical solution to richards equation is time consuming and the intrinsic parameters are difficult to measure a conceptual method is explored to simulate flow process in soil water redistribution module water flux q is assumed as the mixing of two hypothetical components water flux q g affected by the gradient of gravitational potential and water flux q m affected by the gradient of matric potential the value of q g is always negative and thus q m accounts for upward flows to minimize computational efforts required q g and q m are calculated separately and sequential for each time step just like the calculation of et and soil water the soil water budget fig 2 equation of a vertical soil column is expressed as follows 2 θ 1 t l 1 θ 1 t 1 l 1 p t i t q i 1 t e 1 t t 1 t q g 1 t q m 1 t 3 i 2 n θ i t l i i 2 n θ i t δ t l i e i t t i t q i i 1 t q i i t q g i 1 t q g i t q m i t q m i 1 t where subscripts t δt and i denote time d the time step 1d and the ith soil layer respectively where n is number of soil layers where l is the thickness of the soil layer considered cm where p and i are precipitation and irrigation respectively cm d where q i i is the water flux cm d out from the bottom of layer i in infiltration process where q g i is the downward flux cm d out from the bottom of layer i affected by the gravitational potential gradient in redistribution process where the sum of q i n and q g n is taken as the occurrence of deep percolation from the simulated soil column and where q m i is the upward flow flux cm d from layer i 1 to layer i affected by the matric potential gradient in redistribution process for areas with deep groundwater the bottom of the soil profile is considered a free drainage boundary and q m n is 0 note that the flow directions of q i and q g are set as downward while that of q m is set as upward therefore q i and q g always have positive values and q m appears to be negative early on and positive later on 2 2 1 infiltration during irrigation and precipitation events water distribution through a soil profile following precipitation or irrigation is simulated with a tipping bucket module riha et al 1994 in the module once precipitation or irrigation occurs water enters the soil immediately the water first enters the uppermost soil layer and then excess water flows to deeper layers when the soil moisture level reaches saturation the process continues in a tipping bucket fashion until each layer is filled to saturation or until all of the water has been distributed any excess water that drains from the lowest layer q i n becomes part of the deep percolation process for the considered time step 2 2 2 evapotranspiration as a form of consumptive water use evapotranspiration is the broadest term used after precipitation and irrigation morillas et al 2013 as transpiration sustains crop growth needs the model partitions evapotranspiration et into evaporation and transpiration to simulate evapotranspiration processes the fao 56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 is used to compute the reference crop potential evapotranspiration et0 mm

pressure curve kpa c 1 and where γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 the potential evapotranspiration of crop etp is calculated as 5 e t p k c e t 0 where kc is the crop coefficient and it is worth noting that kc in this study is not necessarily the same as the crop coefficient in the traditional sense kc as described by allen et al 1998 kc is important for calculating etp for the concerned crop and changes with crop growth sau et al 2004 and dejonge et al 2012 have successfully used the following formula for the calculation of kc 6 k c 1 0 k c max 1 0 l a i l a i max where lai is the leaf area index where lai max is the maximum lai value and where kc max is kc with the largest possible lai a value of 1 1 for kc max is recommended according to the research results of sau et al 2004 and in this paper the kc max value is set to 1 1 the equation defines the etp of bare wet soil with a zero lai value as the same as the etp value of the reference crop et0 0 12 m tall and lai of 2 88 potential evapotranspiration etp includes potential soil evaporation ep and potential transpiration tp the ratio of ep to tp is shaped by the developmental stage that a leaf canopy occupies and it can be expressed as a function of lai ritchie 1972 partitioned etp into ep and tp with the following equation 7 e p e t p exp k b l a i 8 t p e t p e p where kb is the dimensionless canopy extinction coefficient for crops in general ritchie 1972 used a kb value of 0 85 while belmans et al 1983 used a kb value of 0 6 sau et al 2004 found that a value of close to 0 5 may be more adequate for further solar radiation analyses and it was proved to exhibit good performance for the simulation of evapotranspiration biomass and yields lópez cedrón et al 2008 dejonge et al 2012 evaporation can drive water from as deep as 3 m in a profile though most water is removed from surficial areas assuming that transpiration equals to root water uptake loss and transpiration removes water from all layers containing plant roots the potential volume of soil surface water uptake to any root depth is estimated with the function novark 1987 9 u z t p 1 exp δ z z r 1 exp δ where u z is the total water uptake rate cm d from a ground surface to depth z cm where zr is root depth cm and where δ is a water use distribution parameter a δ value of 3 64 is adequate for corn novark 1987 and this value is used for all crops in our model the potential water uptake from layer i can be calculated as the difference between u values at layer boundaries 10 t p i u f i t t p 11 u f i t 1 1 exp δ exp δ z 1 i z r 1 exp δ z 2 i z 1 i z r where z1 i and z2 i are the depth of the upper and lower boundaries of soil layer i respectively t p i is the potential water uptake from layer i u f i t is the water uptake ratio of layer i to the whole root zone and the sum of u f i t values for all layers of the root zone is equal to 1 0 kendy et al 2003 used the same equation to calculate u f i e and to allocate evaporation to soil layers by substituting root depth for soil layer depth and by setting 10 as the δ value and results showed the reasonableness as evaporation is more heavily concentrated close to surface soils than transpiration in this paper the δ value for evaporation was also set as 10 12 e p i u f i e e p where e p i is the potential volume of soil evaporated from layer i and where u f i e is the evaporation fraction of layer i to all soil layers the actual evaporation and transpiration from layer i are closely related to water conditions and can be computed as 13 e a i k r i e p i 14 t a i k s i t p i where e a i and t a i are the actual soil evaporation and transpiration from layer i respectively and where k r i and k s i are the water stress coefficients of evaporation and transpiration respectively the water stress coefficients for each layer are written as the following equations raes et al 2009 15 k r exp 2 5 θ θ f c θ f c θ w p θ θ f c 1 θ θ f c 16 0 k s 1 exp d r e l f s h a p e 1 exp f s h a p e 1 1 17 d rel 1 θ θ w p 1 p θ f c θ w p where θfc and θwp are the volumetric swc at field capacity and the wilting point cm3 cm3 respectively drel 1 is relative water depletion fshape is the shape factor of the ks curve and p is the fraction of readily available soil water relative to the total volume of available soil water 2 2 3 soil water redistribution 2 2 3 1 downward flows affected by the gradient of gravitational potential in redistribution assuming that no incoming or outgoing water fluxes occur other than those produced by a unit gradient at the bottom of a layer outflows from a layer can be expressed according to the conservation of mass as 18 l d θ d t k θ where l is layer thickness cm where θ is the average volumetric swc of the layer cm3 cm3 where t is time d and where k is unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm d the equation is put forward by steenhuis and van der molen 1986 and then is successfully applied to groundwater recharge estimation for western north china plain kendy et al 2003 according to their finding eq 18 can be solved from an exponential relationship between k and θ which involves few parameters such that 19 k θ k s exp α θ s θ θ s θ d where ks is saturated hydraulic conductivity cm3 day where θs is the volumetric swc of a soil layer at saturation cm3 cm3 where θd is the volumetric swc of dry soil cm3 cm3 where the value of θd is half that of θwp allen et al 1998 raes et al 2009 ritchie 1996 sharpley and williams 1990 and where α is an empirical parameter for homogeneous soils α is approximately valued at 13 bresler et al 1978 steenhuis and van der molen 1986 for heterogeneous soils α can be as large as 16 russo and bresler 1980 kendy et al 2003 by substituting eq 18 into eq 19 and by integrating over time step δt the swc of a single layer after infiltration can be obtained 20 θ t θ s θ s θ d α ln α k s δ t l θ s θ d exp α θ s θ t δ t θ s θ d downward flow flux out of a layer over one time step represents the difference between soil water stored as calculated from eq 20 and that measured prior to calculation then calculations shift from the present layer to the underlying layer two conditions of water flux entering into the deeper layer are considered 1 at the start of the time step and 2 at the end of the time step for either condition calculations generate considerable errors especially in precipitation or irrigation day to limit simulation errors soil water content observed at the end of the time step for the two cases are computed separately and the average swc is taken as the eventual swc value of this process as a result the downward flow flux from each layer is calculated for one time step as deep percolation occurs in both infiltration and redistribution processes the total deep percolation in one time step is the sum of the downward flux from the bottom of the soil profile calculated from the tipping bucket module and from the downward flow module 2 2 3 2 upward flows affected by the gradient of matric potential in redistribution in arid and semi arid areas it is common for soil water to flow upward due to low moisture levels in the upper layer soil subroutine upward flows are thus determined to compute changes in volumetric swc resulting from the upward movement of soil water through the profile the upward flow of water from soil layers is calculated based on capillary flow theory jones et al 1986 according to which upward flow is approximated from a normalized soil water diffusion concept based on a daily time step water content is normalized to the swc at the wilting point where an assumption is made that the diffusivity of all soils is d0 the assumed average diffusivity above the swc at the wilting point of two adjacent layers is a function of the normalized swc for all soils ritchie 1996 21 d i d 0 exp β θ i θ w p i 2 θ i 1 θ w p i 1 2 where di is the average diffusivity value cm2 d of layer i and layer i 1

to 100 cm2 d ritchie 1996 found a d0 value of 0 88 and a β value of 35 4 by fitting data given by rose 1968 suleiman and ritchie 2003 found an exponential relationship between diffusivity and swc and

calculator crop growth model was developed to estimate soil productivity as it is affected by erosion throughout the u s it simulates all crops with one crop growth model using unique parameter values for each crop processes simulated include the leaf area index root growth conversion to biomass the division of biomass into roots the above ground mass and economic yields in the model the phenological development of a crop is based on daily heat unit accumulation patterns a crop starts to grow when the average daily air temperature exceeds the base temperature and it can be harvested when accumulated heat units reach potential heat units required for maturity the interception of solar radiation is estimated as a function of lai which depends on the crop species heat units and crop stress potential biomass and yields are respectively estimated using the concept of biomass energy ratio and harvest index economic yield aboveground biomass potential growth is constrained by the minimum of five stress factors water nitrogen phosphorus temperature and aeration a more detailed description of the epic crop growth model can be found in williams et al 1989 2 4 model performance

data for model testing the yingke irrigation district yid 38 50 38 58 n 100 17 100 34e located in middle oasis of the heihe river basin in northwestern china fig 3 is selected as our case study area it is the third largest irrigation district of the middle oasis and spans 17 4 km from east to west and 14 2 km from south to north covering an area of 192 2 square kilometers at a 1 70 1 1000 natural gradient the terrain in the area is relatively flat and elevations vary between 1456 m and 1600 m from northeast to southwest the local climate of the yid is arid continental annually average temperatures reach 6 5 7 0 c and a minimum of 28 c and a maximum of 33 5 c and average precipitation levels reach 125 mm while the local reference crop evapotranspiration level eto is approximately 1200 mm as a major part of the middle oasis which forms an important grain production base the yid requires approximately 175 million m3 of irrigation water per year accounting for 10 of water requirements of the middle oasis and for more than 90 of water used in the yid in the yid crops grown mainly include corn wheat and vegetables and a few of forest grass and other crops after crop pattern adjustments were made in 2000 shi et al 2011 corn became the main crop grown accounting for 78 of all crops grown in the area for these crops rainfall levels are too low to meet crop water consumption needs and irrigation water mainly originates from heihe river stream flows and is supplemented by groundwater for irrigation purposes the local government and farmers have built a large canal network consisting of one main canal 2 sub main canals 27 secondary canals 173 lateral canals and more than 1000 sub lateral canals the canals span 1119 1 km and most have been lined since the application of water saving practices in 2000 jiang et al 2015 yingke main canal the only main canal in yid diverts water directly from the heihe river and supplements the canal network 2 5 1 field experiment field experiments were carried out at 16 field sites from 2012 to 2013 and a typical field in 2012 fig 3 the 16 field sites s1 s16 distributed across different areas of the yid were arranged based on digital soil land use crop and canal network maps and they covers four soil types from 0 to 80 cm to 80 140 cm silt loam silt loam silt loam sandy loam silt loam loam and loam loam three crop types corn wheat and cabbage and different irrigation volume besides a field covering different soil types was added to our experiment and four points t1 t4 located in this typical field we calls observation points having the same crop types corn and irrigation volume represents four types of soil in 2012 corn was planted in all 16 field sites and in the typical field in 2013 wheat was planted in s5 and s7 and cabbage was grown in s10 among the 16 field sites s2 s5 and s10 were used to represent corn wheat and cabbage respectively which are the main crops grown in the yid soil moisture and crop growth indicators including the leaf area index and dry above ground biomass were recorded every 2 weeks at the 16 field sites and every 1 week at the four observation points of the typical field soil moisture was measured using the time domain reflectometry method and undisturbed soil samples were collected via the cutting ring method using 7 layers of equal thickness to a depth of 140 cm using a malvern laser particle size analyzer called the mastersizer 2000 soil samples were analyzed and soil texture data were obtained for crop growth indicators the leaf area index lai and dry above ground biomass d agb values were measured by accupar lp80 directly and by drying the above ground biomass to a constant weight at 75 c an irrigation schedule and crop growth period table 1 were applied according to recommendations made by the local water conservancy department farmers and a number of researchers 2 5 2 data collection daily meteorological data including those for rainfall maximum and minimum temperature wind speed sunshine duration and relative humidity levels for the zhangye weather station 100 26 e 38 56 n 1482 7 m were downloaded from the china meteorological data service system http cdc nmic cn home do while neglecting spatial variations data collected at the zhangye weather station can be regarded as representative meteorological of the entire area as the station is positioned within the yid fig 3 dozens of groundwater monitoring wells fig 3 were found within and around the yid and groundwater depths monitored by these wells in 2004 were available via inverse distance weighting idw the monitored depth was interpolated and the spatial distribution of groundwater depth in the yid fig 4 was determined for nearly the entire yid groundwater depths in 2004 exceeded 4 m the unrestrained use of groundwater resources has resulted in a gradual decline of the water table in recent years and groundwater depth will continue to increase over the next 10 years chen et al 2016 li et al 2017a therefore the yid can be considered an area with deep groundwater and it is reasonable to omit phreatic water evaporation in the simulation of soil water cycles in 2012 and 2013 to test the model s performance in actual evapotranspiration simulation flux data measured from an eddy correlation system fig 3 were obtained from the western database http www heihedata org c an eddy correlation system was installed at a corn area site close to the s1 and s2 sites and within these sites irrigation schedules used are quite similar the ec data cover the period running from may 30 to september 21 2012 and were processed using edire software developed by the university of edinburgh liu et al 2016 using the bowen ratio equilibrium energy balance closure method consoli and papa 2013 we corrected ec data to improve measurement precision levels 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation soil and crop parameters were calibrated and validated by comparing simulated and measured soil water content swc actual evapotranspiration eta leaf area index lai and dry above ground biomass d bag values from field observations and collected data s5 s7 s10 for 2013 and other field sites for 2012 were used to calibrate soil and crop parameters corn wheat and vegetables and s5 s7 s10 in 2012 were used to validate the calibrated parameters soil and corn growth parameters as only one year data for wheat and cabbage crops were collected crop growth parameters of these two forms were only calibrated and not validated in addition four observation points t1 t2 t3 and t4 located in the typical field were used for supplementary validation in general s2 for 2012 s5 for 2012 and s5 and s10 for 2013 were selected as representative sites of corn wheat and vegetable growth respectively and s2 was used to analyze simulation effects of soil hydrology calibrated values of crop parameters included in the epic crop growth model for corn wheat and cabbage and soil parameters at s2 are shown in tables 2 and 3 respectively as is shown in fig 5 simulations of lai and d bag for corn correspond well with measurements made during calibration and validation for the lai of corn rmse and mre values were measured as 0 429 and 8 2 respectively while r2 and nse values respectively reached 0 877 and 0 846 during calibration rmse and mre values collected during validation were found to be larger than those collected during calibration and r2 and nse values decreased denoting satisfactory performance not fully meeting that of the calibration regarding d bag values for corn during calibration and validation r2 rmse mre and nse were measured as similar at 0 912 2 877 t ha 11 6 and 0 799 during calibration and at 0 920 2 778 t ha 17 7 and 0 902 during validation in addition simulated lai for wheat and cabbage values satisfactorily matched the measured values fig 6 generating r2 values of 0 904 and 0 561 respectively rmse values of 0 397 and 0 715 respectively and nse values of 0 792 and 0 518 respectively the simulated swc values show good agreement with the values measured from various field sites covering four soil types three crop types and different irrigation schedules during calibration and validation figs 7 and 8 fig 9 and table 4 indicated that the model provided good performance in the swc simulation for all the layers in terms of average swc values for the whole profile the statistic suggesting that the simulation effects of whole profile was superior to that of layered 3 2 evaluation of model performance 3 2 1 evapotranspiration the simulated eta at s2 was compared to the measured eta close to s2 with an eddy correlation system for evaluating modeling performance the results show that the simulated eta values are basically consistent with the measured values with the exception of values measured for several days of the initial stage and for rainy days fig 10 evaporation the main component of evapotranspiration in initial stages is very sensitive to water condition located away from eddy correlation system the irrigation schedule of s2 was not exactly the same diverse irrigation practices between in s2 and in the position eddy correlation system located resulted in different water conditions which can be account for the discrepancy of eta in initial stages in general large volumes of invalid data will be generated from measurements of eddy correlation systems in rainy days causing the measured eta values lower than the actual values even so r2 mre and nse results still respectively reached values of 0 519 19 1 and 0 378 for the crop growth period the simulated eta was 631 mm which was similar to the results of other studies taking studies of the zhangye oasis as an example zhao et al 2010 li et al 2012 hochmuth et al 2015 and jiang et al 2015 estimated maize eta values of 618 mm 567 mm 668 mm and 664 699 mm respectively thus evapotranspiration was effectively simulated via the model as the main component of soil hydrology evapotranspiration et plays a key role in agricultural water cycles in agricultural areas evapotranspiration et represents the main source of consumptive water use and it includes the productive consumptive use of water t crop transpiration and the non productive consumptive use of water e soil evaporation pereira et al 2012 the water productivity model separates et into e and t to lessen confounding effects of the non productive consumptive use of water e which is important especially when ground cover is incomplete in initial stages or as a result of sparse planting practices raes et al 2011 daily potential and actual evaporation ep and ea together with potential and actual transpiration tp and ta were calculated using the model and simulation results for s2 for the year 2012 are shown in fig 11 simulation results indicated that water stress limited water consumption and the constrained effect on evaporation and transpiration appeared an apparent difference with ea ep 0 33 and ta tp 0 98 the relatively low non productive consumptive water use ea and high productive consumptive water use ta levels found show that the irrigation schedule used for s2 are reasonable and that irrigation levels have satisfied crop growth demand in the crop growth period the simulated total actual evapotranspiration eta level reached 631 mm and the simulated ta accounted for 80 of it 3 2 2 deep percolation deep percolation was simulated based on tipping bucket module of the infiltration process and the downward flow module of the redistribution process although deep percolation is critical in many soil hydrological settings it seems fair to conclude that this hydrological flux is difficult to measure seyfried et al 2005 in this paper soil water budget was used as an analytical tool to evaluate deep percolation simulation results the components of water budget for the 0 140 cm soil profile at s2 in 2012 are shown in fig 12 it can be find that the simulated soil water storage levels fit well with the measured values and the corresponding statistical indices are shown in table 4 according to the principle of water budget the deep percolation simulated in the awp model is trustworthy because of the well simulated evapotranspiration and soil water storage s2 despite receiving only 113 mm of precipitation in the crop growth period percolated 482 mm of water from the soil profile because too much irrigation water was added to the soil 907 mm jiang et al 2015 estimated that deep percolation of yid under 655 898 mm irrigation level range from 250 to 437 mm from the swap model which is based on numerical solutions to the richards equation as excess water flows from the bottom of the soil profile when irrigation levels exceeds soil profile capacities deep percolation simulated through swap under the 907 mm irrigation level was roughly 470 mm which is very close to our value deep percolation rates increased quickly on days of irrigation and decreased in subsequent days due to water consumption fig 12 according to our simulation results cumulative deep percolation produced in the period swc exceeds field capacity the over field capacity deep percolation was 397 mm and that produced in the period swc is below field capacity the under field capacity deep percolation reached 85 mm the 397 mm simulated over field capacity deep percolation is basically the same as the 350 406 mm total deep percolation estimation of li et al 2017b who simulated deep percolation for maize crops of the zhangye oasis with a traditional conceptual soil hydrological model the simulated 85 mm under field capacity deep percolation was neglected in the traditional conceptual model and accounted for more than 2 3 of precipitation 113 mm thus the under field capacity deep percolation is remarkable and should not be neglected especially in the simulation of awp for arid areas which is in line with the findings of kendy et al 2003 comparisons drawn between these three models show that the cshmur model can overcome the deficiency of traditional conceptual hydrological models in the simulation of under field capacity deep percolation and give an estimation that is as good as the models based on numerical solutions to the richards equation provide 3 2 3 soil water redistribution module that combines downward and upward flows the soil water redistribution module that mixes downward and upward flows is proposed for capturing the continuous redistribution process water flow in redistribution process is assumed as the mixture of two separate and sequential flows downward flows affected by the gravitational potential gradient and upward flows affected by the matric potential gradient the advantages in deep percolation have been discussed in the above section apart from deep percolation water flows caused by matric potential gradient also restrict simulations of soil water redistribution in arid and semi arid areas evapotranspiration spurs upward flows as it attributes to matric potential gradient jones et al 2003 and drought conditions will aggravate the flows produced if there is no gravitational potential gradient the matric potential gradient will be the only driver of water flows and its generation is dependent on water content variations between adjacent layers simulation results implied that water consumed as evaporation or transpiration varies with soil depth and the upper layer has lost more water than the lower layer fig 13 in arid and semi arid areas with deep groundwater soil water cannot be timely supplemented and continuously high levels of evapotranspiration aggravates the matric potential gradient thus driving upward flows that can be effectively used for crop growth of course gravitational potential gradient also changes water storage levels but the consequent variations across different layers were always found to be similar except in a very short period immediately following low irrigation and precipitation this exception only occurs if irrigation or precipitation is not high enough to allow all layers to reach saturated water content levels and can be attributed to the assumption of the tipping bucket infiltration routine in this short period matric potential gradient drives downward flows and even so water flows are mainly simulated from the downward flow module as the flow flux simulated in upward flow module is low relative to that simulated in downward flow module then evapotranspiration spurs matric potential gradient and therefore upward flows are produced as gravitational potential gradient is always downward the flow affected by the matric potential gradient is used to simulate upward flows that evapotranspiration spurs and that s why we refer to this flow as upward flow note that the dynamic of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity levels are considered in the downward flow module while neglected the diffusivity is constant in the upward flow module over one time step in early days following irrigation and precipitation unsaturated hydraulic conductivity changed rapidly and its dynamic change can be reflected since water flow in this period is mainly simulated from the downward flow module in later periods hydraulic conductivity changed so gradually that the dynamic can be neglected in one day although not completely accurate this assumption allowed us to make an approximate estimation with low volumes of precipitation and groundwater supplemented to the root zone upward flows significantly affected crop growth in these areas to realize the effects of upward flows the upward flow module was removed from the cshmur epic model and the corresponding simulation results were compared with those achieved by the unabridged cshmur epic model as is shown in fig 9 and table 4 the upward flow module improved swc simulation effects and especially for the upper half of the soil moisture profile under a certain amount of deep percolation actual evapotranspiration and crop yields determined awp values for arid and semi arid areas with deep groundwater closely related these two components the swc for the upper half of the soil profile is a key factor shaping awp values therefore the upward flow module improving swc simulations of the upper layers can contribute to the awp simulation efficiently the soil water redistribution module combing downward and upward flows can well simulated swc values for all soil layers swc values of the lower half of the soil profile and that of the upper half of the soil profile were found to be highly correlated with deep percolation and actual evapotranspiration and crop yields respectively a conceptual soil hydrological model with this module can be helpful for the simulation of water productivity in arid and semi arid areas with deep groundwater 3 3 simulations in different irrigation scenarios a qualified model used for management should be capable to simulate the dynamic change of the object irrigation schedule in yid was unevenly distributed across space and average irrigation for corn in 2012 reached 607 mm accounting for 67 of s2 seven scenarios involving different irrigation schedules current conditions c average irrigation levels applied the yid a0 80 of average irrigation levels a1 60 of average irrigation levels a2 40 of average irrigation levels a3 20 of average irrigation levels a4 and no irrigation a5 were applied for the simulation of s2 as is shown in fig 14 not only over field capacity deep percolation but also under field capacity deep percolation not considered in most conceptual soil hydrological models varied with irrigation schedules the simulated under field capacity percolation is considerable at normal irrigation conditions and keeps at a low level only if irrigation is too little to arrive at the lowest layer it ranged from 77 mm to 94 mm in scenarios c a1 while from 20 mm to 30 mm in scenarios a2 a5 water storage varied in these irrigation scenarios and thus upward flows benefitting crop growth can be dynamically simulated for these seven irrigation scenarios relative to simulated ta values of 222 502 mm simulated ea varied little from 79 mm to 129 mm the caption of the dynamic changes in the productive consumptive use of water ta and the non productive consumptive use of water ea is a key factor for dynamic awp estimation therefore a model considering the under field capacity deep percolation is helpful in exploring awp to obtain a sustainable agricultural water resources management for arid and semi arid areas with deep groundwater 4 conclusions in this paper a conceptual soil hydrological model considering under field capacity redistribution cshmur was proposed and coupled with the epic crop growth model to estimate awp for rainless area with field data collected in a typical arid area of northwestern china the coupled awp model cshmur epic was calibrated and validated and then the effect of the under field capacity redistribution on the awp simulation results was investigated at last in order to explore the practical application in sustainable agricultural water resources management the developed awp model was used as a tool to simulate the dynamic awp in several irrigation scenarios our main conclusions as follows 1 drought condition substantially aggravate upward flows produced and an upward flow module can efficiently improve simulation effects of swc on the upper half of a soil profile and thus contribute to the estimation of awp for arid and semi arid areas 2 the under field capacity deep percolation is remarkable and should not be neglected in the awp estimation for arid areas according to the proposed model levels reach up to 94 mm with sufficient irrigation accounting for more than 2 3 of the precipitation measured in our study area downward flows embedded in our conceptual soil hydrological model can simulate the under field capacity deep percolation as well as models based on numerical solutions to the richards equation 3 upward flows and under field capacity deep percolation not considered in most conceptual soil hydrological models varied with irrigation schedules and thus a hydrological model considering the under field capacity redistribution has advantages in the exploration of sustainable agricultural water resources management acknowledgments this study was supported by the national natural science

11181,agricultural water productivity awp model is an essential tool for irrigation water management that is highly dependent on soil water processes soil hydrological models based on numeric solution to the richards equation are time consuming and difficult to measure and models based on soil water balance approach are favored especially for crop water simulation because of the less parameters requirement and higher operational efficiency in most of the soil water balance models such as williams ritchie water balance model aquacrop model and hydrobal model the under field capacity redistribution the redistribution during the period of soil water content below the field capacity is omitted and this treatment does not adequately simulate awp for arid and semi arid areas with deep groundwater in these areas awp is the ratio between crop yield achieved and the sum of actual evapotranspiration and deep percolation at field scale since no more water supply for crop growth except for low frequency irrigation and tiny amount of precipitation high evapotranspiration will aggravate an upward flow that can enhance transpiration and thus benefit crop growth while deep percolation not available for crop is sustainably accumulated to a considerable volume in under field capacity redistribution process to take into consideration the beneficial effects of upward flow on crop growth and the considerable under field capacity deep percolation loss a conceptual soil hydrological model considering under field capacity redistribution cshmur is developed and coupled with the epic crop growth model in cshmur model soil water redistribution is characterized by two sequential water flows downward flows affected by the gradient of gravitational potential and upward flows affected by the gradient of matric potential these two flows are mainly used to simulate deep percolation occurring in redistribution processes and upward flows resulting from matric potential respectively the cshmur epic model is calibrated and validated with field data for a typical arid area of northwestern china and it is then applied for the simulation of seven irrigation scenarios the study highlights that the upward flows aggravated by drought conditions and the under field capacity deep percolation are remarkable enough and should not be neglected in the awp estimation for arid and semi arid areas with deep groundwater the developed cshmur epic model can effectively simulate upward flows and the under field capacity deep percolation and thus soil water content swc both in lower and upper soil profiles actual evapotranspiration and crop growth resulting in an precise estimation of awp as upward flows and the under field capacity deep percolation vary with irrigation schedule the model is also helpful in exploring various irrigation schedule to obtain a sustainable agricultural water resources management keywords agricultural water productivity the under field capacity redistribution conceptual soil hydrological model deep groundwater arid and semi arid areas 1 introduction water is a fundamental and irreplaceable resource for agricultural development and ecological systems in recent years under the dual impacts of climate change and human activity water scarcity has arisen all over the world guo and shen 2016 siska and takara 2015 huo et al 2013 cosgrove and loucks 2015 this scarcity relates primarily to water required for food production rather than to water requirements for domestic or industrial purposes which are relative minute rijsberman 2006 sauer et al 2010 mclaughlin and kinzelbach 2015 globally irrigation accounts for more than 70 of total water withdrawals and for more than 90 of total consumptive water use siebert et al 2010 scanlon et al 2002 from a water safety and food security perspective water resource must be managed more efficiently and agricultural water productivity awp levels should be improved assouline et al 2015 amarasingha et al 2017 baker et al 2012 vaghefi et al 2017 masikati et al 2014 defined as production achieved per amount of water used water productivity reflects the relationship between water inputs and outputs and can be adopted as a useful indicator for assessing water resource management pereira et al 2012 the accurate estimation of water productivity can help guide the sustainable management of water resources and especially for those of arid and semi arid regions where water is scarce and crop production is critical for economic development evans and sadler 2008 widely used for water resources management process based agricultural water productivity awp simulations can be used as a tool for investigating and predicting crop productivity under various irrigation management conditions karandish and simunek 2016 for the simulation of water productivity a coupled model relating soil hydrology to crop growth processes quantitatively and bridging the boundaries of the two subjects is superior to a single model zhou et al 2012 as commonly used physical models crop growth models often simulate crop growth based on empirical functions or model underlying physiological processes of crop growth in relation to a surrounding environment liu 2009 substantial crop growth models have been developed and widely used e g epic williams et al 1989 wofost hijmans et al 1994 cropsyst stockle et al 1994 dssat jones et al 2003 and aquacrop steduto et al 2009 over the past few decades of these models the epic crop growth model offers high levels of simulation precision with less demanding data input requirements and thus catch the attention of hydrologists xu et al 2013 wang et al 2014 there are two main means of simulating the soil hydrology of an unsaturated zone numerical solutions to the richards equation and the soil water balance approach models based on the richards equation are often restricted to evaluating small areas and estimates generated can be highly uncertain because functional relationships applied through the richards equation are time consuming and difficult to measure especially at low water content in contrast a soil water balance approach can be applied to large areas with little experimental data flint et al 2002 scanlon et al 2002 gao et al 2017 xue et al 2018 as a result almost all soil hydrology modules considered in crop growth models such as epic cropsyst dssat aquacrop and so on adopt a soil water balance approach to simulate soil water movement in view of the indication that unsaturated hydraulic conductivity below the field capacity are so low that soil water flows are usually assumed to be zero most of soil water balance models such as williams ritchie water balance model used in epic ceres and perfect models littleboy et al 1992 aquacrop raes et al 2009 and hydrobal model bellot and chirino 2013 only simulate water flows during the period hydraulic conductivity in excess of field capacity the over field capacity redistribution as follows but not consider water flows when hydraulic conductivity below the field capacity the under field capacity redistribution as follows these models have something in common 1 they limit percolation simulations to the 1 3 day period following saturation and 2 they neglect upward flows resulting from matric potential in soil water redistribution processes however the redistribution process is in fact continuous and can persist at an appreciable rate for many days or even months after precipitation or irrigation hillel 1982 kendy et al 2003 it is considered to be a passive process that occurs in a variety of directions i e downward upward and even laterally through soil profiles mendel et al 2002 richards and caldwell 1987 although proven successful when applied to wet regions these models do not adequately simulate soil water flows occurring in drought conditions as crop growth is more sensitive to deep percolation and upward flows even low levels of deep percolation the under field capacity deep percolation no longer supporting crop growth may sustainably accumulate to a considerable volume kendy et al 2003 2004 provided a method to manage the under field capacity deep percolation and successfully estimated the long term deep percolation occurring in luancheng count of the western north china plain unfortunately it cannot effectively simulate the upper half of a soil moisture profile causing an adverse impact on the simulation of evapotranspiration crop production and awp jones et al 2003 indicated that continuous evapotranspiration can spur upward flows in entering water limited layers containing large roots upward flows can enhance transpiration and benefit crop growth during rainless periods scott et al 2008 guswa 2005 lee et al 2005 quijano and kumar 2015 without water supply for crop growth except for low frequency irrigation and tiny amount of precipitation in arid and semi arid areas with deep groundwater high and continuous evapotranspiration will substantially aggravate upward flows produced and the aggravated upward flows probably should not be neglected in the simulation of awp in this paper a conceptual soil hydrological model considering under field capacity redistribution cshmur was proposed and coupled with the epic crop growth model to investigate the effect of the under field capacity deep percolation and upward flows on the awp estimation for arid and semi arid area with deep groundwater with field data from a typical arid area in northwestern china the coupled awp model cshmur epic model was calibrated and validated and the simulation effects were evaluated in addition in order to explore the practical application in sustainable agricultural water resources management the developed model was used in the simulation of several irrigation scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the model as discussed by pereira et al 2012 the term wp should be used rather than the term water use efficiency wue the total water productivity is the ratio between the achieved yield and the water used to produce that yield agricultural water productivity awp herein refers to the total water productivity of agricultural crops and it can be used at farm scale or regional scale the total water use consists of actual evapotranspiration from crops and deep percolation at field scale at regional scale canal conveyance operational loss is also included in the total water use in addition to the water use at field the developed cshmur epic model is designed to simulate the farm scale awp and can also provide main inputs for regional scale awp estimation at farm scale awp kg m3 is calculated from the following equation 1 a w p y e t a d p where eta is the actual season evapotranspiration where dp is deep percolation and where y is the crop yield kg the dynamic response relationship between soil water content and crop growth is central to assessing and predicting awp in this study the awp model is established by coupling a conceptual soil hydrological model considering under field capacity redistribution cshmur and the epic crop growth model to take full advantage of the characteristics of these two models and to reduce the number of input parameters used under field capacity redistribution is considered in the soil hydrological model by regarding soil water redistribution as the mixing of two separate and sequential water flows downward flows affected by the gradient of gravitational potential and upward flows affected by the gradient of matric potential downward and upward flows are mainly used to simulate deep percolation occurring through redistribution processes and water movements due to evapotranspiration respectively crop growth indicators e g the leaf area index and root depth the epic crop growth model can provide must be input into cshmur and in turn soil moisture levels simulated through cshmur serve as essential input data for the epic crop growth model specifically as the main output parameters of the epic crop growth model the leaf area index and root depth vary in using the leaf area index root depth and soil moisture level as an interface and by applying information exchange on a daily basis these two models are coupled and a model cshmur epic simulating awp for arid and semi arid areas with deep groundwater is developed a schematic diagram of the coupling structure is presented in fig 1 the model code was written in matlab 2014a and requires the use of microsoft excel data to run outputs of actual evapotranspiration eta deep percolation dp and crop yields y generated from the model are used to calculate the total agricultural water productivity awp level kg m3 2 2 soil hydrology in arid and semi arid areas with flat terrain surface runoff on irrigated land can be assumed negligible but processes such as those of infiltration evapotranspiration and redistribution must be considered in relation to soil hydrology infiltration and redistribution processes mentioned in this paper refer to the water movement process before and after all the water entry into soil following a rainfall or irrigation event respectively the division is only for calculation purpose and the water flow simulated in the model is continuous process in deed as the process are simulated step by step and there is no interval between their calculations in redistribution process soil water movement is driven by the gradient of soil water potential which includes gravitational potential and matric potential as numerical solution to richards equation is time consuming and the intrinsic parameters are difficult to measure a conceptual method is explored to simulate flow process in soil water redistribution module water flux q is assumed as the mixing of two hypothetical components water flux q g affected by the gradient of gravitational potential and water flux q m affected by the gradient of matric potential the value of q g is always negative and thus q m accounts for upward flows to minimize computational efforts required q g and q m are calculated separately and sequential for each time step just like the calculation of et and soil water the soil water budget fig 2 equation of a vertical soil column is expressed as follows 2 θ 1 t l 1 θ 1 t 1 l 1 p t i t q i 1 t e 1 t t 1 t q g 1 t q m 1 t 3 i 2 n θ i t l i i 2 n θ i t δ t l i e i t t i t q i i 1 t q i i t q g i 1 t q g i t q m i t q m i 1 t where subscripts t δt and i denote time d the time step 1d and the ith soil layer respectively where n is number of soil layers where l is the thickness of the soil layer considered cm where p and i are precipitation and irrigation respectively cm d where q i i is the water flux cm d out from the bottom of layer i in infiltration process where q g i is the downward flux cm d out from the bottom of layer i affected by the gravitational potential gradient in redistribution process where the sum of q i n and q g n is taken as the occurrence of deep percolation from the simulated soil column and where q m i is the upward flow flux cm d from layer i 1 to layer i affected by the matric potential gradient in redistribution process for areas with deep groundwater the bottom of the soil profile is considered a free drainage boundary and q m n is 0 note that the flow directions of q i and q g are set as downward while that of q m is set as upward therefore q i and q g always have positive values and q m appears to be negative early on and positive later on 2 2 1 infiltration during irrigation and precipitation events water distribution through a soil profile following precipitation or irrigation is simulated with a tipping bucket module riha et al 1994 in the module once precipitation or irrigation occurs water enters the soil immediately the water first enters the uppermost soil layer and then excess water flows to deeper layers when the soil moisture level reaches saturation the process continues in a tipping bucket fashion until each layer is filled to saturation or until all of the water has been distributed any excess water that drains from the lowest layer q i n becomes part of the deep percolation process for the considered time step 2 2 2 evapotranspiration as a form of consumptive water use evapotranspiration is the broadest term used after precipitation and irrigation morillas et al 2013 as transpiration sustains crop growth needs the model partitions evapotranspiration et into evaporation and transpiration to simulate evapotranspiration processes the fao 56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 is used to compute the reference crop potential evapotranspiration et0 mm d value 4 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn is the net radiation flux at the reference grassland alfalfa surface mj m2 d where g is soil heat flux mj m2 d where t is mean air temperature c where u2 is wind speed m s 1 at a height of 2 m where es is saturation vapor pressure kpa where ea is the actual vapor pressure level kpa where δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 and where γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 the potential evapotranspiration of crop etp is calculated as 5 e t p k c e t 0 where kc is the crop coefficient and it is worth noting that kc in this study is not necessarily the same as the crop coefficient in the traditional sense kc as described by allen et al 1998 kc is important for calculating etp for the concerned crop and changes with crop growth sau et al 2004 and dejonge et al 2012 have successfully used the following formula for the calculation of kc 6 k c 1 0 k c max 1 0 l a i l a i max where lai is the leaf area index where lai max is the maximum lai value and where kc max is kc with the largest possible lai a value of 1 1 for kc max is recommended according to the research results of sau et al 2004 and in this paper the kc max value is set to 1 1 the equation defines the etp of bare wet soil with a zero lai value as the same as the etp value of the reference crop et0 0 12 m tall and lai of 2 88 potential evapotranspiration etp includes potential soil evaporation ep and potential transpiration tp the ratio of ep to tp is shaped by the developmental stage that a leaf canopy occupies and it can be expressed as a function of lai ritchie 1972 partitioned etp into ep and tp with the following equation 7 e p e t p exp k b l a i 8 t p e t p e p where kb is the dimensionless canopy extinction coefficient for crops in general ritchie 1972 used a kb value of 0 85 while belmans et al 1983 used a kb value of 0 6 sau et al 2004 found that a value of close to 0 5 may be more adequate for further solar radiation analyses and it was proved to exhibit good performance for the simulation of evapotranspiration biomass and yields lópez cedrón et al 2008 dejonge et al 2012 evaporation can drive water from as deep as 3 m in a profile though most water is removed from surficial areas assuming that transpiration equals to root water uptake loss and transpiration removes water from all layers containing plant roots the potential volume of soil surface water uptake to any root depth is estimated with the function novark 1987 9 u z t p 1 exp δ z z r 1 exp δ where u z is the total water uptake rate cm d from a ground surface to depth z cm where zr is root depth cm and where δ is a water use distribution parameter a δ value of 3 64 is adequate for corn novark 1987 and this value is used for all crops in our model the potential water uptake from layer i can be calculated as the difference between u values at layer boundaries 10 t p i u f i t t p 11 u f i t 1 1 exp δ exp δ z 1 i z r 1 exp δ z 2 i z 1 i z r where z1 i and z2 i are the depth of the upper and lower boundaries of soil layer i respectively t p i is the potential water uptake from layer i u f i t is the water uptake ratio of layer i to the whole root zone and the sum of u f i t values for all layers of the root zone is equal to 1 0 kendy et al 2003 used the same equation to calculate u f i e and to allocate evaporation to soil layers by substituting root depth for soil layer depth and by setting 10 as the δ value and results showed the reasonableness as evaporation is more heavily concentrated close to surface soils than transpiration in this paper the δ value for evaporation was also set as 10 12 e p i u f i e e p where e p i is the potential volume of soil evaporated from layer i and where u f i e is the evaporation fraction of layer i to all soil layers the actual evaporation and transpiration from layer i are closely related to water conditions and can be computed as 13 e a i k r i e p i 14 t a i k s i t p i where e a i and t a i are the actual soil evaporation and transpiration from layer i respectively and where k r i and k s i are the water stress coefficients of evaporation and transpiration respectively the water stress coefficients for each layer are written as the following equations raes et al 2009 15 k r exp 2 5 θ θ f c θ f c θ w p θ θ f c 1 θ θ f c 16 0 k s 1 exp d r e l f s h a p e 1 exp f s h a p e 1 1 17 d rel 1 θ θ w p 1 p θ f c θ w p where θfc and θwp are the volumetric swc at field capacity and the wilting point cm3 cm3 respectively drel 1 is relative water depletion fshape is the shape factor of the ks curve and p is the fraction of readily available soil water relative to the total volume of available soil water 2 2 3 soil water redistribution 2 2 3 1 downward flows affected by the gradient of gravitational potential in redistribution assuming that no incoming or outgoing water fluxes occur other than those produced by a unit gradient at the bottom of a layer outflows from a layer can be expressed according to the conservation of mass as 18 l d θ d t k θ where l is layer thickness cm where θ is the average volumetric swc of the layer cm3 cm3 where t is time d and where k is unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm d the equation is put forward by steenhuis and van der molen 1986 and then is successfully applied to groundwater recharge estimation for western north china plain kendy et al 2003 according to their finding eq 18 can be solved from an exponential relationship between k and θ which involves few parameters such that 19 k θ k s exp α θ s θ θ s θ d where ks is saturated hydraulic conductivity cm3 day where θs is the volumetric swc of a soil layer at saturation cm3 cm3 where θd is the volumetric swc of dry soil cm3 cm3 where the value of θd is half that of θwp allen et al 1998 raes et al 2009 ritchie 1996 sharpley and williams 1990 and where α is an empirical parameter for homogeneous soils α is approximately valued at 13 bresler et al 1978 steenhuis and van der molen 1986 for heterogeneous soils α can be as large as 16 russo and bresler 1980 kendy et al 2003 by substituting eq 18 into eq 19 and by integrating over time step δt the swc of a single layer after infiltration can be obtained 20 θ t θ s θ s θ d α ln α k s δ t l θ s θ d exp α θ s θ t δ t θ s θ d downward flow flux out of a layer over one time step represents the difference between soil water stored as calculated from eq 20 and that measured prior to calculation then calculations shift from the present layer to the underlying layer two conditions of water flux entering into the deeper layer are considered 1 at the start of the time step and 2 at the end of the time step for either condition calculations generate considerable errors especially in precipitation or irrigation day to limit simulation errors soil water content observed at the end of the time step for the two cases are computed separately and the average swc is taken as the eventual swc value of this process as a result the downward flow flux from each layer is calculated for one time step as deep percolation occurs in both infiltration and redistribution processes the total deep percolation in one time step is the sum of the downward flux from the bottom of the soil profile calculated from the tipping bucket module and from the downward flow module 2 2 3 2 upward flows affected by the gradient of matric potential in redistribution in arid and semi arid areas it is common for soil water to flow upward due to low moisture levels in the upper layer soil subroutine upward flows are thus determined to compute changes in volumetric swc resulting from the upward movement of soil water through the profile the upward flow of water from soil layers is calculated based on capillary flow theory jones et al 1986 according to which upward flow is approximated from a normalized soil water diffusion concept based on a daily time step water content is normalized to the swc at the wilting point where an assumption is made that the diffusivity of all soils is d0 the assumed average diffusivity above the swc at the wilting point of two adjacent layers is a function of the normalized swc for all soils ritchie 1996 21 d i d 0 exp β θ i θ w p i 2 θ i 1 θ w p i 1 2 where di is the average diffusivity value cm2 d of layer i and layer i 1 where the swc is above the wilting point where d0 is the diffusivity value cm2 d where the swc reaches the wilting point and where β is an empirical parameter when di is greater than 100 it is limited to 100 cm2 d ritchie 1996 found a d0 value of 0 88 and a β value of 35 4 by fitting data given by rose 1968 suleiman and ritchie 2003 found an exponential relationship between diffusivity and swc and a d0 value of 2 7 and a β value of 27 5 were found when we fitted the data with eq 21 the upward flow flux q m i from layer i 1 to layer i is calculated as 22 q m i d i θ i 1 θ w p i 1 θ i θ w p i 0 5 l i l i 1 when the normalized swc of layer i is greater than that of layer i 1 q m i is a negative value and water moves downward 2 3 crop growth processes the epic erosion productivity impact calculator crop growth model was developed to estimate soil productivity as it is affected by erosion throughout the u s it simulates all crops with one crop growth model using unique parameter values for each crop processes simulated include the leaf area index root growth conversion to biomass the division of biomass into roots the above ground mass and economic yields in the model the phenological development of a crop is based on daily heat unit accumulation patterns a crop starts to grow when the average daily air temperature exceeds the base temperature and it can be harvested when accumulated heat units reach potential heat units required for maturity the interception of solar radiation is estimated as a function of lai which depends on the crop species heat units and crop stress potential biomass and yields are respectively estimated using the concept of biomass energy ratio and harvest index economic yield aboveground biomass potential growth is constrained by the minimum of five stress factors water nitrogen phosphorus temperature and aeration a more detailed description of the epic crop growth model can be found in williams et al 1989 2 4 model performance evaluation method to quantitatively evaluate the model s performance the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse the mean relative error mre and the nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency nse value nash and sutcliffe 1970 moriasi et al 2007 were computed as shown in eqs 23 26 respectively 23 r 2 i 1 n s i s a v e m i m a v e 2 i 1 n s i s a v e 2 i 1 n m i m a v e 2 24 r m s

values i 1 2 n respectively and where save and mave are the averages of the simulated and measured values respectively generating r2 and nse values of closer to 0 and rmse and mre values of approximately 1 shows that the model is performing well positive nse values denote that the model can be applied and the model is inappropriate to use when nse values are far below 0 2 5 experimental data for model testing the yingke irrigation district yid 38 50 38 58 n 100 17 100 34e located in middle oasis of the heihe river basin in northwestern china fig 3 is selected as our case study area it is the third largest irrigation district of the middle oasis and spans 17 4 km from east to west and 14 2 km from south to north covering an area of 192 2 square kilometers at a 1 70 1 1000 natural gradient the terrain in the area is relatively flat and elevations vary between 1456 m and 1600 m from northeast to southwest the local climate of the yid is arid continental annually average temperatures reach 6 5 7 0 c and a minimum of 28 c and a maximum of 33 5 c and average precipitation levels reach 125 mm while the local reference crop evapotranspiration level eto is approximately 1200 mm as a major part of the middle oasis which forms an important grain production base the yid requires approximately 175 million m3 of irrigation water per year accounting for 10 of water requirements of the middle oasis and for more than 90 of water used in the yid in the yid crops grown mainly include corn wheat and vegetables and a few of forest grass and other crops after crop pattern adjustments were made in 2000 shi et al 2011 corn became the main crop grown accounting for 78 of all crops grown in the area for these crops rainfall levels are too low to meet crop water consumption needs and irrigation water mainly originates from heihe river stream flows and is supplemented by groundwater for irrigation purposes the local government and farmers have built a large canal network consisting of one main canal 2 sub main canals 27 secondary canals 173 lateral canals and more than 1000 sub lateral canals the canals span 1119 1 km and most have been lined since the application of water saving practices in 2000 jiang et al 2015 yingke main canal the only main canal in yid diverts water directly from the heihe river and supplements the canal network 2 5 1 field experiment field experiments were carried out at 16 field sites from 2012 to 2013 and a typical field in 2012 fig 3 the 16 field sites s1 s16 distributed across different areas of the yid were arranged based on digital soil land use crop and canal network maps and they covers four soil types from 0 to 80 cm to 80 140 cm silt loam silt loam silt loam sandy loam silt loam loam and loam loam three crop types corn wheat and cabbage and different irrigation volume besides a field covering different soil types was added to our experiment and four points t1 t4 located in this typical field we calls observation points having the same crop types corn and irrigation volume represents four types of soil in 2012 corn was planted in all 16 field sites and in the typical field in 2013 wheat was planted in s5 and s7 and cabbage was grown in s10 among the 16 field sites s2 s5 and s10 were used to represent corn wheat and cabbage respectively which are the main crops grown in the yid soil moisture and crop growth indicators including the leaf area index and dry above ground biomass were recorded every 2 weeks at the 16 field sites and every 1 week at the four observation points of the typical field soil moisture was measured using the time domain reflectometry method and undisturbed soil samples were collected via the cutting ring method using 7 layers of equal thickness to a depth of 140 cm using a malvern laser particle size analyzer called the mastersizer 2000 soil samples were analyzed and soil texture data were obtained for crop growth indicators the leaf area index lai and dry above ground biomass d agb values were measured by accupar lp80 directly and by drying the above ground biomass to a constant weight at 75 c an irrigation schedule and crop growth period table 1 were applied according to recommendations made by the local water conservancy department farmers and a number of researchers 2 5 2 data collection daily meteorological data including those for rainfall maximum and minimum temperature wind speed sunshine duration and relative humidity levels for the zhangye weather station 100 26 e 38 56 n 1482 7 m were downloaded from the china meteorological data service system http cdc nmic cn home do while neglecting spatial variations data collected at the zhangye weather station can be regarded as representative meteorological of the entire area as the station is positioned within the yid fig 3 dozens of groundwater monitoring wells fig 3 were found within and around the yid and groundwater depths monitored by these wells in 2004 were available via inverse distance weighting idw the monitored depth was interpolated and the spatial distribution of groundwater depth in the yid fig 4 was determined for nearly the entire yid groundwater depths in 2004 exceeded 4 m the unrestrained use of groundwater resources has resulted in a gradual decline of the water table in recent years and groundwater depth will continue to increase over the next 10 years chen et al 2016 li et al 2017a therefore the yid can be considered an area with deep groundwater and it is reasonable to omit phreatic water evaporation in the simulation of soil water cycles in 2012 and 2013 to test the model s performance in actual evapotranspiration simulation flux data measured from an eddy correlation system fig 3 were obtained from the western database http www heihedata org c an eddy correlation system was installed at a corn area site close to the s1 and s2 sites and within these sites irrigation schedules used are quite similar the ec data cover the period running from may 30 to september 21 2012 and were processed using edire software developed by the university of edinburgh liu et al 2016 using the bowen ratio equilibrium energy balance closure method consoli and papa 2013 we corrected ec data to improve measurement precision levels 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation soil and crop parameters were calibrated and validated by comparing simulated and measured soil water content swc actual evapotranspiration eta leaf area index lai and dry above ground biomass d bag values from field observations and collected data s5 s7 s10 for 2013 and other field sites for 2012 were used to calibrate soil and crop parameters corn wheat and vegetables and s5 s7 s10 in 2012 were used to validate the calibrated parameters soil and corn growth parameters as only one year data for wheat and cabbage crops were collected crop growth parameters of these two forms were only calibrated and not validated in addition four observation points t1 t2 t3 and t4 located in the typical field were used for supplementary validation in general s2 for 2012 s5 for 2012 and s5 and s10 for 2013 were selected as representative sites of corn wheat and vegetable growth respectively and s2 was used to analyze simulation effects of soil hydrology calibrated values of crop parameters included in the epic crop growth model for corn wheat and cabbage and soil parameters at s2 are shown in tables 2 and 3 respectively as is shown in fig 5 simulations of lai and d bag for corn correspond well with measurements made during calibration and validation for the lai of corn rmse and mre values were measured as 0 429 and 8 2 respectively while r2 and nse values respectively reached 0 877 and 0 846 during calibration rmse and mre values collected during validation were found to be larger than those collected during calibration and r2 and nse values decreased denoting satisfactory performance not fully meeting that of the calibration regarding d bag values for corn during calibration and validation r2 rmse mre and nse were measured as similar at 0 912 2 877 t ha 11 6 and 0 799 during calibration and at 0 920 2 778 t ha 17 7 and 0 902 during validation in addition simulated lai for wheat and cabbage values satisfactorily matched the measured values fig 6 generating r2 values of 0 904 and 0 561 respectively rmse values of 0 397 and 0 715 respectively and nse values of 0 792 and 0 518 respectively the simulated swc values show good agreement with the values measured from various field sites covering four soil types three crop types and different irrigation schedules during calibration and validation figs 7 and 8 fig 9 and table 4 indicated that the model provided good performance in the swc simulation for all the layers in terms of average swc values for the whole profile the statistic suggesting that the simulation effects of whole profile was superior to that of layered 3 2 evaluation of model performance 3 2 1 evapotranspiration the simulated eta at s2 was compared to the measured eta close to s2 with an eddy correlation system for evaluating modeling performance the results show that the simulated eta values are basically consistent with the measured values with the exception of values measured for several days of the initial stage and for rainy days fig 10 evaporation the main component of evapotranspiration in initial stages is very sensitive to water condition located away from eddy correlation system the irrigation schedule of s2 was not exactly the same diverse irrigation practices between in s2 and in the position eddy correlation system located resulted in different water conditions which can be account for the discrepancy of eta in initial stages in general large volumes of invalid data will be generated from measurements of eddy correlation systems in rainy days causing the measured eta values lower than the actual values even so r2 mre and nse results still respectively reached values of 0 519 19 1 and 0 378 for the crop growth period the simulated eta was 631 mm which was similar to the results of other studies taking studies of the zhangye oasis as an example zhao et al 2010 li et al 2012 hochmuth et al 2015 and jiang et al 2015 estimated maize eta values of 618 mm 567 mm 668 mm and 664 699 mm respectively thus evapotranspiration was effectively simulated via the model as the main component of soil hydrology evapotranspiration et plays a key role in agricultural water cycles in agricultural areas evapotranspiration et represents the main source of consumptive water use and it includes the productive consumptive use of water t crop transpiration and the non productive consumptive use of water e soil evaporation pereira et al 2012 the water productivity model separates et into e and t to lessen confounding effects of the non productive consumptive use of water e which is important especially when ground cover is incomplete in initial stages or as a result of sparse planting practices raes et al 2011 daily potential and actual evaporation ep and ea together with potential and actual transpiration tp and ta were calculated using the model and simulation results for s2 for the year 2012 are shown in fig 11 simulation results indicated that water stress limited water consumption and the constrained effect on evaporation and transpiration appeared an apparent difference with ea ep 0 33 and ta tp 0 98 the relatively low non productive consumptive water use ea and high productive consumptive water use ta levels found show that the irrigation schedule used for s2 are reasonable and that irrigation levels have satisfied crop growth demand in the crop growth period the simulated total actual evapotranspiration eta level reached 631 mm and the simulated ta accounted for 80 of it 3 2 2 deep percolation deep percolation was simulated based on tipping bucket module of the infiltration process and the downward flow module of the redistribution process although deep percolation is critical in many soil hydrological settings it seems fair to conclude that this hydrological flux is difficult to measure seyfried et al 2005 in this paper soil water budget was used as an analytical tool to evaluate deep percolation simulation results the components of water budget for the 0 140 cm soil profile at s2 in 2012 are shown in fig 12 it can be find that the simulated soil water storage levels fit well with the measured values and the corresponding statistical indices are shown in table 4 according to the principle of water budget the deep percolation simulated in the awp model is trustworthy because of the well simulated evapotranspiration and soil water storage s2 despite receiving only 113 mm of precipitation in the crop growth period percolated 482 mm of water from the soil profile because too much irrigation water was added to the soil 907 mm jiang et al 2015 estimated that deep percolation of yid under 655 898 mm irrigation level range from 250 to 437 mm from the swap model which is based on numerical solutions to the richards equation as excess water flows from the bottom of the soil profile when irrigation levels exceeds soil profile capacities deep percolation simulated through swap under the 907 mm irrigation level was roughly 470 mm which is very close to our value deep percolation rates increased quickly on days of irrigation and decreased in subsequent days due to water consumption fig 12 according to our simulation results cumulative deep percolation produced in the period swc exceeds field capacity the over field capacity deep percolation was 397 mm and that produced in the period swc is below field capacity the under field capacity deep percolation reached 85 mm the 397 mm simulated over field capacity deep percolation is basically the same as the 350 406 mm total deep percolation estimation of li et al 2017b who simulated deep percolation for maize crops of the zhangye oasis with a traditional conceptual soil hydrological model the simulated 85 mm under field capacity deep percolation was neglected in the traditional conceptual model and accounted for more than 2 3 of precipitation 113 mm thus the under field capacity deep percolation is remarkable and should not be neglected especially in the simulation of awp for arid areas which is in line with the findings of kendy et al 2003 comparisons drawn between these three models show that the cshmur model can overcome the deficiency of traditional conceptual hydrological models in the simulation of under field capacity deep percolation and give an estimation that is as good as the models based on numerical solutions to the richards equation provide 3 2 3 soil water redistribution module that combines downward and upward flows the soil water redistribution module that mixes downward and upward flows is proposed for capturing the continuous redistribution process water flow in redistribution process is assumed as the mixture of two separate and sequential flows downward flows affected by the gravitational potential gradient and upward flows affected by the matric potential gradient the advantages in deep percolation have been discussed in the above section apart from deep percolation water flows caused by matric potential gradient also restrict simulations of soil water redistribution in arid and semi arid areas evapotranspiration spurs upward flows as it attributes to matric potential gradient jones et al 2003 and drought conditions will aggravate the flows produced if there is no gravitational potential gradient the matric potential gradient will be the only driver of water flows and its generation is dependent on water content variations between adjacent layers simulation results implied that water consumed as evaporation or transpiration varies with soil depth and the upper layer has lost more water than the lower layer fig 13 in arid and semi arid areas with deep groundwater soil water cannot be timely supplemented and continuously high levels of evapotranspiration aggravates the matric potential gradient thus driving upward flows that can be effectively used for crop growth of course gravitational potential gradient also changes water storage levels but the consequent variations across different layers were always found to be similar except in a very short period immediately following low irrigation and precipitation this exception only occurs if irrigation or precipitation is not high enough to allow all layers to reach saturated water content levels and can be attributed to the assumption of the tipping bucket infiltration routine in this short period matric potential gradient drives downward flows and even so water flows are mainly simulated from the downward flow module as the flow flux simulated in upward flow module is low relative to that simulated in downward flow module then evapotranspiration spurs matric potential gradient and therefore upward flows are produced as gravitational potential gradient is always downward the flow affected by the matric potential gradient is used to simulate upward flows that evapotranspiration spurs and that s why we refer to this flow as upward flow note that the dynamic of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity levels are considered in the downward flow module while neglected the diffusivity is constant in the upward flow module over one time step in early days following irrigation and precipitation unsaturated hydraulic conductivity changed rapidly and its dynamic change can be reflected since water flow in this period is mainly simulated from the downward flow module in later periods hydraulic conductivity changed so gradually that the dynamic can be neglected in one day although not completely accurate this assumption allowed us to make an approximate estimation with low volumes of precipitation and groundwater supplemented to the root zone upward flows significantly affected crop growth in these areas to realize the effects of upward flows the upward flow module was removed from the cshmur epic model and the corresponding simulation results were compared with those achieved by the unabridged cshmur epic model as is shown in fig 9 and table 4 the upward flow module improved swc simulation effects and especially for the upper half of the soil moisture profile under a certain amount of deep percolation actual evapotranspiration and crop yields determined awp values for arid and semi arid areas with deep groundwater closely related these two components the swc for the upper half of the soil profile is a key factor shaping awp values therefore the upward flow module improving swc simulations of the upper layers can contribute to the awp simulation efficiently the soil water redistribution module combing downward and upward flows can well simulated swc values for all soil layers swc values of the lower half of the soil profile and that of the upper half of the soil profile were found to be highly correlated with deep percolation and actual evapotranspiration and crop yields respectively a conceptual soil hydrological model with this module can be helpful for the simulation of water productivity in arid and semi arid areas with deep groundwater 3 3 simulations in different irrigation scenarios a qualified model used for management should be capable to simulate the dynamic change of the object irrigation schedule in yid was unevenly distributed across space and average irrigation for corn in 2012 reached 607 mm accounting for 67 of s2 seven scenarios involving different irrigation schedules current conditions c average irrigation levels applied the yid a0 80 of average irrigation levels a1 60 of average irrigation levels a2 40 of average irrigation levels a3 20 of average irrigation levels a4 and no irrigation a5 were applied for the simulation of s2 as is shown in fig 14 not only over field capacity deep percolation but also under field capacity deep percolation not considered in most conceptual soil hydrological models varied with irrigation schedules the simulated under field capacity percolation is considerable at normal irrigation conditions and keeps at a low level only if irrigation is too little to arrive at the lowest layer it ranged from 77 mm to 94 mm in scenarios c a1 while from 20 mm to 30 mm in scenarios a2 a5 water storage varied in these irrigation scenarios and thus upward flows benefitting crop growth can be dynamically simulated for these seven irrigation scenarios relative to simulated ta values of 222 502 mm simulated ea varied little from 79 mm to 129 mm the caption of the dynamic changes in the productive consumptive use of water ta and the non productive consumptive use of water ea is a key factor for dynamic awp estimation therefore a model considering the under field capacity deep percolation is helpful in exploring awp to obtain a sustainable agricultural water resources management for arid and semi arid areas with deep groundwater 4 conclusions in this paper a conceptual soil hydrological model considering under field capacity redistribution cshmur was proposed and coupled with the epic crop growth model to estimate awp for rainless area with field data collected in a typical arid area of northwestern china the coupled awp model cshmur epic was calibrated and validated and then the effect of the under field capacity redistribution on the awp simulation results was investigated at last in order to explore the practical application in sustainable agricultural water resources management the developed awp model was used as a tool to simulate the dynamic awp in several irrigation scenarios our main conclusions as follows 1 drought condition substantially aggravate upward flows produced and an upward flow module can efficiently improve simulation effects of swc on the upper half of a soil profile and thus contribute to the estimation of awp for arid and semi arid areas 2 the under field capacity deep percolation is remarkable and should not be neglected in the awp estimation for arid areas according to the proposed model levels reach up to 94 mm with sufficient irrigation accounting for more than 2 3 of the precipitation measured in our study area downward flows embedded in our conceptual soil hydrological model can simulate the under field capacity deep percolation as well as models based on numerical solutions to the richards equation 3 upward flows and under field capacity deep percolation not considered in most conceptual soil hydrological models varied with irrigation schedules and thus a hydrological model considering the under field capacity redistribution has advantages in the exploration of sustainable agricultural water resources management acknowledgments this study was supported by the national natural science

11182,utilization of reclaimed wastewater rww presents an alternative to irrigation of agricultural crops with fresh water fr especially in dry areas characterized by water scarcity while rww often contains considerable amounts of valuable plant nutrients it is also typically characterized by high salt content which can impair agricultural yields and have environmental repercussions the objective of this study was to determine the effect of long term utilization of rww and fertilization practice on soil properties and plant performance we evaluated irrigation and nutrient management of olives with rww versus fr in a long term field experiment two olive cultivars barnea and leccino were subjected to irrigation with rww either with standard or reduced fertilization and irrigation with fr with standard fertilization during the eight years of the experiment considerable amounts of n p and k were delivered with the rww trees irrigated with rww receiving no additional fertilization were not negatively impacted indicating sufficient nutrient allocation by the rww fruit yield was higher in rww treatments compared to the fr probably due to the presence of p in the autumn of each year soil salinity was higher in the reclaimed wastewater compared to the fresh water treatment but this did not lead to increased leaf na or cl concentrations or to reduced tree productivity from an agronomic point of view the lack of response to salinity implies that irrigation of olive with reclaimed wastewater is sustainable as long as precipitation ensures sufficient seasonal leaching of salts however sodium absorption ratio of the soil solution slowly and steadily increased in the reclaimed wastewater treatments resulting in a high exchangeable sodium percentage

municipal use and for agriculture is increasing continuously a result of the growth in population and human prosperity competition for high quality water resources is particularly fierce in water scarce arid and semi arid regions where irrigation is essential to expansion and success of agriculture the need to treat and dispose increased quantities of sewage on one hand and the increased demand for irrigation water on the other hand indicates the importance for effective and sustainable use of reclaimed waste water rww grant et al 2012 muyen et al 2011 while the use of rww in agriculture can help meet the increased requirement for water across the agricultural domestic and industrial sectors levine and asano 2004 irrigation with rww carries both agronomic and environmental risks that require special consideration on the positive side utilization of rww allows recycling of both water and nutrients that otherwise would have been disposed of into the environment and consequently contaminate natural water bodies on the negative side rww tends to contain higher concentrations of plant growth inhibiting ions such as sodium na and chloride cl hamilton et al 2007 raveh and ben gal 2016 high concentration of na in rww relative to those of ca and mg has additional potential hazardous effects due to the elevation of the rww sodium adsorption ratio sar that consequently may degrade soil physical and chemical properties assouline et al 2015 soil sodicity expressed in terms of exchangeable sodium percentage esp induced by high sar in rww may impair soil hydraulic conductivity air permeability and structure mamedov et al 2001 sou et al 2013 and consequently lead to unfavorable environment for root functioning and development paudel et al 2016a qian and mecham 2005 yalin et al 2017 soil sodicity tends to build up in the entire soil profile levy et al 2011 especially in arid and semi arid environments that have high evaporative demand and low natural precipitation and hence tend to accumulate salts muyen et al 2011 an additional negative impact is that groundwater quality in areas irrigated with rww can be degraded due to increased na and cl following their leaching out of the root zone segal et al 2011 rww usually contains considerable amounts of important plant nutrients such as n p and k which can promote plant growth and yield and reduce the demand for chemical fertilizers da fonseca et al 2007 jung et al 2014 rww has also been suggested as a provider of important micronutrients such as fe and zn pereira et al 2012 hence careful utilization of rww can reduce fertilizer application and therefore environmental and economic costs uncontrolled irrigation with rww with additional fertilization however may lead to accumulation of n in the soil rusan et al 2007 and leaching of excess n as nitrate from the root zone to ground or surface water impairing its quality and usability ju et al 2006 in addition rww depending on the level of its treatment may carry human pathogens such as viruses and bacteria and present a health risk when applied incorrectly in agriculture palese et al 2009 toze 2006 rww is highly heterogeneous depending mostly on the raw water arriving to the treatment plant and the reclaiming process levy et al 2011 the effect of rww on tree crop performance varies with species cultivar and specific environmental conditions shalhevet 1994 further making predictions of plant response to rww challenging in grapefruit citrus paradisi macf irrigation with rww was shown to decrease photosynthetic rates and increase photorespiration paudel et al 2016b in vines vitis vinifera and mandarin citrus clementina rww has been shown to have a negative effect attributed to its high salinity and high na concentration on plant performance and yield laurenson et al 2012 pedrero et al 2014 avocado trees persea americana were also reported to decrease in yield when irrigated with rww due to high sar and its adverse effect on aeration in a relatively heavy soil assouline and narkis 2013 contrary to these pessimistic findings olive trees olea europea l irrigated with rww have most often been reported to experience little if any negative effect ayoub et al 2016 bedbabis et al 2010 2015 segal et al 2011 likewise nectarine had no yield decline by rww utilization pedrero et al 2018 and young grapefruit trees grown in south eastern spain had no negative impact in spite of significant increase in soil salinity and leaf salt content pedrero et al 2015 olive trees are considered suitable for irrigation with rww due to their relatively high salt and b tolerance ben gal 2011 the natural habitat of the olive in the mediterranean climate characterized by limited water resources makes it a natural candidate for irrigation with rww hentati et al 2014 furthermore olive fruit are processed before consumption either for table olives or oil thus reducing the risk of transmitting human pathogens into food palese et al 2009 we previously presented a four year field trial studying the effect of irrigation water source fresh water fw or rww and fertilization level standard or reduced on olive tree performance and mineral dynamics segal et al 2011 the results of that experiment suggested no significant effect of water source or fertilizer level on tree growth yield or leaf mineral concentration however irrigation with rww significantly altered solute transport below the root zone loading 1 75 times more cl than fw likewise rww combined with standard fertilizer application resulted in significant accumulation of no3 in the soil during the irrigation season which leached downward following winter rains segal et al 2011 based on the first four years of the study we had concluded that the n and k nutrients allocated with the rww irrigation water should be taken into account and reduced from the added fertilizer dose this management approach was tested in the subsequent four years the objectives of the current study were to investigate i the long term eight years effects of irrigation with rww having high sar on selected soil properties and ii the impact of fertilization practice and water source on olive tree performance we hypothesized that the modified fertilization practices based on the aforementioned initial four year experiment would meet the tree demand for nutrients while minimizing the leaching of nitrate below the root zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted over eight seasons

supplemented with winter flood waters the rww is disinfected and filtered prior to distribution into the irrigation system chemical properties of the two water sources were measured monthly during the irrigation season averages and sd are presented in table 1 2 2 treatments the three treatments included re rww irrigation with standard fertilization re rww irrigation with reduced fertilization that considered the amount of the n and k derived from the rww and fr fw irrigation with standard fertilization recommended local commercial fertilization dose for intensive olive orchards is 200 and 300

no chemical fertilizers at all and rates of re were reduced taking in consideration the n and k allocated with rww i e identical to re of the first period the fr treatment received standard n and k fertilizer application throughout the eight years of the experiment the resulting modification created two levels of n and k re and fr standard fertilization versus re reduced fertilization based completely on the minerals delivered by the rww treatments were also characterized by two p levels 5 5 mg l 1 for treatments re and re versus no p application in fr the standard practice at the time the experiment was established measured application rates for each treatment and season are given in table 2 2 3 experimental layout two olive cultivars barnea and leccino were positioned in adjacent plots in the center of a 25 ha orchard the trees were planted in 2002 and in 2006 the experiment started the orchard was designed for mechanized overhead harvesting with tree density of 900 trees ha 1 super intensive trees were arranged with spacing of 4 5 m between rows and 2 5 m between trees in the same row the experimental site included 36 plots 3 treatments 6 replicates 2 cultivars organized in a randomized block design for each cultivar each plot included 12 trees 3 rows 4 trees in a row with the two middle trees used for measurements and the other ten as border trees irrigation was applied each year from march to october november according to first and last substantial winter rain events irrigation amounts followed standard extension service recommendations for super intensive orchards according to a modified penman monteith reference et multiplied by a periodic crop coefficient in general deficit irrigation low crop coefficients was practiced in order to control tree vigor and allow efficient mechanical harvesting average annual irrigation volume was 548 mm year 1 and varied from 360 to 690 mm year 1 according to the reference et0 and fruit load table s1 for example low irrigation dose 360 370 mm year 1 were applied on 2006 at the beginning of the trial where threes were relatively small and on 2009 a pronounced off year water was applied using an automated drip system with drippers with discharge rate of 2 3 l h 1 spaced every 50 cm on a single lateral in each tree row 2 4 measurements throughout the experiment soil was sampled twice a year in march at the end of the rainy season and before initiation of irrigation spring and in october towards the end of the irrigation period autumn soil samples were taken between the two measured trees adjacent to the drippers from three depths 0 30 cm 30 60 cm and 60 90 cm saturated paste soil solution extract was used for determination of electrical conductivity ec and no3 k na ca mg and cl concentrations soil

exchangeable na and exchangeable k by ammonium acetate thomas 1986 were too measured only towards the end of the experiment esp was then calculated as the ratio of exchangeable na to the cec and exchangeable potassium percentage epp as the ratio of exchangeable k to the cec diagnostic leaves youngest fully expanded were sampled from each measured tree once a year in july following the

re and re received 2 9 and 2 3 times more na and cl respectively in comparison to fr irrigated trees calcium and mg concentrations were roughly 50 higher in the rww compare to fr the sar of the rww was 5 1 compared to just 2 1 in the fr in both types of irrigation water ph was similar at around 7 5 7 7 there was considerable difference between rww and fresh water in n p and k concentrations nitrogen no3 plus nh4 and k concentrations were nearly 10 times higher in rww than the fw while p concentration in rww was 5 5 mg l 1 compare to practically zero in fr table 1 nutrients were either derived from the irrigation water or added as n and k fertilizers considering the fertilization practice for intensive olives in this region 200 kg n ha 1 and 300 kg k ha 1 a considerable proportion of the recommended nutrients originated from the rww on an average 55 of the total recommended n dose and 58 the total recommended k dose were supplied by the rww while fw included only a minor amount of these nutrients phosphorus was found only in the re and re treatments originating from the rww while the fr did not contain any p table 2 at the time that this experiment was designed and initiated olives were not commonly or regularly fertilized with p hence re and re treatments received a considerable amount of p 30 1 kg ha 1 year 1 due to the high concentration of this nutrient in the rww while the fr treatment did not receive any form of p during the entire experiment during the second period 2010 2013 chemical fertilization rate was reduced for the rww treatments so that re received no additional chemical fertilizer and re received less than half of the recommended dose as supplementary fertilization table 2 3 2 nutrient dynamics in soil 3 2 1 soil no3 and k fig 2 illustrates the effect of soil sampling season spring autumn and experiment period 2006 2009 high fertilization and 2010 2013 modified fertilization on soil n and k for the two cultivars averaged across the soil profile 0 90 cm the effect of the individual treatments in the first period was presented in a preliminary study segal et al 2011 for all comparisons variability was large and treatments did not differ significantly to investigate the effect of the modified fertilization the rww treatments were combined fr treatment was omitted since fertilization doze was not modified in the second period in contrast to high and varied levels of no3 soil n nh4 concentrations averaged only roughly 3 mg l 1 data not shown across treatments and cultivars in general nutrient concentrations tended to increase from spring to autumn with pronounced amplitude for the anionic no3 fig 2 compared to k the modification of fertilization strategy in the second period was well manifested in the soil n levels for both cultivars subsequent to the reduction in n fertilization in treatments re and re soil no3 concentrations decreased significantly in autumn compared to the first period in spring soil n was comparable for the two periods and for both cultivars as for soil k in spring for the two cultivars the concentration in the first period was significantly higher than the second period 8 9 compared to 14 mg l 1 for the first and second period respectively in autumn soil k was 17 18 mg l 1 in the first period and was somewhat lower in the second period 12 14 mg l 1 insignificant 3 2 2 soil extractable p soil extractable p olsen was measured towards the end of the experiment in the spring of 2013 considerably higher p levels in the upper 30 cm were found in rww treatments in comparison to the fr treatment in both cultivars fig 3 below 30 cm no significant treatment effect was noted and olsen p levels were particularly low 1 5 3 5 mg kg 1 across treatments and depths olsen p levels were consistently higher in the barnea compared to the leccino plot 3 2 3 soil na and cl the soil salinity was affected by water source fw or rww and by season spring or autumn the fertilization dose reduced re or standard re had no effect and thus the two rww treatments were combined in fig 4 the two plots barnea and leccino were comparable and therefore only data for the barnea are presented in fig 4a while the data for the leccino can be found in fig s1 chloride was the dominant soil solution ion and found to be strongly correlated to ec in saturated paste ece table s2 after 2008 ece of the rww treated soils was consistently higher than that in soils from the fr treatment average ece in autumn of the entire experiment was 4 78 and 3 66 ds m 1 for the rww and the fr respectively significant difference p 0 0008 however in the spring ece was similar for all treatments with the exception of spring 2013 leccino average spring ece for the entire experiment was 2 48 and 1 95 ds m 1 for the rww and fr treatments respectively not significant p 0 05 this illustrates that winter precipitation led to leaching of substantial amount of salts below the root zone specifically in the rww soil clearly precipitation volume played a central role in years with high rainfall e g 2012 2013 ece in the spring was low and similar for the two water sources on the contrary in years with low rainfall e g 2009 and 2011 ece in the spring was higher especially in the rww fig 4a average na concentration in the soil saturated paste solution was 408 for rww and 238 mg l 1 for the fr treatment throughout the entire experiment as described for ece soil na concentration of the rww treatments were higher in autumn each year in comparison to the fr treatment soil na concentration in the autumn of 2008 2010 2011 and 2012 was significantly higher for rww in the spring differences between the two water sources were less pronounced fig 4b average concentration of ca and mg in the soil solution throughout the experiment were similar for all treatments table s3 and not significantly affected by water source in the rww na was the most dominant cation in the soil solution with concentration approximately double that of ca the second most abundant cation the considerable high concentration of na in the soil compared to ca and mg in the rww treatments resulted in higher soil sar average sar values for the entire experiment for both cultivars were 6 95 and 5 08 mmol l 1 0 5 for the rww and fr treatments respectively significant difference p 0 0001 soil sar values in the rww treatments rose gradually from 3 9 in the spring of 2006 to above 8 0 mmol l 1 0 5 towards the end of the experiment the sar values in soil of the fr treatment increased only slightly from 3 9 to 5 0 mmol l 1 0 5 over the course of the experiment fig 4c the observed increase in the sar of the soil solution could not be linked to changes in the sar of the rww and fw as no significant increase in the sar of both water types over the entire duration of the experiment were measured fig s2 it should further be noted that compared with the observed gradual increase in sar over the experiment period especially in the rww treatments changes in ec were mainly seasonal and no long term trend in the ec was observed towards the end of the experiment exchangeable k percentage epp and exchangeable na percentage esp were measured no significant effect was found in epp with average levels of 3 6 for barnea and 2 6 for leccino soils regardless of treatment table s4 the measured sar and esp values were consistently and significantly higher in the rww treated soils at 0 60 cm depth fig 5 the soil samples taken between rows allowed us to evaluate the effect of irrigation on soil esp the esp levels were similar for the fr treatment and the unirrigated soil and significantly lower in the top 60 cm than those in the rww treatment at the end of the experiment average soil profile esp was 14 for the rww treatments compared to 7 5 for the fr treatment fig 5 table s4 3 3 leaf mineral content leaf mineral concentration was determined in july every year the main macronutrients n p and k are presented in table 3 the remaining minerals mg ca na and cl are presented in table s5 and trace elements are presented in table s6 3 3 1 nitrogen phosphorus and potassium throughout the experiment no significant treatment effect on n leaf concentration was measured during the second period 2009 2013 even when no n fertilizer was applied treatment re trees maintained n levels similar to re and fr table 3 furthermore leaf n concentration tended to increase in the second period and never dropped below the commonly accepted deficiency threshold level of 1 4 fernández escobar 2010 leaf p was consistently found above its reported deficiency threshold of 0 1 fernández escobar 2010 in all treatments and cultivars during the first 4 years of the experiment p level was comparable between treatments during the following period 2009 2013 treatments had significant impact on leaf p table 3 on average re leaves had the highest p concentration about 10 more than re and fr in both cultivars although re and re treatments received similar p levels re had occasionally lower leaf p concentration in both cultivars significant for barnea in 2008 2013 and 2014 and for leccino in 2011 2014 in fact re leaves had p levels comparable to those in the fr treatment that did not receive any p for eight years leaf k was always above the sufficiency threshold of 0 8 table 3 leaf k notably increased in both cultivars and treatments during the second period but showed no treatment effect throughout the entire experiment leccino leaves had consistently and substantially higher k values and generally higher concentrations of n p cl and na compared to those in the barnea cultivar regardless of treatment table 3 and table s5 leaf cl na ca mg and micronutrientsleaf cl was not affected by the different treatments and yet was substantially higher in the leccino compare to the barnea average leaf cl was 0 26 and 0 19 for leccino and barnea respectively table s5 no significant difference in leaf na concentration was found for treatments over the entire experiment leaf na concentration was also generally higher in leccino compared to barnea with average values of 0 024 and 0 019 respectively table s5 for a given cultivar we found no trend in na and cl accumulation with time across treatments and cultivars leaf cl concentration was 0 23 0 04 in the first period and 0 22 0 04 in the second period leaf na did not change between the two periods table s5 leaf ca concentration was not affected by treatment throughout the experiment in either cultivar leaf ca concentration was higher in the leccino compared to the barnea with average values of 1 61 and 1 42 respectively in both cultivars regardless of treatment there was a significant reduction in leaf ca concentration in the second period 2010 2013 in comparison to 2006 2009 leaf mg concentration was not affected by the treatments in either cultivar leaf mg concentration was slightly higher in the barnea in comparison to the leccino table s5 leaf micronutrients b fe cu mn and zn were not affected by treatments in both cultivars while b fe and mn exhibited reduced concentrations from the first to the second period table s6 leaf b fe and mn tended to be higher in barnea while leaf zn was higher in leccino 3 4 plant growth and yield vegetative tree growth as reflected by the relative annual increase in trunk circumference was variable probably a result of fruit load e g in 2008 highest yield and lowest annual growth growth did not differ significantly between treatments in either cultivar until the last season 2012 2013 in the final year of the experiment fr trees of both varieties had greater trunk growth compared to re trees fig 6 a and b overall trunk growth for the entire experiment was greater in leccino compared to barnea regardless of treatment fig 6 for both cultivars growth was highest in the fr treatment yet the effect was statistically significant for the leccino only fig 6c while in any individual season fruit yield was not significantly different among treatments total yield of the barnea trees for the entire 8 years of the experiment was significantly higher in the re and re treatments in comparison to the fr treatment the positive effect of the rww compared to fr on barnea yield was small but consistent in seven of the eight years of study this was not the case for the leccino trees for which no treatment effect on yield was found fig 7 total yield was about 30 higher in the barnea compared to the leccino regardless of treatment while the barnea trees produced fruits each year of the experiment leccino trees have high chilling requirements and failed to flower and bear fruit in the years 2009 2010 and 2013 fig 7b fruit oil content was not affected by treatment however it did differ between cultivars with the barnea having 22 and the leccino 18 data not shown therefore oil yield followed the same trend as fruit yield in the barnea oil yield was 13 higher in the rww treatments in comparison to the fr treatment for the leccino no significant difference in oil yield was measured between treatments average oil yield for all treatments was 40 higher in barnea in comparison to leccino fig 7e f 4 discussion in the current study bearing olive trees of the cultivars barnea and leccino were irrigated with either fresh water or reclaimed wastewater for a period of eight years the trees that were irrigated with rww received either standard or reduced amount of fertilizer n and k application following the first four years we found substantial leaching of no3 below the root zone and concluded that the then standard fertilization of rww was excessive segal et al 2011 hence the fertilization in the rww was modified in this paper we aimed to evaluate the long term effect of irrigation with rww on soil chemical properties and to evaluate the effect of the modified fertilizer management on olive tree performance the effect of water source on microbial activities in this experimental platform was described in frenk et al 2015 the potential negative effect of rww re and re treatments arose from three main factors i high concentrations of salts osmotic effect ii high na and cl concentration risk of toxicity and iii accumulation of na in the soil profile that eventually may impair soil chemical and physical properties soil sodicity sodicity may lead to poor soil structure and reduced hydraulic conductivity which is specifically detrimental to rain low electrolyte infiltration levy et al 2011 in avocado the accumulated effect of rww irrigation has been shown to lead to lower soil hydraulic conductivity which consequentially likely impairs aeration and root functioning yalin et al 2017 4 1 soil salinity the experimental site is located in a semi arid environment where potential evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation average annual reference evapotranspiration during the experiment was over 1500 mm while average precipitation and irrigation rates were 433 and 548 mm year 1 respectively considering a cover factor of around 50 and that not all the winter precipitation is expected to be available and utilized by the trees the irrigation regime can be characterized as deficit similar to recommendations for optimized olive oil cultivation ben gal et al 2011 including specifically for super intensive layouts fernández et al 2013 grattan et al 2006 under deficit irrigation leaching of minerals is minimal and thus during the summer salts accumulate in the root zone in the winter precipitation exceeds the et and hence minerals are leached downwards this pattern was evidenced in the current study for soil water no3 k na and cl that accumulated during the irrigation season and diminished in the winter additionally during the experiment two interesting trends were observed 1 the amplitude of salt accumulation increased with time and 2 the amplitude of no3 and k accumulation decreased during the second period following the decrease in fertilization dose in the rww olive is considered a moderately tolerant plant species concerning salinity and the estimated threshold expressed as ece for yield reduction is 3 6 ds m 1 maas and hoffman 1977 barnea is considered to be a particularly salt tolerant cultivar rewald et al 2011 whose growth and yield is not negatively impacted by salinity rewald et al 2011 weissbein et al 2008 even when irrigated with saline water of 4 2 ds m 1 but allowing regular leaching by irrigation water in the current experiment irrigation water salinity of the rww was only 1 7 ds m 1 but the deficit practice allowed minimal if any leaching during the irrigation season hence the ece late in the irrigation season reached a range of 5 7 ds m 1 compared to 4 ds m 1 for the fr treatment considering the expected actual soil water content levels the actual ec in the root zone is estimated to be 2 3 times higher than the saturated paste extract ec ben gal et al 2016 richards 1969 the ece value was closely and linearly related to cl and na accumulation in the soil table s2 in a controlled experiment examining the effect of root zone salinity on barnea trees inhibition of vegetative growth was measured at prolonged ece as low as 2 8 ds m 1 however reduction in fruit yield was evidenced only when ece was greater than 6 ds m 1 ben gal et al 2016 in accordance we found slight reduction in vegetative growth in response to irrigation with rww but no reduction in yield was measured in olive trees salt accumulates in the fine roots and is effectively excluded from the shoots soda et al 2017 salinity stress can cause an increase in root respiration jacoby et al 2011 it was previously shown that leccino had double the root respiration rate compared to barnea trees when irrigated with high salinity water hill et al 2013 therefore it is possible that in the current experiment leccino trees irrigated with rww allocated more carbon for root respiration compared to barnea trees due to salt exclusion leaf na and cl concentrations were low and were not affected by the water source indicating no foliar damage caused by salinity the average leaf cl concentration was steady and low throughout the experiment below the reported toxicity threshold of 0 5 fernández escobar 2010 similarly na accumulation in leaves was low 0 020 0 027 way below the accepted toxicity threshold of 0 2 and was not affected by water source or time table s5 hence the common diagnosis tools along with growth and yield parameters indicate that the salinity level in the orchard had only minor negative effects on olive performance occurring at the root level and expressed by slight above ground growth inhibition we can therefore conclude that the osmotic and toxic aspects of rww utilization had only a minor effect on olive performance under the environmental conditions and particularly precipitation rates and patterns at our site these conclusions confirm previous studies on olive response to rww ayoub et al 2016 bedbabis et al 2010 bourazanis et al 2016b segal et al 2011 utilization of rww for irrigation of more sensitive fruit trees such as grapevines laurenson et al 2012 citrus nicolás et al 2016 paudel et al 2016a b and avocado yalin et al 2017 resulted in significant negative impact on tree performance 4 2 soil sodicity domestic use of water significantly elevates na concentration in the waste water but has little impact on ca and mg concentrations hence typical rww in israel has sar 4 e g levy et al 2011 in the current study sar of the rww was 5 1 mmol l 1 0 5 the sar value in saturated soil paste increased significantly over the duration of the experiment yet with some seasonal fluctuations from 3 9 to a level of 8 similarly the average esp in the soil profile to a depth of 90 cm in the rww treatment 14 was nearly twice that in the fr treatment 7 5 the high average esp levels and especially those at the 30 60 cm layer in both treatments were higher than expected according to the extensively used empirical sar esp relation developed by the us salinity laboratory richards 1969 levy et al 2011 proposed that such a deviation of the actual esp values from the expected ones could stem from the absence of equilibrium in the soil profile between the sar of the irrigation water the sar of the soil solution and soil esp which could lead to greater than expected adsorption of na to the soil sposito and mattigod 1977 it is suggested that the use of deficit irrigation coupled with insufficient leaching of the soil profile during the rainy season led to the buildup of sodicity in the soil profile to levels much higher than expected based solely on the sar of the irrigation water it has been recognized for quite some time that esp 5 separates between soils with a non sodic to a soil with a sodic type characteristics and behavior shainberg and letey 1984 buildup of sodicity in the soil profile to the levels observed in the current study clearly indicate that both irrigation regimes resulted in creating sodic conditions in the soil profile however the similarity in the sodicity profile of the fr treatment and the non irrigated soil fig 5 suggests that irrigation with fw did not cause a significant change in the soil natural conditions with respect to sodicity however the very high levels of sodicity obtained after rww irrigation could lead to enhanced clay swelling and dispersion aggregate destabilization impaired water movement in the soil profile aeration problems and accumulation of salts these processes are expected to occur mainly in the winter rather than during the irrigation season because then the soil is leached with rain water i e water with very low electrolyte concentration and the sensitivity of the soil clay to swelling and dispersion is much higher shainberg and letey 1984 as is the susceptibility of aggregates to destabilization levy et al 2003 in addition the negative impact of sodicity increases with the increase in clay content levy and mamedov 2002 the clay content in our experimental site was 51 56 putting our soil in the range of soils with high sensitivity to sodicity effects sensitivity to soil sodicity is also crop specific levy et al 2011 in avocado grown in a clay soil for example esp of 6 was suggested as the cause for diminished oxygen availability to roots and thus for damaging root development yalin et al 2017 conversely in olives esp of 20 was suggested as a threshold value above which tree function and development is impaired freeman and carlson 1994 in our experiment where average soil esp was 14 growth yield and leaf diagnosis indicated that rww utilization offers a sustainable approach for olive production yet it would be ill advised to ignore the buildup of sodic conditions in the soil profile following long term irrigation with rww as sustainable crop production comprise also the prevention of degradation in soil properties 4 3 tree and soil response to n and k fertigation rate evaluation of olive tree response to mineral nutrition was enabled by the manipulation and modification of fertigation application rates in the second phase of the experiment the re treatment received considerably less 35 40 n and k than the re and fr treatments table 2 in spite of this no significant decrease in leaf n or k concentration in the re treatment was observed in either of the two cultivars table 3 furthermore accumulated fruit yield was highest for the re treatment this suggests that trees receiving the re treatment did not experience any significant nutrient deficiency the major effect of the reduced fertilization in the second phase was considerable diminishment of no3 and k in the soil profile across cultivars and treatments average autumn soil no3 concentration was reduced from 113 mg l 1 at the first stage to 42 mg l 1 in the second stage in accordance with the low n application rate 124 kg ha 1 lowest no3 values were found for the re 22 mg l 1 treatments re and fr received a comparable n dose 200 kg ha 1 and autumn soil no3 level reached 52 mg l 1 the lack of plant response to the reduced n and k fertilization combined with the significant reduction in n accumulation during the irrigation season implies that any n applied at rates over 124 kg ha 1 was simply leached downwards out of the root zone during the winter in the reduced fertilization practice n uptake efficiency increased and the environmental impact minimized without impairing plant performance this implies that at least for the environmental conditions of the experiment commercial recommended n application rates were excessive this is specifically important for olive cultivation as n over fertilization has been shown to impair both productivity erel et al 2013b fernandez escobar et al 2008 and oil quality dag et al 2009a erel et al 2013a fernández escobar et al 2006 while plant growth in our study was slightly reduced yield was not effected in the leccino variety and was increased for barnea as a result of irrigation with rww previous studies have shown similar results where irrigation with effluent did not affect yields ayoub et al 2016 bedbabis et al 2010 2015 lopez et al 2006 segal et al 2011 a positive yield response to rww was also recently reported in a study on the olive cultivar koroneiki bourazanis et al 2016a which similar to barnea is considered moderately tolerant to salinity chartzoulakis 2005 our results demonstrate that utilization of rww may provide most if not all of the nutrients required for productive olive trees this is in accordance with the data analysis of hadas and kislev 2010 who estimated that for fruit trees in general 88 of the demand for n and 112 of the demand for k can be supplied by typical rww the authors estimated the economic benefit of the reduced fertilization at 528 ha 1 hadas and kislev 2010 we suggest caution when evaluating the potential contribution of rww as nutrient concentrations tend to be unstable depending on source sewage water treatment processes and time nitrogen concentration in rww used for irrigation may vary from as low as 5 up to 60 mg l 1 feigin et al 1991 hence actual total n allocated with rww could range from below to well in excess of crop demand bar tal et al 2011 in israel typical mineral n concentration in rww used for irrigation of citrus is 23 mg l 1 bar tal et al 2011 comparable to the average in this experiment 4 4 phosphorus nutrition in several fruit trees including olives p fertilization is recommended only following observation of deficiency symptoms or low leaf concentrations fernández escobar 2010 lópez villalta and muñoz cobo 1996 olive trees tend to have mychorryzal symbiosis in their root system which contribute dramatically to p acquisition dag et al 2009b porras soriano et al 2009 therefore most orchards are not fertilized with p and rely solely on p reserves similar to the practice in the fr treatment in the current study leaf p concentration of the fr treatment never dropped below the acknowledged deficiency threshold of 0 1 in leaves fernández escobar 2010 in rww a large proportion of p is in its inorganic form bar yosef 2011 and hence is relatively available for uptake by plants indeed extractable p accumulated in the top soil layer was about double in our rww irrigated plots compared to that found in the fr irrigated soil below 30 cm extractable p levels were identical for rww and fr indicating immobility and lack of leaching following the eight years of regular p application the depth of p leaching in soil is negatively related to clay content bar yosef 1999 and the clay content in the experimental site was very high in sandy soils irrigated with rww p transport in the soil profile was found to be significantly enhanced bar yosef 2011 in the fr soil olsen p values were comparable to the non irrigated soil between the tree rows and no depletion was noted apparently these low p values were maintained by the natural p cycle including contributions due to the farmer s practice to shred pruned branches onsite in accordance with the olsen p levels in the second period leaf p in the re was significantly higher than fr surprisingly leaf p in re was similar to that for fr even while fr received a lower p dose causing lower olsen p in soil the enhanced p availability in the rww treatment was associated with significant increase in fruit and oil yield recent studies have shown that p availability plays a major role in olive flowering and fruit set erel et al 2013b 2016 possibly trees of the fr treatment compensated the zero rate of p fertilizer application through enhanced mycorrhizal activity despite their positive effect on nutrient acquisition mycorrhiza exert a cost on the plant s carbon budget douds et al 1988 lynch and ho 2005 this offers an additional possible explanation for the lower total yield observed in the barnea fr treatment 5 conclusion the ever growing demand for food and water is driving towards utilization of wastewater in agriculture our results reaffirm the need to consider nutrients provided with the rww in fertilization management under our specific experimental environmental conditions tree requirements for nutrients were successfully supplied by the minerals present in the rww without need for additional fertilization we arrive at two main deductions regarding nutrition management i common fertilization practice typically leads to n over fertilization and ii p nutrition is underestimated these conclusions are well in agreement with former field and controlled studies e g erel et al 2013b fernández escobar et al 2009 nitrogen over fertilization may lead to impaired product quality reduced yield and cause significant no3 transport to groundwater while balanced n management minimizes n losses with no negative impact on yield salinity and soil sodicity are major considerations in rww utilization under the environmental and management conditions of the current study salinity seemed to have minor if any effect on overall performance however continuous elevation of soil sar and accumulation of na in soil exchange sites is of great concern as it may indicate slow but consistent degradation of soil physical properties these long term hazards were not manifested in the duration of the current study but the trend is alarming we therefore conclude that utilization of rww should be accompanied with routine close monitoring of soil sodicity to avoid soil degradation and allow

11182,utilization of reclaimed wastewater rww presents an alternative to irrigation of agricultural crops with fresh water fr especially in dry areas characterized by water scarcity while rww often contains considerable amounts of valuable plant nutrients it is also typically characterized by high salt content which can impair agricultural yields and have environmental repercussions the objective of this study was to determine the effect of long term utilization of rww and fertilization practice on soil properties and plant performance we evaluated irrigation and nutrient management of olives with rww versus fr in a long term field experiment two olive cultivars barnea and leccino were subjected to irrigation with rww either with standard or reduced fertilization and irrigation with fr with standard fertilization during the eight years of the experiment considerable amounts of n p and k were delivered with the rww trees irrigated with rww receiving no additional fertilization were not negatively impacted indicating sufficient nutrient allocation by the rww fruit yield was higher in rww treatments compared to the fr probably due to the presence of p in the autumn of each year soil salinity was higher in the reclaimed wastewater compared to the fresh water treatment but this did not lead to increased leaf na or cl concentrations or to reduced tree productivity from an agronomic point of view the lack of response to salinity implies that irrigation of olive with reclaimed wastewater is sustainable as long as precipitation ensures sufficient seasonal leaching of salts however sodium absorption ratio of the soil solution slowly and steadily increased in the reclaimed wastewater treatments resulting in a high exchangeable sodium percentage 14 reaching nearly double that of the fresh water treatment the latter observations highlight the likelihood for adverse effects of long term irrigation with reclaimed wastewater on the deterioration

electrical conductivity ece electrical conductivity in saturated soil paste keywords reclaimed wastewater olive irrigation soil salinity soil sodicity 1 introduction global demand for water for municipal use and for agriculture is increasing continuously a result of the growth in population and human prosperity competition for high quality water resources is particularly fierce in water scarce arid and semi arid regions where irrigation is essential to expansion and success of agriculture the need to treat and dispose increased quantities of sewage on one hand and the increased demand for irrigation water on the other hand indicates the importance for effective and sustainable use of reclaimed waste water rww grant et al 2012 muyen et al 2011 while the use of rww in agriculture can help meet the increased requirement for water across the agricultural domestic and industrial sectors levine and asano 2004 irrigation with rww carries both agronomic and environmental risks that require special consideration on the positive side utilization of rww allows recycling of both water and nutrients that otherwise would have been disposed of into the environment and consequently contaminate natural water bodies on the negative side rww tends to contain higher concentrations of plant growth inhibiting ions such as sodium na and chloride cl hamilton et al 2007 raveh and ben gal 2016 high concentration of na in rww relative to those of ca and mg has additional potential hazardous effects due to the elevation of the rww sodium adsorption ratio sar that consequently may degrade soil physical and chemical properties assouline et al 2015 soil sodicity expressed in terms of exchangeable sodium percentage esp induced by high sar in rww may impair soil hydraulic conductivity air permeability and structure mamedov et al 2001 sou et al 2013 and consequently lead to unfavorable environment for root functioning and development paudel et al 2016a qian and mecham 2005 yalin et al 2017 soil sodicity tends to build up in the entire soil profile levy et al 2011 especially in arid and semi arid environments that have high evaporative demand and low natural precipitation and hence tend to accumulate salts muyen et al 2011 an additional negative impact is that groundwater quality in areas irrigated with rww can be degraded due to increased na and cl following their leaching out of the root zone segal et al 2011 rww usually contains considerable amounts of important plant nutrients such as n p and k which can promote plant growth and yield and reduce the demand for chemical fertilizers da fonseca et al 2007 jung et al 2014 rww has also been suggested as a provider of important micronutrients such as fe and zn pereira et al 2012 hence careful utilization of rww can reduce fertilizer application and therefore environmental and economic costs uncontrolled irrigation with rww with additional fertilization however may lead to accumulation of n in the soil rusan et al 2007 and leaching of excess n as nitrate from the root zone to ground or surface water impairing its quality and usability ju et al 2006 in addition rww depending on the level of its treatment may carry human pathogens such as viruses and bacteria and present a health risk when applied incorrectly in agriculture palese et al 2009 toze 2006 rww is highly heterogeneous depending mostly on the raw water arriving to the treatment plant and the reclaiming process levy et al 2011 the effect of rww on tree crop performance varies with species cultivar and specific environmental conditions shalhevet 1994 further making predictions of plant response to rww challenging in grapefruit citrus paradisi macf irrigation with rww was shown to decrease photosynthetic rates and increase photorespiration paudel et al 2016b in vines vitis vinifera and mandarin citrus clementina rww has been shown to have a negative effect attributed to its high salinity and high na concentration on plant performance and yield laurenson et al 2012 pedrero et al 2014 avocado trees persea americana were also reported to decrease in yield when irrigated with rww due to high sar and its adverse effect on aeration in a relatively heavy soil assouline and narkis 2013 contrary to these pessimistic findings olive trees olea europea l irrigated with rww have most often been reported to experience little if any negative effect ayoub et al 2016 bedbabis et al 2010 2015 segal et al 2011 likewise nectarine had no yield decline by rww utilization pedrero et al 2018 and young grapefruit trees grown in south eastern spain had no negative impact in spite of significant increase in soil salinity and leaf salt content pedrero et al 2015 olive trees are considered suitable for irrigation with rww due to their relatively high salt and b tolerance ben gal 2011 the natural habitat of the olive in the mediterranean climate characterized by limited water resources makes it a natural candidate for irrigation with rww hentati et al 2014 furthermore olive fruit are processed before consumption either for table olives or oil thus reducing the risk of transmitting human pathogens into food palese et al 2009 we previously presented a four year field trial studying the effect of irrigation water source fresh water fw or rww and fertilization level standard or reduced on olive tree performance and mineral dynamics segal et al 2011 the results of that experiment suggested no significant effect of water source or fertilizer level on tree growth yield or leaf mineral concentration however irrigation with rww significantly altered solute transport below the root zone loading 1 75 times more cl than fw likewise rww combined with standard fertilizer application resulted in significant accumulation of no3 in the soil during the irrigation season which leached downward following winter rains segal et al 2011 based on the first four years of the study we had concluded that the n and k nutrients allocated with the rww irrigation water should be taken into account and reduced from the added fertilizer dose this management approach was tested in the subsequent four years the objectives of the current study were to investigate i the long term eight years effects of irrigation with rww having high sar on selected soil properties and ii the impact of fertilization practice and water source on olive tree performance we hypothesized that the modified fertilization practices based on the aforementioned initial four year experiment would meet the tree demand for nutrients while minimizing the leaching of nitrate below the root zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted over eight seasons

the experiment was established measured application rates for each treatment and season are given in table 2 2 3 experimental layout two olive cultivars barnea and leccino were positioned in adjacent plots in the center of a 25 ha orchard the trees were planted in 2002 and in 2006 the experiment started the orchard was designed for mechanized overhead harvesting with tree density of 900 trees ha 1 super intensive trees were arranged with spacing of 4 5 m between rows and 2 5 m between trees in the same row the experimental site included 36 plots 3 treatments 6 replicates 2 cultivars organized in a randomized block design for each cultivar each plot included 12 trees 3 rows 4 trees in a row with the two middle trees used for measurements and the other ten as border trees irrigation was applied each year from march to october november according to first and last substantial winter rain events irrigation amounts followed standard extension service recommendations for super intensive orchards according to a modified penman monteith reference et multiplied by a periodic crop coefficient in general deficit irrigation low crop coefficients was practiced in order to control tree vigor and allow efficient mechanical harvesting average annual irrigation volume was 548 mm year 1 and varied from 360 to 690 mm year 1 according to the reference et0 and fruit load table s1 for example low irrigation dose 360 370 mm year 1 were applied on 2006 at the beginning of the trial where threes were relatively small and on 2009 a pronounced off year water was applied using an automated drip system with drippers with discharge rate of 2 3 l h 1 spaced every 50 cm on a single lateral in each tree row 2 4 measurements throughout the experiment soil was sampled twice a year in march at the end of the rainy season and before initiation of irrigation spring and in october towards the end of the irrigation period autumn soil samples were taken between the two measured trees adjacent to the

was 5 1 compared to just 2 1 in the fr in both types of irrigation water ph was similar at around 7 5 7 7 there was considerable difference between rww and fresh water in n p and k concentrations nitrogen no3 plus nh4 and k concentrations were nearly 10 times higher in rww than the fw while p concentration in rww was 5 5 mg l 1 compare to practically zero in fr table 1 nutrients were either derived from the irrigation water or added as n and k fertilizers considering the fertilization practice for intensive olives in this region 200 kg n ha 1 and 300 kg k ha 1 a considerable proportion of the recommended nutrients originated from the rww on an average 55 of the total recommended n dose and 58 the total recommended k dose were supplied by the rww while fw included only a minor amount of these nutrients phosphorus was found only in the re and re treatments originating from the rww while the fr did not contain any p table 2 at the time that this experiment was designed and initiated olives were not commonly or regularly fertilized with p hence re and re treatments received a considerable amount of p 30 1 kg ha 1 year 1 due to the high concentration of this nutrient in the rww while the fr treatment did not receive any form of p during the entire experiment during the second period 2010 2013 chemical fertilization rate was reduced for the rww treatments so that re received no additional chemical fertilizer and re received less than half of the recommended dose as supplementary fertilization table 2 3 2 nutrient dynamics in soil 3 2 1 soil no3 and k fig 2 illustrates the effect of soil sampling season spring autumn and experiment period 2006 2009 high fertilization and 2010 2013 modified fertilization on soil n and k for the two cultivars averaged across the soil profile 0 90 cm the effect of the individual treatments in the first period was presented in a preliminary study segal et al 2011 for all comparisons variability was large and treatments did not differ significantly to investigate the effect of the modified fertilization the rww treatments were combined fr treatment was omitted since fertilization doze was not modified in the second period in contrast to high and varied levels of no3 soil n nh4 concentrations averaged only roughly 3 mg l 1 data not shown across treatments and cultivars in general nutrient concentrations tended to increase from spring to autumn with pronounced amplitude for the anionic no3 fig 2 compared to k the modification of fertilization strategy in the second period was well manifested in the soil n levels for both cultivars subsequent to the reduction in n fertilization in treatments re and re soil no3 concentrations decreased significantly in autumn compared to the first period in spring soil n was comparable for the two periods and for both cultivars as for soil k in spring for the two cultivars the concentration in the first period was significantly higher than the second period 8 9 compared to 14 mg l 1 for the first and second period respectively in autumn soil k was 17 18 mg l 1 in the first period and was somewhat lower in the second period 12 14 mg l 1 insignificant 3 2 2 soil extractable p soil extractable p olsen was measured towards the end of the experiment in the spring of 2013 considerably higher p levels in the upper 30 cm were found in rww treatments in comparison to the fr treatment in both cultivars fig 3 below 30 cm no significant treatment effect was noted and olsen p levels were particularly low 1 5 3 5 mg kg 1 across treatments and depths olsen p levels were consistently higher in the barnea compared to the leccino plot 3 2 3 soil na and cl the soil salinity was affected by water source fw or rww and by season spring or autumn the fertilization dose reduced re or standard re had no effect and thus the two rww treatments were combined in fig 4 the two plots barnea and leccino were comparable and therefore only data for the barnea are presented in fig 4a while the data for the leccino can be found in fig s1 chloride was the dominant soil solution ion and found to be strongly correlated to ec in saturated paste ece table s2 after 2008 ece of the

significant difference p 0 0008 however in the spring ece was similar for all treatments with the exception of spring 2013 leccino average spring ece for the entire experiment was 2 48 and 1 95 ds m 1 for the rww and fr treatments respectively not significant p 0 05 this illustrates that winter precipitation led to leaching of substantial amount of salts below the root zone specifically in the rww soil clearly precipitation volume played a central role in years with high rainfall e g 2012 2013 ece in the spring was low and similar for the two water sources on the contrary in years with low rainfall e g 2009 and 2011 ece in the spring was higher especially in the rww fig 4a average na concentration in the soil saturated paste solution was 408 for rww and 238 mg l 1 for the fr treatment throughout the entire experiment as described for ece soil na concentration of the rww treatments were higher in autumn each year in comparison to the fr treatment soil na concentration in the autumn of 2008 2010 2011 and 2012 was significantly higher for rww in the spring differences between the two water sources were less pronounced fig 4b average concentration of ca and mg in the soil solution throughout the experiment were similar for all treatments table s3 and not significantly affected by water source in the rww na was the most dominant cation in the soil solution with concentration approximately double that of ca the second most abundant cation the considerable high concentration of na in the soil compared to ca and mg in the rww treatments resulted in higher soil sar average sar values for the entire experiment for both cultivars were 6 95 and 5 08 mmol l 1 0 5 for the rww and fr treatments respectively significant difference p 0 0001 soil sar values in the rww treatments rose gradually from 3 9 in the spring of 2006 to above 8 0 mmol l 1 0 5 towards the end of the experiment the sar values in soil of the fr treatment increased only slightly from 3 9 to 5 0 mmol l 1 0 5 over the course of the experiment fig 4c the observed increase in the sar of the soil solution could not be linked to changes in the sar of the rww and fw as no significant increase in the sar of both water types over the entire duration of the experiment were measured fig s2 it should further be noted that compared with the observed gradual increase in sar over the experiment period especially in the rww treatments changes in ec were mainly seasonal and no long term trend in the ec was observed towards the end of the experiment exchangeable k percentage epp and exchangeable na percentage esp were measured no significant effect was found in epp with average levels of 3 6 for barnea and 2 6 for leccino soils regardless of treatment table s4 the measured sar and esp values were consistently and significantly higher in the rww treated soils at 0 60 cm depth fig 5 the soil samples taken between rows allowed us to evaluate the effect of irrigation on soil esp the esp levels were similar for the fr treatment and the unirrigated soil and significantly lower in the top 60 cm than those in the rww treatment at the end of the experiment average soil profile esp was 14

significant treatment effect on n leaf concentration was measured during the second period 2009 2013 even when no n fertilizer was applied treatment re trees maintained n levels similar to re and fr

consistently found above its reported deficiency threshold of 0 1 fernández escobar 2010 in all treatments and cultivars during the first 4 years of the experiment p level was comparable between treatments during the following period 2009 2013 treatments had significant impact on leaf p table 3 on average re leaves had the highest p concentration about 10 more than re and fr in both cultivars although re and re treatments received similar p levels re had occasionally lower leaf p concentration in both cultivars significant for barnea in 2008 2013 and 2014 and for leccino in 2011 2014 in

the different treatments and yet was substantially higher in the leccino compare to the barnea average leaf cl was 0 26 and 0 19 for leccino and barnea respectively table s5 no significant difference in leaf na concentration was found for treatments over the entire experiment leaf na concentration was also generally higher in leccino compared to barnea with average values of 0 024 and 0 019 respectively table s5 for a given cultivar we found no trend in na and cl accumulation with time across treatments and cultivars leaf cl concentration was 0 23 0 04 in the first period and 0 22 0 04 in the second period leaf na did not change between the two periods table s5 leaf ca concentration was not affected by treatment throughout the experiment in either cultivar leaf ca concentration was higher in the leccino compared to the barnea with average values of 1 61 and 1 42 respectively in both cultivars regardless of treatment there was a significant reduction in leaf ca concentration in the second period 2010 2013 in comparison to 2006 2009 leaf mg concentration was not affected by the treatments in either cultivar leaf mg concentration was slightly higher in the barnea in comparison to the leccino table s5 leaf micronutrients b fe cu mn and zn were not affected by treatments in both cultivars while b fe and mn exhibited reduced concentrations from the first to the second period table s6 leaf b fe and mn tended to be higher in barnea while leaf zn was higher in leccino 3 4 plant growth and yield vegetative tree growth as reflected by the relative annual increase in trunk circumference was variable probably a result of fruit load e g in 2008 highest yield and lowest annual growth growth did not differ significantly between treatments in either cultivar until the last season 2012 2013 in the final year of the experiment fr trees of both varieties had greater trunk growth compared to re trees fig 6 a and b overall trunk growth for the entire experiment was greater in leccino compared to barnea regardless of treatment fig 6 for both cultivars growth was highest in the fr treatment yet the effect was statistically significant for the leccino only fig 6c while in any individual season fruit yield was not significantly different among treatments total yield of the barnea trees for the entire 8 years of the experiment was significantly higher in the re and re treatments in comparison to the fr treatment the positive effect of the rww compared to fr on barnea yield was small but consistent in seven of the eight years of study this was not the case for the leccino trees for which no treatment effect on yield was found fig 7 total yield was about 30 higher in the barnea compared to the leccino regardless of treatment while the barnea trees produced fruits each year of the experiment leccino trees have high chilling requirements and failed to flower and bear fruit in the years 2009 2010 and 2013 fig 7b fruit oil content was not affected by treatment however it did differ between cultivars with the barnea having 22 and the leccino 18 data not shown therefore oil yield followed the same trend as fruit yield in the barnea oil yield was 13 higher in the rww treatments in comparison to the fr treatment for the leccino no significant difference in oil yield was measured between treatments average oil yield for all treatments was 40 higher in barnea in comparison to leccino fig 7e f 4 discussion in the current study bearing olive trees of the cultivars barnea and leccino were irrigated with either fresh water or reclaimed wastewater for a period of eight years the trees that were irrigated with rww received either standard or reduced amount of fertilizer n and k application following the first four years we found substantial leaching of no3 below the root zone and concluded that the then standard fertilization of rww was excessive segal et al 2011 hence the fertilization in the rww was modified in this paper we aimed to evaluate the long term effect of irrigation with rww on soil chemical properties and to evaluate the effect of the modified fertilizer management on olive tree performance the effect of water source on microbial activities in this experimental platform was described in frenk et al 2015 the potential negative effect of rww re and re treatments arose from three main factors i high concentrations of salts osmotic effect ii high na and cl concentration risk of toxicity and iii accumulation of na in the soil profile that eventually may impair soil chemical and physical properties soil sodicity sodicity may lead to poor soil structure and reduced hydraulic conductivity which is specifically detrimental to rain low electrolyte infiltration levy et al 2011 in avocado the accumulated effect of rww irrigation has been shown to lead to lower soil hydraulic conductivity which consequentially likely impairs aeration and root functioning yalin et al 2017 4 1 soil salinity the experimental site is located in a semi arid environment where potential evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation average annual reference evapotranspiration during the experiment was over 1500 mm while average precipitation and irrigation rates were 433 and 548 mm year 1 respectively considering a cover factor of around 50 and that not all the winter precipitation is expected to be available and utilized by the trees the irrigation regime can be characterized as deficit similar to recommendations for optimized olive oil cultivation ben gal et al 2011 including specifically for super intensive layouts fernández et al 2013 grattan et al 2006 under deficit irrigation leaching of minerals is minimal and thus during the summer salts accumulate in the root zone in the winter precipitation exceeds the et and hence minerals are leached downwards this pattern was evidenced in the current study for soil water no3 k na and cl that accumulated during the irrigation season and diminished in the winter additionally during the experiment two interesting trends were observed 1 the amplitude of salt accumulation increased with time and 2 the amplitude of no3 and k accumulation decreased during the second period following the decrease in fertilization dose in the rww olive is considered a moderately tolerant plant species concerning salinity and the estimated threshold expressed as ece for yield reduction is 3 6 ds m 1 maas and hoffman 1977 barnea is considered to be a particularly salt tolerant cultivar rewald et al 2011 whose growth and yield is not negatively impacted by salinity rewald et al 2011 weissbein et al 2008 even when irrigated with saline water of 4 2 ds m 1 but allowing regular leaching by irrigation water in the current experiment irrigation water salinity of the rww was only 1 7 ds m 1 but the deficit practice allowed minimal if any leaching during the irrigation season hence the ece late in the irrigation season reached a range of 5 7 ds m 1 compared to 4 ds m 1 for the fr treatment considering the expected actual soil water content levels the actual ec in the root zone is estimated to be 2 3 times higher than the saturated paste extract ec ben gal et al 2016 richards 1969 the ece value was closely and linearly related to cl and na accumulation in the soil table s2 in a controlled experiment examining the effect of root zone salinity on barnea trees inhibition of vegetative growth was measured at prolonged ece as low as 2 8 ds m 1 however reduction in fruit yield was evidenced only when ece was greater than 6 ds m 1 ben gal et al 2016 in accordance we found slight reduction in vegetative growth in response to irrigation with rww but no reduction in yield was measured in olive trees salt accumulates in the fine roots and is effectively excluded from the shoots soda et al 2017 salinity stress can cause an increase in root respiration jacoby et al 2011 it was previously shown that leccino had double the root respiration rate compared to barnea trees when irrigated with high salinity water hill et al 2013 therefore it is possible that in the current experiment leccino trees irrigated with rww allocated more carbon for root respiration compared to barnea trees due to salt exclusion leaf na and cl concentrations were low and were not affected by the water source indicating no foliar damage caused by salinity the average leaf cl concentration was steady and low throughout the experiment below the reported toxicity threshold of 0 5 fernández escobar 2010 similarly na accumulation in leaves was low 0 020 0 027 way below the accepted toxicity threshold of 0 2 and was not affected by water source or time table s5 hence the common diagnosis tools along with growth and yield parameters indicate that the salinity level in the orchard had only minor negative effects on olive performance occurring at the root level and expressed by slight above ground growth inhibition we can therefore conclude that the osmotic and toxic aspects of rww utilization had only a minor effect on olive performance under the environmental conditions and particularly precipitation rates and patterns at our site these conclusions confirm previous studies on olive response to rww ayoub et al 2016 bedbabis et al 2010 bourazanis et al 2016b segal et al 2011 utilization of rww for irrigation of more sensitive fruit trees such as grapevines laurenson et al 2012 citrus nicolás et al 2016 paudel et al 2016a b and avocado yalin et al 2017 resulted in significant negative impact on tree performance 4 2 soil sodicity domestic use of water significantly elevates na concentration in the waste water but has little impact on ca and mg concentrations hence typical rww in israel has sar 4 e g levy et al 2011 in the current study sar of the rww was 5 1 mmol l 1 0 5 the sar value in saturated soil paste increased significantly over the duration of the experiment yet with some seasonal fluctuations from 3 9 to a level of 8 similarly the average esp in the soil profile to a depth of 90 cm in the rww treatment 14 was nearly twice that in the fr treatment 7 5 the high average esp levels and especially those at the 30 60 cm layer in both treatments were higher than expected according to the extensively used empirical sar esp relation developed by the us salinity laboratory richards 1969 levy et al 2011 proposed that such a deviation of the actual esp values from the expected ones could stem from the absence of equilibrium in the soil profile between the sar of the irrigation water the sar of the soil solution and soil esp which could lead to greater than expected adsorption of na to the soil sposito and mattigod 1977 it is suggested that the use of deficit irrigation coupled with insufficient leaching of the soil profile during the rainy season led to the buildup of sodicity in the soil profile to levels much higher than expected based solely on the sar of the irrigation water it has been recognized for quite some time that esp 5 separates between soils with a non sodic to a soil with a sodic type characteristics and behavior shainberg and letey 1984 buildup of sodicity in the soil profile to the levels observed in the current study clearly indicate that both irrigation regimes resulted in creating sodic conditions in the soil profile however the similarity in the sodicity profile of the fr treatment and the non irrigated soil fig 5 suggests that irrigation with fw did not cause a significant change in the soil natural conditions with respect to sodicity however the very high levels of sodicity obtained after rww irrigation could lead to enhanced clay swelling and dispersion aggregate destabilization impaired water movement in the soil profile aeration problems and accumulation of salts these processes are expected to occur mainly in the winter rather than during the irrigation season because then the soil is leached with rain water i e water with very low electrolyte concentration and the sensitivity of the soil clay to swelling and dispersion is much higher shainberg and letey 1984 as is the susceptibility of aggregates to destabilization levy et al 2003 in addition the negative impact of sodicity increases with the increase in clay content levy and mamedov 2002 the clay content in our experimental site was 51 56 putting our soil in the range of soils with high sensitivity to sodicity effects sensitivity to soil sodicity is also crop specific levy et al 2011 in avocado grown in a clay soil for example esp of 6 was suggested as the cause for diminished oxygen availability to roots and thus for damaging root development yalin et al 2017 conversely in olives esp of 20 was suggested as a threshold value above which tree function and development is impaired freeman and carlson 1994 in our experiment where average soil esp was 14 growth yield and leaf diagnosis indicated that rww utilization offers a sustainable approach for olive production yet it would be ill advised to ignore the buildup of sodic conditions in the soil profile following long term irrigation with rww as sustainable crop production comprise also the prevention of degradation in soil properties 4 3 tree and soil response to n and k fertigation rate evaluation of olive tree response to mineral nutrition was enabled by the manipulation and modification of fertigation application rates in the second phase of the experiment the re treatment received considerably less 35 40 n and k than the re and fr treatments table 2 in spite of this no significant decrease in leaf n or k concentration in the re treatment was observed in either of the two cultivars table 3 furthermore accumulated fruit yield was highest for the re treatment this suggests that trees receiving the re treatment did not experience any significant nutrient deficiency the major effect of the reduced fertilization in the second phase was considerable diminishment of no3 and k in the soil profile across cultivars and treatments average autumn soil no3 concentration was reduced from 113 mg l 1 at the first stage to 42 mg l 1 in the second stage in accordance with the low n application rate 124 kg ha 1 lowest no3 values were found for the re 22 mg l 1 treatments re and fr received a comparable n dose 200 kg ha 1 and autumn soil no3 level reached 52 mg l 1 the lack of plant response to the reduced n and k fertilization combined with the significant reduction in n accumulation during the irrigation season implies that any n applied at rates over 124 kg ha 1 was simply leached downwards out of the root zone during the winter in the reduced fertilization practice n uptake efficiency increased and the environmental impact minimized without impairing plant performance this implies that at least for the environmental conditions of the experiment commercial recommended n application rates were excessive this is specifically important for olive cultivation as n over fertilization has been shown to impair both productivity erel et al 2013b fernandez escobar et al 2008 and oil quality dag et al 2009a erel et al 2013a fernández escobar et al 2006 while plant growth in our study was slightly reduced yield was not effected in the leccino variety and was increased for barnea as a result of irrigation with rww previous studies have shown similar results where irrigation with effluent did not affect yields ayoub et al 2016 bedbabis et al 2010 2015 lopez et al 2006 segal et al 2011 a positive yield response to rww was also recently reported in a study on the olive cultivar koroneiki bourazanis et al 2016a which similar to barnea is considered moderately tolerant to salinity chartzoulakis 2005 our results demonstrate that utilization of rww may provide most if not all of the nutrients required for productive olive trees this is in accordance with the data analysis of hadas and kislev 2010 who estimated that for fruit trees in general 88 of the demand for n and 112 of the demand for k can be supplied by typical rww the authors estimated the economic benefit of the reduced fertilization at 528 ha 1 hadas and kislev 2010 we suggest caution when evaluating the potential contribution of rww as nutrient concentrations tend to be unstable depending on source sewage water treatment processes and time nitrogen concentration in rww used for irrigation may vary from as low as 5 up to 60 mg l 1 feigin et al 1991 hence actual total n allocated with rww could range from below to well in excess of crop demand bar tal et al 2011 in israel typical mineral n concentration in rww used for irrigation of citrus is 23 mg l 1 bar tal et al 2011 comparable to the average in this experiment 4 4 phosphorus nutrition in several fruit trees including olives p fertilization is recommended only following observation of deficiency symptoms or low leaf concentrations fernández escobar 2010 lópez villalta and muñoz cobo 1996 olive trees tend to have mychorryzal symbiosis in their root system which contribute dramatically to p acquisition dag et al 2009b porras soriano et al 2009 therefore most orchards are not fertilized with p and rely solely on p reserves similar to the practice in the fr treatment in the current study leaf p concentration of the fr treatment never dropped below the acknowledged deficiency threshold of 0 1 in leaves fernández escobar 2010 in rww a large proportion of p is in its inorganic form bar yosef 2011 and hence is relatively available for uptake by plants indeed extractable p accumulated in the top soil layer was about double in our rww irrigated plots compared to that found in the fr irrigated soil below 30 cm extractable p levels were identical for rww and fr indicating immobility and lack of leaching following the eight years of regular p application the depth of p leaching in soil is negatively related to clay content bar yosef 1999 and the clay content in the experimental site was very high in sandy soils irrigated with rww p transport in the soil profile was found to be significantly enhanced bar yosef 2011 in the fr soil olsen p values were comparable to the non irrigated soil between the tree rows and no depletion was noted apparently these low p values were maintained by the natural p cycle including contributions due to the farmer s practice to shred pruned branches onsite in accordance with the olsen p levels in the second period leaf p in the re was significantly higher than fr surprisingly leaf p in re was similar to that for fr even while fr received a lower p dose causing lower olsen p in soil the enhanced p availability in the rww treatment was associated with significant increase in fruit and oil yield recent studies have shown that p availability plays a major role in olive flowering and fruit set erel et al 2013b 2016 possibly trees of the fr treatment compensated the zero rate of p fertilizer application through enhanced mycorrhizal activity despite their positive effect on nutrient acquisition mycorrhiza exert a cost on the plant s carbon budget douds et al 1988 lynch and ho 2005 this offers an additional possible explanation for the lower total yield observed in the barnea fr treatment 5 conclusion the ever growing demand for food and water is driving towards utilization of wastewater in agriculture our results reaffirm the need to consider nutrients provided with the rww in fertilization management under our specific experimental environmental conditions tree requirements for nutrients were successfully supplied by the minerals present in the rww without need for additional fertilization we arrive at two main deductions regarding nutrition management i common fertilization practice typically leads to n over fertilization and ii p nutrition is underestimated these conclusions are well in agreement with former field and controlled studies e g erel et al 2013b fernández escobar et al 2009 nitrogen over fertilization may lead to impaired product quality reduced yield and cause significant no3 transport to groundwater while balanced n management minimizes n losses with no negative impact on yield salinity and soil sodicity are major considerations in rww utilization under the environmental and management conditions of the current study salinity seemed to have minor if any effect on overall performance however continuous elevation of soil sar and accumulation of na in soil exchange sites is of great concern as it may indicate slow but consistent degradation of soil physical properties these long term hazards were not manifested in the duration of the current study but the trend is alarming we therefore conclude that utilization of rww should be accompanied with routine close monitoring of soil sodicity to avoid soil degradation and allow

11183,little is known about the economy wide repercussions of water buyback which may include relevant feedbacks on the output of economic sectors at a regional and supra regional scale limited studies available rely on stand alone computable general equilibrium cge models that represent competition for water explicitly but this approach presents significant data and methodological challenges in areas where mature water markets are not in place the case of most regions worldwide to bridge this gap this paper couples a microeconomic positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup model that elicits the value and price share to water with a macroeconomic regionally calibrated cge model for spain methods are illustrated with a case study in the murcia region in southeastern spain economy wide feedbacks amplify income losses in murcia s agriculture from 20 5 in the pmaup model up to 33 in the coupled pmaup cge model compensations paid to irrigators enhance demand in the region but supply contraction in agriculture and related sectors lead to overall gdp losses up to 2 1 in most scenarios the supply gap is partially filled in by other spanish regions which experience a gdp gain through a substitution effect up to 034 in all scenarios aggregate gdp for spain decreases up to 023 keywords mathematical programming cge water buyback spain 1 introduction water institutions are increasingly reliant on the reacquisition or buyback of water rights to restore the balance in overexploited basins buyback programmes are operated through purchase tenders that compensate farmers who choose to relinquish their rights to withdraw water complemented with flanking measures to address negative feedbacks on agriculture and related economic sectors at a regional and supra regional scale dsewpac 2016 grba 2008 hanak and stryjewski 2012 an expanding research analyses the interaction between user level choices and tender design to limit information rents and prevent overcompensation iftekhar et al 2013 qureshi et al 2009 wheeler et al 2013 zuo et al 2015 less is known however about the economy wide impacts of buyback despite the large amount of resources committed to mitigate them for example the buyback programme of the upper guadiana river basin in spain projected an investment of eur 3 billion along a 20 year transition period of which only 33 addressed purchase tenders directly while the remaining 67 envisaged flanking measures to compensate for negative feedbacks including subsidies for economic diversification and new transportation communication and energy infrastructures grba 2008 in australia s murray darling basin an investment of aud 3 1 billion for the reacquisition of 1500 million m3 from irrigators was complemented with an irrigation modernization programme worth aud 7 36 billion aiming to i compensate for negative feedbacks through enhanced productivity and ii limit water use by another 1900 million m3 department of the environment 2015 dsewpac 2016 although the achievement of the latter target has been questioned australian parliament 2017 research available on the topic relies on theoretical models marchiori et al 2012 or computable general equilibrium cge models applied to the australian case dixon et al 2012a 2011 use a dynamic cge model containing water accounts to analyze the effects of an illustrative buyback scheme in the southern murray darling basin simulation results show that contrary to what could be expected buyback has a positive impact on the regional economy and a negative albeit marginal one at a national level this is explained by supply demand interaction in water markets which lead to higher prices that i increase net exports of water and consumption and ii cause a reallocation of farm production factors that partially compensates for the negative impact on agricultural output notably the adjustment dynamics of the model relies on the existence of full fledged water markets a prerequisite that holds only in australia chile and the semi arid states of western us in most regions and countries today allocation rules are still conditioned by historical rights and queuing and prices represent administrative charges to partially recover the cost of conveying water to users oecd 2015 in this context attempts to model competition for water explicitly in a cge environment must rely on estimations that assign a price and value share to water see e g darwin et al 1995 which is challenging due to the limited information available more importantly recent research rightly claims that the shadow price of water must correspond to the gap between irrigated and rainfed production to pay for the returns to water which is often not reflected in value and price estimations hertel and liu 2016 addressing this methodological challenge in a cge environment calls for an alternative approach that models water competition implicitly e g through irrigated land calzadilla et al 2011 taheripour et al 2013 or virtual water cazcarro et al 2014 which however is inadequate to model and inform water purchase tenders and thus the economy wide impact of buyback programmes in the absence of water markets or data sources with equivalent information an economy wide assessment of buyback programmes may require the macroeconomic model to be simulated in concert with a complementary bottom up model that supplies the missing information this makes possible to bridge the scale gap and adapt the analysis on the varied and asymmetric welfare impacts to the more convenient scale or decision unit a wide range of applications coupling bottom up with macroeconomic models can be found in the literature and not only related to water issues bottom up models can be bio physical carrera et al 2015 or microeconomic such as agent based husby 2016 chap 7 or mathematical programming methods baghersad and zobel 2015 while macroeconomic approaches typically include cge or input output io models the choice of bottom up and macroeconomic model varies depending on the research focus data availability and policy experiment cge models are preferred over io where price dynamics are expected to be relevant as happens with policies involving large reallocations of physical and financial resources such as buyback and to examine the medium and long run effects dudu and chumi 2008 on the other hand microeconomic mathematical programming methods are the approach typically used to model agents motives and behavior in agricultural economics graveline 2016 one straightforward way to combine the complementary outputs of micro and macro economic models is to solve both models independently where available and use results to inform water policy however the different foundations of both approaches individual behavior in narrowly defined markets in microeconomic models v structure and behavior of a whole economy in macroeconomic ones can lead to conflicting outcomes and raise consistency issues pindyck 2015 using a holistic approach that solves both models together allows a detailed representation of causal relationships and interdependencies and ensures consistency but making the complex internal optimization procedures of micro and macro economic models compatible will demand oversimplification as happens with holistic hydroeconomic models that represent farmers behavior through piecewise exogenous benefit functions that relate water use to profit harou et al 2009 modular approaches run the two models independently in a recursive or sequential fashion which increases the probability of convergence on an optimal solution and the level of detail in each sub field at the expense of a less thorough representation of causality and interdependencies between models singh 2012 while the use of both holistic and modular approaches is widely reported in hybrid models literature the coupling of computationally demanding macroeconomic models with bottom up models is typically conducted using a modular approach carrera et al 2015 grames et al 2016 this paper presents a methodological framework that utilizes a modular approach to connect in a sequential fashion a microeconomic positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup model with a macroeconomic cge model to assess the local and economy wide impacts of agricultural water buyback the microeconomic pmaup model makes possible a realistic representation of intricate water allocation mechanisms based on queuing and historical rights charged by the administration and a detailed assessment of farmers motives and behavior bringing positivism and high spatial resolution to the design of buyback scenarios while the cge model feeds on the simulation outputs from the pmuap model to assess the spread and intensity of the policy shock throughout spatial units economic sectors and macroeconomic agents methods are illustrated with an application to the region of murcia in southeastern spain the pmaup model is calibrated at an agricultural water demand unit awdu scale a basic agricultural unit in spain that encompasses irrigation communities with a common source of water and similar administrative and hydrological characteristics srba 2015a on the other hand cge models typically work at a national or supranational scale although some examples considering the sub national regions within a country or a group of countries can be found in australia wittwer and horridge 2010 europe brandsma et al 2015 us dixon et al 2012a russia bohringer et al 2014 and china horridge and wittwer 2008 this work relies on the intertemporal computable equilibrium system ices a global cge model that has been used extensively to assess the macro economic impacts of climate change and to evaluate different environmental and climate policies see e g parrado and de cian 2014 for the purpose of this research the model has been calibrated for 17 sub national units

to autonomous communities and cities and nuts 3 to provinces eurostat 2016 level in spain this bridges the scale gap and makes feasible the coupling between both models which is resolved in two steps in the first step the water constraint is progressively strengthened in the pmaup model to assess agents awdus responses to buyback and reveal i the foregone income and ii the compensating variation that addresses foregone utility or shadow price of water this step relies on previous work by pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 in the second step the foregone income and compensating variation obtained for every agent are aggregated at a regional level and reproduced in a macroeconomic context through two shocks i a shock on production based on the foregone income and ii a shock on the income of the representative agent in the cge model resulting from the water sales a function of the compensating variation the economy wide repercussions of water buyback are estimated as the difference between the economic output of the economic sectors and regions under selected water reacquisition targets and that of the baseline without buyback the paper is structured as follows sections 2 3 and 4 constitute the methodological part of the paper and introduce the pmaup model the cge model and the coupling approach respectively section 5 presents the case study area the region of murcia in spain section 6 illustrates the methods with an application to the case study area section 7 discusses the results and section 8 concludes 2 the microeconomic module positive multi attribute utility programming the microeconomic model used in this paper builds on the axioms of revealed preference houthakker 1950 samuelson 1938 to elicit an objective function that is both consistent with an observed and finite set of choices and prices afriat 1967 and suitable as a basis for empirical analysis in agricultural water management gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 the theory of revealed preference originates in samuelson s 1938 pure theory of consumer behavior which derived testable implications of rational consumption behavior and demand for two different budget sets without the need to postulate a utility function to represent agent s preferences giving rise to the weak axiom of revealed preference samuelson 1948 1938 later on houthakker 1950 introduced the strong axiom of revealed preference sarp which uses transitivity to derive testable implications of rational consumption for any budget sets houthakker also established a close link between the axioms about demand and those about preferences by showing that in order to satisfy sarp demand functions must be the observable result of the optimization of preferences subject to agent s budgetary constraint the theoretical foundation for revealed preference theory provided by houthakker 1950 and samuelson 1948 1938 assumes a complete description of a demand system that gives quantities as a function of every possible budget and price the key development in applied revealed preference research is offered by afriat 1967 who develops a utility function consistent with agent s choices from an observed finite dataset of prices and choices providing the basis to estimate aggregate consumer demand functions christensen et al 1975 although the first revealed preference applications date from the 1970s battalio et al 1973 the large computational power and hard micro data necessary to implement revealed preference models have limited empirical analyses vermeulen 2012 yet these barriers appear to be subsiding in 2005 varian 2006 conducted a search on revealed preference in jstor business and economics journals and found 997 results in early 2018 the same search found 8866 results

strengthened to estimate i the foregone income and ii the compensating variation that addresses foregone utility or shadow price of water the price and value share to water thus revealed were found consistent with those observed in previous reacquisitions garrido et al 2013 and other works in the area using positive mathematical programming martínez granados and calatrava 2014 this paper relies on the estimations by pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 to feed a series of simulations in a cge environment through the development of a coupled pmaup cge model in order to assess the economy wide repercussions of agricultural water buyback 2 1 objective function in irrigated agriculture agent observed choices are a combination of crop mix and timing water application and capital stock just 1975 literature often simplifies this complex decision process by representing each possible combination of crops timing water application and capital as a separate crop with unique features so that the optimization problem is reduced to a choice on the crop portfolio x within a domain f x where the crop portfolio x is a vector representing the land share devoted to each individual crop x i such that 1 x f x 0 x i 1 i 1 n x i 1 the agent does not have direct preferences over the crop portfolio itself but over the utility this crop portfolio will return in terms of the provision of valuable attributes applied models to simulate farmer s behavior often assume that farmers are rational profit maximizers and therefore utility equals profit u π although this approach usually leads to significant divergence between observed and simulated behavior more robust theoretical frameworks assume agent s behavior can be modeled by means of maximizing a utility function where profits are the relevant attribute as in expected utility von neumann and morgenstern 1953 and positive mathematical programming howitt 1995 since the 1970s a growing research body known as the theory of planned behavior tpb has disputed that farmers behavior can be modeled maximizing profits or a utility function where profits are the single relevant attribute ajzen 1991 harman et al 1972 instead these authors argue that farmers behavior is driven by multiple and often conflicting attributes related to socioeconomic cultural and natural features including but not limited to profit recent empirical evidence shows that the variance in farmers intentions and observed strategic and entrepreneurial conduct are largely explained by farmers attitudes towards their behavior basarir and gillespie 2006 berkhout et al 2010 attitudes can be seen as a summary of psychological evaluations based on agent s beliefs about the goodness or badness of an object normally associated with a particular attribute gómez limón et al 2016 if farmers beliefs concerning multiple attributes govern decision making modeling farmers behavior requires the consideration of more than one attribute through a multi attribute utility function where relevant attributes are included keeney and raiffa 1993 rational economic agents will choose the crop portfolio x that maximizes the utility from the provision of relevant attributes z x within a domain f x 2 m a x u x x u z 1 x z 2 x z 3 x z m x 3 s t 0 x i 1 4 i 1 n x i 1 5 x f x 6 z z x r m attributes are quantities of dimension one the result of dividing observed attribute values by the maximum feasible value they can attain and are defined so that more is better i e increasing the provision of one attribute improves agent s utility provided the remaining attributes are kept constant assuming attributes are measurable alternative crop portfolios can be ranked in accordance to the utility they yield there is no risk of correlation among attributes since the outcome of the utility function is an ordinal value edgeworth 1881 this means that the model is not concerned about total utility or levels of utility but rather about ranking alternative decisions so that they are coherent with observed choices rational agents will then cultivate the crop portfolio that maximizes utility within a domain defined by a set of quantifiable restrictions notably agronomic features land constraints know how policy restrictions e g common agricultural policy and water allocation the latter can be represented as 7 i 1 n w i x i w where water availability per hectare is denoted by w w i is the water required by crop x i per hectare in revealing agent s preferences the pmaup model follows a positive approach implying that the optimal solution to the problem above should be as closed as possible to the observed choice or crop portfolio x 0 afriat 1967 the pmaup model thus aims to recover an objective function that is consistent with x 0 and the choice domain f x so that it can be used to forecast future behavior varian 2006 following standard microeconomic theory the parameters of a utility function can be elicited for a given set of attributes equalizing the marginal rate of transformation m r t k p which represents the opportunity cost between two attributes z p z k and is obtained as the slope of the efficient frontier β k p and the marginal rate of substitution m r s k p which represents the willingness to sacrifice one unit of attribute z p for one unit of attribute z k 8 m r t k p β k p m r s k p u z p u z k p k the utility function is parameterized in three steps which are explained in detail in the next sections i efficient frontiers are elicited for each pair of attributes using numerical methods and the tangency point that serves as a landing point for the utility function s indifference curve is obtained ii given a tangency point and a functional form the utility function parameters are calibrated for every possible combination of attributes equalizing the m r t k p and the m r s k p iii error terms are obtained as the distance between observed and simulated choices the utility function with the lowest error contains the relevant attributes and is the one used in the simulations 2 2 marginal rate of transformation observed decisions of rational agents must be efficient i e they must belong to the pareto efficient set or efficient frontier therefore among all feasible choices we are only interested in revealing those along the efficient frontier where the agent maximizes utility in a multi attribute context the efficient frontier represents the maximum value of attribute z p rational agents can attain for a given value of attribute z k within the domain real life efficient frontiers cannot be analytically defined using a closed function andré 2009 instead numerical methods through an optimization procedure are typically used as follows 9 m a x z p x x 10 s t z k x c k p c 0 1 11 0 x i 1 12 i 1 n x i 1 13 x f x where c 0 1 is a finite set that determines the values of attribute z k for which the values of attribute z p are projected to the frontier recall attributes are values of dimension one solving the optimization problem above we obtain an efficient frontier in the two dimensional space τ z p z k x where x is the set of crop choices delivering a provision of attributes z p z k along the frontier literature offers a number of alternatives to estimate the tangency or landing point for the utility function sumpsi et al 1997 maximize each attribute z k z p separately within the domain to calculate the pay off matrix i e the maximum value each attribute can attain within the domain and approximate the efficient frontier through a hyper plane connecting two efficient points included in the pay off matrix segment formed by points a and b in two dimensions in fig 1 case 1 andré and riesgo 2007 project the observed choice to the closest efficient point x i e along the efficiency frontier which is then used as a reference point to obtain a compromise set consisting of a set of efficient points in the vicinity the compromise set is interpreted as the piece of the efficient frontier where the utility function is maximized then the tangency point for the indifference curve is obtained regressing a hyper plane from the compromise set segment formed by points a and b in fig 1 case 2 finally gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 obtain the maximum feasible value of attribute z p for the observed value of z k i e c z k o in eq 10 and vice versa and again use a hyper plane connecting the two points to approximate the efficient frontier segment formed by points a and b in fig 1 case 3 all these methods obtain the efficient frontier and tangency points from linear combinations of two efficient points admittedly efficient frontiers are convex otherwise there is no tradeoff and the choice between the two attributes becomes irrelevant this means that the hyper planes connecting efficient points will not belong to the actual efficient set x and will lead to approximation errors distance between the segment ab and x in fig 1 positive multi attribute models typically rely on the methods described in cases 1 3 to reveal the tangency points consistent with pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 this paper follows the method by gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 which minimizes the approximation error for the database used solving the optimization problem in eqs 9 13 for the observed values of each pair of attributes z k and z p i e z k o and z p o yields two efficient points namely τ z p z k o and τ z p o z k points a and b in fig 1 case 3 the slope in any intermediate point τ between the two projected efficient points or m r t k p is obtained as follows 14 m r t k p τ β k p τ z p z p o z k z k o β k p τ provides a reliable estimate gutiérrez martín et al 2014 for the tangency point which is used for the calibration of the utility function 2 3 marginal rate of substitution the marginal rate of substitution m r s k p measures the willingness to sacrifice one unit of attribute z p for one unit of attribute z k which graphically corresponds to the slope of the indifference or isoutility curve m r s k p u z p u z k see eq 8 rational economic agents will choose the crop portfolio where the m r s k p over the indifference curve equals the m r t k p over the efficient frontier for any pair of attributes see eq 8 similarly to afriat s 1967 model for the case of single attribute utility functions the methodology presented here can be used to calibrate a utility function consistent with observed choices and the domain typically there will be several utility functions available for the case of single attribute utility functions varian 1982 presented a way to describe the entire set of utility functions consistent with observed preferences while varian 1983 obtained bounds on specific functional forms for the case of multi attribute utility functions the information provided by the m r t k p and m r s k p makes feasible the elicitation of the function parameters consistent with observed choices within the domain f x for a given functional form considered for the application presented here it is assumed that the multi attribute utility function adopts a cobb douglas specification which offers a sensible approximation to actual farmers behavior sampson 1999 as compared to alternative additive or multiplicative additive specifications a cobb douglas function offers the advantages of decreasing marginal utility for each attribute and the existence of a global optimum inada 1963 following a cobb douglas specification the objective function in eq 2 can now be represented as 15 u p 1 m z p α p x p 1 m α p 1 where α p are the objective function parameters or alpha values by means of equalizing the m r s k p of a cobb douglas function and the m r t k p obtained in the previous section the objective function parameters can be estimated solving the following system of equations 16 m r s k p α p α k z k z p β k p m r t k p p k 17 p 1 m α p 1 the values of the parameters obtained resolving the system of equations above for alternative attribute combinations within the set z x are used in eqs 2 6 to simulate the optimal crop portfolio choice x and obtain the corresponding attribute values z p p 1 m and utility u 2 4 relevant attributes and utility function parameters rational agents cultivate the portfolio of crops that maximizes the utility obtained from the attributes they value therefore the relevant attributes are those that minimize the distance between observed and calibrated behavior which is measured through a calibration residual obtained as the ordinary arithmetic mean of two errors the first error captures the distance between the observed x o and simulated x crop portfolio 18 e x 1 n i 1 n x i o x i x i o 2 the second error captures the distance between observed z o and calibrated z attributes 19 e τ 1 m p 1 m z p o z p z p o 2 the relevant set of attributes minimizes the average calibration residual which is obtained as follows 20 e e x e τ 2 the set of attributes and corresponding parameter values that minimize the average calibration residual is the one used in the simulations 2 5 data agents in the pmaup model are the 55 agricultural water demand units awdus of the segura river basin located within the boundaries of the region of murcia aggregation of individual farmers to conform representative economic agents is well documented in the literature also through the use of awdus martínez granados and calatrava 2014 pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 the calibration year observed crop portfolio x o is 2013 data used in the pmaup model depends on the finite attributes set considered in the model calibration we explore five attributes based on a literature review on multi attribute utility functions see pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 these attributes include profit z 1 quantified through the gross variable margin risk avoidance z 2 obtained as the difference between the standard deviation of the crop portfolio that maximizes profit and that of an alternative portfolio x direct costs avoidance z 3 the difference between the per unit of revenue direct costs incurred in the management of the crop portfolio that maximizes profit and those of an alternative portfolio x hired labor avoidance z 4 the difference between the hired labor necessary to implement the crop portfolio that maximizes profit and that of an alternative portfolio x and family labor avoidance z 5 the difference between the hired labor necessary to implement the crop portfolio that maximizes profit and that of an alternative portfolio x data collection aims at supplying the necessary information to quantify the attributes listed above land use data per crop is obtained at a municipal level for the calibration

module computable general equilibrium model 3 1 theoretical structure from a general point of view a cge model is a market based tool which captures the economic interactions taking place between sectors regions and factors prices are flexible and adjust to the different impacts and policies to clear the markets and achieve a new equilibrium in which supply equals demand the regionalized ices is a neoclassical model perfect competition is assumed in all sectors of the economy factors are fully employed and investments are saving driven in this experiment we use a regionalized version of the model that includes the 17 nuts2 regions of spain the rest of europe and the rest of the world and seven economic sectors namely agriculture extraction food industry other industry utilities sector construction and services the main characteristics of demand and supply are described in the following sub sections 3 1 1 supply a representative firm in every region and sector minimizes costs

s t y j s m i n v a j s i n j s where p v a j s and p i n j s are respectively the price of the value added composite and the price of intermediate inputs in sector j of region s gva in sector j is produced with a constant elasticity of substitution ces function that depends on v f primary factors f capital land labor and natural resources with sector specific elasticity of substitution σ j input augmenting or biased technical change is represented with the parameter γ f j s for each primary factor f in sector j and region s 23 v a j s f γ f j s v f j s σ j σ j 0 the regionally calibrated cge model assumes endogenous labor and capital supply at the regional level allowing to some extent the spatial mobility of workers and capital within the national territory production factors are immobile with respect to the rest of europe and the rest of the world within each spanish region labor and capital can move across sectors while land is used in the agricultural sector only and natural resources in mining forestry and fishing sectors a constant elasticity of transformation cet function is implemented for the purpose of modelling regional labor and capital supply given the national constraint the first order conditions are obtained from the following maximization problem 24 m a x w f s s spain w f s q f s f l a b o r c a p i t a l s s p a i n 25 q f s p a i n q f d η f 1 η f η f η f 1 η f 0 where q f represents the supply in the sub country region s and in spain and w f their corresponding prices the elasticity of substitution η f falls within the interval 0 a higher absolute value indicates a higher interregional mobility while a null value denotes perfect immobility at the regional level consistently with previous studies carrera et al 2015 koks et al 2015 we set an intermediate value of minus two 3 1 2 demand final and intermediate goods can be traded in the domestic national and international market the demand side includes an upper and a lower bundle both thresholds postulate imperfect substitution between products coming from different spatial units countries and or regions according to the standard armington assumption armington 1969 in the upper level this is done by breaking agents demand for any commodity in two parts using a ces function d d j s and d m j s which are the domestic demand and the aggregate demand for imported products in region s and sector j respectively the representative agent in each region includes the household and the government for each economic sector the representative agent minimizes the total expenditure under the ces constraint on domestic and imported goods 26 m i n d d j s d m j s p d d j s d d j s p d m j s d m j s 27 s t d t o t j s g 1 d d j s d m j s σ j u p σ j u p 0 where d t o t j s is the total demand and p d d j s and p d m j s are the prices associated with domestic and aggregate demand for imported goods respectively the armington elasticity in the upper level σ j u p captures the imperfect substitution between domestic and imported commodities in the lower level the aggregate amount of imports d m j s are sourced from the country or the sub country region of origin the representative agent in each region and sector minimizes the expenditure for imports under a constant ratios of elasticities of substitution and homothetic cresh constraint cai and arora

the bi lateral imports and elasticities of substitution of region country s in sector j price indexes for the aggregate import composite is weighted by the three dimensional elasticity following the minimization problem in the two equations above the advantage to use the cresh function in the lower level consists in having a three dimensional elasticity σ j s s l o 0 which allows for more flexibility than ces to model the product substitutability for each couple of spatial units since theoretical and empirical evidence shows that trade is larger within national borders than across them given the same distance anderson et al 2003 mccallum 1995 intra national trade flows should be more fluid than international trade ones and this is guaranteed by setting a higher value of the cresh elasticity involving two spanish regions the income inc s of the representative agent in each sub national region or country is allocated in fixed proportions to private final consumption cons s government consumption gov s and saving save s 30 inc s cons s gov s save s the macro economic closure assumes that the investments are mobile at the international level global investments are equal to global savings and trade balance in each country region is given by the difference between regional country savings and investments 3 2 data the model uses information from the gtap 8 database narayanan et al 2012 the 8 1 version consists in a collection of social accounting matrices sams for 57 economic sectors and 134 countries or groups of countries in the world the reference year is 2007 we split the national sam of spain in the gtap database into 17 regions using information from spanish regional accounting ine 2017 and economic accounts for agriculture and structural business statistics eurostat 2016 to do this first we match the sectors of the gtap database with those of our data sources then for each sector the regional shares of value added and accordingly of labor capital land and natural resources are computed using the sub national data finally these shares are used to distribute original country level data across sub national units a detailed description of the methodology is available in bosello and standardi 2015 ine 2017 provides information on both capital and labor at the sectoral level for some manufacturing activities we referred to structural business statistics eurostat 2016 because they have a more detailed description of these sectors to regionalize the agricultural economic components of value added we mainly rely on the economic accounts for agriculture eurostat 2016 because of the rich and already standardized information across eu regions one of the most challenging tasks to achieve in the database construction is the derivation of the sub national domestic demand and trade among regions within the country this is because these data are often missing and need to be computed using different techniques in our case we rely on the so called simple locations quotients slqs miller and blair 2009 slqs give a measure of the regional specialization in the economic activity compared to the national average and allow us to determine the domestic demand and aggregate demand for imports then we follow the gravitational approach to obtain the bilateral trade flows across sub national regions in line with dixon et al 2012b and wittwer and horridge 2010 4 coupling the pmaup and cge models once the multi attribute objective function is calibrated in the pmaup model the water allocation constraint w g is progressively strengthened to comply with alternative water reacquisition targets g and the resulting crop portfolio x g utility u g and gva v a g a function of the gross margin z 1 g and hired labor z 4 g are estimated these variables contain the necessary information to reveal i the foregone income and ii the compensating variation that addresses the foregone utility these two measures serve as a basis to assess the economy wide repercussions of water buyback in a cge environment the foregone income is used to estimate the consequences on the supply side through a productivity shock in the representative agricultural firm while the compensating variation is used to assess the consequences on the demand side through a money transfer to the representative agent in murcia 4 1 the supply shock in the microeconomic model the gva v a g in murcia for every reacquisition target g is obtained aggregating the simulated gross margin z 1 g and labor income a function of hired labor z 4 g 31 v

that of the baseline scenario without buyback g 0 although the foregone income is in principle more easily observable to the buyer principal than foregone utility using a method that accounts for changes in utility instead of changes in income yields more accurate and typically lower compensation estimates this is explained by the tradeoff between risk and management complexity aversion on the one hand and profit on the other in the multi attribute microeconomic model as a result water uses displaying high income but high risk and management complexity can yield a relatively low marginal utility and compensating variation and vice versa uses with low income but low risk and management complexity attached can still yield a high marginal utility and compensating variation for a detailed discussion on the compensation estimation method choice the reader may refer to pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 the compensating variation for a given reacquisition target c v g is obtained in the microeconomic model as follows 34 c v g e u 0 w g e u 0 w 0 where e represents an expenditure function i e the minimum amount of money agents would need to attain the initial utility u 0 given a water constraint w g in the baseline scenario g 0 the expenditure function equals 0 for consistency the compensating variation stemming from the pmaup model is divided by the baseline gva in the pmaup model and the resulting percentage is multiplied by the baseline gva in the cge model to estimate the equivalent compensating variation in the macroeconomic context δ g 35 δ g c v g v a 0 v a g a g r m u r compensations to irrigators are represented in the cge macroeconomic context through an income transfer to the representative agent in murcia t g income transfers can be operated through an annuity payment or a lump sum transfer since the capitalization rate that applies to agricultural assets in spain has been volatile during the financial crisis boe 2015 an annuity payment that removes discount rate uncertainty was preferred in this case note that the marginal cost of the public funds scheme and the corresponding distortion of resource allocation is endogenous in the cge model and is captured by the adjustment in the relative prices once the transfer from the rest of spain to the murcia region is set economic agents change their decision according to their new income budget constraint when ex ante designing the policy an analyst may be tempted to equalize income transfers to expected compensating variations however cge models work on realized values which typically do not match expected compensating variations due to information asymmetry this leads to some degree of agency costs θ 1 iftekhar et al 2013 36 t g θ δ g the potential for rent extraction is conditional

income transfer to the representative agent in a macroeconomic context and finds a new equilibrium the economy wide impacts of water buyback are estimated as the difference between the gva of the economic sectors and regions in spain for each water reacquisition target and that of the baseline without water buyback 5 case study area the region of murcia in spain the region of murcia is located in southeastern spain within the boundaries of the absolute water scarce segura river basin murcia has a surface of 11 313 km2 a population of 1 5 million inhabitants and a gdp per capita of eur 19

numbers are not consecutive because they indicate the numbering within the segura river basin which also includes awdus outside the murcia region displays the awdus in the murcia region the worsening water crisis and difficulties to deploy more restrictive caps and charging arrangements led the segura river basin to pioneer water purchase tenders in the eu srba 2014 two buyback tenders for the temporary reacquisition 1 year of water rights from rice farms upstream were implemented during the 2007 2008 drought tenders had a budget of eur 700 000 and envisaged a maximum purchase price of eur 0 18 m3 in 2007 the first tender consumed eur 495 000 to purchase 2 93 million m3 at an average price of eur 0 17 m3 similar results were obtained in the 2008 tender both water reacquisitions were fully used to enhance environmental flows garrido et al 2013 recent research in awdus of the region of murcia has estimated the annuity payment of buyback programmes to inform the design of purchase tenders in the area martínez granados and calatrava 2014 pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 yet a major and persisting concern relates to the economy wide repercussions of water buyback the region of murcia is highly dependent on agriculture which represents around 4 4 of regional gdp and 10 4 of regional employment as compared to 2 3 and 4 at a national level ine 2017 food industry and tourism closely connected to the agricultural sector account for 4 5 and 5 6 of the gdp respectively ine 2017 relevant feedbacks on the output of economic sectors in the region which are yet to be estimated can be anticipated from this sectoral gdp distribution 6 results methods are illustrated with an application to the murcia region in se spain the pmaup is calibrated for the 55 awdus in the area following the methodology in section 2 the parameterization results of the utility function of each awdu and the corresponding calibration residuals come from pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 and can be also consulted in the on line supplementary material a series of simulations are run in which the water allocation constraint is strengthened in every awdu limiting water availability precludes some portfolio choices and has a negative impact on the utility of agents through a reduced provision of valuable attributes including profit agents readjust their crop portfolio according to their objective function and the new water constraint for every simulation resolved the foregone income and compensating variation are estimated results from microeconomic simulations are then elaborated to obtain the productivity shock and the annuity that feed the cge model the macroeconomic simulation runs a comparative statics exercise to assess regional and sectorial gva changes considering eight alternative water reacquisition targets 50 4 of water allocation in the baseline 100 8 150 12 200 16 250 20 300 24 350 28 and 400 32 million m3 the economic repercussions of water reacquisitions are assessed following two alternative criteria i a cost effective criterion ce in which priority in the reacquisition is given to those awdus where water is inexpensive and ii a proportional criterion pr in which the same proportion of the initial water allocation is purchased in each awdu the motivation for the inclusion of these two criteria lies on the heterogeneity of water if water was a homogeneous good with the same environmental value across murcia s awdus the first criterion should apply however this is not the case and purchase tenders focusing on specific awdus may be necessary to restore preserve critical ecosystem services finally a major concern in water reacquisitions regards agency costs due to information asymmetry irrigators may perceive a compensation that is not consistent with the shadow price of water increasing the cost of the buyback program and or limiting its scope and henceforth the extent of ecosystem services delivered three agency costs scenarios are defined based on the values reported in the literature θ 1 no agency costs case 1 θ 1 5 case 2 and θ 2 case 3 iftekhar et al 2013 martínez granados and calatrava 2014 pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 zuo et al 2015 6 1 microeconomic assessment initially agents react to the new water allocation constraint substituting irrigated crops in the margin by less water demanding or rainfed crops that yield slightly lower utility levels when the water reacquisition target becomes more stringent though agents are constrained to sacrifice increasingly valuable crops and utility losses amplify this process is visible in fig 3 which displays the compensating variation m3 in the 55 awdus for 8 reacquisition targets as utility decreases so does income one of the critical attributes determining utility fig 4 in some simulations the objective function cannot be resolved within the domain n a value in the legend this is largely the consequence of the ligneous crops surface thresholds set in the model 4 4 uprooting fruit trees would result in disinvestments with negative impacts on future market and non market ecosystem services income the latter not being accounted for in the model alternatively water requirement for fruit trees could be reduced resulting in yield losses but preserving the trees but this necessitates yield functions that are challenging to implement in the pmaup model not the least due to the limited hard data available consequently a minimum surface threshold has been set for ligneous crops which have to remain above 90 of their original surface and happens with 40 of awdus when water allocation is reduced by 32 400 million m3 a maximum threshold for water reacquisition targets is fixed at this value overall surface water reliant awdus in upstream catchments display less productive crop portfolios and lower purchase prices compared to those located downstream focusing water purchase tenders on upstream areas may improve environmental flows along the basin at the least cost ce criterion however complementary purchase tenders may be necessary in other areas to restore the balance locally e g aquifers tributary rivers the results obtained above for every awdu are aggregated to obtain the inputs for the cge model table 1 displays the foregone income and compensating variation as a percentage of murcia s agricultural gva in the baseline for alternative reacquisition targets and design ce and pr in the case of no agency costs θ 1 not surprisingly the pr scheme shows higher compensating variation and income losses than the ce scheme in absolute value income losses are greater than the compensating variation in both schemes as the water allocation constraint is strengthened an increasing share of land is devoted to less water intensive and rainfed crops which yield a lower expected income but typically also higher risk and management complexity avoidance two valuable attributes that mitigate the negative impact income losses have on utility the opposite may happen and the compensating variation can be greater than income losses absolute values where agency costs are considered 6 2 macroeconomic assessment in the pmaup model agents choices are taken within a static macroeconomic scenario with exogenous prices a reasonable assumption for the small awdus of murcia gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 when the productivity and income shocks stemming from the pmaup model are aggregated for the entire murcia s agricultural sector and translated into the cge model the macroeconomic scenario is not anymore given but reacts through changes in relative prices triggering the reaction of other economic sectors agents and regions consistent with the permanent nature of the reacquisitions the model assumes a flexible cge setting with a medium to long term focus where labor and capital are perfectly mobile between sectors and cet elasticity for labor and capital mobility within spain is minus two this value is consistent with previous cge studies assuming a flexible economic system at the sub country level carrera et al 2015 koks et al 2015 accordingly regional and sectorial gva changes in this comparative statics exercise should be also understood in a medium to long term context the regionalized cge model explores the macroeconomic impacts of murcia s water buyback programme across sectors and regions of spain through a series of simulations fig 5 displays simulation results in the agriculture a food industry b services c and aggregate gdp d for all water targets 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 and 400 million m3 ce and pr reacquisition schemes and agency cost cases 1 2 and 3 the microeconomic results in table 1 are amplified in the macroeconomic assessment for example for the most ambitious reacquisition target in the pr scheme and no agency costs case murcia s agricultural income experiences a 33 contraction as compared to 20 5 in the microeconomic model sectors that are strongly linked to agriculture like food industry also experience relevant losses in murcia up to 4 gva as opposed to the gva losses experienced by murcia agricultural gva elsewhere in spain increases by 37 aggregate agricultural gva in spain still decreases by almost 1 5 and the service sector by almost 02 this is partly the result of a substitution effect led by the reallocation of agricultural supply from murcia towards other economic sectors and regions of spain on the other hand the contraction of the spanish aggregate income limits the rise of the gva in the rest of spain resulting in an income effect that counterbalances the substitution effect the trade off between substitution and income effects is typical of this dynamic macroeconomic scenario where flexible prices determine the adjustment of trading flows the underlying reallocation of primary factors is critical to understand these effects consumers substitute goods from murcia with goods produced elsewhere and not affected by the negative productivity shock thus increasing the firms demand for capital and labor in the rest of spain this leads to a shift of capital and labor force from murcia to the rest of spain where capital and workers can find higher remunerations as a result murcia experiences a substantial gdp loss up to 2 1 while gdp increases in the rest of spain up to 0 034 overall the policy has a negative impact on spanish gdp although limited up to 0 023 not surprisingly the pr scheme has a more negative impact than the ce it is worth noting that higher agency costs do not influence the effects on spanish aggregate gdp but have implications for its spatial distribution mitigating losses in murcia and diminishing gains in other spanish regions it should be also noted that relative changes in food industry and services exhibit nonlinear and non monotonous patterns this is due to the reallocation of primary factors and the resultant redistribution of trade in the different scenarios agency costs mitigate murcia s losses in the services sector and the overall economy but have a negligible impact on agriculture and food industry where results for the three agency costs scenarios are similar fig 6 assesses policy impacts looking at the equivalent variation conceptually the equivalent variation is similar to the compensating variation but it is applied at the macroeconomic level to assess welfare impacts it represents the amount of income that keeps the utility of the agent of the cge model equal to that of the baseline and is mainly driven by final consumption a negative sign denotes a welfare loss as compared to the baseline welfare effects at a regional and national level are also explained by the movements of primary factors and the re composition of trade in the different scenarios which depends on the armington elasticities whose coefficients differ for every sector this leads to non linear adjustment and non monotonicity in murcia the income transfer from the rest of spain is insufficient to fully compensate the negative impact of reacquisitions resulting in a welfare loss in most macroeconomic scenarios only for a few reacquisition targets 200 350 and 400 million m3 and for the highest level of agency costs case 3 the income transfer leaves the representative agent with a welfare level comparable or higher to that of the baseline the rest of spain finds itself worse off in terms of welfare in several scenarios despite the gdp increase on the one hand the income transfer in murcia increases imports from the rest of spain especially agricultural products which are cheaper since the production has not been negatively affected by the productivity shock on the other this is possible because the rest of spain finances the consumption of murcia through the income transfer thus decreasing its own welfare impacts on the rest of spain are a function of agency costs with welfare gains where there are no agency costs and welfare losses where agency costs are high again the size of agency costs does not affect aggregate welfare impacts on spain and the pr scheme is more detrimental for welfare than the ce scheme 7 discussion simulation results show that the economy wide repercussions of water buyback are relevant and range between 33 and 19 33 agricultural gva losses in the murcia region for the most ambitious reacquisition target 400 million m3 significantly higher than the gva losses estimated in the microeconomic model up to 20 5 for the same scenario this amplification effect is the result of the reallocation of primary factors from murcia to the rest of spain modelled in the cge context despite compensations paid to local irrigators murcia s supply contraction in the agricultural and related economic sectors leads to an overall gdp loss in the region between 1 and 2 1 the remaining spanish regions partially fill in the supply gap and experience an agricultural gdp increase between 0 21 and 0 37 and an overall gdp increase between 0 012 and 0 034 which is nonetheless insufficient to compensate gdp losses in murcia resulting in a limited net gdp loss in the spanish economy between 0 013 and 0 023 for the most ambitious target welfare effects can be unevenly distributed between murcia and the rest of spain with winners and losers depending on the size of the agency costs results support the decision to develop investment plans flanking measures to address the economy wide impacts of buyback particularly in affected rural economies and related economic sectors such as food industry previous applied research on the economy wide impacts of agricultural water buyback programmes is limited and focuses on the australian case dixon et al 2011 2012a analyze the economy wide impacts of the water buyback programme in the southern murray darling basin using a sub national cge model for australia that incorporates water as a primary factor thus making water trading simulations feasible results show that the reacquisition of 1 500 million m3 22 8 of initial water allotments to restore the balance in the southern murray darling basin has a marginal impact at the national level 0 006 of gdp in the segura river basin restoring the balance would demand the reacquisition of 250 million m3 15 9 of initial water allotments our results suggest this policy would have an impact on the spanish gdp comparable to the australian case 0 011 in the pr scheme and 0 004 in the ce scheme but a significantly higher cost per m3 of water reacquired 0 21 in the ce and 0 51 in the pr as compared to 0 05 in australia in 2015 prices this is largely explained by the distinct ability of the agricultural sectors in the southern murray darling basin and murcia to absorb the shock following the reacquisitions agricultural output falls by 1 3 in southern murray darling basin as compared to between 16 pr and 6 5 ce in murcia in addition farmers in the murray darling basin increase their consumption and welfare following the buyback while the opposite situation is registered in most scenarios in murcia two elements appear crucial to explain the differences between our results and those of dixon et al 2012a 2011 i the existence of water markets in australia and ii the coupling method used in our approach which allows for a more detailed representation of the motivations and constraints faced by farmers in a market environment buyback constrains supply and increases water prices and farmers can leverage on this opportunity to increase consumption and welfare this is not the case in europe where water markets do not exist and prices are administrative charges that do not respond to the scarcity value of water the second key element is the coupling the spatial resolution in the sub national australian cge model does not offer the same level of detail than a locally calibrated microeconomic model such as the pmaup model for murcia the southern half of the large murray darling basin 1 061 469 km2 is divided into 13 units in dixon et al 2012a 2011 while murcia which covers an area equaling 1 of the murray darling basin s territory 11 313 km2 is divided in 55 units in our study the microeconomic analysis makes possible the use of mathematical programming methods to elicit the parameters of agents objective functions and allows for a more detailed representation of the motivations and constraints faced by irrigators the australian cge model does not consider these constraints and risks to overestimate irrigators capacity to shift capital labor and land from one land use to another as wittwer 2012 points out a finer regional division in cge models is desirable for three reasons i more detailed regional results ii environmental issues such as water management often call for smaller regions that can map watershed or other natural boundaries more closely and iii more and smaller regions give a greater sense of geographical realism the coupling between the pmaup and the regionally calibrated cge model is a first step in this direction although macroeconomic models have been previously used to assess the economy wide impacts of fiscal policy schemes and water markets to the best of our knowledge this is the first applied study of the economy wide impacts of buyback policies outside australia the most plausible explanation to this gap is the difficulty to accurately simulate the price and value share to water and water reallocation among users outside of a market environment some macroeconomic models have been developed to inform irrigation water reallocation in the eu context and elsewhere see e g hertel and liu 2016 even if the focus of these studies is different from ours they can provide useful insights and policy implications for our work for instance insights from other macroeconomic models can be useful to inform policy sequencing in water reacquisitions water market scenarios for europe unequivocally show an increase in gva through water reallocation to more productive uses dudu and chumi 2008 suggesting water trading could help mitigate the gva losses associated to buyback programmes on the other hand this very mechanism increases shadow prices darwin et al 1995 dixon et al 2012a and thus the overall cost of buyback for taxpayers a sensible water policy reform consistent with the cost effectiveness rationale that governs eu water policy ec 2000 may need to consider alternative policy sequencings to the australian case to enhance acceptability e g commencing reacquisitions before developing full fledged water markets in addition to its economy wide impacts water buyback can also involve wider environmental consequences beyond the target basin because of the spatial redistribution of production for example cazcarro et al 2014 show that a combination of water tariffs and subsidies on food production can save water in the water scarce regions of southern spain murcia and andalusia and enhance food production in the water abundant regions of the north cantabria and basque country in our assessment water conservation targets in murcia are achieved at the expense of a significant decrease in the agricultural output which is replaced by higher agricultural production elsewhere although we are not able to precise water use patterns in the remaining spanish regions the agricultural production increase is more pronounced in northern regions such as asturias cantabria and aragón where water is relatively more abundant pointing towards a pattern similar to that of cazcarro et al 2014 however as higher value added and water intensive crops are affected by the reacquisition transferring their production to northern regions may become increasingly unfeasible due to climatic and agronomic constrains as a result water use may increase in other water scarce southern regions that resemble the physical and socioeconomic conditions of the region of murcia exacerbating water overallocation problems there for a discussion on the policy implications of implementing agricultural water buyback schemes including an analysis on the feasibility of the beneficiary pays approach adopted by this instrument we refer the reader to pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 8 conclusions coupling the pmaup and cge models makes feasible a detailed analysis of the tradeoffs in water conservation from the sub regional awdu to the regional national and supranational scale methods are general and replicable in other areas where water markets are non existent or in an early stage of development and ex post trading data is not readily available future research can focus on i addressing the current limitations of the micro and macro economic models and ii expanding the methodological framework the current version of the pmaup relies on a validated projection method to reveal the efficient frontier but recent developments in the field could help to minimize the approximation error see e g gómez limón et al 2016b also the calibration residual could be reduced finding alternative and or complementary attributes in the objective function that are relevant in explaining agents decisions although this is ultimately constrained by data availability the cge model could be improved introducing temporal dynamics to examine the transition pathway towards the new equilibrium and identify potential trade offs between short and long run effects which could be relevant for policy implementation in exploring transition pathways the sequential coupling and comparative statics used in this paper could be replaced with a recursive coupling where agents in the pmaup model adapt to the new macroeconomic scenario until convergence is reached while comparative statics is often used to assess the impact of one time permanent policies such as buyback a recursive model would allow a better representation of temporary or recurrent policies e g water charging from the data perspective water satellite accounts at a sectorial level where available could be used to analyze simultaneously the macroeconomic propagation of the policy and water use changes in economic sectors other than irrigators in murcia e g through input output coefficients the current methodological framework could be also expanded including a hydrological module that accounts for catchment specific characteristics and system dynamics e g percolation runoff and localizes water flows and water conservation across the basin this information is instrumental to assess the environmental outputs of the policy and to estimate its economic benefits through non market valuation methods

11183,little is known about the economy wide repercussions of water buyback which may include relevant feedbacks on the output of economic sectors at a regional and supra regional scale limited studies available rely on stand alone computable general equilibrium cge models that represent competition for water explicitly but this approach presents significant data and methodological challenges in areas where mature water markets are not in place the case of most regions worldwide to bridge this gap this paper couples a microeconomic positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup model that elicits the value and price share to water with a macroeconomic regionally calibrated cge model for spain methods are illustrated with a case study in the murcia region in southeastern spain economy wide feedbacks amplify income losses in murcia s agriculture from 20 5 in the pmaup model up to 33 in the coupled pmaup cge model compensations paid to irrigators enhance demand in the region but supply contraction in agriculture and related sectors lead to overall gdp losses up to 2 1 in most scenarios the supply gap is partially filled in by other spanish regions which experience a gdp gain through a substitution effect up to 034 in all scenarios aggregate gdp for spain decreases up to 023 keywords mathematical programming cge water buyback spain 1 introduction water institutions are increasingly reliant on the reacquisition or buyback of water rights to restore the balance in overexploited basins buyback programmes are operated through purchase tenders that compensate farmers who choose to relinquish their rights to withdraw water complemented with flanking measures to address negative feedbacks on agriculture and related economic sectors at a regional and supra regional scale dsewpac 2016 grba 2008 hanak and stryjewski 2012 an expanding research analyses the interaction between user level choices and tender design to limit information rents and prevent overcompensation iftekhar et al 2013 qureshi et al 2009 wheeler et al 2013 zuo et al 2015 less is known however about the economy wide impacts of buyback despite the large amount of resources committed to mitigate them for example the buyback programme of the upper guadiana river basin in spain projected an investment of eur 3 billion along a 20 year transition period of which only 33 addressed purchase tenders directly while the remaining 67 envisaged flanking measures to compensate for negative feedbacks including subsidies for economic diversification and new transportation communication and energy infrastructures grba 2008 in australia s murray darling basin an investment of aud 3 1 billion for the reacquisition of 1500 million m3 from irrigators was complemented with an irrigation modernization programme worth aud 7 36 billion aiming to i compensate for negative feedbacks through enhanced productivity and ii limit water use by another 1900 million m3 department of the environment 2015 dsewpac 2016 although the achievement of the latter target has been questioned australian parliament 2017 research available on the topic relies on theoretical models marchiori et al 2012 or computable general equilibrium cge models applied to the australian case dixon et al 2012a 2011 use a dynamic cge model containing water accounts to analyze the effects of an illustrative buyback scheme in the southern murray darling basin simulation results show that contrary to what could be expected buyback has a positive impact on the regional economy and a negative albeit marginal one at a national level this is explained by supply demand interaction in water markets which lead to higher prices that i increase net exports of water and consumption and ii cause a reallocation of farm production factors that partially compensates for the negative impact on agricultural output notably the adjustment dynamics of the model relies on the existence of full fledged water markets a prerequisite that holds only in australia chile and the semi arid states of western us in most regions and countries today allocation rules are still conditioned by historical rights and queuing and prices represent administrative charges to partially recover the cost of conveying water to users oecd 2015 in this context attempts to model competition for water explicitly in a cge environment must rely on estimations that assign a price and value share to water see e g darwin et al 1995 which is challenging due to the limited information available more importantly recent research rightly claims that the shadow price of water must correspond to the gap between irrigated and rainfed production to pay for the returns to water which is often not reflected in value and price estimations hertel and liu 2016 addressing this methodological challenge in a cge environment calls for an alternative approach that models water competition implicitly e g through irrigated land calzadilla et al 2011 taheripour et al 2013 or virtual water cazcarro et al 2014 which however is inadequate to model and inform water purchase tenders and thus the economy wide impact of buyback programmes in the absence of water markets or data sources with equivalent information an economy wide assessment of buyback programmes may require the macroeconomic model to be simulated in concert with a complementary bottom up model that supplies the missing information this makes possible to bridge the scale gap and adapt the analysis on the varied and asymmetric welfare impacts to the more convenient scale or decision unit a wide range of applications coupling bottom up with macroeconomic models can be found in the literature and not only related to water issues bottom up models can be bio physical carrera et al 2015 or microeconomic such as agent based husby 2016 chap 7 or mathematical programming methods baghersad and zobel 2015 while macroeconomic approaches typically include cge or input output io models the choice of bottom up and macroeconomic model varies depending on the research focus data availability and policy experiment cge models are preferred over io where price dynamics are expected to be relevant as happens with policies involving large reallocations of physical and financial resources such as buyback and to examine the medium and long run effects dudu and chumi 2008 on the other hand microeconomic mathematical programming methods are the approach typically used to model agents motives and behavior in agricultural economics graveline 2016 one straightforward way to combine the complementary outputs of micro and macro economic models is to solve both models independently where available and use results to inform water policy however the different foundations of both approaches individual behavior in narrowly defined markets in microeconomic models v structure and behavior of a whole economy in macroeconomic ones can lead to conflicting outcomes and raise consistency issues pindyck 2015 using a holistic approach that solves both models together allows a detailed representation of causal relationships and interdependencies and ensures consistency but making the complex internal optimization procedures of micro and macro economic models compatible will demand oversimplification as happens with holistic hydroeconomic models that represent farmers behavior through piecewise exogenous benefit functions that relate water use to profit harou et al 2009 modular approaches run the two models independently in a recursive or sequential fashion which increases the probability of convergence on an optimal solution and the level of detail in each sub field at the expense of a less thorough representation of causality and interdependencies between models singh 2012 while the use of both holistic and modular approaches is widely reported in hybrid models literature the coupling of computationally demanding macroeconomic models with bottom up models is typically conducted using a modular approach carrera et al 2015 grames et al 2016 this paper presents a methodological framework that utilizes a modular approach to connect in a sequential fashion a microeconomic positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup model with a macroeconomic cge model to assess the local and economy wide impacts of agricultural water buyback the microeconomic pmaup model makes possible a realistic representation of intricate water allocation mechanisms based on queuing and historical rights charged by the administration and a detailed assessment of farmers motives and behavior bringing positivism and high spatial resolution to the design of buyback scenarios while the cge model feeds on the simulation outputs from the pmuap model to assess the spread and intensity of the policy shock throughout spatial units economic sectors and macroeconomic agents methods are illustrated with an application to the region of murcia in southeastern spain the pmaup model is calibrated at an agricultural water demand unit awdu scale a basic agricultural unit in spain that encompasses irrigation communities with a common source of water and similar administrative and hydrological characteristics srba 2015a on the other hand cge models typically work at a national or supranational scale although some examples considering the sub national regions within a country or a group of countries can be found in australia wittwer and horridge 2010 europe brandsma et al 2015 us dixon et al 2012a russia bohringer et al 2014 and china horridge and wittwer 2008 this work relies on the intertemporal computable equilibrium system ices a global cge model that has been used extensively to assess the macro economic impacts of climate change and to evaluate different environmental and climate policies see e g parrado and de cian 2014 for the purpose of this research the model has been calibrated for 17 sub national units

to autonomous communities and cities and nuts 3 to provinces eurostat 2016 level in spain this bridges the scale gap and makes feasible the coupling between both models which is resolved in two steps in the first step the water constraint is progressively strengthened in the pmaup model to assess agents awdus responses to buyback and reveal i the foregone income and ii the compensating variation that addresses foregone utility or shadow price of water this step relies on previous work by pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 in the second step the foregone income and compensating variation obtained for every agent are aggregated at a regional level and reproduced in a macroeconomic context through two shocks i a shock on production based on the foregone income and ii a shock on the income of the representative agent in the cge model resulting from the water sales a function of the compensating variation the economy wide repercussions of water buyback are estimated as the difference between the economic output of the economic sectors and regions under selected water reacquisition targets and that of the baseline without buyback the paper is structured as follows sections 2 3 and 4 constitute the methodological part of the paper and introduce the pmaup model the cge model and the coupling approach respectively section 5 presents the case study area the region of murcia in spain section 6 illustrates the methods with an application to the case study area section 7 discusses the results and section 8 concludes 2 the microeconomic module positive multi attribute utility programming the microeconomic model used in this paper builds on the axioms of revealed preference houthakker 1950 samuelson 1938 to elicit an objective function that is both consistent with an observed and finite set of choices and prices afriat 1967 and suitable as a basis for empirical analysis in agricultural water management gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 the theory of revealed preference originates in samuelson s 1938 pure theory of consumer behavior which derived testable implications of rational consumption behavior and demand for two different budget sets without the need to postulate a utility function to represent agent s preferences giving rise to the weak axiom of revealed preference samuelson 1948 1938 later on houthakker 1950 introduced the strong axiom of revealed preference sarp which uses transitivity to derive testable implications of rational consumption for any budget sets houthakker also established a close link between the axioms about demand and those about preferences by showing that in order to satisfy sarp demand functions must be the observable result of the optimization of preferences subject to agent s budgetary constraint the theoretical foundation for revealed preference theory provided by houthakker 1950 and samuelson 1948 1938 assumes a complete description of a demand system that gives quantities as a function of every possible budget and price the key development in applied revealed preference research is offered by afriat 1967 who develops a utility function consistent with agent s choices from an observed finite dataset of prices and choices providing the basis to estimate aggregate consumer demand functions christensen et al 1975 although the first revealed preference applications date from the 1970s battalio et al 1973 the large computational power and hard micro data necessary to implement revealed preference models have limited empirical analyses vermeulen 2012 yet these barriers appear to be subsiding in 2005 varian 2006 conducted a search on revealed preference in jstor business and economics journals and found 997 results in early 2018 the same search found 8866 results

strengthened to estimate i the foregone income and ii the compensating variation that addresses foregone utility or shadow price of water the price and value share to water thus revealed were found consistent with those observed in previous reacquisitions garrido et al 2013 and other works in the area using positive mathematical programming martínez granados and calatrava 2014 this paper relies on the estimations by pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 to feed a series of simulations in a cge environment through the development of a coupled pmaup cge model in order to assess the economy wide repercussions of agricultural water buyback 2 1 objective function in irrigated agriculture agent observed choices are a combination of crop mix and timing water application and capital stock just 1975 literature often simplifies this complex decision process by representing each possible combination of crops timing water application and capital as a separate crop with unique features so that the optimization problem is reduced to a choice on the crop portfolio x within a domain f x where the crop portfolio x is a vector representing the land share devoted to each individual crop x i such that 1 x f x 0 x i 1 i 1 n x i 1 the agent does not have direct preferences over the crop portfolio itself but over the utility this crop portfolio will return in terms of the provision of valuable attributes applied models to simulate farmer s behavior often assume that farmers are rational profit maximizers and therefore utility equals profit u π although this approach usually leads to significant divergence between observed and simulated behavior more robust theoretical frameworks assume agent s behavior can be modeled by means of maximizing a utility function where profits are the relevant attribute as in expected utility von neumann and morgenstern 1953 and positive mathematical programming howitt 1995 since the 1970s a growing research body known as the theory of planned behavior tpb has disputed that farmers behavior can be modeled maximizing profits or a utility function where profits are the single relevant attribute ajzen 1991 harman et al 1972 instead these authors argue that farmers behavior is driven by multiple and often conflicting attributes related to socioeconomic cultural and natural features including but not limited to profit recent empirical evidence shows that the variance in farmers intentions and observed strategic and entrepreneurial conduct are largely explained by farmers attitudes towards their behavior basarir and gillespie 2006 berkhout et al 2010 attitudes can be seen as a summary of psychological evaluations based on agent s beliefs about the goodness or badness of an object normally associated with a particular attribute gómez limón et al 2016 if farmers beliefs concerning multiple attributes govern decision making modeling farmers behavior requires the consideration of more than one attribute through a multi attribute utility function where relevant attributes are included keeney and raiffa 1993 rational economic agents will choose the crop portfolio x that maximizes the utility from the provision of relevant attributes z x within a domain f x 2 m a x u x x u z 1 x z 2 x z 3 x z m x 3 s t 0 x i 1 4 i 1 n x i 1 5 x f x 6 z z x r m attributes are quantities of dimension one the result of dividing observed attribute values by the maximum feasible value they can attain and are defined so that more is better i e increasing the provision of one attribute improves agent s utility provided the remaining attributes are kept constant assuming attributes are measurable alternative crop portfolios can be ranked in accordance to the utility they yield there is no risk of correlation among attributes since the outcome of the utility function is an ordinal value edgeworth 1881 this means that the model is not concerned about total utility or levels of utility but rather about ranking alternative decisions so that they are coherent with observed choices rational agents will then cultivate the crop portfolio that maximizes utility within a domain defined by a set of quantifiable restrictions notably agronomic features land constraints know how policy restrictions e g common agricultural policy and water allocation the latter can be represented as 7 i 1 n w i x i w where water availability per hectare is denoted by w w i is the water required by crop x i per hectare in revealing agent s preferences the pmaup model follows a positive approach implying that the optimal solution to the problem above should be as closed as possible to the observed choice or crop portfolio x 0 afriat 1967 the pmaup model thus aims to recover an objective function that is consistent with x 0 and the choice domain f x so that it can be used to forecast future behavior varian 2006 following standard microeconomic theory the parameters of a utility function can be elicited for a given set of attributes equalizing the marginal rate of transformation m r t k p which represents the opportunity cost between two attributes z p z k and is obtained as the slope of the efficient frontier β k p and the marginal rate of substitution m r s k p which represents the willingness to sacrifice one unit of attribute z p for one unit of attribute z k 8 m r t k p β k p m r s k p u z p u z k p k the utility function is parameterized in three steps which are explained in detail in the next sections i efficient frontiers are elicited for each pair of attributes using numerical methods and the tangency point that serves as a landing point for the utility function s indifference curve is obtained ii given a tangency point and a functional form the utility function parameters are calibrated for every possible combination of attributes equalizing the m r t k p and the m r s k p iii error terms are obtained as the distance between observed and simulated choices the utility function with the lowest error contains the relevant attributes and is the one used in the simulations 2 2 marginal rate of transformation observed decisions of rational agents must be efficient i e they must belong to the pareto efficient set or efficient frontier therefore among all feasible choices we are only interested in revealing those along the efficient frontier where the agent maximizes utility in a multi attribute context the efficient frontier represents the maximum value of attribute z p rational agents can attain for a given value of attribute z k within the domain real life efficient frontiers cannot be analytically defined using a closed function andré 2009 instead numerical methods through an optimization procedure are typically used as follows 9 m a x z p x x 10 s t z k x c k p c 0 1 11 0 x i 1 12 i 1 n x i 1 13 x f x where c 0 1 is a finite set that determines the values of attribute z k for which the values of attribute z p are projected to the frontier recall attributes are values of dimension one solving the optimization problem above we obtain an efficient frontier in the two dimensional space τ z p z k x where x is the set of crop choices delivering a provision of attributes z p z k along the frontier literature offers a number of alternatives to estimate the tangency or landing point for the utility function sumpsi et al 1997 maximize each attribute z k z p separately within the domain to calculate the pay off matrix i e the maximum value each attribute can attain within the domain and approximate the efficient frontier through a hyper plane connecting two efficient points included in the pay off matrix segment formed by points a and b in two dimensions in fig 1 case 1 andré and riesgo 2007 project the observed choice to the closest efficient point x i e along the efficiency frontier which is then used as a reference point to obtain a compromise set consisting of a set of efficient points in the vicinity the compromise set is interpreted as the piece of the efficient frontier where the utility function is maximized then the tangency point for the indifference curve is obtained regressing a hyper plane from the compromise set segment formed by points a and b in fig 1 case 2 finally gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 obtain the maximum feasible value of attribute z p for the observed value of z k i e c z k o in eq 10 and vice versa and again use a hyper plane connecting the two points to approximate the efficient frontier segment formed by points a and b in fig 1 case 3 all these methods obtain the efficient frontier and tangency points from linear combinations of two efficient points admittedly efficient frontiers are convex otherwise there is no tradeoff and the choice between the two attributes becomes irrelevant this means that the hyper planes connecting efficient points will not belong to the actual efficient set x and will lead to approximation errors distance between the segment ab and x in fig 1 positive multi attribute models typically rely on the methods described in cases 1 3 to reveal the tangency points consistent with pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 this paper follows the method by gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 which minimizes the approximation error for the database used solving the optimization problem in eqs 9 13 for the observed values of each pair of attributes z k and z p i e z k o and z p o yields two efficient points namely τ z p z k o and τ z p o z k points a and b in fig 1 case 3 the slope in any intermediate point τ between the two projected efficient points or m r t k p is obtained as follows 14 m r t k p τ β k p τ z p z p o z k z k o β k p τ provides a reliable estimate gutiérrez martín et al 2014 for the tangency point which is used for the calibration of the utility function 2 3 marginal rate of substitution the marginal rate of substitution m r s k p measures the willingness to sacrifice one unit of attribute z p for one unit of attribute z k which graphically corresponds to the slope of the indifference or isoutility curve m r s k p u z p u z k see eq 8 rational economic agents will choose the crop portfolio where the m r s k p over the indifference curve equals the m r t k p over the efficient frontier for any pair of attributes see eq 8 similarly to afriat s 1967 model for the case of single attribute utility functions the methodology presented here can be used to calibrate a utility function consistent with observed choices and the domain typically there will be several utility functions available for the case of single attribute utility functions varian 1982 presented a way to describe the entire set of utility functions consistent with observed preferences while varian 1983 obtained bounds on specific functional forms for the case of multi attribute utility functions the information provided by the m r t k p and m r s k p makes feasible the elicitation of the function parameters consistent with observed choices within the domain f x for a given functional form considered for the application presented here it is assumed that the multi attribute utility function adopts a cobb douglas specification which offers a sensible approximation to actual farmers behavior sampson 1999 as compared to alternative additive or multiplicative additive specifications a cobb douglas function offers the advantages of decreasing marginal utility for each attribute and the existence of a global optimum inada 1963 following a cobb douglas specification the objective function in eq 2 can now be represented as 15 u p 1 m z p α p x p 1 m α p 1 where α p are the objective function parameters or alpha values by means of equalizing the m r s k p of a cobb douglas function and the m r t k p obtained in the previous section the objective function parameters can be estimated solving the following system of equations 16 m r s k p α p α k z k z p β k p m r t k p p k 17 p 1 m α p 1 the values of the parameters obtained resolving the system of equations above for alternative attribute combinations within the set z x are used in eqs 2 6 to simulate the optimal crop portfolio choice x and obtain the corresponding attribute values z p p 1 m and utility u 2 4 relevant attributes and utility function parameters rational agents cultivate the portfolio of crops that maximizes the utility obtained from the attributes they value therefore the relevant attributes are those that minimize the distance between observed and calibrated behavior which is measured through a calibration residual obtained as the ordinary arithmetic mean of two errors the first error captures the distance between the observed x o and simulated x crop portfolio 18 e x 1 n i 1 n x i o x i x i o 2 the second error captures the distance between observed z o and calibrated z attributes 19 e τ 1 m p 1 m z p o z p z p o 2 the relevant set of attributes minimizes the average calibration residual which is obtained as follows 20 e e x e τ 2 the set of attributes and corresponding parameter values that minimize the average calibration residual is the one used in the simulations 2 5 data agents in the pmaup model are the 55 agricultural water demand units awdus of the segura river basin located within the boundaries of the region of murcia aggregation of individual farmers to conform representative economic agents is well documented in the literature also through the use of awdus martínez granados and calatrava 2014 pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 the calibration year observed crop portfolio x o is 2013 data used in the pmaup model depends on the finite attributes set considered in the model calibration we explore five attributes based on a literature review on multi attribute utility functions see pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 these attributes include profit z 1 quantified through the gross variable margin risk avoidance z 2 obtained as the difference between the standard deviation of the crop portfolio that maximizes profit and that of an alternative portfolio x direct costs avoidance z 3 the difference between the per unit of revenue direct costs incurred in the management of the crop portfolio that maximizes profit and those of an alternative portfolio x hired labor avoidance z 4 the difference between the hired labor necessary to implement the crop portfolio that maximizes profit and that of an alternative portfolio x and family labor avoidance z 5 the difference between the hired labor necessary to implement the crop portfolio that maximizes profit and that of an alternative portfolio x data collection aims at supplying the necessary information to quantify the attributes listed above land use data per crop is obtained at a municipal level for the calibration

sectors regions and factors prices are flexible and adjust to the different impacts and policies to clear the markets and achieve a new equilibrium in which supply equals demand the regionalized ices is a neoclassical model perfect competition is assumed in all sectors of the economy factors are fully employed and investments are saving driven in this experiment we use a regionalized version of the model that includes the 17 nuts2 regions of spain the rest of europe and the rest of the world and seven economic sectors namely agriculture extraction food industry other industry utilities sector construction and services the main characteristics of demand and supply are described in the following sub sections 3 1 1 supply a representative firm in every region and sector minimizes costs

produced with a constant elasticity of substitution ces function that depends on v f primary factors f capital land labor and natural resources with sector specific elasticity of substitution σ j

factors are immobile with respect to the rest of europe and the rest of the world within each spanish region labor and capital can move across sectors while land is used in the agricultural sector only and natural resources in mining forestry and fishing sectors a constant elasticity of transformation cet function is implemented for the purpose of modelling regional labor and capital supply

q f d η f 1 η f η f η f 1 η f 0 where q f represents the supply in the sub country region s and in spain and w f their corresponding prices the elasticity of substitution η f falls within the interval 0 a higher absolute value indicates a higher interregional mobility while a null value denotes perfect immobility at the regional level consistently with previous studies carrera et al 2015 koks et al 2015 we set an intermediate value of minus two 3 1 2 demand final and intermediate goods can be traded in the domestic national and international market the demand side includes an upper and a lower bundle both thresholds postulate imperfect substitution between products coming from different spatial units countries and or regions according to the standard armington assumption armington 1969 in the upper level this is done by breaking agents demand for any commodity in two parts using a ces function d d j s and d m j s which are the domestic demand and the aggregate demand for imported products in region s and sector j respectively the representative agent in each region includes the household and the government for each economic sector the representative agent minimizes the total expenditure under the ces constraint on domestic and imported goods 26 m i n d d j s d m j s p d d j s d d j s p d m j s d m j s 27 s t d t o t j s g 1 d d j s d m j s σ j u p σ j u p 0 where d t o t

captures the imperfect substitution between domestic and imported commodities in the lower level the aggregate amount of imports d m j s are sourced from the country or the sub country region of origin the representative agent in each region and sector minimizes the expenditure for imports under a constant ratios of elasticities of substitution and homothetic cresh constraint cai and arora

the bi lateral imports and elasticities of substitution of region country s in sector j price indexes for the aggregate import composite is weighted by the three dimensional elasticity following the minimization problem in the two equations above the advantage to use the cresh function in the lower level consists in having a three dimensional elasticity σ j s s l o 0 which allows for more flexibility than ces to model the product substitutability for each couple of spatial units since theoretical and empirical evidence shows that trade is larger within national borders than across them given the same distance anderson et al 2003 mccallum 1995 intra national trade flows should be more fluid than international trade ones and this is guaranteed by setting a higher value of the cresh elasticity involving two spanish regions the income inc s of the representative agent in each sub national region or country is allocated in fixed proportions to private final consumption cons s government consumption gov s and saving save s 30 inc s cons s gov s save s the macro economic closure assumes that the investments are mobile at the international level global investments are equal to global savings and trade balance in each country region is given by the difference between regional country savings and investments 3 2 data the model uses information from the gtap 8 database narayanan et al 2012 the 8 1 version consists in a collection of social accounting matrices sams for 57 economic sectors and 134 countries or groups of countries in the world the reference year is 2007 we split the national sam of spain in the gtap database into 17 regions using information from spanish regional accounting ine 2017 and economic accounts for agriculture and structural business statistics eurostat 2016 to do this first we match the sectors of the gtap database with those of our data sources then for each sector the regional shares of value added and accordingly of labor capital land and natural resources are computed using the sub national data finally these shares are used to distribute original country level data across sub national units a detailed description of the methodology is available in bosello and standardi 2015 ine 2017 provides information on both capital and labor at the sectoral level for some manufacturing activities we referred to structural business statistics eurostat 2016 because they have a more detailed description of these sectors to regionalize the agricultural economic components of value added we mainly rely on the economic accounts for agriculture eurostat 2016 because of the rich and already standardized information across eu regions one of the most challenging tasks to achieve in the database construction is the derivation of the sub national domestic demand and trade among regions within the country this is because these data are often missing and need to be computed using different techniques in our case we rely on the so called simple locations quotients slqs miller and blair 2009 slqs give a measure of the regional specialization in the economic activity compared to the national average and allow us to determine the domestic demand and aggregate demand for imports then we follow the gravitational approach to obtain the bilateral trade flows across sub national regions in line with dixon et al 2012b and wittwer and horridge 2010 4 coupling the pmaup and cge models once the multi attribute objective function is calibrated in the pmaup model the water allocation constraint w g is progressively strengthened to comply with alternative water reacquisition targets g and the resulting crop portfolio x g utility u g and gva v a g a function of the gross margin z 1 g and hired labor z 4 g are estimated these variables contain the necessary information to reveal i the foregone income and ii the compensating variation that addresses the foregone utility these two measures serve as a basis to assess the economy wide repercussions of water buyback in a cge environment the foregone income is used to estimate the consequences on the supply side through a productivity shock in the representative agricultural firm while the compensating variation is used to assess the consequences on the demand side through a money transfer to the representative agent in murcia 4 1 the supply shock in the microeconomic model the gva v a g in murcia for every reacquisition target g is obtained aggregating the simulated gross margin z 1 g and labor income a function of hired labor z 4 g 31 v

that of the baseline scenario without buyback g 0 although the foregone income is in principle more easily observable to the buyer principal than foregone utility using a method that accounts for changes in utility instead of changes in income yields more accurate and typically lower compensation estimates this is explained by the tradeoff between risk and management complexity aversion on the one hand and profit on the other in the multi attribute microeconomic model as a result water uses displaying high income but high risk and management complexity can yield a relatively low marginal utility and compensating variation and vice versa uses with low income but low risk and management complexity attached can still yield a high marginal utility and compensating variation for a detailed discussion on the compensation estimation method choice the reader may refer to pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 the compensating variation for a given reacquisition target c v g is obtained in the microeconomic model as follows 34 c v g e u 0 w g e u 0 w 0 where e represents an expenditure function i e the minimum amount of money agents would need to attain the initial utility u 0 given a water constraint w g in the baseline scenario g 0 the expenditure function equals 0 for consistency the compensating variation stemming from the pmaup model is divided by the baseline gva in the pmaup model and the resulting percentage is multiplied by the baseline gva in the cge model to estimate the equivalent compensating variation in the macroeconomic context δ g 35 δ g c v g v a 0 v a g a g r m u r compensations to irrigators are represented in the cge macroeconomic context through an income transfer to the representative agent in murcia t g income transfers can be operated through an annuity payment or a lump sum transfer since the capitalization rate that applies to agricultural assets in spain has been volatile during the financial crisis boe 2015 an annuity payment that removes discount rate uncertainty was preferred in this case note that the marginal cost of the public funds scheme and the corresponding distortion of resource allocation is endogenous in the cge model and is captured by the adjustment in the relative prices once the transfer from the rest of spain to the murcia region is set economic agents change their decision according to their new income budget constraint when ex ante designing the policy an analyst may be tempted to equalize income transfers to expected compensating variations however cge models work on realized values which typically do not match expected compensating variations due to information asymmetry this leads to some degree of agency costs θ 1 iftekhar et al 2013 36 t g θ δ g the potential for rent extraction is conditional on the information asymmetries present and on the ability of the principal to address them e g through auction design next the income transfer is introduced in the cge model through the equation

inc s cons s gov s save s tr s tr 0 s spain except murcia the region of murcia receives the total amount of the annuity for the implementation of the water buyback policy minus its share of the income

income transfer to the representative agent in a macroeconomic context and finds a new equilibrium the economy wide impacts of water buyback are estimated as the difference between the gva of the economic sectors and regions in spain for each water reacquisition target and that of the baseline without water buyback 5 case study area the region of murcia in spain the region of murcia is located in southeastern spain within the boundaries of the absolute water scarce segura river basin murcia has a surface of 11 313 km2 a population of 1 5 million inhabitants and a gdp per capita of eur 19

numbers are not consecutive because they indicate the numbering within the segura river basin which also includes awdus outside the murcia region displays the awdus in the murcia region the worsening water crisis and difficulties to deploy more restrictive caps and charging arrangements led the segura river basin to pioneer water purchase tenders in the eu srba 2014 two buyback tenders for the temporary reacquisition 1 year of water rights from rice farms upstream were implemented during the 2007 2008 drought tenders had a budget of eur 700 000 and envisaged a maximum purchase price of eur 0 18 m3 in 2007 the first tender consumed eur 495 000 to purchase 2 93 million m3 at an average price of eur 0 17 m3 similar results were obtained in the 2008 tender both water reacquisitions were fully used to enhance environmental flows garrido et al 2013 recent research in awdus of the region of murcia has estimated the annuity payment of buyback programmes to inform the design of purchase tenders in the area martínez granados and calatrava 2014 pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 yet a major and persisting concern relates to the economy wide repercussions of water buyback the region of murcia is highly dependent on agriculture which represents around 4 4 of regional gdp and 10 4 of regional employment as compared to 2 3 and 4 at a national level ine 2017 food industry and tourism closely connected to the agricultural sector account for 4 5 and 5 6 of the gdp respectively ine 2017 relevant feedbacks on the output of economic sectors in the region which are yet to be estimated can be anticipated from this sectoral gdp distribution 6 results methods are illustrated with an application to the murcia region in se spain the pmaup is calibrated for the 55 awdus in the area following the methodology in section 2 the parameterization results of the utility function of each awdu and the corresponding calibration residuals come from pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 and can be also consulted in the on line supplementary material a series of simulations are run in which the water allocation constraint is strengthened in every awdu limiting water availability precludes some portfolio choices and has a negative impact on the utility of agents through a reduced provision of valuable attributes including profit agents readjust their crop portfolio according to their objective function and the new water constraint for every simulation resolved the foregone income and compensating variation are estimated results from microeconomic simulations are then elaborated to obtain the productivity shock and the annuity that feed the cge model the macroeconomic simulation runs a comparative statics exercise to assess regional and sectorial gva changes considering eight alternative water reacquisition targets 50 4 of water allocation in the baseline 100 8 150 12 200 16 250 20 300 24 350 28 and 400 32 million m3 the economic repercussions of water reacquisitions are assessed following two alternative criteria i a cost effective criterion ce in which priority in the reacquisition is given to those awdus where water is inexpensive and ii a proportional criterion pr in which the same proportion of the initial water allocation is purchased in each awdu the motivation for the inclusion of these two criteria lies on the heterogeneity of water if water was a homogeneous good with the same environmental value across murcia s awdus the first criterion should apply however this is not the case and purchase tenders focusing on specific awdus may be necessary to restore preserve critical ecosystem services finally a major concern in water reacquisitions regards agency costs due to information asymmetry irrigators may perceive a compensation that is not consistent with the shadow price of water increasing the cost of the buyback program and or limiting its scope and henceforth the extent of ecosystem services delivered three agency costs scenarios are defined based on the values reported in the literature θ 1 no agency costs case 1 θ 1 5 case 2 and θ 2 case 3 iftekhar et al 2013 martínez granados and calatrava 2014 pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 zuo et al 2015 6 1 microeconomic assessment initially agents react to the new water allocation constraint substituting irrigated crops in the margin by less water demanding or rainfed crops that yield slightly lower utility levels when the water reacquisition target becomes more stringent though agents are constrained to sacrifice increasingly valuable crops and utility losses amplify this process is visible in fig 3 which displays the compensating variation m3 in the 55 awdus for 8 reacquisition targets as utility decreases so does income one of the critical attributes determining utility fig 4 in some simulations the objective function cannot be resolved within the domain n a value in the legend this is largely the consequence of the ligneous crops surface thresholds set in the model 4 4 uprooting fruit trees would result in disinvestments with negative impacts on future market and non market ecosystem services income the latter not being accounted for in the model alternatively water requirement for fruit trees could be reduced resulting in yield losses but preserving the trees but this necessitates yield functions that are challenging to implement in the pmaup model not the least due to the limited hard data available consequently a minimum surface threshold has been set for ligneous crops which have to remain above 90 of their original surface and happens with 40 of awdus when water allocation is reduced by 32 400 million m3 a maximum threshold for water reacquisition targets is fixed at this value overall surface water reliant awdus in upstream catchments display less productive crop portfolios and lower purchase prices compared to those located downstream focusing water purchase tenders on upstream areas may improve environmental flows along the basin at the least cost ce criterion however complementary purchase tenders may be necessary in other areas to restore the balance locally e g aquifers tributary rivers the results obtained above for every awdu are aggregated to obtain the inputs for the cge model table 1 displays the foregone income and compensating variation as a percentage of murcia s agricultural gva in the baseline for alternative reacquisition targets and design ce and pr in the case of no agency costs θ 1 not surprisingly the pr scheme shows higher compensating variation and income losses than the ce scheme in absolute value income losses are greater than the compensating variation in both schemes as the water allocation constraint is strengthened an increasing share of land is devoted to less water intensive and rainfed crops which yield a lower expected income but typically also higher risk and management complexity avoidance two valuable attributes that mitigate the negative impact income losses have on utility the opposite may happen and the compensating variation can be greater than income losses absolute values where agency costs are considered 6 2 macroeconomic assessment in the pmaup model agents choices are taken within a static macroeconomic scenario with exogenous prices a reasonable assumption for the small awdus of murcia gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 when the productivity and income shocks stemming from the pmaup model are aggregated for the entire murcia s agricultural sector and translated into the cge model the macroeconomic scenario is not anymore given but reacts through changes in relative prices triggering the reaction of other economic sectors agents and regions consistent with the permanent nature of the reacquisitions the model assumes a flexible cge setting with a medium to long term focus where labor and capital are perfectly mobile between sectors and cet elasticity for labor and capital mobility within spain is minus two this value is consistent with previous cge studies assuming a flexible economic system at the sub country level carrera et al 2015 koks et al 2015 accordingly regional and sectorial gva changes in this comparative statics exercise should be also understood in a medium to long term context the regionalized cge model explores the macroeconomic impacts of murcia s water buyback programme across sectors and regions of spain through a series of simulations fig 5 displays simulation results in the agriculture a food industry b services c and aggregate gdp d for all water targets 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 and 400 million m3 ce and pr reacquisition schemes and agency cost cases 1 2 and 3 the microeconomic results in table 1 are amplified in the macroeconomic assessment for example for the most ambitious reacquisition target in the pr scheme and no agency costs case murcia s agricultural income experiences a 33 contraction as compared to 20 5 in the microeconomic model sectors that are strongly linked to agriculture like food industry also experience relevant losses in murcia up to 4 gva as opposed to the gva losses experienced by murcia agricultural gva elsewhere in spain increases by 37 aggregate agricultural gva in spain still decreases by almost 1 5 and the service sector by almost 02 this is partly the result of a substitution effect led by the reallocation of agricultural supply from murcia towards other economic sectors and regions of spain on the other hand the contraction of the spanish aggregate income limits the rise of the gva in the rest of spain resulting in an income effect that counterbalances the substitution effect the trade off between substitution and income effects is typical of this dynamic macroeconomic scenario where flexible prices determine the adjustment of trading flows the underlying reallocation of primary factors is critical to understand these effects consumers substitute goods from murcia with goods produced elsewhere and not affected by the negative productivity shock thus increasing the firms demand for capital and labor in the rest of spain this leads to a shift of capital and labor force from murcia to the rest of spain where capital and workers can find higher remunerations as a result murcia experiences a substantial gdp loss up to 2 1 while gdp increases in the rest of spain up to 0 034 overall the policy has a negative impact on spanish gdp although limited up to 0 023 not surprisingly the pr scheme has a more negative impact than the ce it is worth noting that higher agency costs do not influence the effects on spanish aggregate gdp but have implications for its spatial distribution mitigating losses in murcia and diminishing gains in other spanish regions it should be also noted that relative changes in food industry and services exhibit nonlinear and non monotonous patterns this is due to the reallocation of primary factors and the resultant redistribution of trade in the different scenarios agency costs mitigate murcia s losses in the services sector and the overall economy but have a negligible impact on agriculture and food industry where results for the three agency costs scenarios are similar fig 6 assesses policy impacts looking at the equivalent variation conceptually the equivalent variation is similar to the compensating variation but it is applied at the macroeconomic level to assess welfare impacts it represents the amount of income that keeps the utility of the agent of the cge model equal to that of the baseline and is mainly driven by final consumption a negative sign denotes a welfare loss as compared to the baseline welfare effects at a regional and national level are also explained by the movements of primary factors and the re composition of trade in the different scenarios which depends on the armington elasticities whose coefficients differ for every sector this leads to non linear adjustment and non monotonicity in murcia the income transfer from the rest of spain is insufficient to fully compensate the negative impact of reacquisitions resulting in a welfare loss in most macroeconomic scenarios only for a few reacquisition targets 200 350 and 400 million m3 and for the highest level of agency costs case 3 the income transfer leaves the representative agent with a welfare level comparable or higher to that of the baseline the rest of spain finds itself worse off in terms of welfare in several scenarios despite the gdp increase on the one hand the income transfer in murcia increases imports from the rest of spain especially agricultural products which are cheaper since the production has not been negatively affected by the productivity shock on the other this is possible because the rest of spain finances the consumption of murcia through the income transfer thus decreasing its own welfare impacts on the rest of spain are a function of agency costs with welfare gains where there are no agency costs and welfare losses where agency costs are high again the size of agency costs does not affect aggregate welfare impacts on spain and the pr scheme is more detrimental for welfare than the ce scheme 7 discussion simulation results show that the economy wide repercussions of water buyback are relevant and range between 33 and 19 33 agricultural gva losses in the murcia region for the most ambitious reacquisition target 400 million m3 significantly higher than the gva losses estimated in the microeconomic model up to 20 5 for the same scenario this amplification effect is the result of the reallocation of primary factors from murcia to the rest of spain modelled in the cge context despite compensations paid to local irrigators murcia s supply contraction in the agricultural and related economic sectors leads to an overall gdp loss in the region between 1 and 2 1 the remaining spanish regions partially fill in the supply gap and experience an agricultural gdp increase between 0 21 and 0 37 and an overall gdp increase between 0 012 and 0 034 which is nonetheless insufficient to compensate gdp losses in murcia resulting in a limited net gdp loss in the spanish economy between 0 013 and 0 023 for the most ambitious target welfare effects can be unevenly distributed between murcia and the rest of spain with winners and losers depending on the size of the agency costs results support the decision to develop investment plans flanking measures to address the economy wide impacts of buyback particularly in affected rural economies and related economic sectors such as food industry previous applied research on the economy wide impacts of agricultural water buyback programmes is limited and focuses on the australian case dixon et al 2011 2012a analyze the economy wide impacts of the water buyback programme in the southern murray darling basin using a sub national cge model for australia that incorporates water as a primary factor thus making water trading simulations feasible results show that the reacquisition of 1 500 million m3 22 8 of initial water allotments to restore the balance in the southern murray darling basin has a marginal impact at the national level 0 006 of gdp in the segura river basin restoring the balance would demand the reacquisition of 250 million m3 15 9 of initial water allotments our results suggest this policy would have an impact on the spanish gdp comparable to the australian case 0 011 in the pr scheme and 0 004 in the ce scheme but a significantly higher cost per m3 of water reacquired 0 21 in the ce and 0 51 in the pr as compared to 0 05 in australia in 2015 prices this is largely explained by the distinct ability of the agricultural sectors in the southern murray darling basin and murcia to absorb the shock following the reacquisitions agricultural output falls by 1 3 in southern murray darling basin as compared to between 16 pr and 6 5 ce in murcia in addition farmers in the murray darling basin increase their consumption and welfare following the buyback while the opposite situation is registered in most scenarios in murcia two elements appear crucial to explain the differences between our results and those of dixon et al 2012a 2011 i the existence of water markets in australia and ii the coupling method used in our approach which allows for a more detailed representation of the motivations and constraints faced by farmers in a market environment buyback constrains supply and increases water prices and farmers can leverage on this opportunity to increase consumption and welfare this is not the case in europe where water markets do not exist and prices are administrative charges that do not respond to the scarcity value of water the second key element is the coupling the spatial resolution in the sub national australian cge model does not offer the same level of detail than a locally calibrated microeconomic model such as the pmaup model for murcia the southern half of the large murray darling basin 1 061 469 km2 is divided into 13 units in dixon et al 2012a 2011 while murcia which covers an area equaling 1 of the murray darling basin s territory 11 313 km2 is divided in 55 units in our study the microeconomic analysis makes possible the use of mathematical programming methods to elicit the parameters of agents objective functions and allows for a more detailed representation of the motivations and constraints faced by irrigators the australian cge model does not consider these constraints and risks to overestimate irrigators capacity to shift capital labor and land from one land use to another as wittwer 2012 points out a finer regional division in cge models is desirable for three reasons i more detailed regional results ii environmental issues such as water management often call for smaller regions that can map watershed or other natural boundaries more closely and iii more and smaller regions give a greater sense of geographical realism the coupling between the pmaup and the regionally calibrated cge model is a first step in this direction although macroeconomic models have been previously used to assess the economy wide impacts of fiscal policy schemes and water markets to the best of our knowledge this is the first applied study of the economy wide impacts of buyback policies outside australia the most plausible explanation to this gap is the difficulty to accurately simulate the price and value share to water and water reallocation among users outside of a market environment some macroeconomic models have been developed to inform irrigation water reallocation in the eu context and elsewhere see e g hertel and liu 2016 even if the focus of these studies is different from ours they can provide useful insights and policy implications for our work for instance insights from other macroeconomic models can be useful to inform policy sequencing in water reacquisitions water market scenarios for europe unequivocally show an increase in gva through water reallocation to more productive uses dudu and chumi 2008 suggesting water trading could help mitigate the gva losses associated to buyback programmes on the other hand this very mechanism increases shadow prices darwin et al 1995 dixon et al 2012a and thus the overall cost of buyback for taxpayers a sensible water policy reform consistent with the cost effectiveness rationale that governs eu water policy ec 2000 may need to consider alternative policy sequencings to the australian case to enhance acceptability e g commencing reacquisitions before developing full fledged water markets in addition to its economy wide impacts water buyback can also involve wider environmental consequences beyond the target basin because of the spatial redistribution of production for example cazcarro et al 2014 show that a combination of water tariffs and subsidies on food production can save water in the water scarce regions of southern spain murcia and andalusia and enhance food production in the water abundant regions of the north cantabria and basque country in our assessment water conservation targets in murcia are achieved at the expense of a significant decrease in the agricultural output which is replaced by higher agricultural production elsewhere although we are not able to precise water use patterns in the remaining spanish regions the agricultural production increase is more pronounced in northern regions such as asturias cantabria and aragón where water is relatively more abundant pointing towards a pattern similar to that of cazcarro et al 2014 however as higher value added and water intensive crops are affected by the reacquisition transferring their production to northern regions may become increasingly unfeasible due to climatic and agronomic constrains as a result water use may increase in other water scarce southern regions that resemble the physical and socioeconomic conditions of the region of murcia exacerbating water overallocation problems there for a discussion on the policy implications of implementing agricultural water buyback schemes including an analysis on the feasibility of the beneficiary pays approach adopted by this instrument we refer the reader to pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 8 conclusions coupling the pmaup and cge models makes feasible a detailed analysis of the tradeoffs in water conservation from the sub regional awdu to the regional national and supranational scale methods are general and replicable in other areas where water markets are non existent or in an early stage of development and ex post trading data is not readily available future research can focus on i addressing the current limitations of the micro and macro economic models and ii expanding the methodological framework the current version of the pmaup relies on a validated projection method to reveal the efficient frontier but recent developments in the field could help to minimize the approximation error see e g gómez limón et al 2016b also the calibration residual could be reduced finding alternative and or complementary attributes in the objective function that are relevant in explaining agents decisions although this is ultimately constrained by data availability the cge model could be improved introducing temporal dynamics to examine the transition pathway towards the new equilibrium and identify potential trade offs between short and long run effects which could be relevant for policy implementation in exploring transition pathways the sequential coupling and comparative statics used in this paper could be replaced with a recursive coupling where agents in the pmaup model adapt to the new macroeconomic scenario until convergence is reached while comparative statics is often used to assess the impact of one time permanent policies such as buyback a recursive model would allow a better representation of temporary or recurrent policies e g water charging from the data perspective water satellite accounts at a sectorial level where available could be used to analyze simultaneously the macroeconomic propagation of the policy and water use changes in economic sectors other than irrigators in murcia e g through input output coefficients the current methodological framework could be also expanded including a hydrological module that accounts for catchment specific characteristics and system dynamics e g percolation runoff and localizes water flows and water conservation across the basin this information is instrumental to assess the environmental outputs of the policy and to estimate its economic benefits through non market valuation methods

11184,water is considered as one of the limited and important resources for agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions such as iran coneflower has been introduced to iran in the recent decades in iran coneflower is cultivated in dried and semi dried regions and used as a medicinal plant in the pharmaceutical industry and as a decorative plant as well this research was aimed to evaluate the effect of chemical and biological nitrogen on biomass production water and nitrogen use efficiency and nutrients uptake in coneflower under different irrigation regimes field experiment was conducted as split plots in randomized complete blocks with three replications during 2015 2016 in lordegan iran the experimental treatments included irrigation after 25 50 and 75 soil water depletion as the main factor and non nitrogen levels control nitroxin contains azotobacter and azosperillium bacteria 40 kg n ha 1 nitrogen combination of nitroxin and nitrogen and 80 kg n ha 1 were considered as the sub factor the use of different levels of nitrogen increased the concentration of nitrogen phosphorus nitrate and biological yield in different irrigation levels the highest nitrogen use efficiency was obtained in the first and second years at irrigation levels following 50 of available water depletion moreover use of 40 kg n ha 1 in the first year and the nitroxin and 40 kg n ha 1 use in the second year resulted in the highest nitrogen use efficiency the highest water use efficiency in the first year was obtained from irrigation after 25 and 50 of available water depletion and in the second year from irrigation after 50 of soil water depletion the highest water use efficiency was obtained from use of 80 kg n ha 1 in irrigation after 25 of soil water depletion and use of 80 kg ha 1 n and nitroxin and nitrogen combination in irrigation after 50 of soil water depletion in general the results showed that the highest bioyield with less nitrate higher water and nitrogen use efficiency were obtained using nitrogen and nitroxin combination at irrigation levels after 50 of soil water depletion keywords irrigation nitrogen use efficiency nitrate water use efficiency 1 introduction coneflower echinaceae purpurea l munch is a medicinal and perennial herb belongs to the asteracea family which is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry especially in europe and the united states barrett 2003 this plant has 11 species of those 3 species e angustifolia dc var angustifolia e pallida nutt and e purpurea l moench are used pharmaceutically the first two species are mainly cultivated for root use while the whole of echinaceae purpurea species has a medicinal use coneflower has been introduced to iran in the recent decades in iran coneflower is used as a medicinal plant in the pharmaceutical industry and as a decorative plant as well studies show that less research has been performed on coneflower crop management coneflower is used to treat diseases in the urinary tract respiratory disorders and viral infections tsai et al 2012 drought is the main limiting factor in agricultural production among the various environmental constraints it is involved in many plant yields including inhibition of photosynthesis restriction of water absorption damage to the plasma membrane and potentially growth reduction talbi et al 2015 therefore optimal water use in agricultural production as one of the most important environmental factors affecting plant growth especially in arid and semi arid regions of iran is crucial in such a situation in order to have a higher yield in terms of water use it is necessary to investigate the reaction of the plant to the levels of water deficit stress rao et al 2016 the plant under drought stress changes its metabolic and physiological activities to minimize the negative impacts of stress and to increase the survival lambers et al 2008 nyiraneza et al 2009 on the other hand the results of other researchers indicate that under drought stress the absorption of nutrients especially phosphor and nitrogen is limited due to the decrease in the supply and release of these nutrients and reduced root growth the effect of different levels of irrigation on other medicinal plants indicates that drought stress reduces the water use efficiency by reducing the yield of the aerial organ pirzad and mohammadzadeh 2018 one of the ways to increase yield and thus increase water use efficiency is to use nitrogen fertilizers improving the nutritional conditions of plants under drought stress can help increase plant resistance and herbal productions waraich et al 2011 nitrogen is the second most important factor affecting the quantity and quality of medicinal plants after water numerous studies indicated that increased nitrogen can improve water use efficiency and reduce the negative impacts of drought stress on plant growth in arid areas however nitrogen nutrition is associated with drought stress tolerance and increasing nitrogen supply the physiological state and plant growth will be improved in response to reduced water availability in the soil drenovsky et al 2012 on the other hand if the available nitrogen is less or higher than the optimum amount for the plant growth rate it will disrupt the vital and qualitative processes of the medicinal plants which may reduce or stop the reproductive growth rios gonzalez et al 2002 use of more fertilizers leads to its increased waste and finally pollution of living resources and the decreased quality of medicinal plants by increasing the accumulation of nitrate in herbal products and soil nitrate pollution in this regard the use of biological fertilizers can be effective in reducing the use of chemical fertilizers and increasing the yield nitroxin is a bio fertilizer containing azotobacter and azospirillum bacteria effects of azotobacter and azospirillum on growth of echinacea purpurea jokar et al 2015 isazadehhajagha et al 2017 faba bean kholdi et al 2015 and salvia officinalis youssef et al 2004 have been reported the results of other researches indicate that due to the slow release of nitrogen bio fertilizers have higher nitrogen use efficiency kızılkaya 2008 yang et al 2011 therefore to reduce the environmental impacts and increase the water and nitrogen use efficiency in coneflower investigating the possibility of replacing a part of the chemical nitrogen by nitroxin is essential so far few studies have been carried out on the coneflower the objectives of the present study were to i examine the effects of different levels of irrigation and nitrogen on growth yield and water and nitrogen use efficiency in coneflower and ii examine the impact of chemical and biological nitrogen on nitrate accumulation in the plant organ 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and climatic characteristics this experiment was conducted in the 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 cropping years in the lordegan region iran with a latitude of 31 31 n the longitude of 50 48 e and a latitude of 1564 m above sea level the average annual temperature and precipitation of this region was 15 1 c and 550 mm respectively total monthly rainfall and average monthly air temperature for the two growing seasons are presented in fig 1 the main soil physicochemical properties are presented in table 1 2 2 field preparation and treatments application three leafed 90 day seedlings of coneflower echinaceae purpurea l munch were used in this experiment the experiment was conducted in split plot based on randomized complete blocks design with three replications irrigation at three levels including after 25 t25 50 t50 and 75 t75 available water depletion selected as the main factor which was applied from the five leaf stage to the end sub factor was in five levels includes non use of nitrogen control nitroxin 5 l ha 1 40 kg n ha 1 the combination of nitrogen 40 kg n ha 1 and nitroxin 5 l ha 1 and 80 kg n ha 1 nitroxin fertilizer is commercial name of nitrogen fixing bacteria which contains azospirillum sp 5 105 cfu ml and azotobacter sp 1 4 107 cfu ml nitrogen was used from the urea source in two stages of five leaf and onset of stem elongation nitroxin was provided from the mehr asia biotechnology company and supplied as soil inoculation into root absorption zone of plants each experiment plot consisted of 5 rows with 50 cm spacing transplanting the coneflower seedlings was performed on may 3 2014 the spacing between the plants was 20 cm and it was 50 cm between the rows the distances between main plots sub plots and blocks were 2 m 1 m and 2 m respectively after complete standing of the plants at 5 leaf stage irrigation treatments were applied based on the maximum allowable depletion mad percentage of the soil available water saw between 0 03 to 1 5 mpa kramer and boyer 1995 the predefined treatments applied were 25 50 and 75 mad of asw representing the non stressed control t25 moderate drought stress t50 and severe drought stress t75 respectively soil moisture measurement involves removing soil moisture by heating the soil sample at 105 c campbell and mulla 1990 to achieve each irrigation treatment sampling was performed 24 h before irrigation from root zone soil and the amount of available water was calculated by campbell and mulla 1990 method the irrigation water supply at each plot was measured with a water counter irrigation water needed prior to irrigation is the amount of water needed during irrigation to replenish the soil moisture deficit thereby taking the soil water back to the maximum soil available water all plots were irrigated by furrow irrigation during the growing season in both years the amount of water needed for irrigation at each level was calculated via the eq 1 katerji et al 2008 1 ig θfc θpwp τ ρ d a 100 ie in this equation ig is the irrigation water needed m3 θfc is the percentage of soil moisture content at the soil field capacity point θpwp is the percentage of moisture content of the soil at the wilting point τ is the moisture removal percentage from the soil 25 50 and 75 ρ is the soil bulk density kg m 3 d is the root zone depth m a is the plot area m2 and ie is the irrigation efficiency which was considered as 65 sepaskhah 2003 on average according to furrow irrigation method it should be noted that the rainfall in march and april in the 2015 2016 crop year was considered in the calculation of water use efficiency harvesting the whole aerial organ was performed in 2015 crop year on september 24th and in 2016 two harvestings were performed on june 20th and september 22th 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 total nitrogen the determination of nitrogen is based on the berthelot reaction in which a phenol derivative here salicylate forms an azo dye in the presence of ammonia and hypochlorite in alkaline medium the indophenol thus formed has a green blue color of which the absorbance is measured at a wavelength of 660 nm novozamsky et al 1974 2 3 2 nitrate accumulation the singh 1988 method was used to measure nitrate in the aerial organ sothat 0 1 g of dry weight of the whole harvested aerial organ was used 2 3 3 phosphorus content to measure phosphorus a colorimetric method as molybdate vanadate was used chapman and pratt 1961 about 10 ml of yellow phosphorus solution including molybdenum ammonium and vanadate and nitric acid was mixed with 10 ml of dried extract and using distilled water the mixture reached to the volume of 50 ml then using the spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 420 nm the phosphorus absorbance was read potassium phosphate was used to prepare standard phosphorus 2 3 4 potassium content potassium was measured according to patterson et al 1984 the amount of potassium was read by flame diffusion method with a flame photometer in mg g 1 of dry sample and the readings were adjusted by comparison with the standard samples to prepare the potassium standards potassium chloride was used 2 3 5 biological yield at flowering full bloom stage the whole aerial organs flowers leaves and branches were harvested in 2 m2 of each experimental plot the flower heads and leaves were separated from the stems and the samples were dried at ambient temperature mean 25 1 c for 96 h stuart and wills 2003 weighted and biological yield was expressed in kg ha 2 4 calculation of nitrogen use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency was calculated as the ratio of biomass yield to the nitrogen supplied since nitrogen fixation by azotobacteria and azospirillum was reported 20 40 kg ha 1 in resources reviewed in the other hand the results of the present experiment indicates that the yield and nitrogen levels in the aerial organ in the treatment of 40 kg n ha 1 and nitroxin had no significant differences therefore the amount of the fixed nitrogen in nitroxin treatment was considered for the calculation of nitrogen efficiency as 40 kg n ha 1 nitrogen efficiency indices were calculated using the eq 2 2 nitrogen use efficiency nue wt nf where wt is the total plant weight kg and nf is the nitrogen fertilizer used kg 2 5 calculation of water use efficiency the water use efficiency in plants is the amount of plant s economic yield biological yield in coneflower relative to the amount of supplied water irrigation water and rainfall howell 1994 calculated according to the eq 3 3 water use efficiency wue yi kg wi m3 where yi is the produced biomass and wi is the amount of consumed water irrigation and rainfall 2 6 statistical analysis the analysis of variance for the two year data was performed using glm sas sas 9 1 3 sas institute inc cary nc usa to analyze the data from the second year the bioavailability of the two harvestings was combined in all the case of the significant interactions the slicing and the mean comparisons were performed based on the l s means procedure of the sas program 3 results the results of the two year data analysis indicate that year irrigation nitrogen interaction was significant on nitrogen phosphorus potassium nitrate and biological yield moreover the interaction of year irrigation and year nitrogen was significant for water and nitrogen use efficiency table 2 the use of different levels of nitrogen increased nitrogen concentration in the aerial organ in all irrigation treatments use of nitroxin and nitrogen in control and severe stress treatments increased the nitrogen levels in the aerial organ compared to control by 2 2 and 2 2 times respectively in the second year using of 80 kg n ha 1 in all irrigation levels caused the highest nitrogen in the aerial organ although there was no significant difference with the combination of nitrogen and nitroxin the results of this study showed that nitroxin provides nitrogen in plants under control and mild stress conditions up to 40 kg n ha 1 fig 2 the amount of phosphorus in the aerial organ of the coneflower was affected by nitrogen at different irrigation levels the results of this study showed that nitroxin and combination of nitroxin and nitrogen had the most effect on the amount of phosphorus in the aerial organ so that nitroxin using at mild stress level t50 in the first year increased the amount of phosphorus in the aerial organ 54 and in the second year 1 7 times and the combination of nitroxin and nitrogen under severe stress conditions t75 had a better effect on increasing phosphorous content than other treatments fig 3 with increasing the irrigation level from t25 to t75 phosphorus absorption decreased application of nitrogen in the first year and at t25 and t50 levels had no significant effect on the amount of potassium in the aerial organ however in t75 potassium adsorption decreased with nitrogen use although no significant difference was observed between different fertilizer levels in the second year at t25 the highest amount of potassium was obtained from the combination of nitroxin and nitrogen however there was no significant difference with nitroxin and no nitrogen use use of 80 kg n ha 1 in t50 and t75 reduced the amount of potassium by 32 and 20 respectively moreover the combination of nitroxin and nitrogen and non use of nitrogen at t75 level simultaneously produced the highest amount of potassium in the aerial organ the accumulation of nitrate in the aerial organ was affected by nitrogen use so that with increasing nitrogen use nitrate accumulation in the aerial organ increased significantly fig 5 using 80 kg n ha 1 increased the amount of nitrate compared to non nitrogen 1 5 1 53 times and t50 1 2 times in t25 in both years the nitrate accumulation in nitroxin treatment was the lowest compared to the other nitrogen treatments so that in the second year nitroxin use decreased the nitrate accumulation by 37 compared to the control the biological yield of coneflower increased by nitrogen supplying at all levels of irrigation compared to control in both years fig 6 therefore in the first year under control conditions using of 80 kg n ha 1 increased the biological yield by 100 compared to the control moreover the highest biological yield in mild stress was obtained from the combination of nitroxin and nitrogen in this year which increased 108 compared to the control however using of 80 kg n ha 1 showed no significant difference with nitroxin and nitrogen combination at t75 nitrogen increased biological yield compared to control however no significant difference was observed between nitrogen levels in the second year the effect of treatments on biological yield was similar to that of the first year and in t50 conditions the highest yield was obtained by combining nitroxin and nitrogen and 80 kg n ha 1 however at the t75 level 40 kg n ha 1 and the combination of nitroxin and nitrogen had the greatest impact on biological yield in general in the second year the biological yield was greater than the first year in both years the highest nitrogen use efficiency was achieved at t50 so that at this irrigation level nitrogen use efficiency increased by 12 and 68 compared to the t25 and t75 respectively fig 7 in the second year it increased by 13 and 33 the results showed that in both year nitroxin application and 40 kg n ha 1 had the highest nitrogen use efficiency and there was no significant difference between the use of 80 kg n ha 1 and the combination of nitroxin and nitrogen fig 8 the reason for increasing the efficiency of nitrogen use at t50 could be increased biomass production at this level of irrigation the results of two years of the examination showed that the highest biomass was produced at this irrigation level comparing the mean of year irrigation interaction showed that in the first year the highest water use efficiency was obtained from two levels of t25 and t50 and water use efficiency at t75 level was reduced by 35 compared to the other two irrigation levels fig 9 in the second year t50 treatment increased water use efficiency by 15 and 25 than t25 and t75 respectively the results of irrigation and nitrogen interactions during two years of experiment showed that at all irrigation levels nitrogen use increased water use efficiency compared to control so that water use efficiency at t25 treatment resulted from use of 80 kg n ha 1 there was no significant difference in irrigation levels between nitroxin and 40 kg n ha 1 use of nitroxin and nitrogen combinition increased water use efficiency in t50 treatment compared to control by 82 however the average of this treatment did not have a significant difference with use of 80 kg ha nitroxin significantly increased water use efficiency compared to 40 kg n ha 1 fig 10 water use efficiency decreased by changing the irrigation level t25 to t75 however nitrogen use increased this trait in t75 treatment the maximum water use efficiency at this irrigation level was obtained using the combination of nitroxin and nitrogen and 40 kg n ha 1 4 discussion increasing the concentration of nitrogen in the aerial organs followed the using nitrogen especially under controlled conditions and mild stress shows the increased nitrogen absorption by the plant using high levels of nitrogen due to the proper conditions for photosynthesis better root growth and the use of available nitrogen increased nitrogen absorption in the plant changing the irrigation level from t25 to t75 reduced nitrogen content in the aerial organs the increased nitrogen consumption has been increased the nitrogen concentration in coneflower bonomelli et al 2005 corn seed chen et al 2015 and black cumin leaves shah 2008 gonzalez dugo et al 2010 reported that under drought stress nitrogen absorption in most plants decreases even if mineral nitrogen is provided for the plant reducing nitrogen levels in the aerial organs under t75 conditions can be due to reduced nitrogen absorption by the root as a result of reduced availability of nitrogen for the plant due to reduced available water content and nitrogen solubility and lower roots growth or the effect of water stress on the activity of bacteria in nitroxin dobermaann and fairhurst 2000 reported that the availability of enough nitrogen for the plant would increase the need for other high nutritional nutrients such as phosphorus and potassium so if the plant accesses to this nutrients its absorption will increase the correlation analysis table 3 shows that nitrogen had a slightly positive and significant correlation r 0 24 with phosphorus and was not correlated with potassium also the results show that application of nitrogen increases phosphorus absorption nitrogen absorption increased the plant growth and required nutrients such as phosphorus in other hand increased phosphorus in nitroxin and the combination of nitroxin and nitrogen treatments can be due to the effect of this bio fertilizer on the absorption of the nutrients through the production of soluble root extracts and the reduction of ph which is reported by glick 2012 reducing soil ph caused by using bio fertilizer reflects the fact that acidifying the soil by organic acids and increasing the organic matter content of the soil may be the main reason for greater access to the nutrients such as phosphorus and potassium on the other hand azotobacter and azosperlliuom can increase plant access to the nutrients in the soil through affecting the root growth considering that the absorption of the nutrients is not independent and is a complex process it seems that better absorption of phosphorus by bio fertilizers can be due to its direct effect on the absorption of the nutrients or by other nutrients absorption the absorption of phosphorus is improved indirectly the results of bonomelli et al 2005 showed that using of nitrogen in coneflower increased the content of phosphorus in the plant tissues the results show that the phosphorus content in the tissue in the second year was less than the first year the correlation analysis table 3 shows that phosphorus content is negatively correlated with biological yield r 0 46 these results indicate that with increasing biological yield in 2015 2016 phosphorus content per unit area has been decreased also the result show that absorption of nitrogen and phosphorus decreased and potassium increased under drought stress drought reduces the absorption of the nutrients by the root and its transfer from root to shoots this occurs due to reduced transpiration and damage to the active transmission system and permeability of the membranes on the other hand decreasing the mobility of phosphorus in the soils with low water content is obvious since soil water content affects its analytical reactions and biological activities marschner 1995 the reason for reducing phosphorus absorption in 80 kg n ha 1 at t75 is probably the effect of this fertilizer on the occurrence of doubled osmotic stress due to high soluble nitrogen in the soil on the other hand under drought stress conditions the reduction of phosphorus release rate from soil to root surface is higher than other nutrients since phosphate ion is bound to clay particle sand it is less available to the plant roots the content of potassium in aerial organ was not significantly increased in nitrogen treatments compared to control and it decreased at some levels the reason for this decrease may be due to dilution effect because of the increase in biomass volume by these treatments than the control there was a negative and significant correlation r 0 73 between the potassium and phosphorus content in aerial organs table 3 the results clearly show this negative relationship especially in t75 so that the highest potassium content and lowest phosphorus was seem under t75 conditions fig 4 it seems that increasing the absorption of potassium is due to the important role of potassium in osmotic regulation stomatal opening regulation and membrane stability marschner 1995 under drought stress the positive correlation r 0 68 between potassium content and biological yield confirms that potassium could have effective influence on the biological yield the results of this study showed that nitrate accumulation in the aerial organ had a close relationship with the amount of nitrogen fertilizer used the amount of nitrate in the aerial organ decreased by nitroxin application compared with other treatments the reason for this result is that the release and distribution of nitrogen in biological fertilizers is slower than chemical fertilizers since organic fertilizers do not simply provide sustained nitrogen during the plant growth herencia et al 2011 the results show that application of 80 kg n ha 1 under severe stress caused the highest amount of nitrate accumulation in the tissue in second year the radiation environment and available water content of the plant influence the accumulation of nitrate in the plant tissue anjana and iqbal 2007 under water deficit stress conditions the plant closes its somata to prevent transpiration thereby preventing carbon dioxide entering in addition to reducing the water wasting then the process of photosynthesis decreases sharply and nitrate to protein conversion stops and nitrate accumulation starts the amount of nitrate in the second year was lower than in the first year the reason could be the increased growth and production of more biomass in the plant in the second year in optimum growth conditions the plant can use the amount of nitrate stored in vacuoles to produce carbohydrates and organic acids and prevent the accumulation of nitrate in the tissue the slightly negative and significant correlation r 0 31 between biological yield and nitrate accumulation confirms this results application of nitrogen and nitroxin improved biological yield in all irrigation treatments positive and significant correlation between the biological yield and nitrogen r 0 57 conformed that nitrogen increased biological yield by probably increasing phosphorus uptake and enhancing photosynthesis the biological yield in irrigation after 50 mad of saw was significantly higher compared with t25 which emphasis that increasing irrigation intervals until t50 improve biological yield in two experimental years in fact t50 could provide enough water and caused more plant growth without stress correspondingly biological yield of t75 treatment was reduced compared with t25 and t50 severe water stress affects many aspects of plants such as photosynthesis water potential of plant tissues leaves damage and ultimately resulted in decreased growth and yield there are also several reasons for lowering the biological yield of coneflower in this experiment under drought stress conditions such as reducing the absorption of phosphorus and nitrogen nutrients fig 2 and 3 thereby disrupting the photosynthesis processes and reducing the photosynthetic potential and eventually biological yield on the other hand under drought stress conditions for osmotic regulating and controlling drought induced oxidative stress the plant uses some of its products to create the appropriate metabolites for these conditions therefore the amount of biomass production decreases more than water use reduction the results in corn wang et al 2017 and rosemary and thyme pirzad and mohammadzadeh 2018 show that reducing the number of irrigation reduces biomass yield nevertheless the negative effects of drought stress may be alleviated by nitrogen supply in this study the biological yield achieved from application of nitrogen treatments was significantly higher in t75 compared with control this may be partly explained by fact that nitrogen supply could reduce the negative effect of drought stress in coneflower meanwhile 40 kg n ha 1 and combination of nitroxin and nitrogen caused more biological yield compared to nitroxin alone and also 80 kg n ha 1 gonzalez dugo et al 2010 reported that under drought stress conditions increasing concentrations of nitrogen compounds in the rhizosphere via fertilizers resulted in increased soil water osmotic pressure and need more plant efforts to maintain cellular water content so reducing the transpiration therefore it seems that the reason for the reduction in yield by application of 80 kg n ha 1 in t75 during two years is the disruption of the absorption of nitrogen and other nutrients due to increased osmotic pressure around the rhizosphere reduced transpiration and decreased growth in the plant this effect is evident in 2015 2016 cropping year regarding the results and attributes during the two years of experiment it can be observed that nitroxin and the combination of nitroxin and nitrogen in the second year had a better and more effective result this suggested an increase in the population of bacteria presented at these fertilization levels and hence a better influence of this nitrogen source or it may be as a result of better plant growth in the second year the increase in photosynthesis and the possibility of carbohydrate transfer to the root and thus the possibility of better growth root and access to water and nutrients such as nitrogen increasing root growth increases ventilation and improves the proper conditions for activity of nitrogen fixing bacteria moreover in addition to the water deficit effect on biomass water deficit decreases yield by reducing nitrogen absorption increasing the number of irrigation in the t25 reduced the nitrogen use efficiency so nitrogen use efficiency of t25 was reduced 12 and 13 compared to the t50 treatment in first and second year respectively this result shows that more irrigation through nitrogen leaching reduces efficiency vasileva and pachev 2015 also reported that high irrigation number and ammonium sublimation reduce the nitrogen use efficiency sustaining higher nue is one of the key goals of sustainable agriculture as shown in fig 8 nue increased exponentially with decreasing nitrogen rate nitroxin and 40 kg n ha 1 in both years it seems that better nitrogen uptake and use are related to these treatments appropriate n supply would improve nue increase crop yield and reduce soil n losses spiertz 2010 the reduction in nitrogen use efficiency in both 2015 and 2016 by 80 kg n ha 1 can be due to some factors such as more nitrogen leaching and the non matching the plant requirement with the presence of nitrogen in the soil on the other hand one of the most important roles of nitroxin fertilizer is increasing the root growth due to its effect by producing the some phytohormones and the simultaneous supply of nitrogen during the growth increased root growth leads to better absorption of most of the nutrients from the soil nitroxin increased the nitrogen use efficiency in the second year compared to the first year the reason for this result may be an increase in activity of nitroxin bacteria in the second year and an increase in root capacity in the absorption of nitrogen and other nutrients such as phosphorus increasing nitrogen supply increases the accumulation of dry matter however the increase in nitrogen available for the plant also increases the nitrogen accumulation in the plant so the negative effect of nitrogen accumulation is more than the dry matter production and nitrogen use efficiency decreases thereby in addition to the promotion of nue nitroxin also reduce risk of plant and groundwater contamination water stress significantly reduced nitrogen uptake and biological yield leading to the reduction of water use efficiency hence the lowest nue was observed from t75 in both years similar results have been obtained by wang et al 2017 and pirzad and mohammadzadeh 2018 one of the ways to increase water use efficiency is to supply enough nitrogen in the plant increasing nitrogen enhance the production of biomass and thus the optimal use of water mueller et al 2012 miranzadeh et al 2011 the correlation analysis table 3 shows that wue is positively correlated with nitrogen content r 0 8 and also the biological yield r 0 82 these results indicate that in the coneflower the increase in nitrogen increases the water use efficiency nitrogen increased the water use efficiency by affecting the chlorophyll content and photosynthesis processes increasing the plant s power against drought stress through osmotic regulation and antioxidant capacity increasing the leaf area root growth and thus increasing the absorption of water and other nutrients the results of zhang et al 2017 in wheat show that water use efficiency increased with increasing nitrogen levels increased water use efficiency caused by the effect of nitroxin and the combination of nitrogen and nitroxin can be due to the role of these treatments in more slow absorption of nitrogen and other nutrients the results show the superiority of nitroxin and nitrogen combination in increasing water use efficiency compared to nitroxin alone especially in t75 conditions the reason for increasing water use efficiency caused by using the combination compared to nitroxin alone and 80 kg n ha 1 can be better consistently of this treatment with the available soil nitrogen and plant requirements this means that at the beginning of the growth where the nutritional needs are low the mineral nitrogen associated with the nitrogen supplying bacterium are available to the plant with continuing the plant growth the plant becomes able to supply the hydrocarbon required by the bacterium in the root and with the transfer of increased hydrocarbons increases the nitrogen fixation and root growth consequently the nitrogen absorption is sustained however under t75 conditions if nitroxin is used alone the plant closes its stomata encountering with water stress and reduces photosynthesis hence reducing the transfer of photosynthetic material to the root reduces the nitrogen fixation which intensifies the photosynthetic output reduction thus the t75 treatment through its effect on nitrogen fixation reduces the growth and production of biomass and ultimately reduces water use efficiency figs 2 and 6 the reason for the reduction of aerial yield in t25 treatment and consequently the reduction of water use efficiency can be the sensitivity of the coneflower to the soil excess water in fact the results show that the best irrigation treatment for coneflower is irrigation based on 50 water depletion and in such condition the plant will have better biomass yield and hence will use the available water optimally 5 conclusions the results of the present experiment show that the best irrigation regime for coneflower to achieve the highest biological yield nitrogen and water use efficiencies is irrigation after 50 of the soil available water depletion although the highest biological yield was achieved using 80 kg n ha 1 but its difference was not significant with nitrogen and nitroxin combination at t50 irrigation level while the highest nitrate accumulation in the aerial part was extremely higher in 80 kg n ha 1 therefore to use less chemical fertilizer nitrogen and nitroxin combination can be replaced by 80 kg n ha 1 in climatic and soil conditions similar to the experimental farm 
11184,water is considered as one of the limited and important resources for agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions such as iran coneflower has been introduced to iran in the recent decades in iran coneflower is cultivated in dried and semi dried regions and used as a medicinal plant in the pharmaceutical industry and as a decorative plant as well this research was aimed to evaluate the effect of chemical and biological nitrogen on biomass production water and nitrogen use efficiency and nutrients uptake in coneflower under different irrigation regimes field experiment was conducted as split plots in randomized complete blocks with three replications during 2015 2016 in lordegan iran the experimental treatments included irrigation after 25 50 and 75 soil water depletion as the main factor and non nitrogen levels control nitroxin contains azotobacter and azosperillium bacteria 40 kg n ha 1 nitrogen combination of nitroxin and nitrogen and 80 kg n ha 1 were considered as the sub factor the use of different levels of nitrogen increased the concentration of nitrogen phosphorus nitrate and biological yield in different irrigation levels the highest nitrogen use efficiency was obtained in the first and second years at irrigation levels following 50 of available water depletion moreover use of 40 kg n ha 1 in the first year and the nitroxin and 40 kg n ha 1 use in the second year resulted in the highest nitrogen use efficiency the highest water use efficiency in the first year was obtained from irrigation after 25 and 50 of available water depletion and in the second year from irrigation after 50 of soil water depletion the highest water use efficiency was obtained from use of 80 kg n ha 1 in irrigation after 25 of soil water depletion and use of 80 kg ha 1 n and nitroxin and nitrogen combination in irrigation after 50 of soil water depletion in general the results showed that the highest bioyield with less nitrate higher water and nitrogen use efficiency were obtained using nitrogen and nitroxin combination at irrigation levels after 50 of soil water depletion keywords irrigation nitrogen use efficiency nitrate water use efficiency 1 introduction coneflower echinaceae purpurea l munch is a medicinal and perennial herb belongs to the asteracea family which is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry especially in europe and the united states barrett 2003 this plant has 11 species of those 3 species e angustifolia dc var angustifolia e pallida nutt and e purpurea l moench are used pharmaceutically the first two species are mainly cultivated for root use while the whole of echinaceae purpurea species has a medicinal use coneflower has been introduced to iran in the recent decades in iran coneflower is used as a medicinal plant in the pharmaceutical industry and as a decorative plant as well studies show that less research has been performed on coneflower crop management coneflower is used to treat diseases in the urinary tract respiratory disorders and viral infections tsai et al 2012 drought is the main limiting factor in agricultural production among the various environmental constraints it is involved in many plant yields including inhibition of photosynthesis restriction of water absorption damage to the plasma membrane and potentially growth reduction talbi et al 2015 therefore optimal water use in agricultural production as one of the most important environmental factors affecting plant growth especially in arid and semi arid regions of iran is crucial in such a situation in order to have a higher yield in terms of water use it is necessary to investigate the reaction of the plant to the levels of water deficit stress rao et al 2016 the plant under drought stress changes its metabolic and physiological activities to minimize the negative impacts of stress and to increase the survival lambers et al 2008 nyiraneza et al 2009 on the other hand the results of other researchers indicate that under drought stress the absorption of nutrients especially phosphor and nitrogen is limited due to the decrease in the supply and release of these nutrients and reduced root growth the effect of different levels of irrigation on other medicinal plants indicates that drought stress reduces the water use efficiency by reducing the yield of the aerial organ pirzad and mohammadzadeh 2018 one of the ways to increase yield and thus increase water use efficiency is to use nitrogen fertilizers improving the nutritional conditions of plants under drought stress can help increase plant resistance and herbal productions waraich et al 2011 nitrogen is the second most important factor affecting the quantity and quality of medicinal plants after water numerous studies indicated that increased nitrogen can improve water use efficiency and reduce the negative impacts of drought stress on plant growth in arid areas however nitrogen nutrition is associated with drought stress tolerance and increasing nitrogen supply the physiological state and plant growth will be improved in response to reduced water availability in the soil drenovsky et al 2012 on the other hand if the available nitrogen is less or higher than the optimum amount for the plant growth rate it will disrupt the vital and qualitative processes of the medicinal plants which may reduce or stop the reproductive growth rios gonzalez et al 2002 use of more fertilizers leads to its increased waste and finally pollution of living resources and the decreased quality of medicinal plants by increasing the accumulation of nitrate in herbal products and soil nitrate pollution in this regard the use of biological fertilizers can be effective in reducing the use of chemical fertilizers and increasing the yield nitroxin is a bio fertilizer containing azotobacter and azospirillum bacteria effects of azotobacter and azospirillum on growth of echinacea purpurea jokar et al 2015 isazadehhajagha et al 2017 faba bean kholdi et al 2015 and salvia officinalis youssef et al 2004 have been reported the results of other researches indicate that due to the slow release of nitrogen bio fertilizers have higher nitrogen use efficiency kızılkaya 2008 yang et al 2011 therefore to reduce the environmental impacts and increase the water and nitrogen use efficiency in coneflower investigating the possibility of replacing a part of the chemical nitrogen by nitroxin is essential so far few studies have been carried out on the coneflower the objectives of the present study were to i examine the effects of different levels of irrigation and nitrogen on growth yield and water and nitrogen use efficiency in coneflower and ii examine the impact of chemical and biological nitrogen on nitrate accumulation in the plant organ 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and climatic characteristics this experiment was conducted in the 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 cropping years in the lordegan region iran with a latitude of 31 31 n the longitude of 50 48 e and a latitude of 1564 m above sea level the average annual temperature and precipitation of this region was 15 1 c and 550 mm respectively total monthly rainfall and average monthly air temperature for the two growing seasons are presented in fig 1 the main soil physicochemical properties are presented in table 1 2 2 field preparation and treatments application three leafed 90 day seedlings of coneflower echinaceae purpurea l munch were used in this experiment the experiment was conducted in split plot based on randomized complete blocks design with three replications irrigation at three levels including after 25 t25 50 t50 and 75 t75 available water depletion selected as the main factor which was applied from the five leaf stage to the end sub factor was in five levels includes non use of nitrogen control nitroxin 5 l ha 1 40 kg n ha 1 the combination of nitrogen 40 kg n ha 1 and nitroxin 5 l ha 1 and 80 kg n ha 1 nitroxin fertilizer is commercial name of nitrogen fixing bacteria which contains azospirillum sp 5 105 cfu ml and azotobacter sp 1 4 107 cfu ml nitrogen was used from the urea source in two stages of five leaf and onset of stem elongation nitroxin was provided from the mehr asia biotechnology company and supplied as soil inoculation into root absorption zone of plants each experiment plot consisted of 5 rows with 50 cm spacing transplanting the coneflower seedlings was performed on may 3 2014 the spacing between the plants was 20 cm and it was 50 cm between the rows the distances between main plots sub plots and blocks were 2 m 1 m and 2 m respectively after complete standing of the plants at 5 leaf stage irrigation treatments were applied based on the maximum allowable depletion mad percentage of the soil available water saw between 0 03 to 1 5 mpa kramer and boyer 1995 the predefined treatments applied were 25 50 and 75 mad of asw representing the non stressed control t25 moderate drought stress t50 and severe drought stress t75 respectively soil moisture measurement involves removing soil moisture by heating the soil sample at 105 c campbell and mulla 1990 to achieve each irrigation treatment sampling was performed 24 h before irrigation from root zone soil and the amount of available water was calculated by campbell and mulla 1990 method the irrigation water supply at each plot was measured with a water counter irrigation water needed prior to irrigation is the amount of water needed during irrigation to replenish the soil moisture deficit thereby taking the soil water back to the maximum soil available water all plots were irrigated by furrow irrigation during the growing season in both years the amount of water needed for irrigation at each level was calculated via the eq 1 katerji et al 2008 1 ig θfc θpwp τ ρ d a 100 ie in this equation ig is the irrigation water needed m3 θfc is the percentage of soil moisture content at the soil field capacity point θpwp is the percentage of moisture content of the soil at the wilting point τ is the moisture removal percentage from the soil 25 50 and 75 ρ is the soil bulk density kg m 3 d is the root zone depth m a is the plot area m2 and ie is the irrigation efficiency which was considered as 65 sepaskhah 2003 on average according to furrow irrigation method it should be noted that the rainfall in march and april in the 2015 2016 crop year was considered in the calculation of water use efficiency harvesting the whole aerial organ was performed in 2015 crop year on september 24th and in 2016 two harvestings were performed on june 20th and september 22th 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 total nitrogen the determination of nitrogen is based on the berthelot reaction in which a phenol derivative here salicylate forms an azo dye in the presence of ammonia and hypochlorite in alkaline medium the indophenol thus formed has a green blue color of which the absorbance is measured at a wavelength of 660 nm novozamsky et al 1974 2 3 2 nitrate accumulation the singh 1988 method was used to measure nitrate in the aerial organ sothat 0 1 g of dry weight of the whole harvested aerial organ was used 2 3 3 phosphorus content to measure phosphorus a colorimetric method as molybdate vanadate was used chapman and pratt 1961 about 10 ml of yellow phosphorus solution including molybdenum ammonium and vanadate and nitric acid was mixed with 10 ml of dried extract and using distilled water the mixture reached to the volume of 50 ml then using the spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 420 nm the phosphorus absorbance was read potassium phosphate was used to prepare standard phosphorus 2 3 4 potassium content potassium was measured according to patterson et al 1984 the amount of potassium was read by flame diffusion method with a flame photometer in mg g 1 of dry sample and the readings were adjusted by comparison with the standard samples to prepare the potassium standards potassium chloride was used 2 3 5 biological yield at flowering full bloom stage the whole aerial organs flowers leaves and branches were harvested in 2 m2 of each experimental plot the flower heads and leaves were separated from the stems and the samples were dried at ambient temperature mean 25 1 c for 96 h stuart and wills 2003 weighted and biological yield was expressed in kg ha 2 4 calculation of nitrogen use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency was calculated as the ratio of biomass yield to the nitrogen supplied since nitrogen fixation by azotobacteria and azospirillum was reported 20 40 kg ha 1 in resources reviewed in the other hand the results of the present experiment indicates that the yield and nitrogen levels in the aerial organ in the treatment of 40 kg n ha 1 and nitroxin had no significant differences therefore the amount of the fixed nitrogen in nitroxin treatment was considered for the calculation of nitrogen efficiency as 40 kg n ha 1 nitrogen efficiency indices were calculated using the eq 2 2 nitrogen use efficiency nue wt nf where wt is the total plant weight kg and nf is the nitrogen fertilizer used kg 2 5 calculation of water use efficiency the water use efficiency in plants is the amount of plant s economic yield biological yield in coneflower relative to the amount of supplied water irrigation water and rainfall howell 1994 calculated according to the eq 3 3 water use efficiency wue yi kg wi m3 where yi is the produced biomass and wi is the amount of consumed water irrigation and rainfall 2 6 statistical analysis the analysis of variance for the two year data was performed using glm sas sas 9 1 3 sas institute inc cary nc usa to analyze the data from the second year the bioavailability of the two harvestings was combined in all the case of the significant interactions the slicing and the mean comparisons were performed based on the l s means procedure of the sas program 3 results the results of the two year data analysis indicate that year irrigation nitrogen interaction was significant on nitrogen phosphorus potassium nitrate and biological yield moreover the interaction of year irrigation and year nitrogen was significant for water and nitrogen use efficiency table 2 the use of different levels of nitrogen increased nitrogen concentration in the aerial organ in all irrigation treatments use of nitroxin and nitrogen in control and severe stress treatments increased the nitrogen levels in the aerial organ compared to control by 2 2 and 2 2 times respectively in the second year using of 80 kg n ha 1 in all irrigation levels caused the highest nitrogen in the aerial organ although there was no significant difference with the combination of nitrogen and nitroxin the results of this study showed that nitroxin provides nitrogen in plants under control and mild stress conditions up to 40 kg n ha 1 fig 2 the amount of phosphorus in the aerial organ of the coneflower was affected by nitrogen at different irrigation levels the results of this study showed that nitroxin and combination of nitroxin and nitrogen had the most effect on the amount of phosphorus in the aerial organ so that nitroxin using at mild stress level t50 in the first year increased the amount of phosphorus in the aerial organ 54 and in the second year 1 7 times and the combination of nitroxin and nitrogen under severe stress conditions t75 had a better effect on increasing phosphorous content than other treatments fig 3 with increasing the irrigation level from t25 to t75 phosphorus absorption decreased application of nitrogen in the first year and at t25 and t50 levels had no significant effect on the amount of potassium in the aerial organ however in t75 potassium adsorption decreased with nitrogen use although no significant difference was observed between different fertilizer levels in the second year at t25 the highest amount of potassium was obtained from the combination of nitroxin and nitrogen however there was no significant difference with nitroxin and no nitrogen use use of 80 kg n ha 1 in t50 and t75 reduced the amount of potassium by 32 and 20 respectively moreover the combination of nitroxin and nitrogen and non use of nitrogen at t75 level simultaneously produced the highest amount of potassium in the aerial organ the accumulation of nitrate in the aerial organ was affected by nitrogen use so that with increasing nitrogen use nitrate accumulation in the aerial organ increased significantly fig 5 using 80 kg n ha 1 increased the amount of nitrate compared to non nitrogen 1 5 1 53 times and t50 1 2 times in t25 in both years the nitrate accumulation in nitroxin treatment was the lowest compared to the other nitrogen treatments so that in the second year nitroxin use decreased the nitrate accumulation by 37 compared to the control the biological yield of coneflower increased by nitrogen supplying at all levels of irrigation compared to control in both years fig 6 therefore in the first year under control conditions using of 80 kg n ha 1 increased the biological yield by 100 compared to the control moreover the highest biological yield in mild stress was obtained from the combination of nitroxin and nitrogen in this year which increased 108 compared to the control however using of 80 kg n ha 1 showed no significant difference with nitroxin and nitrogen combination at t75 nitrogen increased biological yield compared to control however no significant difference was observed between nitrogen levels in the second year the effect of treatments on biological yield was similar to that of the first year and in t50 conditions the highest yield was obtained by combining nitroxin and nitrogen and 80 kg n ha 1 however at the t75 level 40 kg n ha 1 and the combination of nitroxin and nitrogen had the greatest impact on biological yield in general in the second year the biological yield was greater than the first year in both years the highest nitrogen use efficiency was achieved at t50 so that at this irrigation level nitrogen use efficiency increased by 12 and 68 compared to the t25 and t75 respectively fig 7 in the second year it increased by 13 and 33 the results showed that in both year nitroxin application and 40 kg n ha 1 had the highest nitrogen use efficiency and there was no significant difference between the use of 80 kg n ha 1 and the combination of nitroxin and nitrogen fig 8 the reason for increasing the efficiency of nitrogen use at t50 could be increased biomass production at this level of irrigation the results of two years of the examination showed that the highest biomass was produced at this irrigation level comparing the mean of year irrigation interaction showed that in the first year the highest water use efficiency was obtained from two levels of t25 and t50 and water use efficiency at t75 level was reduced by 35 compared to the other two irrigation levels fig 9 in the second year t50 treatment increased water use efficiency by 15 and 25 than t25 and t75 respectively the results of irrigation and nitrogen interactions during two years of experiment showed that at all irrigation levels nitrogen use increased water use efficiency compared to control so that water use efficiency at t25 treatment resulted from use of 80 kg n ha 1 there was no significant difference in irrigation levels between nitroxin and 40 kg n ha 1 use of nitroxin and nitrogen combinition increased water use efficiency in t50 treatment compared to control by 82 however the average of this treatment did not have a significant difference with use of 80 kg ha nitroxin significantly increased water use efficiency compared to 40 kg n ha 1 fig 10 water use efficiency decreased by changing the irrigation level t25 to t75 however nitrogen use increased this trait in t75 treatment the maximum water use efficiency at this irrigation level was obtained using the combination of nitroxin and nitrogen and 40 kg n ha 1 4 discussion increasing the concentration of nitrogen in the aerial organs followed the using nitrogen especially under controlled conditions and mild stress shows the increased nitrogen absorption by the plant using high levels of nitrogen due to the proper conditions for photosynthesis better root growth and the use of available nitrogen increased nitrogen absorption in the plant changing the irrigation level from t25 to t75 reduced nitrogen content in the aerial organs the increased nitrogen consumption has been increased the nitrogen concentration in coneflower bonomelli et al 2005 corn seed chen et al 2015 and black cumin leaves shah 2008 gonzalez dugo et al 2010 reported that under drought stress nitrogen absorption in most plants decreases even if mineral nitrogen is provided for the plant reducing nitrogen levels in the aerial organs under t75 conditions can be due to reduced nitrogen absorption by the root as a result of reduced availability of nitrogen for the plant due to reduced available water content and nitrogen solubility and lower roots growth or the effect of water stress on the activity of bacteria in nitroxin dobermaann and fairhurst 2000 reported that the availability of enough nitrogen for the plant would increase the need for other high nutritional nutrients such as phosphorus and potassium so if the plant accesses to this nutrients its absorption will increase the correlation analysis table 3 shows that nitrogen had a slightly positive and significant correlation r 0 24 with phosphorus and was not correlated with potassium also the results show that application of nitrogen increases phosphorus absorption nitrogen absorption increased the plant growth and required nutrients such as phosphorus in other hand increased phosphorus in nitroxin and the combination of nitroxin and nitrogen treatments can be due to the effect of this bio fertilizer on the absorption of the nutrients through the production of soluble root extracts and the reduction of ph which is reported by glick 2012 reducing soil ph caused by using bio fertilizer reflects the fact that acidifying the soil by organic acids and increasing the organic matter content of the soil may be the main reason for greater access to the nutrients such as phosphorus and potassium on the other hand azotobacter and azosperlliuom can increase plant access to the nutrients in the soil through affecting the root growth considering that the absorption of the nutrients is not independent and is a complex process it seems that better absorption of phosphorus by bio fertilizers can be due to its direct effect on the absorption of the nutrients or by other nutrients absorption the absorption of phosphorus is improved indirectly the results of bonomelli et al 2005 showed that using of nitrogen in coneflower increased the content of phosphorus in the plant tissues the results show that the phosphorus content in the tissue in the second year was less than the first year the correlation analysis table 3 shows that phosphorus content is negatively correlated with biological yield r 0 46 these results indicate that with increasing biological yield in 2015 2016 phosphorus content per unit area has been decreased also the result show that absorption of nitrogen and phosphorus decreased and potassium increased under drought stress drought reduces the absorption of the nutrients by the root and its transfer from root to shoots this occurs due to reduced transpiration and damage to the active transmission system and permeability of the membranes on the other hand decreasing the mobility of phosphorus in the soils with low water content is obvious since soil water content affects its analytical reactions and biological activities marschner 1995 the reason for reducing phosphorus absorption in 80 kg n ha 1 at t75 is probably the effect of this fertilizer on the occurrence of doubled osmotic stress due to high soluble nitrogen in the soil on the other hand under drought stress conditions the reduction of phosphorus release rate from soil to root surface is higher than other nutrients since phosphate ion is bound to clay particle sand it is less available to the plant roots the content of potassium in aerial organ was not significantly increased in nitrogen treatments compared to control and it decreased at some levels the reason for this decrease may be due to dilution effect because of the increase in biomass volume by these treatments than the control there was a negative and significant correlation r 0 73 between the potassium and phosphorus content in aerial organs table 3 the results clearly show this negative relationship especially in t75 so that the highest potassium content and lowest phosphorus was seem under t75 conditions fig 4 it seems that increasing the absorption of potassium is due to the important role of potassium in osmotic regulation stomatal opening regulation and membrane stability marschner 1995 under drought stress the positive correlation r 0 68 between potassium content and biological yield confirms that potassium could have effective influence on the biological yield the results of this study showed that nitrate accumulation in the aerial organ had a close relationship with the amount of nitrogen fertilizer used the amount of nitrate in the aerial organ decreased by nitroxin application compared with other treatments the reason for this result is that the release and distribution of nitrogen in biological fertilizers is slower than chemical fertilizers since organic fertilizers do not simply provide sustained nitrogen during the plant growth herencia et al 2011 the results show that application of 80 kg n ha 1 under severe stress caused the highest amount of nitrate accumulation in the tissue in second year the radiation environment and available water content of the plant influence the accumulation of nitrate in the plant tissue anjana and iqbal 2007 under water deficit stress conditions the plant closes its somata to prevent transpiration thereby preventing carbon dioxide entering in addition to reducing the water wasting then the process of photosynthesis decreases sharply and nitrate to protein conversion stops and nitrate accumulation starts the amount of nitrate in the second year was lower than in the first year the reason could be the increased growth and production of more biomass in the plant in the second year in optimum growth conditions the plant can use the amount of nitrate stored in vacuoles to produce carbohydrates and organic acids and prevent the accumulation of nitrate in the tissue the slightly negative and significant correlation r 0 31 between biological yield and nitrate accumulation confirms this results application of nitrogen and nitroxin improved biological yield in all irrigation treatments positive and significant correlation between the biological yield and nitrogen r 0 57 conformed that nitrogen increased biological yield by probably increasing phosphorus uptake and enhancing photosynthesis the biological yield in irrigation after 50 mad of saw was significantly higher compared with t25 which emphasis that increasing irrigation intervals until t50 improve biological yield in two experimental years in fact t50 could provide enough water and caused more plant growth without stress correspondingly biological yield of t75 treatment was reduced compared with t25 and t50 severe water stress affects many aspects of plants such as photosynthesis water potential of plant tissues leaves damage and ultimately resulted in decreased growth and yield there are also several reasons for lowering the biological yield of coneflower in this experiment under drought stress conditions such as reducing the absorption of phosphorus and nitrogen nutrients fig 2 and 3 thereby disrupting the photosynthesis processes and reducing the photosynthetic potential and eventually biological yield on the other hand under drought stress conditions for osmotic regulating and controlling drought induced oxidative stress the plant uses some of its products to create the appropriate metabolites for these conditions therefore the amount of biomass production decreases more than water use reduction the results in corn wang et al 2017 and rosemary and thyme pirzad and mohammadzadeh 2018 show that reducing the number of irrigation reduces biomass yield nevertheless the negative effects of drought stress may be alleviated by nitrogen supply in this study the biological yield achieved from application of nitrogen treatments was significantly higher in t75 compared with control this may be partly explained by fact that nitrogen supply could reduce the negative effect of drought stress in coneflower meanwhile 40 kg n ha 1 and combination of nitroxin and nitrogen caused more biological yield compared to nitroxin alone and also 80 kg n ha 1 gonzalez dugo et al 2010 reported that under drought stress conditions increasing concentrations of nitrogen compounds in the rhizosphere via fertilizers resulted in increased soil water osmotic pressure and need more plant efforts to maintain cellular water content so reducing the transpiration therefore it seems that the reason for the reduction in yield by application of 80 kg n ha 1 in t75 during two years is the disruption of the absorption of nitrogen and other nutrients due to increased osmotic pressure around the rhizosphere reduced transpiration and decreased growth in the plant this effect is evident in 2015 2016 cropping year regarding the results and attributes during the two years of experiment it can be observed that nitroxin and the combination of nitroxin and nitrogen in the second year had a better and more effective result this suggested an increase in the population of bacteria presented at these fertilization levels and hence a better influence of this nitrogen source or it may be as a result of better plant growth in the second year the increase in photosynthesis and the possibility of carbohydrate transfer to the root and thus the possibility of better growth root and access to water and nutrients such as nitrogen increasing root growth increases ventilation and improves the proper conditions for activity of nitrogen fixing bacteria moreover in addition to the water deficit effect on biomass water deficit decreases yield by reducing nitrogen absorption increasing the number of irrigation in the t25 reduced the nitrogen use efficiency so nitrogen use efficiency of t25 was reduced 12 and 13 compared to the t50 treatment in first and second year respectively this result shows that more irrigation through nitrogen leaching reduces efficiency vasileva and pachev 2015 also reported that high irrigation number and ammonium sublimation reduce the nitrogen use efficiency sustaining higher nue is one of the key goals of sustainable agriculture as shown in fig 8 nue increased exponentially with decreasing nitrogen rate nitroxin and 40 kg n ha 1 in both years it seems that better nitrogen uptake and use are related to these treatments appropriate n supply would improve nue increase crop yield and reduce soil n losses spiertz 2010 the reduction in nitrogen use efficiency in both 2015 and 2016 by 80 kg n ha 1 can be due to some factors such as more nitrogen leaching and the non matching the plant requirement with the presence of nitrogen in the soil on the other hand one of the most important roles of nitroxin fertilizer is increasing the root growth due to its effect by producing the some phytohormones and the simultaneous supply of nitrogen during the growth increased root growth leads to better absorption of most of the nutrients from the soil nitroxin increased the nitrogen use efficiency in the second year compared to the first year the reason for this result may be an increase in activity of nitroxin bacteria in the second year and an increase in root capacity in the absorption of nitrogen and other nutrients such as phosphorus increasing nitrogen supply increases the accumulation of dry matter however the increase in nitrogen available for the plant also increases the nitrogen accumulation in the plant so the negative effect of nitrogen accumulation is more than the dry matter production and nitrogen use efficiency decreases thereby in addition to the promotion of nue nitroxin also reduce risk of plant and groundwater contamination water stress significantly reduced nitrogen uptake and biological yield leading to the reduction of water use efficiency hence the lowest nue was observed from t75 in both years similar results have been obtained by wang et al 2017 and pirzad and mohammadzadeh 2018 one of the ways to increase water use efficiency is to supply enough nitrogen in the plant increasing nitrogen enhance the production of biomass and thus the optimal use of water mueller et al 2012 miranzadeh et al 2011 the correlation analysis table 3 shows that wue is positively correlated with nitrogen content r 0 8 and also the biological yield r 0 82 these results indicate that in the coneflower the increase in nitrogen increases the water use efficiency nitrogen increased the water use efficiency by affecting the chlorophyll content and photosynthesis processes increasing the plant s power against drought stress through osmotic regulation and antioxidant capacity increasing the leaf area root growth and thus increasing the absorption of water and other nutrients the results of zhang et al 2017 in wheat show that water use efficiency increased with increasing nitrogen levels increased water use efficiency caused by the effect of nitroxin and the combination of nitrogen and nitroxin can be due to the role of these treatments in more slow absorption of nitrogen and other nutrients the results show the superiority of nitroxin and nitrogen combination in increasing water use efficiency compared to nitroxin alone especially in t75 conditions the reason for increasing water use efficiency caused by using the combination compared to nitroxin alone and 80 kg n ha 1 can be better consistently of this treatment with the available soil nitrogen and plant requirements this means that at the beginning of the growth where the nutritional needs are low the mineral nitrogen associated with the nitrogen supplying bacterium are available to the plant with continuing the plant growth the plant becomes able to supply the hydrocarbon required by the bacterium in the root and with the transfer of increased hydrocarbons increases the nitrogen fixation and root growth consequently the nitrogen absorption is sustained however under t75 conditions if nitroxin is used alone the plant closes its stomata encountering with water stress and reduces photosynthesis hence reducing the transfer of photosynthetic material to the root reduces the nitrogen fixation which intensifies the photosynthetic output reduction thus the t75 treatment through its effect on nitrogen fixation reduces the growth and production of biomass and ultimately reduces water use efficiency figs 2 and 6 the reason for the reduction of aerial yield in t25 treatment and consequently the reduction of water use efficiency can be the sensitivity of the coneflower to the soil excess water in fact the results show that the best irrigation treatment for coneflower is irrigation based on 50 water depletion and in such condition the plant will have better biomass yield and hence will use the available water optimally 5 conclusions the results of the present experiment show that the best irrigation regime for coneflower to achieve the highest biological yield nitrogen and water use efficiencies is irrigation after 50 of the soil available water depletion although the highest biological yield was achieved using 80 kg n ha 1 but its difference was not significant with nitrogen and nitroxin combination at t50 irrigation level while the highest nitrate accumulation in the aerial part was extremely higher in 80 kg n ha 1 therefore to use less chemical fertilizer nitrogen and nitroxin combination can be replaced by 80 kg n ha 1 in climatic and soil conditions similar to the experimental farm
