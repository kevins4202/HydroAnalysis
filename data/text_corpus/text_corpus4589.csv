vehicles backstepping approach the port controlled hamiltonian coordinate control speed and heading control 1 introduction the rapid development of unmanned surface vehicle usv is particularly significant in providing cost effective solutions to coastal and offshore problems over the past decade many types of research military and commercial organizations are forging ahead with the development of the unmanned surface vehicle usvs have been widely used in many areas such as scientific research roberts and sutton 2006 environmental monitoring naeem et al 2008 maritime security anti submarine warfare electronic warfare surface warfare special operation forces and maritime interdiction operation liu et al 2016 research institutions develop usvs as test platforms for various sensors and control algorithms to expedite research progress most of these usvs are converted to manned vessels that use collections of the shelf components some researchers got nice results available dealing with usvs liu et al 2016 specially k d do do and pan 2006a concerns the robust tracking control problem for a surface vessel with parameter uncertainties and external disturbances donaire et al 2017b present a dynamic model of marine vehicles in both body fixed and inertial momentum coordinates using port hamiltonian framework however the usual approach is to consider the control problem of the usv from a pure signal perspective or energy perspective usvs are outfitted with global positioning system gps receivers and attitude and heading reference system ahrs sensors for closed loop waypoint following and trajectory tracking other ancillary sensors like doppler velocity logs dvl to measure fluid flow allowing for even tighter control to waypoints and trajectories sonnenburg 2012 in unknown environments the usvs must make execute maneuvers to traverse safely and quickly usv must reliably perform aggressive maneuvers to successfully replace highly skilled human operators which requires the development of advanced motion control algorithms some researchers focus on developing control methods to make usv taking the most dangerous tasks over the past decade the designed method of port controlled hamiltonian system pch attracted more and more scholars attention if a nonlinear dynamical system models can be described by pch structure there will be a multitude of advantages because there is an obvious relationship between the energy and the dynamics of pch system and the energy conservative property makes the controller energy balancing in some research paper ortega et al 2002a the interconnection and damping assignment passivity based control ida pbc method that invokes the principles of dissipation and energy shaping is introduced and this method has practical physically significance the ida pbc method achieves stabilization by rendering the closed loop system passive with a desired energy storage function which is also a candidate lyapunov function ortega and garcía canseco 2004 ortega et al 2002a furthermore by damping injection the closed loop system can be asymptotically stabilized there are some particularly successful applications for mechanical systems control as stated in some other research papers donaire et al 2017a renton et al 2012 romero et al 2013 yu et al 2013 lv chengxing et al lv et al 2018 proposed a state error port controlled hamiltonian approach for the speed and heading control problem of the usv the approach is to find a feedback control law such as the closed loop dynamics is a state error pch system with dissipation and it is widely recognized that ida pbc method is robust for under actuated mechanical systems by using the lyapunov s direct method and backstepping control approach to track the reference position and orientation to globally exponentially stable have already existed in the literature dong et al 2015 klinger et al 2017 liao et al 2010 some scholars used this approach to resolve the trajectory tracking problem of the usv system liao et al 2014 2016 and the result showed that the controller can still force the trajectory in this paper pch control method and backstepping control method of usvs are combined to ensure that the system has the advantages of the two control methods the pch control method is energy control firstly the usvs are considered as an energy conversion device which can transform the input energy into output energy its control goal is to optimize input and output energy of the whole system and the system can reach its minimum energy consumption we write the classical model of usv due to fossen into a port hamiltonian systems phs form after that the closed loop system takes a phs form by fixing the interconnection matrix when the backstepping control method is used usvs are considered as a signal conversion device which can transform the input signal into the output signal its control goal is to improve the dynamic and steady state response of the system the coordination control strategy is proposed to change the control strength of signal controller and energy controller over time each control can play a role in the corresponding period of time to maximize its control effect the fast dynamic response and minimum energy loss make the system to achieve the desired control effect finally we simulate to analyze the performance of the proposed control approach 2 problem description the usv propulsion system consists of two propellers which are driven by two electric powered motors is shown as in fig 1 by the force and torque control usv can keep moving in the condition of surge sway and yaw the forces f and torque t are functions of the two surge control forces from each propeller 1 f f 1 f 2 t b f 1 f 2 2 where the thrust f 1 is created by the first motor and the thrust f 2 is created by the second motor b is the distance between the two propellers from 1 the thrust allocated to each propeller f 1 and f 2 can be calculated for the simulation study and control methodology design purposes the availability of a sufficiently accurate usv model that enable effective control design is imperative the widely used usv model including both kinematics and kinetics components was given by fossen 2002 and he used a word maneuvering that describes a vehicle s motion in the horizontal plane these are generally based on a combination of physical principles and empirical observation and they are often decomposed into speed surge subsystem and steering sway and yaw subsystem we consider the degrees of freedom in surge sway and yaw the kinetics model of usv can be described as 2 m 11 u m 22 v r d 11 u f τ d 1 m 22 v m 11 u r d 22 v τ d 2 m 33 r m 22 m 11 u v d 33 r t τ d 3 where u is surge velocity v is sway velocity and r is yaw rate in body fixed reference frame m ii are inertia coefficients of usv including mass effects added d ii are hydrodynamic damping coefficients in conditions of surge sway and yaw f are the forces of the propulsion system t is the steering torque and τ d i represent the force and torque disturbance inputs the kinematics model of usvs can be described as 3 x u c o s ψ v s i n ψ y u s i n ψ v c o s ψ ψ r where x y are the cartesian coordinated in the earth fixed reference frame and ψ denotes orientation angle of the vessel equations 2 and 3 can be expressed in matrix form 4 m υ c υ υ d υ υ τ τ d η k η υ here υ u v r t and η x y ψ t τ f 0 t t τ d τ d 1 τ d 2 τ d 3 t m is an inertia parameters matrix including the added body mass c υ is the so called coriolis and centripetal matrix and d υ is hydrodynamic damping matrix further detail can be found in fossen s article fossen 2002 we assume that there are no actuator constraints saturation and rate limits and the external disturbances have bound when the usvs run at low speed they run in displacement mode whereby the hull is supported by buoyancy forces in this work we are only discussing a linear drag model which is only appropriate for low speed and station keeping operations it is a challenge to control the motion of usv accurately and to quickly prevent collisions as well as any safety problem addressed by the high level planner approach such as genetic algorithm a search algorithm line of sight los method the operating environment can dynamically change into a way that cannot be totally predict such as the moving usvs might suddenly change their orientation or speed of motion at any time a variation on a radar track is detected the motion planning controller must be fast enough to generate a new path so the reference heading angle and speed generated by the motion planner are extremely important sean kragelund et al 2013 simetti et al 2009 the thrust of the propeller was also explored klinger et al 2017 and it can be written as 5 t p k p ρ ω 2 d 4 here t p is thrust of the propeller ρ is the water density d is the diameter of the propeller and ω is the angular velocity of the motor rotor the propeller is driven by the permanent magnet synchronous motor the main energy loss of the usv system is the copper loss of the permanent magnet synchronous motor it can be described as follows jiunn jiang and kan ping 2003 6 p l o s s p c u 3 2 r s i d 2 i q 2 where i d and i q are the d and q axis currents of pmsm r s is the stator phase winding resistance of pmsm because the sway force is missing in the v equation 2 the usv is clearly under actuated without consideration of x y we research only the combined heading angle and speed control problem of u v r ψ in this paper it is obvious that the surge velocity always couples with yaw rate due to the fact that it s impossible to control either one of them independently in literature ghommam et al 2006 liao et al 2010 the system can be viewed as two interconnected subsystems in cascade form which can be written as follows 7 1 x 1 f 1 t x 1 g t x x 2 2 x 2 f 2 t x 2 τ where x δ x 1 x 2 t x 1 δ v x 2 δ u r ψ t the function f 1 t x 1 is continuously differentiable in t x 1 and f 2 t x 2 τ g t x are continuous in their arguments and locally lipschitz if the following assumptions are satisfied then the cascade system 1 and 2 is globally uniformly asymptotically stable 1 the system x 1 f 1 t x 1 is uniformly globally asymptotically stable 2 there exists a control law to globally asymptotically stabilizes the system 2 3 the function g t x satisfies 8 g t x 2 θ 1 x 2 2 θ 2 x 2 2 x 1 2 where 2 θ 1 θ 2 refers to the euclidian norm defined for vectors and the induced euclidian norm defined for matrices that means we only need to design a stabilizing control law to stabilize the system 2 the detailed proof can be seen in literature ghommam et al 2006 liao et al 2010 liao liao et al 2010 and klinger et al 2017 pointed out that the combined surge speed and heading control laws make the state u v r ψ t globally uniformly asymptotically convergent to u d 0 0 ψ d t and bounded the control objective is to design a hybrid coordination controller that can track the given heading angle and speed signals from system 4 the equilibrium point should be u v r ψ t u d 0 0 ψ d t where u d and ψ d respectively refer to the desired surge speed and the desired heading angle the main energy loss 6 of the usv system should be smaller and p l o s s arg min p l o s s 3 design of the proposed control algorithm 3 1 port controlled hamiltonian model of unmanned surface vehicles system we consider a nonlinear system that is described by the port controlled hamiltonian pch form lanczos 1986 ortega and garcía canseco 2004 9 q p 0 i n i n 0 h q h p 0 g q τ 0 i n τ d y g t q h p where q ℝ n p ℝ n are the states respectively τ and y ℝ m m n are the input and output variables respectively and the n m matrix g q is the input matrix which represents the interconnection structure if m n the system is fully actuated while if m n the system is under actuated the hamiltonian function which is defined as the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy is the total energy of the system 10 h q p k q p v q 1 2 p t m 1 q p v q where v q is the potential energy function and m q m t q 0 is the inertia matrix if m is constant the pch system is called separable otherwise it is called non separable the model 9 can be further depicted as 11 q p j q p r q p h q h p 0 g q τ 0 i n τ d y g t q h p the matrix j q p is a skew symmetric matrix function that describes the system interconnection structure and r q p is symmetric and positive semi definite and describes the structure of the dissipative components of the system following the references donaire and perez 2010 romero et al 2013 we make the following definition state 12 q δ η p δ m υ and the hamiltonian function is given by 13 h q p 1 2 p t m 1 q p 1 2 m 11 u 2 m 22 v 2 m 33 r 2 then the usv nonlinear dynamics model 4 in phs form can be represented as 14 q p 0 k q k t q c p 0 0 0 d h q h p 0 g q τ 0 i n τ d from equations 11 13 and 14 the usv nonlinear dynamic model 14 can also be expressed in the form of equation 11 where 15 j q p 0 k q k t q c p j t q p 16 r q p 0 0 0 d 0 j q p is the skew symmetric matrix and r q p is positive semi definite symmetric matrix in equation 14 17 m m 11 0 0 0 m 22 0 0 0 m 33 d d 11 0 0 0 d 22 0 0 0 d 33 18 c p 0 0 p 2 0 0 p 1 p 2 p 1 0 0 0 m 22 v 0 0 m 11 u m 22 v m 11 u 0 the vector of input τ ℝ m m n so the usv is a typical under actuated system 3 2 ida pbc control of unmanned surface vehicles system the ida pbc method has been proposed by paper ortega et al 2002b to control under actuated mechanical systems given a pch system 9 without disturbances we can obtain the following preserved pch dynamics by using the ida pbc control method the desired closed loop system should be given by the form 19 q p 0 k q k t q j 2 0 0 0 d h d q h d p it can also take the form as 20 q p j d q p r d q p h d q h d p where the terms 21 j d q p j d t q p 0 k q k t q j 2 22 r d r d t 0 0 0 d 0 d d 1 0 0 0 d 2 0 0 0 d 3 represent the desired interconnection and damping structures j 2 j 2 t is a free parameter the dissipation damping matrix d could be of the following form d g k v g t 0 where k v 0 the desired equilibrium is the closed loop hamiltonian function s minimum point and the closed loop hamiltonian function is given by 23 h d p q 1 2 m 11 u u d 2 m 22 v 2 m 33 r 2 1 2 k ψ ψ ψ d 2 where k ψ is a positive parameter when the system comes to the equilibrium point from equations 2 and 3 we can obtain 24 u v r ψ t u d 0 0 ψ d t in ida pbc control approach the control law τ i d a makes system 14 equal to the pch system in 9 and choose j 2 c p 25 τ i d a g t q g q 1 g t q j d q p r d q p h d p q j q p r q p h p q then we can obtain the regulation energy shaping and the damping injection controller 26 f e d 11 u d 1 u u d 0 d 22 v d 2 v t e k ψ ψ d ψ m 22 v u d d 33 r d 3 r to ensure that the v equation holds we choose d 2 d 22 3 3 lyapunov s direct method and backstepping approach control of unmanned surface vehicles system as stated in papers ghommam et al 2006 klinger et al 2017 liao et al 2010 the surge speed and heading controller has been developed respectively via lyapunov s direct method and backstepping approach by using feedback linearization and the motion system 4 also can be expressed as the cascaded system the combined motion system u v r ψ t can be separated out surge speed subsystem and yaw subsystem considering the surge subsystem of motion system 4 without disturbances a nonlinear feedback surge speed controller can be developed for the surge subsystem by using input state linearization let ξ u be a linearizing control the error feedback surge speed control law can be defined as 27 f m 11 ξ u m 22 v r d 11 u if the surge tracking error is defined as e u u u d and the linearizing control input of the form ξ u k u e u is selected where k u is a positive parameter then the surge tracking error dynamics will be 28 e u k u e u 0 we can see that the heading subsystem is a typical cascade control system and we can use backstepping method to stabilize it now the heading subsystem without disturbances can be rewritten as 29 m 33 r t m 22 m 11 u v d 33 r ψ r we denote e ψ ψ ψ d as the heading tracking error the time derivative of the heading tracking error is 30 e ψ ψ ψ d r ψ d in order to obtain stable feedback the lyapunov candidate function is defined as 31 v 1 e ψ 2 e ψ 2 2 the linearizing control input of the form ξ ψ k 1 e ψ k 2 r is selected k 1 and k 2 are positive parameters then the surge tracking error dynamics will be 32 t m 33 ξ ψ m 22 m 11 u v d 33 r the time derivative of the v 1 can be obtained as follows 33 v 1 e ψ e ψ e ψ e ψ k 1 e ψ 2 k 2 e ψ 2 0 from equation 27 and equation 32 the signal controller of the system is 34 f s m 11 k u e u m 22 v r d 11 u t s m 33 k 1 e ψ k 2 r m 22 m 11 u v d 33 r 3 4 coordination control of unmanned surface vehicles system the coordination control strategy is shown in fig 2 in order to realize the coordination control strategy the coordination functions are designed to change the control strength of signal controller and energy controller over time when the usv starts the control strength of signal controller is much bigger than the control strength of energy controller therefore the system can reach its steady state quickly as time goes on the percentage of energy control strength will increase the total loss of the system is optimized at the steady state the coordination functions can be designed as 35 c s u t e t t 1 t u c e u t 1 e t t 1 t u c s ψ t e t t 1 t ψ c e ψ t 1 e t t 1 t ψ where t u and t ψ are coordination time constants t 1 is the initial moment when the absolute value change of the surge speed tracking error is satisfied the condition u u d β u β u is a constant and β u 0 and t 1 is the initial moment when the absolute value change of the heading angle tracking error is satisfied the condition ψ ψ d β ψ β ψ is a constant and β ψ 0 obviously the coordination functions have c s u t 0 1 c e u t 0 1 c s ψ t 0 1 c e ψ t 0 1 therefore the coordination strategy is 36 τ 1 c s u t f s c e u t f e τ 3 c s ψ t t s c e ψ t t e 3 5 stability 1 for the signal control subsystem the system state variables χ u v r ψ t can stabilize at the equilibrium point u d 0 0 ψ d t the lyapunov candidate function of the nomianl system f t χ is defined as 37 v s e u 2 e ψ 2 e ψ 2 2 the time derivative of v s along nomianl system becomes 38 v s k u e u 2 k 1 e ψ 2 k 2 e ψ 2 0 obviously we can get v s is positive definite and v s is negative semi definite the time derivative of v s is zero only when the nomianl system without external disturbances reaches the equilibrium point let v s be a lyapunov function of the nominal system suppose the disturbances inputs satisfies the bound τ d γ t χ δ t where γ t satisfies 0 γ s d s using lemma 9 4 and lemma 9 5 in khalil 2000 the signal controller subsystem with disturbances is asymptotically stability 2 for the energy control subsystem we consider the lyapunov candidate function of the pch system defined as v e h d p q which is minimized at the equilibrium point u d 0 0 ψ d t we can compute the time derivative of v e with respect to time for the solutions 19 to obtaining ortega and garcía canseco 2004 ortega et al 2002a yu et al 2013 39 v e h d p q t h d p p t h d q q t h d p d d h d p 0 by using lyapunov stability theory the stability of the closed loop system is established asymptotic stability follows by applying the la salle s invariance principle if the largest invariant set of the system contained in p q ℝ n h d p q 0 the energy subsystem is asymptotically stability from equations 15 16 17 and 18 if the parameters are with uncertain displacement and drag the structures of the matrix j x and d x are also maintained then the interconnection and damping structures of the system remain unchanged the stability of the system is also asymptotically stable the closed loop system with external disturbance forces can be rewritten as follows 40 q p 0 k q k t q j 2 0 0 0 d h d q h d p 0 τ d and the vector τ d represents the disturbance forces using theorem 5 in sontag 2008 the closed loop system is iss which implies the system satisfies 41 α v e t β v e 0 t 0 t γ τ d s d s where α γ k β k l sontag 2008 this property has a nice physical interpretation when disturbances inputs have finite energy the closed system is also bounded energy weakly converging state that means there exists some σ k makes the following implication holding 42 0 σ τ d s d s lim t inf v e t v e 0 τ d 0 3 from daniel liberzon 2003 it is well known that a switched system is stable if all individual subsystems are stable and the switching is sufficiently slow so as to allow the transient effects to dissipate after each switch from the above discussion of stability each subsystems are globally exponentially stable so the lyapunov candidate function of signal subsystem and energy subsystem can be bounded as follows 43 a 1 χ 2 v s b 1 χ 2 44 v s c 1 χ 2 45 a 2 χ 2 v e b 2 χ 2 46 v e c 2 χ 2 where a 1 b 1 c 1 a 2 b 2 c 2 ℝ 0 if the dwell time is sufficiently large which guarantees that the hypotheses of theorem 3 1 in liberzon 2003 are satisfied the switch system is asymptotically stable the dwell time is obtained by calculating the switching time satisfy the inequality t i 1 t i t d for all i liberzon 2003 for the surge subsystem the dwell time is 47 t d t u log b 1 b 2 a 1 a 2 for the sway yaw subsystem the dwell time is 48 t d t ψ log b 1 b 2 a 1 a 2 then the switched system is globally asymptotically stable 4 simulation results in order to demonstrate the performance of our coordination controller and to validate our control methodology the simulation is performed for the usv motion the simulation results perform on a model usv with a mass of 17 5 kg and a length of 1 2 m and two propellers driven by pmsm motors are equipped for providing surge force and yaw moment simulation is carried in matlab simulink software the different parameters of the usv are listed as bellows do and pan 2006b m 11 25 8 kg m 22 33 8 kg m 33 2 76 kg m 2 d 11 12 kg s d 22 17 kg s d 33 0 5 kg m 2 s the parameters of the pmsm are r s 2 875 ω the control parameters are taken as k ψ 5000 d 1 100 d 3 2000 k u 10 k 1 5000 k 2 1000 β u β ψ 0 1 the heading angle response curve and the surge speed response curve are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively through the simulation the different coordination time constants are t ψ 1 t u 1 0 5 s t ψ 2 t u 2 0 3 s t ψ 3 t u 3 0 1 s t ψ 4 t u 4 0 8 s usually the coordination time constants have a range of 0 1 according to figs 3 and 4 we can see that it may get satisfactory control effect when t ψ t u 0 5 s t ψ 4 t u 4 0 8 s for the balance between energy controller and signal controller the coordination time constants are set to t ψ t u 0 5 s at the moment of t 0 s the desired states are u d v d r d ψ d t 1 0 0 180 π t and the desired states u d v d r d ψ d t changes suddenly to 1 2 0 0 270 π t at the moment of t 30 s the simulation experiment shown in fig 5 fig 7 illustrates the performance of the three controllers ida pbc approach lyapunov s direct method and backstepping approach coordination strategy when the vehicle is held under the action of a constant current and changes on the heading and speed references are set the simulation results verify the theoretical properties of stability position regulation of the coordination strategy controller fig 5 shows the performance of the three heading angle controllers fig 6 shows the performance of the three surge speed controllers fig 7 shows the energy dissipation of the three controllers according to figs 5 and 6 the signal controller has the best dynamical response and the energy controller has the minimal energy loss it can be seen from fig 7 that the coordination strategy has the lower energy dissipation at the steady state in the dynamic state the signal controller is the main control strength of the coordination control system and the energy controller affects the control strength of the coordination control system at the steady state so the coordination strategy can accelerate the dynamical response and achieve the purpose of reducing the energy dissipation at the same time we construct a continuously varying function as the desired surge speed and heading angle 49 u d cos 0 05 π t ψ d cos 0 05 π t the time varying disturbances are taken as τ d t k t ψ σ with the first order markov process σ σ ξ ω where σ r 3 is the vector of bias forces ω r 3 is the vector of zero mean gaussian white noise and ξ r 3 3 is a diagonal matrix scaling the amplitude of ω du et al 2016 choose σ 0 10 n 10 n 10 nm and ξ diag 2 3 5 the simulation results are depicted using solid line in fig 8 and fig 9 it can be seen from figs 8 and 9 that the coordination strategy achieves satisfactory control performance for time varying desired states with time varying disturbances the energy dissipation curves of different approaches ida pbc backstepping coordination are given in fig 10 the illustrates shows that the hybrid coordination controller not only reduces energy consumption but also has a good dynamic response 5 conclusion in this paper we present a hybrid coordination control method based on signal and energy for speed and heading control of unmanned surface vehicles system the pch control subsystem optimizes the energy consumption energy of usv system and the backstepping control subsystem makes usv system has perfect dynamic performances in addition the pch controller plays a major role when the closed system is in steady state and the backstepping controller plays a significant role when the closed system is in dynamic state the advantage of each controller does make sense when it is operating therefore the hybrid coordination control method overcomes the shortcomings of cannot balance quickly track signals with energy optimization using traditional methods that are only used as a signal controller or an energy controller the proposed control method has good application values and practical significance simulation results confirm the validity and stability of control algorithm the coordination control strategy has the advantages of both controller the closed loop system can not only quickly track the signal but also has good steady state performance and strong stability there are still open problems in this field the usv model used in this paper is not considering drag and disturbance uncertainties likewise we have not discussed guidance problem finally the pch system that is known to be passive have excellent robustness properties we have not analyzed the robustness of the hybrid system we defer these topics to future work the future work will also focus on extending the proposed approach to solve the trajectory tracking problem of the underactuated unmanned surface

system the coordination control strategy is proposed to change the control strength of signal controller and energy controller over time each control can play a role in the corresponding period of time to maximize its control effect the fast dynamic response and minimum energy loss make the system to achieve the desired control effect finally we simulate to analyze the performance of the proposed control approach 2 problem description the usv propulsion system consists of two propellers which are driven by two electric powered motors is shown as in fig 1 by the force and torque control usv can keep moving in the condition of surge sway and yaw the forces f and torque t are functions of the two surge control forces from each propeller 1 f f 1 f 2 t b f 1 f 2 2 where the thrust f 1 is created by the first motor and the thrust f 2 is created by the second motor b is the distance between the two propellers from 1 the thrust allocated to each propeller f 1 and f 2 can be calculated for the simulation study and control methodology design purposes the availability of a sufficiently accurate usv model that enable effective control design is imperative the widely used usv model including both kinematics and kinetics components was given by fossen 2002 and he used a word maneuvering that describes a vehicle s motion in the horizontal plane these are generally based on a combination of physical principles and empirical observation and they are often decomposed into speed surge subsystem and steering sway and yaw subsystem we consider the degrees of freedom in surge sway and yaw the kinetics model of usv can be described as 2 m 11 u m 22 v r d 11 u f τ d 1 m 22 v m 11 u r d 22 v τ d 2 m 33 r m 22 m 11 u v d 33 r t τ d 3 where u is surge velocity v is sway velocity and r is yaw rate in body fixed reference frame m ii are inertia coefficients of usv including mass effects added d ii are hydrodynamic damping coefficients in conditions of surge sway and yaw f are the forces of the propulsion system t is the steering torque and τ d i represent the force and torque disturbance inputs the kinematics model of usvs can be described as 3 x u c o s ψ v s i n ψ y u s i n ψ v c o s ψ ψ r where x y are the cartesian coordinated in the earth fixed reference frame and ψ denotes orientation angle of the vessel equations 2 and 3 can be expressed in matrix form 4 m υ c υ υ d υ υ τ τ d η k η υ here υ u v r t and η x y ψ t τ f 0 t t τ d τ d 1 τ d 2 τ d 3 t m is an inertia parameters matrix including the added body mass c υ is the so called coriolis and centripetal matrix and d υ is hydrodynamic damping matrix further detail can be found in fossen s article fossen 2002 we assume that there are no actuator constraints saturation and rate limits and the external disturbances have bound when the usvs run at low speed they run in displacement mode whereby the hull is supported by buoyancy forces in this work we are only discussing a linear drag model which is only appropriate for low speed and station keeping operations it is a challenge to control the motion of usv accurately and to quickly prevent collisions as well as any safety problem addressed by the high level planner approach such as genetic algorithm a search algorithm line of sight los method the operating environment can dynamically change into a way that cannot be totally predict such as the moving usvs might suddenly change their orientation or speed of motion at any time a variation on a radar track is detected the motion planning controller must be fast enough to generate a new path so the reference heading angle and speed generated by the motion planner are extremely important sean kragelund et al 2013 simetti et al 2009 the thrust of the propeller was also explored klinger et al 2017 and it can be written as 5 t p k p ρ ω 2 d 4 here t p is thrust of the propeller ρ is the water density d is the diameter of the propeller and ω is the angular velocity of the motor rotor the propeller is driven by the permanent magnet synchronous motor the main energy loss of the usv system is the copper loss of the permanent magnet synchronous motor it can be described as follows jiunn jiang and kan ping 2003 6 p l o s s p c u 3 2 r s i d 2 i q 2 where i d and i q are the d and q axis currents of pmsm r s is the stator phase winding resistance of pmsm because the sway force is missing in the v equation 2 the usv is clearly under actuated without consideration of x y we research only the combined heading angle and speed control problem of u v r ψ in this paper it is obvious that the surge velocity always couples with yaw rate due to the fact that it s impossible to control either one of them independently in literature ghommam et al 2006 liao et al 2010 the system can be viewed as two interconnected subsystems in cascade form which can be written as follows 7 1 x 1 f 1 t x 1 g t x x 2 2 x 2 f 2 t x 2 τ where x δ x 1 x 2 t x 1 δ v x 2 δ u r ψ t the function f 1 t x 1 is continuously differentiable in t x 1 and f 2 t x 2 τ g t x are continuous in their arguments and locally lipschitz if the following assumptions are satisfied then the cascade system 1 and 2 is globally uniformly asymptotically stable 1 the system x 1 f 1 t x 1 is uniformly globally asymptotically stable 2 there exists a control law to globally asymptotically stabilizes the system 2 3 the function g t x satisfies 8 g t x 2 θ 1 x 2 2 θ 2 x 2 2 x 1 2 where 2 θ 1 θ 2 refers to the euclidian norm defined for vectors and the induced euclidian norm defined for matrices that means we only need to design a stabilizing control law to stabilize the system 2 the detailed proof can be seen in literature ghommam et al 2006 liao et al 2010 liao liao et al 2010 and klinger et al 2017 pointed out that the combined surge speed and heading control laws make the state u v r ψ t globally uniformly asymptotically convergent to u d 0 0 ψ d t and bounded the control objective is to design a hybrid coordination controller that can track the given heading angle and speed signals from system 4 the equilibrium point should be u v r ψ t u d 0 0 ψ d t where u d and ψ d respectively refer to the desired surge speed and the desired heading angle the main energy loss 6 of the usv system should be smaller and p l o s s arg min p l o s s 3 design of the proposed control algorithm 3 1 port controlled hamiltonian model of unmanned surface vehicles system we consider a nonlinear system that is described by the port controlled hamiltonian pch form lanczos 1986 ortega and garcía canseco 2004 9 q p 0 i n i n 0 h q h p 0 g q τ 0 i n τ d y g t q h p where q ℝ n p ℝ n are the states respectively τ and y ℝ m m n are the input and output variables respectively and the n m matrix g q is the input matrix which represents the interconnection structure if m n the system is fully actuated while if m n the system is under actuated the hamiltonian function which is defined as the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy is the total energy of the system 10 h q p k q p v q 1 2 p t m 1 q p v q where v q is the potential energy function and m q m t q 0 is the inertia matrix if m is constant the pch system is called separable otherwise it is called non separable the model 9 can be further depicted as 11 q p j q p r q p h q h p 0 g q τ 0 i n τ d y g t q h p the matrix j q p is a skew symmetric matrix function that describes the system interconnection structure and r q p is symmetric and positive semi definite and describes the structure of the dissipative components of the system following the references donaire and perez 2010 romero et al 2013 we make the following definition state 12 q δ η p δ m υ and the hamiltonian function is given by 13 h q p 1 2 p t m 1 q p 1 2 m 11 u 2 m 22 v 2 m 33 r 2 then the usv nonlinear dynamics model 4 in phs form can be represented as 14 q p 0 k q k t q c p 0 0 0 d h q h p 0 g q τ 0 i n τ d from equations 11 13 and 14 the usv nonlinear dynamic model 14 can also be expressed in the form of equation 11 where 15 j q p 0 k q k t q c p j t q p 16 r q p 0 0 0 d 0 j q p is the skew symmetric matrix

the vector of input τ ℝ m m n so the usv is a typical under actuated system 3 2 ida pbc control of unmanned surface vehicles system the ida pbc method has been proposed by paper ortega et al 2002b to control under actuated mechanical systems given a pch system 9 without disturbances we can obtain the following preserved pch dynamics by using the ida pbc control method the desired closed loop system should be given by the form 19 q p 0 k q k t q j 2 0 0 0 d h d q h d p it can also take the form as 20 q p j d q p r d q p h d q h d p where the terms 21 j d q p j d t q p 0 k q k t q j 2 22 r d r d t 0 0 0 d 0 d d 1 0 0 0 d 2 0 0 0 d 3 represent the desired interconnection and damping structures j 2 j 2 t is a free parameter the dissipation damping matrix d could be of the following form d g k v g t 0 where k v 0 the desired equilibrium is the closed loop hamiltonian function s minimum point and the closed loop hamiltonian function is given by 23 h d p q 1 2 m 11 u u d 2 m 22 v 2 m 33 r 2 1 2 k ψ ψ ψ d 2 where k ψ is a positive parameter when the system comes to the equilibrium point from equations 2 and 3 we can obtain 24 u v r ψ t u d 0 0 ψ d t in ida pbc control approach the control law τ i d a makes system 14 equal to the pch system in 9 and choose j 2 c p 25 τ i d a g t q g q 1 g t q j d q p r d q p h d p q j q p r q p h p q then we can obtain the regulation energy shaping and the damping injection controller 26 f e d 11 u d 1 u u d 0 d 22 v d 2 v t e k ψ ψ d ψ m 22 v u d d 33 r d 3 r to ensure that the v equation holds we choose d 2 d 22 3 3 lyapunov s direct method and backstepping approach control of unmanned surface vehicles system as stated in papers ghommam et al 2006 klinger et al 2017 liao et al 2010 the surge speed and heading controller has been developed respectively via lyapunov s direct method and backstepping approach by using feedback linearization and the motion system 4 also can be expressed as the cascaded system the combined motion system u v r ψ t can be separated out surge speed subsystem and yaw subsystem considering the surge subsystem of motion system 4 without disturbances a nonlinear feedback surge speed controller can be developed for the surge subsystem by using input state linearization let ξ u be a linearizing control the error feedback surge speed control law can be defined as 27 f m 11 ξ u m 22 v r d 11 u if the surge tracking error is defined as e u u u d and the linearizing control input of the form ξ u k u e u is selected where k u is a positive parameter then the surge tracking error dynamics will be 28 e u k u e u 0 we can see that the heading subsystem is a typical cascade control system and we can use backstepping method to stabilize it now the heading subsystem without disturbances can be rewritten as 29 m 33 r t m 22 m 11 u v d 33 r ψ r we denote e ψ ψ ψ d as the heading tracking error the time derivative of the heading tracking error is 30 e ψ ψ ψ d r ψ d in order to obtain stable feedback the lyapunov candidate function is defined as 31 v 1 e ψ 2 e ψ 2 2 the linearizing control input of the form ξ ψ k 1 e ψ k 2 r is selected k 1 and k 2 are positive parameters then the surge tracking error dynamics will be 32 t m 33 ξ ψ m 22 m 11 u v d 33 r the time derivative of the v 1 can be obtained as follows 33 v 1 e ψ e ψ e ψ e ψ k 1 e ψ 2 k 2 e ψ 2 0 from equation 27 and equation 32 the signal controller of the system is 34 f s m 11 k u e u m 22 v r d 11 u t s m 33 k 1 e ψ k 2 r m 22 m 11 u v d 33 r 3 4 coordination control of unmanned surface vehicles system the coordination control strategy is shown in fig 2 in order to realize the coordination control strategy the coordination functions are designed to change the control strength of signal controller and energy controller over time when the usv starts the control strength of signal controller is much bigger than the control strength of energy controller therefore the system can reach its steady state quickly as time goes on the percentage of energy control strength will increase the total loss of the system is optimized at the steady state the coordination functions can be designed as 35 c s u t e t t 1 t u c e u t 1 e t t 1 t u c s ψ t e t t 1 t ψ c e ψ t 1 e t t 1 t ψ where t u and t ψ are coordination time constants t 1 is the initial moment when the absolute value change of the surge speed tracking error is satisfied the condition u u d β u β u is a constant and β u 0 and t 1 is the initial moment when the absolute value change of the heading angle tracking error is satisfied the condition ψ ψ d β ψ β ψ is a constant and β ψ 0 obviously the coordination functions have c s u t 0 1 c e u t 0 1 c s ψ t 0 1 c e ψ t 0 1 therefore the coordination strategy is 36 τ 1 c s u t f s c e u t f e τ 3 c s ψ t t s c e ψ t t e 3 5 stability 1 for the signal control subsystem the system state variables χ u v r ψ t can stabilize at the equilibrium point u d 0 0 ψ d t the lyapunov candidate function of the nomianl system f t χ is defined as 37 v s e u 2 e ψ 2 e ψ 2 2 the time derivative of v s along nomianl system becomes 38 v s k u e u 2 k 1 e ψ 2 k 2 e ψ 2 0 obviously we can get v s is positive definite and v s is negative semi definite the time derivative of v s is zero only when the nomianl system without external disturbances reaches the equilibrium point let v s be a lyapunov function of the nominal system suppose the disturbances inputs satisfies the bound τ d γ t χ δ t where γ t satisfies 0 γ s d s using lemma 9 4 and lemma 9 5 in khalil 2000 the signal controller subsystem with disturbances is asymptotically stability 2 for the energy control subsystem we consider the lyapunov candidate function of the pch system defined as v e h d p q which is minimized at the equilibrium point u d 0 0 ψ d t we can compute the time derivative of v e with respect to time for the solutions 19 to obtaining ortega and garcía canseco 2004 ortega et al 2002a yu et al 2013 39 v e h d p q t h d p p t h d q q t h d p d d h d p 0 by using lyapunov stability theory the stability of the closed loop system is established asymptotic stability follows by applying the la salle s invariance principle if the largest invariant set of the system contained in p q ℝ n h d p q 0 the energy subsystem is asymptotically stability from equations 15 16 17 and 18 if the parameters are with uncertain displacement and drag the structures of the matrix j x and d x are also maintained then the interconnection and damping structures of the system remain unchanged the stability of the system is also asymptotically stable the closed loop system with external disturbance forces can be rewritten as follows 40 q p 0 k q k t q j 2 0 0 0 d h d q h d p 0 τ d and the vector τ d represents the disturbance forces using theorem 5 in sontag 2008 the closed loop system is iss which implies the system satisfies 41 α v e t β v e 0 t 0 t γ τ d s d s where α γ k β k l sontag 2008 this property has a nice physical interpretation when disturbances inputs have finite energy the closed system is also bounded energy weakly converging state that means there exists some σ k makes the following implication holding 42 0 σ τ d s d s lim t inf v e t v e 0 τ d 0 3 from daniel liberzon 2003 it is well known that a switched system is stable if all individual subsystems are stable and the switching is sufficiently slow so as to allow the transient effects to dissipate after each switch from the above discussion of stability each subsystems are globally exponentially stable so the lyapunov candidate function of signal subsystem and energy subsystem can be bounded as follows 43 a 1 χ 2 v s b 1 χ 2 44 v s c 1 χ 2 45 a 2 χ 2 v e b 2 χ 2 46 v e c 2 χ 2 where a 1 b 1 c 1 a 2 b 2 c 2 ℝ 0 if the dwell time is sufficiently large which guarantees that the hypotheses of theorem 3 1 in liberzon 2003 are satisfied the switch system is asymptotically stable the dwell time is obtained by calculating the switching time satisfy the inequality t i 1 t i t d for all i liberzon 2003 for the surge subsystem the dwell time is 47 t d t u log b 1 b 2 a 1 a 2 for the sway yaw subsystem the dwell time is 48 t d t ψ log b 1 b 2 a 1 a 2 then the switched system is globally asymptotically stable 4 simulation results in order to demonstrate the performance of our coordination controller and to validate our control methodology the simulation is performed for the usv motion the simulation results perform on a model usv with a mass of 17 5 kg and a length of 1 2 m and two propellers driven by pmsm motors are equipped for providing surge force and yaw moment simulation is carried in matlab simulink software the different parameters of the usv are listed as bellows do and pan 2006b m 11 25 8 kg m 22 33 8 kg m 33 2 76 kg m 2 d 11 12 kg s d 22 17 kg s d 33 0 5 kg m 2 s the parameters of the pmsm are r s 2 875 ω the control parameters are taken as k ψ 5000 d 1 100 d 3 2000 k u 10 k 1 5000 k 2 1000 β u β ψ 0 1 the heading angle response curve and the surge speed response curve are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively through the simulation the different coordination time constants are t ψ 1 t u 1 0 5 s t ψ 2 t u 2 0 3 s t ψ 3 t u 3 0 1 s t ψ 4 t u 4 0 8 s usually the coordination time constants have a range of 0 1 according to figs 3 and 4 we can see that it may get satisfactory control effect when t ψ t u 0 5 s t ψ 4 t u 4 0 8 s for the balance between energy controller and signal controller the coordination time constants are set to t ψ t u 0 5 s at the moment of t 0 s the desired states are u d v d r d ψ d t 1 0 0 180 π t and the desired states u d v d r d ψ d t changes suddenly to 1 2 0 0 270 π t at the moment of t 30 s the simulation experiment shown in fig 5 fig 7 illustrates the performance of the three controllers ida pbc approach lyapunov s direct method and backstepping approach coordination strategy when the vehicle is held under the action of a constant current and changes on the heading and speed references are set the simulation results verify the theoretical properties of stability position regulation of the coordination strategy controller fig 5 shows the performance of the three heading angle controllers fig 6 shows the performance of the three surge speed controllers fig 7 shows the energy dissipation of the three controllers according to figs 5 and 6 the signal controller has the best dynamical response and the energy controller has the minimal energy loss it can be seen from fig 7 that the coordination strategy has the lower energy dissipation at the steady state in the dynamic state the signal controller is the main control strength of the coordination control system and the energy controller affects the control strength of the coordination control system at the steady state so the coordination strategy can accelerate the dynamical response and achieve the purpose of reducing the energy dissipation at the same time we construct a continuously varying function as the desired surge speed and heading angle 49 u d cos 0 05 π t ψ d cos 0 05 π t the time varying disturbances are taken as τ d t k t ψ σ with the first order markov process σ σ ξ ω where σ r 3 is the vector of bias forces ω r 3 is the vector of zero mean gaussian white noise and ξ r 3 3 is a diagonal matrix scaling the amplitude of ω du et al 2016 choose σ 0 10 n 10 n 10 nm and ξ diag 2 3 5 the simulation results are depicted using solid line in fig 8 and fig 9 it can be seen from figs 8 and 9 that the coordination strategy achieves satisfactory control performance for time varying desired states with time varying disturbances the energy dissipation curves of different approaches ida pbc backstepping coordination are given in fig 10 the illustrates shows that the hybrid coordination controller not only reduces energy consumption but also has a good dynamic response 5 conclusion in this paper we present a hybrid coordination control method based on signal and energy for speed and heading control of unmanned surface vehicles system the pch control subsystem optimizes the energy consumption energy of usv system and the backstepping control subsystem makes usv system has perfect dynamic performances in addition the pch controller plays a major role when the closed system is in steady state and the backstepping controller plays a significant role when the closed system is in dynamic state the advantage of each controller does make sense when it is operating therefore the hybrid coordination control method overcomes the shortcomings of cannot balance quickly track signals with energy optimization using traditional methods that are only used as a signal controller or an energy controller the proposed control method has good application values and practical significance simulation results confirm the validity and stability of control algorithm the coordination control strategy has the advantages of both controller the closed loop system can not only quickly track the signal but also has good steady state performance and strong stability there are still open problems in this field the usv model used in this paper is not considering drag and disturbance uncertainties likewise we have not discussed guidance problem finally the pch system that is known to be passive have excellent robustness properties we have not analyzed the robustness of the hybrid system we defer these topics to future work the future work will also focus on extending the proposed approach to solve the trajectory tracking problem of the underactuated unmanned surface

22946,oscillating water column owc is the most widely used wave energy converting technology for onshore structures the interest in owc wave energy converters wecs has been rising in the last decade because of its capability of long term operation with high reliability and survivability the impulse and wells turbines acting as axial flow self rectifying turbines and rotating unidirectionally in reciprocating airflows generated by the air chamber play a key role in the pneumatic power conversion of owc facilities although these turbines were developed based on theoretical analysis and steady

fuels as an alternative solution renewable energy has been widely used for electricity generation in recent times it was reported that the proportion of renewable energy sources in power generation increased by 14 1 in 2016 realizing the highest growth rate on record british petroleum 2017 besides solar and wind energy ocean wave energy has attracted attentions because of its vast reserves and wide distribution many types of wave energy converters wecs have been developed to successfully harness wave energy according to their working principle wecs are generally classified as three types oscillating water column owc overtopping and oscillating body drew et al 2009 falcão 2010 lagoun et al 2010 lópez et al 2013 the advantage of owc over the other types is its simplicity of structure operation and maintenance 1 1 owc technology several reviews on owcs have been conducted by heath 2012 and delmonte et al 2016 yoshio masuda 1925 2009 the pioneer of modern wave power technology proposed a navigation buoy with an air turbine that became a prototype of the first floating owc falcão and henriques 2016 studies prior to the 1990s preliminarily presented different concepts of owcs and investigated their hydrodynamic performance and efficiencies some well known plants were deployed and constructed including the research barge kaimei designed by the japan marine science and technology center kudo 1984 a breakwater owc developed by the national engineering laboratory in scotland moody 1979 a 60 kw owc facility at the sakata port in japan suzuki et al 2004 takahashi et al 1992 and a 125 kw owc plant at trivandrum in india das 1992 large scale owcs have been developed with higher rated powers for grid connection as summarized in table 1 as shown in fig 1 a typical onshore owc plant comprises an air chamber with an open mouth below the water surface on the skirt wall incident waves cause the water column to oscillate inside the chamber which results in a variation of the sealed air volume upon the free water surface the pressure difference between the external atmosphere and the chamber compresses and decompresses the air to be exhaled and inhaled through the duct hence the air turbine installed in the duct is capable of converting the low pressure pneumatic energy into mechanical shaft power as the primary moving component air turbines have no contact with the seawater during operation this facilitates maintenance and repair of the owc components 1 2 air turbines for owc for an owc plant it is important to capture the pneumatic energy from the reciprocating airflow efficiently the earliest operating mode was to equip the owcs by a rectifying system with non return valves and a traditional air turbine such as the francis turbine or other axial flow turbines one successful example is the owc type navigation buoy developed in the 1960s masuda 1985 takao and setoguchi 2012 as shown in fig 2 however this rectifying system was considered impractical when used in a large scaled plant its complicated mechanical structure made it difficult to manufacture and maintain in large size which was demonstrated in the sea trial of a two valve traditional turbine in kaimei kocivar 1980 masuda and mccormick 2015 as shown in fig 3 consequently the concept of a self rectifying air turbine which can rectify the airflows by the turbine itself directly was proposed as an alternative this kind of turbine is capable of rotating in one direction regardless of the incident airflow direction the vast majority of axial flow self rectifying air turbines discussed in this review for owc application thus far are mainly of two types wells turbine and impulse turbine the wells turbine proposed by alan arthur wells in 1976 raghunathan 1984 was employed for owc plants because of its simple geometry and high operating efficiency as the flow coefficient increases from zero it is able to attain a high efficiency within a narrow operation region prior to stalling a sudden significant decrease in efficiency can be observed over the stalling point the efficiency remains low for large coefficients furthermore the wells turbine has other disadvantages such as poor self starting capability and high operating noise on the other hand the impulse turbine proposed by kim in 1988 has been undergoing rapid development to overcome the shortcomings of the wells turbine especially for the wave climate with lower energy density kim et al 1988 setoguchi et al 1993 the impulse turbine has a wider operational range and is less sensitive to variations in the flow coefficient it has a better self starting capability because of its mechanical nature the main disadvantage of the impulse turbine is the aerodynamic loss when the flow is guided to enter the downstream guide vanes at a large incidence angle thakker et al 2008 to improve the performance of these turbines some configurations of rotor blades and guide vanes have been proposed a number of reviews summarized the state of art of turbines and compared their overall performance under steady flow and irregular wave conditions setoguchi and takao 2006 takao and setoguchi 2012 falcão et al 2018 the configurations include the wells turbine with fixed guide vanes wtgv wells turbine with self pitch controlled blades tscb biplane wells turbine with fixed guide vanes bwgv impulse turbine with self pitch controlled guide vanes isgv and impulse turbine with fixed guide vanes ifgv comparisons of the mean efficiency and self starting characteristics under irregular wave conditions are shown in fig 4 compared to the wells turbine the impulse turbine can obtain a higher efficiency for larger flow coefficients without stall and self start in a shorter period the peak value of mean efficiency for isgv is obtained as 0 47 which is larger than that for other configurations the guide vanes of isgv are capable of rotating about the pivots and are self adaptive to the oscillation of airflow the upstream guide vanes work as an array of nozzles the generated aerodynamic torques on the downstream guide vanes subsequently make them rotate to the diffuser position via link control setoguchi et al 1996 an isgv was manufactured and commissioned in a prototype owc at vizhinjam india in 1997 santhakumar et al 1998 takao et al 2000a on the other hand the peak mean efficiency of tscb is 15 higher than that of wtgv the rotor blades of tscb can pitch about a pivot in the range limit of two preset angles according to the variation in the flow direction the pitching is driven by the moment m generated at various angles of incidence model tests were conducted to study the effects of the basic design parameters on the turbine performance such as the setting angle solidity and aspect ratio inoue et al 1989 setoguchi et al 1997 all experiments were performed for various fixed staggered blades instead of self pitching blades under unidirectional steady flow conditions this substitution ignores the transient effects of the position variations of rotor blades table 2 limits the turbines discussed in this review furthermore table 1 also introduces the turbines installed in prototype owc plants since the 1990s the wells turbine was widely used in full scale plants in the early 1990s recently the impulse turbine especially appeared in the asian owc

plants or test prototypes heath 2012 the techniques of phase control falcão and henriques 2016 and the strategies for electrical control delmonte et al 2016 takao and setoguchi 2012 and setoguchi et al 2001 concluded a series of experimental results for wells and impulse turbines shehata et al 2016b was concerned with the research directions methodologies some numerical models of the wells turbine which aimed at enhancing its performance and efficiency with the rapid development of personal and parallel computers the computational fluid dynamics cfd has been widely applied for performance evaluation and optimization of turbines since the 2000s according to our limited literature review there has not been a comprehensive review focusing on cfd models and achievements on both two types of turbines compared to the previous reviews this study places emphasis on cfd methodologies related technological difficulties performance achievements and future trends in modeling and analyzing axial flow self rectifying air turbines for owc application in section 2 cfd models with various aspects are described and summarized the operating principles and numerical achievements for performance enhancement for wells and impulse turbines are reported in section 3 and 4 respectively in section 5 the discussion on present cfd studies and future trends are presented conclusions can be found in section 6 2 cfd models benefiting from improvements in fundamental theories numerical modeling and methods more powerful computing capability and more precise experimental measurements cfd is becoming an essential desktop tool in the design and optimization of turbo machines because of fruitful modules and functions integrated in the models the cfd studies can aid to improve the understanding of complicated flow phenomena in steady or unsteady states conveniently the turbine geometry can be improved without any expensive manufacturing and laboratory testing by numerical simulations with an engineering judgment for the owc turbine application shown in fig 5 the increase in paper number with a large proportion of approximately 59 within the last 5 years indicates that the cfd methodology plays a critical role in the design and optimization of air turbines detailed information about the cfd models for the wells and impulse turbines is summarized in tables 3 and 4 respectively 2 1 governing equations the governing equations in most cfd models are the continuity equation and the navier stokes n s equations even though the local velocity of airflow over the blade tip can be up to 100 m s in some circumstance the mach number m a in the applications of the turbine was found less than 0 4 and the air can be considered incompressible starzmann and carolus 2013 on the other hand the air density inside the chamber is time varying according to certain pressure density relationship theoretical analysis and experimental tests on this spring like effect such as the aero thermodynamic characteristics of the air chamber were conducted sarmento and falcão 1985 even so the incompressible solver for cfd models was considered in most studies and the chamber turbine interaction for spring like effects was neglected in the numerical simulations for turbines only in order to reduce the computational costs and maintain the precision of the n s equations the time averaged concept was first proposed by osborne reynolds 1995 each instantaneous quantity in turbulent motion can be decomposed into time averaged and fluctuating components as a result the governing equations in cartesian coordinates can be written as follows kim et al 2002b thakker and dhanasekaran 2003 ansys inc 2011 continuity equation 12 ρ t x i ρ u i x j ρ u j x k ρ u k 0 reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations 13 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j u j x i x j ρ u i u j 14 t ρ u j x k ρ u j u k p x j x k μ u j x k u k x j 2 3 δ j k u k x j x k ρ u j u k 15 t ρ u k x i ρ u k u i p x k x i μ u k x i u i x k 2 3 δ k i u i x k x i ρ u k u i where ρ is the air density p represents the pressure δ ij is the kronecker delta and u i u j and u k are the mean velocities in the x i x j and x k directions the last term ρ u i u j x j referred to the reynolds stresses represents the effects of turbulence 2 2 turbulence model to model the turbulence term in eqns 13 15 and close the rans equations the boussinesq approach was first applied to associate the reynolds stresses with the mean velocity gradients by introducing the concept of eddy viscosity the relationship is incorporated as follows hinze 1975 16 ρ u i u j μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 ρ k μ t u k x k δ i j where k represents the turbulence kinetic energy and μ t is the turbulent viscosity based on the assumption the spalart allmaras s a model k ε model and k ω model were proposed to compute the turbulent viscosity μ t as listed in tables 3 and 4 these turbulent models are predominantly used in the cfd models of owc turbines because of the complexity of airflows over the turbine system it is difficult to reach a simple conclusion as to best turbulence model in fact it is too absolute to determine the optimal turbulence model depending only on the length scales and flow conditions massive calculations should be conducted together with the geometry modification and mesh optimization for the turbulence model selection as shown in fig 6 numerical predictions of the steady state performance in terms of dimensionless torque t 0 and turbine efficiency η with different turbulent models for the wells turbine are compared with corresponding data from experiments conducted by curran and gato 1997 three typical turbulence models including the shear stress transport sst k ω and s a models by torresi et al 2004 2008 the realizable k ε model by shaaban and hafiz 2012 and the sst k ω model by halder et al 2015 are employed although the s a model predicts the torque coefficient and turbine efficiency with a better accuracy in magnitude it fails in the prediction of the stall point it indicates that the s a model has limited accommodation capability for rapid changes in the length scale such as the sudden changes in airflow from the wall boundary to free shear regions this may be caused by the use of only one transport equation for kinematic eddy viscosity in this model spalart and allmaras 1992 the k ε model employs two separate transport equations to deal with the turbulent velocity and length scales the standard k ε model proposed by launder and spalding 1972 is a semi empirical model with two equations for the turbulent kinetic energy k and its dissipation rate ε its limitation is that the value of ε is usually derived from physical experience to overcome the limits of empiricism two alternative refined models are proposed the renormalization group rng k ε model and the realizable k ε model the rng k ε model accounts of the effects of swirl and low reynolds numbers and employs an analytical formula of turbulent prandtl numbers yakhot and orszag 1986 choudhury 1993 which is capable of analyzing a wider range of turbulent flows than the standard k ε model on the other hand the realizable k ε model makes an improvement with new transport equations for the turbulent viscosity and dissipation rate shih et al 1995 it satisfies certain mathematical constraints in the reynolds stresses and is substantially consistent with the inherent mechanism of turbulent flows hence the realizable k ε model can accurately predict the stall phenomena and turbine performance before stalling as shown in fig 6 in addition the standard k ω model is only applicable for both wall bounded turbulence and free shear flows wilcox 1998 the sst k ω model uses a blending function to combine the standard k ω model in the near wall region with the transformed k ε model in the far field region menter 1994 this modification broadens the applicability of the k ω model with higher accuracy as illustrated in fig 6 the sst k ω model by halder et al 2015 demonstrates numerical results that agree well with experimental data over the entire range of flow coefficients 2 3 flow reference frame and boundary conditions because of the limited computational capability in the early stage the single rotating reference frame srf approach was initially applied in the numerical models for the wells turbine without guide vanes in an efficient steady calculation watterson and raghunathan 1998 kim et al 2002a the entire computational domain is defined with respect to the moving reference frame if the rotational speed is constant the equations for fluid motion can be transformed to the moving frame consequently the steady state prediction can be conducted under this quasi steady assumption torresi et al 2008 if the guide vanes are employed for the wells turbine the entire computational domain should be divided into multiple moving parts within separate interfaces the moving zones are solved using the moving reference frame equations whereas stationary zones are solved using the stationary reference frame equations ansys inc 2011 in general the number of guide vanes in the upstream and downstream is usually different from the rotor blades this means the continuity of flow passages in the entire computational domain cannot be satisfied which will result in an imprecise or even unrealistic prediction the mixing plane mp model was introduced to solve this problem govardhan and chauhan 2007 cui and hyun 2016 during the computation the area averaged fluxes are computed at the mps which will be considered boundary conditions spatially mixed at the interfaces as the solution converges the mixing plane boundary conditions would adjust to the prevailing flow conditions liu et al 2016a although there are a few studies using the multiple reference frame mrf model hyun et al 2004 2006 the mp model has been popularly applied in steady studies for the impulse turbine with fixed guide vanes thakker et al 2004 badhurshah and samad 2015a generally the mp approach provides a physically meaningful time averaged solution which is more cost effective in terms of computational time than unsteady calculations however it should be noted that the multiple rotating reference frame approach based on the steady state approximations does not consider the relative motion between adjacent zones this means that the moving zone is fixed in a specific position where the instantaneous flow field is calculated the sliding mesh sm model was employed further to attain a time accurate solution for rotor stator interaction thakker et al 2001 pereiras et al 2014 in this model the stationary and rotational sub domains are connected to each other through non conformal interfaces the mesh motions are prescribed so that the sub domains linked at the interfaces remain in contact with each other sliding along the interface boundaries to ensure an accurate exchange of the entire flux at the interfaces and a faster computational convergence liu et al 2011 and 2016c the typical computational domain and boundary conditions for the wells turbine and impulse turbine in steady calculations are shown in fig 7 the entire computational domain is divided into three parts the upstream guide vane domain rotor blade domain and downstream guide vane domain the upstream and downstream domains are extended to a certain distance away from the rotor blade to guarantee the full development of turbulent flow the detailed extending distances in different models are listed in tables 3 and 4 the guide vane domains are stationary whereas the rotor blade domain is set to rotate at a prescribed speed the velocity inlet boundary conditions are usually applied at the entrance of the upstream guide vane domain the velocity magnitude velocity direction turbulence intensity and hydraulic diameter can be specified for the inlet boundary at the exit of the downstream guide vane domain the pressure outlet boundary condition is specified as the static pressure with a radial equilibrium distribution and backflow conditions in addition the surfaces of the blade hub and duct are usually defined as non slip wall boundary conditions to avoid the enormous calculations caused by modeling all blades and guide vanes rotational periodic boundaries are defined at each side of the rotor and guide vane regions the calculations are restricted to one row of blade and guide vane passages two mixing planes are required in the application of mp model to connect the three sub domains 2 4 reynolds number in an owc air turbine system the reynolds number re is defined as follows liu et al 2017 17 r e ρ w l r μ ρ v a 2 u r 2 l r μ where w and μ are the relative inflow velocity at the peak efficiency point and the air viscosity respectively usually the turbulent flow around the rotor blades is regarded with full development for owc turbines because the wells turbine has a higher rotating velocity than the impulse turbine during operation the reynolds number of the wells turbine is always in the order of 105 whereas it is 104 for the impulse turbine the effects of the reynolds number on turbine performance have been studied experimentally and numerically as shown in fig 8 a setoguchi et al 2004 presented experimental results that indicated that impulse turbine efficiency under steady conditions can be improved with an increase in re this is because a higher re can help increase c t and decrease c a slightly the latest steady state tests by liu et al 2017 found that the critical value of re is approximately 5 60 104 for an impulse turbine for hub diameter d h 210 mm hyun et al 2006 established a 3 d numerical model of the impulse turbine for d h 266 mm with all the guide vanes and rotor blades employed it was reported that the turbine efficiency can be increased by 7 with a larger reynolds number re 2 5 106 for the wells turbine without guide vanes inoue et al 1986b reported that a larger reynolds number of re 2 5 105 can make the stall point move from ϕ 0 38 to ϕ 0 46 and increase the peak efficiency by 43 as shown in fig 8 b 2 5 wall function and y in the owc air turbine system the airflow passing through rotor blades is always turbulent with a high reynolds number the wall function which uses semi empirical formulas instead of the grid computing of the near wall region has been predominately applied for near wall treatments in most cfd models y which defines the distance of a wall adjacent cell away from the nearest wall is a non dimensional parameter that determines the density of grids near the surface of the wall for the wells turbine the standard and non equilibrium wall functions were employed in the numerical studies by cui and hyun 2016 shaaban and hafiz 2012 and shaaban 2012 the standard wall function is used as a default option in some commercial cfd software for the k ε turbulence model the non equilibrium wall function was considered more suitable to the flow separation around the blade surface čarija et al 2012 in terms of the mesh in the near wall region the value of y was suggested to be approximately 30 furthermore torresi et al 2004 2009 employed the enhanced wall treatment and refined the meshes sufficiently for resolving the viscous sub layer where the value of y value is in the order of 1 consequently the turbulence equations are solved to the walls and no near wall modeling is required at first thakker et al 2001 and thakker and hemry 2004 applied the standard wall function to model the near wall region of the impulse turbine the non equilibrium wall function gradually replaced the standard function because of its capability to deal with complex airflows involving separations reattachment and other non equilibrium effects and severe pressure gradients thakker and dhanasekaran 2003 accordingly the values of y at the blade and guide vane range from approximately 25 to 45 thakker and hourigan 2005a and 2005b in addition the enhanced wall function was used for y values smaller than 6 during modeling a unidirectional axial impulse turbine pereiras et al 2014 detailed information of y and near wall treatment are listed in table 3 and table 4 2 6 cfd software the cfd software provides a general purpose code package to solve the governing equations coupled with different turbulent models boundary conditions and initial conditions it is quite convenient for users to operate the software by merely entering the necessary parameters through the graphic user interface gui with the geometry and grid files with the rapid development of the computational capability of the personal computer the commercial cfd software plays a dominant role in the desktop analysis of turbo machines because of its powerful functions on geometry modeling and flow field simulation which are also employed in the application of owc turbines unlike cfd software such as the numeca fine turbo and turbodesign specifically used for generic turbo machines the general purpose cfd platform ansys fluent and ansys cfx were predominantly employed to analyze the owc turbines halder et al 2015 and badhurshah and samad 2015a and 2015b conducted numerical analysis of wells and impulse turbines using ansys cfx and compared their results with those derived using ansys fluent it can be found that the two types of cfd software show few significant differences in terms of accuracy of the numerical prediction ansys fluent has some advantages such as friendlier gui lower memory consumption substantial turbulence models and discretization schemes and more flexible user defined functions udfs more than 80 of the numerical simulations of owc turbines were reported using ansys fluent 3 wells turbine 3 1 operation principle the schematic of forces acting on the blade of the wells turbine without guide vanes is illustrated in fig 9 the rotor blade moves at a certain linear velocity u r in an axial flow with the velocity of v a in the relative frame where the rotor is assumed stationary the rotor motion can be equated with a tangential flow with the velocity of r u the relative velocity w of the incident flow inclines toward the chord line of the rotor blade within an angle which is called the angle of attack α and is defined as α tan 1 v a u r tan 1 ϕ according to the airfoil theory the rotor blade experiences two kinds of forces the lift force l normal to the direction of relative velocity w and the drag force d in the direction of w these forces could be resolved into the tangential component f t and the axial component f a respectively evidently the direction of the tangential force f t remains the same regardless of the direction of incident flow therefore the wells turbine can rotate in one direction even under the reciprocating airflow conditions in addition the stalling and self starting characteristics of the wells turbine can be explained from the perspective of the angle of attack the variation in the tangential force coefficient c θ defined as c θ f t 1 2ρw 2 l r against α is shown in fig 10 a four notable regimes can be observed in the regime ⅰ the value of c θ is negative where all the pneumatic power input is dissipated as heat c θ increases with the increase of α in regime ⅱ which is regarded as the operation case a sudden decrease of c θ can be observed which is caused by the flow separation from the blade surface due to an increased angle of attack this incidence angle is regarded as the stalling point where the value of f t has a significant drop c θ remains negative in regime ⅲ which affects the self starting performance as the turbine starts from rest the value of α gradually decreases from 90 if the turbine cannot pass through regime ⅲ it will enter the crawling state and fail to accelerate to the normal operating rotation speed as plotted by the dotted line in fig 10 b in fig 10 c raghunathan 1995 presented a suitable combination of rotor solidity σ t and hub to tip ratio ν for successful self starting 3 2 numerical achievements the cfd models should be verified before any detailed numerical investigations are conducted the turbulence model grid independence time step et al need to be validated carefully experiments can preliminarily reveal the effects of flow conditions and geometry parameters on the operating performance of air turbines and provide validation cases for cfd models the original numerical studies mainly focused on applying the numerical simulation to explore the physical mechanism of the wells turbine without guide vanes including the flow pattern around rotor blades the stalling phenomenon and the hysteretic characteristics after the establishment of the model and original explorations the research focus switched to the optimization of the turbine geometry such as the guide vane tip clearance hub to tip ratio and blade sweep table 3 summarizes the detailed information of the cfd models for the wells turbine 3 2 1 mechanism exploration watterson and raghunathan 1996 led the development of a cfd code to investigate the aerodynamics of the wells turbine as shown in fig 11 the cfd code solved the 3d rans equations based on the finite volume method jameson and baker 1987 an unstructured mesh method called newt dawes 1992 and the k ε turbulent model modified by lam and bremhorst 1981 the numerical contours of the relative mach number and velocity vectors indicated that the stalling is caused by the tip clearance vortex and its spread from tip to hub however the pioneering model conducted the simulations for only four flow coefficients with the triangular meshes illustrated in fig 11 a it failed to exactly predict the stalling point as shown in fig 11 b hence optimizations of the mesh type and structure and improvements in the turbulence model are required to enhance the accuracy of the numerical model in predicting turbine aerodynamics a clear and detailed description of 3d flows around the wells turbine was presented by suzuki and arakawa 2001 2006 numerical predictions of flow patterns and velocity vectors around the blade illustrated a strong counterclockwise vortex on the suction surface under the stall condition because of the flow separation in the forward area of the chord the commercial software fluent was first reported in the numerical study of a wells turbine without guide vanes kim et al 2002c the unsteady hysteretic characteristics were analyzed under a reciprocating flow condition the wells turbine has a hysteretic loop where the values of c t and c a in the accelerating flow are smaller than those in the decelerating flow as shown in fig 12 based on the vortex theorems the hysteretic behavior is closely associated with the intensity of the vortical flow occurring on the suction side of the blade kim et al 2002a the tip clearance rotor solidity and setting angle of rotor blade have significant effects on its hysteretic performance setoguchi et al 2003a the numerical results of the biplane wells turbine were reported by mamun et al 2004 and kinoue et al 2004 as shown in fig 13 a spiral type separation on the suction surface of the upstream blade enclosed in a red ellipse is evident in the decelerating flow than in the accelerating flow when the attack of angle is 14 meanwhile the biplane turbine with staggered blades could eliminate the clockwise hysteretic loops of c a for the turbine without stagger 3 2 2 geometry optimization based on the established model watterson and raghunathan 1998 investigated the effects of rotor solidity it was found that increasing the solidity can make the stalling point migrate to the larger flow coefficient region because the blade to blade interaction is strengthened in the hub region kim et al 2002c reported a good agreement between numerical results and experimental data especially on the maximum efficiency and the stalling point fig 14 presents the numerical results of the effects of the blade sweep under steady conditions as illustrated in fig 14 b a blade sweep ratio of s b 0 35 is optimal for a wells turbine with the profile of naca0020 govardhan and dhanasekaran 2001 created different 3d models with variable chord varc rotors and circular arc guide vanes for numerical investigations which have a better performance than the original turbine to obtain a higher peak efficiency and a wider operating range of flow coefficients the variable thickness blade vtb can reduce the interaction between the tip leakage vortex and suction surface of the blade nazeryan and lakzian 2018 at most a 63 37 increase in c t and 72 8 increase in η are achieved by the vtb in the deep stall condition torresi et al 2004 2008 conducted 3d numerical simulations on the wells turbines with low and high solidities respectively the investigation of tip clearance was demonstrated to be necessary to improve the reliability of predicting the hysteretic performance of wells turbine a smaller gap results in the occurrence of flow separation near the tip for lower flow coefficients whereas a larger gap causes a degradation of the performance due to a decrease in the pressure drop over the turbine numerical results obtained by taha et al 2010 2011 yielded similar conclusions on the effects of tip clearance shaaban and hafiz 2012 employed the form of venturi tube for the turbine duct and studied the effects of duct area ratio ar and duct angle on the turbine efficiency and stall point the turbine performance was predicted to improve by 9 in turbine efficiency and a substantial migration of the stalling point was predicted for ar 1 5 with a duct angle of 7 in addition the performance of the biplane wells turbine was studied in terms of the interaction between upstream and downstream rotors and their respective contributions to the turbine performance shaaban 2012 it was revealed that a high reynolds number and a swiveling angle of the blades can contribute to the better performance of a double stage wells turbine dorrell and hsieh 2008 according to the gouy stodola theorem bejan 1996 the difference between reversible and actual works in any thermodynamic system is the entropy generation shehata et al 2014 employed 2d numerical models with different airfoils to evaluate the entropy generation due to viscous dissipation the effects of the reynolds number and angle of attack on entropy generation are evident the turbine with naca0015 blades provides a smaller value of total entropy generation furthermore the global entropy generation rates of the wells turbine with different airfoils were assessed numerically under sinusoidal flow conditions shehata et al 2016a the second law efficiency of the turbine with naca0015 airfoil is 1 5 higher than other airfoils the application of passive flow control can help to increase the torque coefficient by more than 40 within the stalling regime shehata et al 2017 mahboubidoust and ramiar 2017 employed the similar methodology and found the dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator can increase the torque coefficient by 39 4 and decrease the lift coefficient by 30 5 averagely moreover the blade skew was designed and studied numerically to improve the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance of wells turbine starzmann and carolus 2013 the optimal backward forward blade skew can make the stalling point migrate to the larger flow coefficient region and widen the range of operation by 5 in terms of static pressure head hashem et al 2018 proposed to submerge the wells turbine in the sea water as the operating medium and found the airfoil of s146 can increase the values of c t and η by 1 4 and 1 8 times at ϕ 0 3 respectively the concept of a groove as a rotor tip treatment was applied to migrate the stalling point and enhance the turbine efficiency halder et al 2015 halder and samad 2015 which is somewhat similar to the concept of simple penetration proposed by hyun et al 2005 the schematic diagram of the groove is described in fig 15 a the basic idea is to render the tip clearance virtually zero the effects of groove depth and tip clearance on the turbine performance were studied under steady conditions it can be observed in fig 15 b that the groove influences the tip leakage flow and creates a smaller vortex near the downstream groove corner which is capable of migrating the stalling point another optimization of turbine geometry is to change the blade thickness from hub to tip by mixing the naca0015 and naca0024 profiles a smaller thickness at mid cross section is better at increasing the power output and restraining the flow separation halder and samad 2015 in addition the blade sweep angles at the tip and mid cross sections can be optimized to restrain the flow separation and increase the relative power output by 29 halder et al 2017a and 2017b 4 impulse turbine 4 1 operation principle the structure of velocity vectors over the guide vanes and rotor blades of an impulse turbine is shown in fig 16 the upstream guide vanes operate as stationary nozzles to guide and accelerate the incident flow into the rotor with a pre whirl angle α 2 resulting in a velocity increase and pressure drop as the airflow enter the rotor the airflow is then guided by rotor blades and enters the downstream guide vanes at a relative velocity w 3 generally the composition of aerodynamic losses for the impulse turbine is quite complicated among them the mechanical loss can be reduced by improving the level of manufacturing technology thakker et al 2005a the profile and secondary flow losses are of substantial significance which can be reduced by optimizing the geometries of rotor blades and guide vanes gomes et al 2012a for instance the incidence angle i defined as the angle between the direction of w2 and the blade inlet angle α r is a substantially important parameter to minimize the blade profile loss for the blade passage cho and choi 2004 furthermore the tip clearance is another parameter that has a significant effect on the turbine performance this is because the leakage flow emerging at the blade tip will interact with the passage flow to generate the tip leakage vortex thakker and dhanasekaran 2003 fig 17 shows a comparison of the rotating velocity variation between the impulse turbine and wells turbine under sinusoidal flow during self starting setoguchi et al 2001 the impulse turbine can start in a shorter period than the wells turbine which experiences a considerably difficult process and requires approximately a six fold starting period the rotational speed of the impulse turbine at the stable stage is approximately one third of the wells turbine from this view it can be expected to design an impulse turbine for owc plants which can effectively self start especially in a low density wave climate the impulse turbine with different setting angles of guide vanes are also compared in fig 17 for the impulse turbine the acceleration value for a smaller setting angle is larger than the large one 4 2 validation of cfd models a series of experimental tests of the impulse turbine were conducted at saga university japan which provided fruitful validated data for the numerical analysis maeda et al 1999 setoguchi et al 2001 both steady for a short time and oscillating airflow can be produced by controlling the motion of the piston many cfd studies referred to the above experimental data such as hyun et al 2004 2005 badhurshah and samad 2015a and 2015b cui and hyun 2016 and liu et al 2016a the research team from the university of limerick also conducted experimental studies on the impulse turbine curran and gato 1997 thakker and hourigan 2004 because the wind generation equipment was unidirectional only the upper halves of sinusoidal or irregular flows were generated for the tests of turbine performance thakker et al 2005a these experimental data were also popular for the validation of cfd models thakker et al 2004 2005b thakker and hourigan 2005a 4 3 numerical achievements numerical studies on the impulse turbine started later than those on the wells turbine some valuable experiences were borrowed from previous works on the wells turbine with respect to establishing the model and optimizing the design as mentioned in section 4 1 the operational mechanism of the impulse turbine is simpler than that of the wells turbine consequently cfd models of the impulse turbine are easier in terms of mesh generation and model validation the major objective of numerical simulations focuses on the optimization of turbine geometry detailed information of the cfd models for impulse turbine is listed in table 4 4 3 1 2d and 3d models thakker et al 2001 realized the first application of cfd analysis in the study of impulse turbines with fixed guide vanes the 2d cfd results were compared with experimental data which show similar trends in the same order of magnitude however the numerical results overestimated the performance of impulse turbine by approximately 14 due to the ignorance of the 3d characteristics of airflow and the effects of tip gap loss the 3d models were expected to overcome the above shortcomings the comparison of mesh structures for 2d and 3d models is shown in fig 18 subsequently the cfd works began to focus on the validation of 3d models with experimental data for the same turbine thakker et al 2004 thakker and hourigan 2005a 3d models with various tip clearances were established for exploring the mechanics of tip leakage flow based on abundant validations with experimental data thakker and dhanasekaran 2003 it was demonstrated that the performance of the impulse turbine is quite sensitive to the tip clearance furthermore visual contours of velocity and pressure provide valuable information to reveal the physics of fluid behavior in the impulse turbine which is technically difficult to traditional experiments two schemes of meshes were compared where the tip clearance was not modeled thakker and hourigan 2005b structured grids agreed better with experimental results thakker and dhanasekaran 2005 summarized their experimental and computational results and reported that the downstream guide vanes were responsible for the low efficiency of the turbine because of flow separation and loss of average pressure thakker and his team paved the path for the establishment of 2d and 3d models using the commercial cfd software fluent the parametric optimization and analysis of fluid behaviors were preliminarily conducted which provided sufficient supports for subsequent studies on the impulse turbine hyun et al 2004 also compared the accuracy and effectiveness of 2d and 3d models on basis of neglecting the effect of reynolds number and assuming an identical value for both guide vanes and rotor blades it was shown that the 2d model can qualitatively predict the turbine performance and has advantages over the 3d model of simpler and faster calculations in addition some optimal parameters were found such as a tip clearance of 0 5 mm and the setting angle of guide vane of 30 most former studies generally assumed the airflow to be quasi steady and applied the quasi steady method to the unsteady problems in order to the steady state coefficients this method has been validated by inoue et al 1986a however the quasi steady assumption has inherent shortcomings as it neglects the variation in the reynolds number and other complicated aerodynamics especially during the self starting process a fully transient simulation based on newtonian mechanics can be expected to reveal the detailed unsteady characteristics of air turbines liu et al 2011 first established a 3d transient numerical model to predict the self starting and stoppage performance of the impulse turbine under some unsteady flow conditions 4 3 2 performance improvement hyun et al 2005 proposed the design of a penetrating end plate installed vertically on the blade tip to minimize the adverse effects of tip clearance as shown in fig 19 a the 3d model was established using the relative moving reference frame and the standard k ε turbulence model as illustrated in fig 19 b the existence of the penetrating end plate results in an obvious decrease in the input coefficient c a furthermore the effects of the reynolds number on the turbine performance were predicted using a 3d model with all guide vanes and rotor blades involved as presented in fig 19 c the turbine efficiency increases up by 7 with the increase of re hyun et al 2006 liu et al 2013 conducted a series of 3d steady state simulations to provide guidance for the impulse turbine utilization in the 500 kw yongsoo owc plant on jeju island south korea as shown in fig 20 the flow path lines on rotor blades clearly demonstrated that a larger tip clearance would result in tip leakage flow marked by the red ellipse and vortex rollup marked by the green ellipse moreover a tip clearance of 3 mm was recommended to obtain better turbine efficiency liu et al 2013 subsequently liu and his team conducted a series of parametric studies with the aim of optimizing the geometry of impulse turbine and improving the energy conversion efficiency the numerical results recommended the rotor solidity defined as s r l r of 0 49 liu et al 2015 the solidity ratio defined as g n z of 0 63 cui and liu 2014 and the stagger angle of the rotor blades the rotor blade rotates a certain degree about the midpoint of blade section of 5 within the corresponding guide vane configurations cui et al 2015 shows better performance for improving the turbine efficiency pereiras et al 2014 numerically analyzed the flow field of a twin turbine configuration proposed by jayashankar et al 2009 both turbines operate throughout the cycle both exhalation and inhalation processes and only one operates in direct mode power output while the other operates in reverse mode backflow preventer the turbines alternate their roles following the direction change of the reciprocating airflow the numerical results showed that the major source of incidence losses occurs in the rotor for the direct mode and in the row of guide vanes for the reverse mode increasing the blockage by changing the solidity of the rotor and guide vanes might improve the efficiency of the whole system tog and tousi 2014 optimized the nozzle parameter to improve the axial gap flow pattern on basis of a genetic algorithm a 3d numerical study was conducted to obtain conclusive results using both transient and steady state calculations an improvement in turbine efficiency by 2 5 was finally obtained with a reduction in the total pressure losses and a decrease in the sensitivity of the nozzle to the expansion rate badhurshah and samad 2015a and badhurshah et al 2018 coupled the cfd analysis with multiple surrogate models for the optimization of both turbine design and flow parameters the coupled optimized design can enhance the turbine efficiency by 16 compared to the original design 5 discussions and perspectives 5 1 steady models and quasi steady method it can be concluded that the cfd simulations have been fully developed for predicting the steady performance of wells and impulse turbines with satisfactory accuracy different for experiments and analytical method the cfd analysis is capable of not only revealing the details of flow and pressure field distributions but also reducing the researching expenses and increasing the variety of objectives the steady state investigation plays a key role for understanding the fundamental characteristics of the turbine especially during preliminary study and geometry optimization which saves expenses and time for steady state cfd studies the general purpose commercial software can be used in the numerical simulations of owc turbines the sst k ω model is recommended to deal with the turbulence effects especially at near wall regions over rotor blades and guide vanes the mp model should be employed for the stator guide vanes and rotor blades interactions because the wells turbine is lift type the order of magnitude has better to be 106 for the number of structured hexahedral meshes with d d 300 mm the order of magnitude for y is recommended to be 1 with the enhanced wall treatment on the other hand the number of cooper tetrahedral meshes is usually at the order of 105 for the impulse turbine with d d 300 mm the number of y can be controlled at approximately 30 with application of the standard wall functions the periodic boundary condition allows only one row of the blade and guide vanes employed in steady calculations the length of extended upstream downstream computation domains is recommended not less than four times the chord length since the interaction between two energy conversion stages of an owc system is complicated and the variations in the free surface elevation air pressure in the chamber and air flow velocity are affected mutually reciprocating airflows over the turbine should be considered transient viscous and unsteady since the cost is still huge especially for limited computation resources during the preliminary desktop design stage the quasi steady method is usually employed as a compromise solution which can predict some unsteady behaviors of the turbine with much less computation cost during quasi steady analysis the airflow at each instant is considered quasi steady and the unsteady parameters can be calculated based on the steady coefficients cui et al 2015 hu and li 2018 the basic assumption of quasi steady analysis is that the incident wave frequency is much smaller than the blade passing frequency of the turbine under normal operating conditions where the interaction between the chamber and turbine can be ignored gato et al 1996 hyun et al 2006 in addition if the reduced frequency of the turbine defined as k f w l r v2 a u2 r 1 2 is usually of the order 10 4 the amplitude attenuation and phase lag can be ignored and the airflow is regarded as quasi steady setoguchi et al 1998 several attempts have been made to predict the unsteady performance of air turbines the quasi steady analysis was generally applied to predict the mean efficiency versus the flow coefficient and the rotating speed of rotor blades versus time setoguchi et al 1996 kim et al 2002d takao et al 2000b setoguchi et al 2003b and 2003c however the limitations are evident because the assumption of quasi steady airflow neglects the interaction between waves and turbines as well as the variation in the reynolds number during the self starting process therefore the transient cfd models should be developed for the direct simulations of unsteady turbine behaviors in addition the chamber turbine coupled models also should be considered to reflect the unsteady interactions between the energy conversion stages 5 2 development of transient cfd simulations with the rapid improvement of cfd technology it has become possible to simulate the transient behaviors of air turbines under reciprocating flow conditions such as the fully unsteady start and operation processes a 3d numerical model was created as a preliminary attempt of transient simulation in both constant and sinusoidal flows liu et al 2018 cui et al 2019 fig 21 presents the model setup and flow field demonstration of the 3d transient model as shown in fig 21 a the computational domains and meshes are generated in the software gambit with tet hybird tgrid meshes near the rotor blades and hex wedge cooper meshes in other regions the total cell number is approximately 1 7 106 the sliding mesh model and user define function udf are employed for the flow driven motion of the rotor unlike traditional calculations of forced rotations with a constant angular velocity the turbine in the present model is entirely driven by the airflows and rotates passively which is governed by newton s second law of motion the rotating velocity of the rotor and the inlet velocity of the airflow are both updated in real time more details of this fully flow driven model were described by liu et al 2018 transient calculations under sinusoidal flow conditions demonstrate different fluid structure interactions as illustrated in fig 21 b with the guidance of upstream guide vanes the airflow enters the rotor region and achieves a velocity up to 40 m s evident separation can be observed from the downstream guide vanes which might cause significant aerodynamic loss the airflow then moves in spiral to the exit of flow passage effects of air flow velocity amplitude and rotor s moment of inertia on the flow field and pressure distribution on the blades pneumatic torque and rotation speed and the transient input and torque coefficients were also studied it can be seen in fig 22 that a smaller moment of inertia results in rapid acceleration of the rotor a larger magnitude of oscillation and a higher rotating speed in the stable stage in the future the friction electricity generator loadings and air compressibility would be considered in accordance with the real physics incident airflows with irregular and random characteristics under real sea conditions should be considered for the calculations this would offer more valuable information to the designers and engineers of owc prototype facilities 5 3 establishment of chamber turbine model it is known that the overall efficiency of an owc plant depends on the combination of the primary conversion stage of air chamber and the secondary conversion stage of air turbines the above literature review indicates that numerous studies have been conducted to study the aerodynamic characteristics of air turbines similarly abundant studies have been conducted for the air chamber for instance experiments were conducted to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of a pile supported chamber structure he and huang 2014 nagata et al 2011 proposed a 2d theoretical method to specify the energy equations and motion equations and estimate the primary efficiency of a floating air chamber conde et al 2011 bouali and larbi 2013 and luo et al 2014 validated the reliability and accuracy of numerical simulations with corresponding experimental data in predicting the interaction between the waves and the chamber the majority of the reports studied the chamber and air turbine separately despite the fact that the chamber turbine coupling plays an important role in an owc system the initial attempt to theoretically study the combination of chamber and air turbines was based on an assumption that the turbine has a simplified relationship either linear or square between the pressure difference across the turbine and the relative flow rate falcão et al 2012 2014 gomes et al 2012b luo et al 2014 lópez and iglesias 2014 used a slot with various widths to produce different turbine damping and evaluated the pneumatic efficiency of a given owc murakami et al 2016 performed 2d wave tank tests in regular waves for a fixed owc plant with an impulse turbine the effects of chamber turbine coupling were included during evaluation of the primary and secondary conversion efficiencies lópez et al 2014 and liu et al 2016b created the 2d and 3d rans vof models using orifice plates instead of air turbine to study the optimum turbine chamber coupling the simplified assumption of turbine damping showed that the interaction between air chamber and turbines was still a one way simulation with the development of cfd technology and computer capacity it has become possible to realize a transient two way simulation of the overall owc system in the near future in addition future studies might focus on the synthesis of existing achievements and tentatively establish a system for designing a suitable air turbine according to different design conditions in european or asian oceans one such example in point is the design theory of marine propellers carlton 2007 the owc system requires the combined effects of key parameters such as the turbine diameter hub to tip ratio rotor profile blade numbers and rotating speed numerical simulations can help to establish a valuable turbine design database 6 conclusions with the development of renewable marine energy the owc wave energy converter has become one of the most popular technologies worldwide as a critical part of the owc system the axial flow self rectifying air turbines proposed in the mid 1970s have been well studied via model tests theoretical derivation and cfd simulations this review focuses on the cfd achievements for the wells and impulse turbines the operating principles and technological difficulties are presented in details in addition the cfd models for both turbines are listed in order of chronology and groups the following remarks could be concluded from the review the cfd method has advantages in describing the fundamental features of the flow field reducing the expenses and enriching the objectives although experimental validations are of significant importance and necessity cfd is popularly regarded as a reliable effective tool for exploring the mechanism of wells and impulse turbines and optimizing their geometries for wells and impulse turbines the accuracy of numerical models depends on the turbulence model flow reference frame reynolds number and the near wall treatment in addition the model of the wells turbine requires a better mesh quality than the impulse turbine this is embodied in the grid density near the rotor blades and the control of y numerical works on the wells turbine starting from the 1990s focused on the exploration of the physical mechanism and optimization of turbine geometries the prediction of stalling phenomena has been difficult additionally the numerical simulations of impulse turbine beginning in the 2000s gradually became reliable in improving the turbine performance in the near future it will be possible to realize a transformation from the quasi steady analysis to the transient simulation and investigate the unsteady performance of air turbines in a way that more closely reflects reality in addition the model of chamber turbine coupling can be established to predict the overall efficiency of owc system and facilitate turbine selection according to different design conditions acknowledgement the research is financially supported by the fundamental research funds for the central

22946,oscillating water column owc is the most widely used wave energy converting technology for onshore structures the interest in owc wave energy converters wecs has been rising in the last decade because of its capability of long term operation with high reliability and survivability the impulse and wells turbines acting as axial flow self rectifying turbines and rotating unidirectionally in reciprocating airflows generated by the air chamber play a key role in the pneumatic power conversion of owc facilities although these turbines were developed based on theoretical analysis and steady

fuels as an alternative solution renewable energy has been widely used for electricity generation in recent times it was reported that the proportion of renewable energy sources in power generation increased by 14 1 in 2016 realizing the highest growth rate on record british petroleum 2017 besides solar and wind energy ocean wave energy has attracted attentions because of its vast reserves and wide distribution many types of wave energy converters wecs have been developed to successfully harness wave energy according to their working principle wecs are generally classified as three types oscillating water column owc overtopping and oscillating body drew et al 2009 falcão 2010 lagoun et al 2010 lópez et al 2013 the advantage of owc over the other types is its simplicity of structure operation and maintenance 1 1 owc technology several reviews on owcs have been conducted by heath 2012 and delmonte et al 2016 yoshio masuda 1925 2009 the pioneer of modern wave power technology proposed a navigation buoy with an air turbine that became a prototype of the first floating owc falcão and henriques 2016 studies prior to the 1990s preliminarily presented different concepts of owcs and investigated their hydrodynamic performance and efficiencies some well known plants were deployed and constructed including the research barge kaimei designed by the japan marine science and technology center kudo 1984 a breakwater owc developed by the national engineering laboratory in scotland moody 1979 a 60 kw owc facility at the sakata port in japan suzuki et al 2004 takahashi et al 1992 and a 125 kw owc plant at trivandrum in india das 1992 large scale owcs have been developed with higher rated powers for grid connection as summarized in table 1 as shown in fig 1 a typical onshore owc plant comprises an air chamber with an open mouth below the water surface on the skirt wall incident waves cause the water column to oscillate inside the chamber which results in a variation of the sealed air volume upon the free water surface the pressure difference between the external atmosphere and the chamber compresses and decompresses the air to be exhaled and inhaled through the duct hence the air turbine installed in the duct is capable of converting the low pressure pneumatic energy into mechanical shaft power as the primary moving component air turbines have no contact with the seawater during operation this facilitates maintenance and repair of the owc components 1 2 air turbines for owc for an owc plant it is important to capture the pneumatic energy from the reciprocating airflow efficiently the earliest operating mode was to equip the owcs by a rectifying system with non return valves and a traditional air turbine such as the francis turbine or other axial flow turbines one successful example is the owc type navigation buoy developed in the 1960s masuda 1985 takao and setoguchi 2012 as shown in fig 2 however this rectifying system was considered impractical when used in a large scaled plant its complicated mechanical structure made it difficult to manufacture and maintain in large size which was demonstrated in the sea trial of a two valve traditional turbine in kaimei kocivar 1980 masuda and mccormick 2015 as shown in fig 3 consequently the concept of a self rectifying air turbine which can rectify the airflows by the turbine itself directly was proposed as an alternative this kind of turbine is capable of rotating in one direction regardless of the incident airflow direction the vast majority of axial flow self rectifying air turbines discussed in this review for owc application thus far are mainly of two types wells turbine and impulse turbine the wells turbine proposed by alan arthur wells in 1976 raghunathan 1984 was employed for owc plants because of its simple geometry and high operating efficiency as the flow coefficient increases from zero it is able to attain a high efficiency within a narrow operation region prior to stalling a sudden significant decrease in efficiency can be observed over the stalling point the efficiency remains low for large coefficients furthermore the wells turbine has other disadvantages such as poor self starting capability and high operating noise on the other hand the impulse turbine proposed by kim in 1988 has been undergoing rapid development to overcome the shortcomings of the wells turbine especially for the wave climate with lower energy density kim et al 1988 setoguchi et al 1993 the impulse turbine has a wider operational range and is less sensitive to variations in the flow coefficient it has a better self starting capability because of its mechanical nature the main disadvantage of the impulse turbine is the aerodynamic loss when the flow is guided to enter the downstream guide vanes at a large incidence angle thakker et al 2008 to improve the performance of these turbines some configurations of rotor blades and guide vanes have been proposed a number of reviews summarized the state of art of turbines and compared their overall performance under steady flow and irregular wave conditions setoguchi and takao 2006 takao and setoguchi 2012 falcão et al 2018 the configurations include the wells turbine with fixed guide vanes wtgv wells turbine with self pitch controlled blades tscb biplane wells turbine with fixed guide vanes bwgv impulse turbine with self pitch controlled guide vanes isgv and impulse turbine with fixed guide vanes ifgv comparisons of the mean efficiency and self starting characteristics under irregular wave conditions are shown in fig 4 compared to the wells turbine the impulse turbine can obtain a higher efficiency for larger flow coefficients without stall and self start in a shorter period the peak value of mean efficiency for isgv is obtained as 0 47 which is larger than that for other configurations the guide vanes of isgv are capable of rotating about the pivots and are self adaptive to the oscillation of airflow the upstream guide vanes work as an array of nozzles the generated aerodynamic torques on the downstream guide vanes subsequently make them rotate to the diffuser position via link control setoguchi et al 1996 an isgv was manufactured and commissioned in a prototype owc at vizhinjam india in 1997 santhakumar et al 1998 takao et al 2000a on the other hand the peak mean efficiency of tscb is 15 higher than that of wtgv the rotor blades of tscb can pitch about a pivot in the range limit of two preset angles according to the variation in the flow direction the pitching is driven by the moment m generated at various angles of incidence model tests were conducted to study the effects of the basic design parameters on the turbine performance such as the setting angle solidity and aspect ratio inoue et al 1989 setoguchi et al 1997 all experiments were performed for various fixed staggered blades instead of self pitching blades under unidirectional steady flow conditions this substitution ignores the transient effects of the position variations of rotor blades table 2 limits the turbines discussed in this review furthermore table 1 also introduces the turbines installed in prototype owc plants since the 1990s the wells turbine was widely used in full scale plants in the early 1990s recently the impulse turbine especially appeared in the asian owc applications for steady state studies the input coefficient c a torque coefficient c t and turbine efficiency η are used together with the flow coefficient ϕ for the performance evaluation of owc

plants or test prototypes heath 2012 the techniques of phase control falcão and henriques 2016 and the strategies for electrical control delmonte et al 2016 takao and setoguchi 2012 and setoguchi et al 2001 concluded a series of experimental results for wells and impulse turbines shehata et al 2016b was concerned with the research directions methodologies some numerical models of the wells turbine which aimed at enhancing its performance and efficiency with the rapid development of personal and parallel computers the computational fluid dynamics cfd has been widely applied for performance evaluation and optimization of turbines since the 2000s according to our limited literature review there has not been a comprehensive review focusing on cfd models and achievements on both two types of turbines compared to the previous reviews this study places emphasis on cfd methodologies related technological difficulties performance achievements and future trends in modeling and analyzing axial flow self rectifying air turbines for owc application in section 2 cfd models with various aspects are described and summarized the operating principles and numerical achievements for performance enhancement for wells and impulse turbines are reported in section 3 and 4 respectively in section 5 the discussion on present cfd studies and future trends are presented conclusions can be found in section 6 2 cfd models benefiting from improvements in fundamental theories numerical modeling and methods more powerful computing capability and more precise experimental measurements cfd is becoming an essential desktop tool in the design and optimization of turbo machines because of fruitful modules and functions integrated in the models the cfd studies can aid to improve the understanding of complicated flow phenomena in steady or unsteady states conveniently the turbine geometry can be improved without any expensive manufacturing and laboratory testing by numerical simulations with an engineering judgment for the owc turbine application shown in fig 5 the increase in paper number with a large proportion of approximately 59 within the last 5 years indicates that the cfd methodology plays a critical role in the design and optimization of air turbines detailed information about the cfd models for the wells and impulse turbines is summarized in tables 3 and 4 respectively 2 1 governing equations the governing equations in most cfd models are the continuity equation and the navier stokes n s equations even though the local velocity of airflow over the blade tip can be up to 100 m s in some circumstance the mach number m a in the applications of the turbine was found less than 0 4 and the air can be considered incompressible starzmann and carolus 2013 on the other hand the air density inside the chamber is time varying according to certain pressure density relationship theoretical analysis and experimental tests on this spring like effect such as the aero thermodynamic characteristics of the air chamber were conducted sarmento and falcão 1985 even so the incompressible solver for cfd models was considered in most studies and the chamber turbine interaction for spring like effects was neglected in the numerical simulations for turbines only in order to reduce the computational costs and maintain the precision of the n s equations the time averaged concept was first proposed by osborne reynolds 1995 each instantaneous quantity in turbulent motion can be decomposed into time averaged and fluctuating components as a result the governing equations in cartesian coordinates can be written as follows kim et al 2002b thakker and dhanasekaran 2003 ansys inc 2011 continuity equation 12 ρ t x i ρ u i x j ρ u j x k ρ u k 0 reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations 13 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j u j x i x j ρ u i u j 14 t ρ u j x k ρ u j u k p x j x k μ u j x k u k x j 2 3 δ j k u k x j x k ρ u j u k 15 t ρ u k x i ρ u k u i p x k x i μ u k x i u i x k 2 3 δ k i u i x k x i ρ u k u i where ρ is the air density p represents the pressure δ ij is the kronecker delta and u i u j and u k are the mean velocities in the x i x j and x k directions the last term ρ u i u j x j referred to the reynolds stresses represents the effects of turbulence 2 2 turbulence model to model the turbulence term in eqns 13 15 and close the rans equations the boussinesq approach was first applied to associate the reynolds stresses with the mean velocity gradients by introducing the concept of eddy viscosity the relationship is incorporated as follows hinze 1975 16 ρ u i u j μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 ρ k μ t u k x k δ i j where k represents the turbulence kinetic energy and μ t is the turbulent viscosity based on the assumption the spalart allmaras s a model k ε model and k ω model were proposed to compute the turbulent viscosity μ t as listed in tables 3 and 4 these turbulent models are predominantly used in the cfd models of owc turbines because of the complexity of airflows over the turbine system it is difficult to reach a simple conclusion as to best turbulence model in fact it is too absolute to determine the optimal turbulence model depending only on the length scales and flow conditions massive calculations should be conducted together with the geometry modification and mesh optimization for the turbulence model selection as shown in fig 6 numerical predictions of the steady state performance in terms of dimensionless torque t 0 and turbine efficiency η with different turbulent models for the wells turbine are compared with corresponding data from experiments conducted by curran and gato 1997 three typical turbulence models including the shear stress transport sst k ω and s a models by torresi et al 2004 2008 the realizable k ε model by shaaban and hafiz 2012 and the sst k ω model by halder et al 2015 are employed although the s a model predicts the torque coefficient and turbine efficiency with a better accuracy in magnitude it fails in the prediction of the stall point it indicates that the s a model has limited accommodation capability for rapid changes in the length scale such as the sudden changes in airflow from the wall boundary to free shear regions this may be caused by the use of only one transport equation for kinematic eddy viscosity in this model spalart and allmaras 1992 the k ε model employs two separate transport equations to deal with the turbulent velocity and length scales the standard k ε model proposed by launder and spalding 1972 is a semi empirical model with two equations for the turbulent kinetic energy k and its dissipation rate ε its limitation is that the value of ε is usually derived from physical experience to overcome the limits of empiricism two alternative refined models are proposed the renormalization group rng k ε model and the realizable k ε model the rng k ε model accounts of the effects of swirl and low reynolds numbers and employs an analytical formula of turbulent prandtl numbers yakhot and orszag 1986 choudhury 1993 which is capable of analyzing a wider range of turbulent flows than the standard k ε model on the other hand the realizable k ε model makes an improvement with new transport equations for the turbulent viscosity and dissipation rate shih et al 1995 it satisfies certain mathematical constraints in the reynolds stresses and is substantially consistent with the inherent mechanism of turbulent flows hence the realizable k ε model can accurately predict the stall phenomena and turbine performance before stalling as shown in fig 6 in addition the standard k ω model is only applicable for both wall bounded turbulence and free shear flows wilcox 1998 the sst k ω model uses a blending function to combine the standard k ω model in the near wall region with the transformed k ε model in the far field region menter 1994 this modification broadens the applicability of the k ω model with higher accuracy as illustrated in fig 6 the sst k ω model by halder et al 2015 demonstrates numerical results that agree well with experimental data over the entire range of flow coefficients 2 3 flow reference frame and boundary conditions because of the limited computational capability in the early stage the single rotating reference frame srf approach was initially applied in the numerical models for the wells turbine without guide vanes in an efficient steady calculation watterson and raghunathan 1998 kim et al 2002a the entire computational domain is defined with respect to the moving reference frame if the rotational speed is constant the equations for fluid motion can be transformed to the moving frame consequently the steady state prediction can be conducted under this quasi steady assumption torresi et al 2008 if the guide vanes are employed for the wells turbine the entire computational domain should be divided into multiple moving parts within separate interfaces the moving zones are solved using the moving reference frame equations whereas stationary zones are solved using the stationary reference frame equations ansys inc 2011 in general the number of guide vanes in the upstream and downstream is usually different from the rotor blades this means the continuity of flow passages in the entire computational domain cannot be satisfied which will result in an imprecise or even unrealistic prediction the mixing plane mp model was introduced to solve this problem govardhan and chauhan 2007 cui and hyun 2016 during the computation the area averaged fluxes are computed at the mps which will be considered boundary conditions spatially mixed at the interfaces as the solution converges the mixing plane boundary conditions would adjust to the prevailing flow conditions liu et al 2016a although there are a few studies using the multiple reference frame mrf model hyun et al 2004 2006 the mp model has been popularly applied in steady studies for the impulse turbine with fixed guide vanes thakker et al 2004 badhurshah and samad 2015a generally the mp approach provides a physically meaningful time averaged solution which is more cost effective in terms of computational time than unsteady calculations however it should be noted that the multiple rotating reference frame approach based on the steady state approximations does not consider the relative motion between adjacent zones this means that the moving zone is fixed in a specific position where the instantaneous flow field is calculated the sliding mesh sm model was employed further to attain a time accurate solution for rotor stator interaction thakker et al 2001 pereiras et al 2014 in this model the stationary and rotational sub domains are connected to each other through non conformal interfaces the mesh motions are prescribed so that the sub domains linked at the interfaces remain in contact with each other sliding along the interface boundaries to ensure an accurate exchange of the entire flux at the interfaces and a faster computational convergence liu et al 2011 and 2016c the typical computational domain and boundary conditions for the wells turbine and impulse turbine in steady calculations are shown in fig 7 the entire computational domain is divided into three parts the upstream guide vane domain rotor blade domain and downstream guide vane domain the upstream and downstream domains are extended to a certain distance away from the rotor blade to guarantee the full development of turbulent flow the detailed extending distances in different models are listed in tables 3 and 4 the guide vane domains are stationary whereas the rotor blade domain is set to rotate at a prescribed speed the velocity inlet boundary conditions are usually applied at the entrance of the upstream guide vane domain the velocity magnitude velocity direction turbulence intensity and hydraulic diameter can be specified for the inlet boundary at the exit of the downstream guide vane domain the pressure outlet boundary condition is specified as the static pressure with a radial equilibrium distribution and backflow conditions in addition the surfaces of the blade hub and duct are usually defined as non slip wall boundary conditions to avoid the enormous calculations caused by modeling all blades and guide vanes rotational periodic boundaries are defined at each side of the rotor and guide vane regions the calculations are restricted to one row of blade and guide vane passages two mixing planes are required in the application of mp model to connect the three sub domains 2 4 reynolds number in an owc air turbine system the reynolds number re is defined as follows liu et al 2017 17 r e ρ w l r μ ρ v a 2 u r 2 l r μ where w and μ are the relative inflow velocity at the peak efficiency point and the air viscosity respectively usually the turbulent flow around the rotor blades is regarded with full development for owc turbines because the wells turbine has a higher rotating velocity than the impulse turbine during operation the reynolds number of the wells turbine is always in the order of 105 whereas it is 104 for the impulse turbine the effects of the reynolds number on turbine performance have been studied experimentally and numerically as shown in fig 8 a setoguchi et al 2004 presented experimental results that indicated that impulse turbine efficiency under steady conditions can be improved with an increase in re this is because a higher re can help increase c t and decrease c a slightly the latest steady state tests by liu et al 2017 found that the critical value of re is approximately 5 60 104 for an impulse turbine for hub diameter d h 210 mm hyun et al 2006 established a 3 d numerical model of the impulse turbine for d h 266 mm with all the guide vanes and rotor blades employed it was reported that the turbine efficiency can be increased by 7 with a larger reynolds number re 2 5 106 for the wells turbine without guide vanes inoue et al 1986b reported that a larger reynolds number of re 2 5 105 can make the stall point move from ϕ 0 38 to ϕ 0 46 and increase the peak efficiency by 43 as shown in fig 8 b 2 5 wall function and y in the owc air turbine system the airflow passing through rotor blades is always turbulent with a high reynolds number the wall function which uses semi empirical formulas instead of the grid computing of the near wall region has been predominately applied for near wall treatments in most cfd models y which defines the distance of a wall adjacent cell away from the nearest wall is a non dimensional parameter that determines the density of grids near the surface of the wall for the wells turbine the standard and non equilibrium wall functions were employed in the numerical studies by cui and hyun 2016 shaaban and hafiz 2012 and shaaban 2012 the standard wall function is used as a default option in some commercial cfd software for the k ε turbulence model the non equilibrium wall function was considered more suitable to the flow separation around the blade surface čarija et al 2012 in terms of the mesh in the near wall region the value of y was suggested to be approximately 30 furthermore torresi et al 2004 2009 employed the enhanced wall treatment and refined the meshes sufficiently for resolving the viscous sub layer where the value of y value is in the order of 1 consequently the turbulence equations are solved to the walls and no near wall modeling is required at first thakker et al 2001 and thakker and hemry 2004 applied the standard wall function to model the near wall region of the impulse turbine the non equilibrium wall function gradually replaced the standard function because of its capability to deal with complex airflows involving separations reattachment and other non equilibrium effects and severe pressure gradients thakker and dhanasekaran 2003 accordingly the values of y at the blade and guide vane range from approximately 25 to 45 thakker and hourigan 2005a and 2005b in addition the enhanced wall function was used for y values smaller than 6 during modeling a unidirectional axial impulse turbine pereiras et al 2014 detailed information of y and near wall treatment are listed in table 3 and table 4 2 6 cfd software the cfd software provides a general purpose code package to solve the governing equations coupled with different turbulent models boundary conditions and initial conditions it is quite convenient for users to operate the software by merely entering the necessary parameters through the graphic user interface gui with the geometry and grid files with the rapid development of the computational capability of the personal computer the commercial cfd software plays a dominant role in the desktop analysis of turbo machines because of its powerful functions on geometry modeling and flow field simulation which are also employed in the application of owc turbines unlike cfd software such as the numeca fine turbo and turbodesign specifically used for generic turbo machines the general purpose cfd platform ansys fluent and ansys cfx were predominantly employed to analyze the owc turbines halder et al 2015 and badhurshah and samad 2015a and 2015b conducted numerical analysis of wells and impulse turbines using ansys cfx and compared their results with those derived using ansys fluent it can be found that the two types of cfd software show few significant differences in terms of accuracy of the numerical prediction ansys fluent has some advantages such as friendlier gui lower memory consumption substantial turbulence models and discretization schemes and more flexible user defined functions udfs more than 80 of the numerical simulations of owc turbines were reported using ansys fluent 3 wells turbine 3 1 operation principle the schematic of forces acting on the blade of the wells turbine without guide vanes is illustrated in fig 9 the rotor blade moves at a certain linear velocity u r in an axial flow with the velocity of v a in the relative frame where the rotor is assumed stationary the rotor motion can be equated with a tangential flow with the velocity of r u the relative velocity w of the incident flow inclines toward the chord line of the rotor blade within an angle which is called the angle of attack α and is defined as α tan 1 v a u r tan 1 ϕ according to the airfoil theory the rotor blade experiences two kinds of forces the lift force l normal to the direction of relative velocity w and the drag force d in the direction of w these forces could be resolved into the tangential component f t and the axial component f a respectively evidently the direction of the tangential force f t remains the same regardless of the direction of incident flow therefore the wells turbine can rotate in one direction even under the reciprocating airflow conditions in addition the stalling and self starting characteristics of the wells turbine can be explained from the perspective of the angle of attack the variation in the tangential force coefficient c θ defined as c θ f t 1 2ρw 2 l r against α is shown in fig 10 a four notable regimes can be observed in the regime ⅰ the value of c θ is negative where all the pneumatic power input is dissipated as heat c θ increases with the increase of α in regime ⅱ which is regarded as the operation case a sudden decrease of c θ can be observed which is caused by the flow separation from the blade surface due to an increased angle of attack this incidence angle is regarded as the stalling point where the value of f t has a significant drop c θ remains negative in regime ⅲ which affects the self starting performance as the turbine starts from rest the value of α gradually decreases from 90 if the turbine cannot pass through regime ⅲ it will enter the crawling state and fail to accelerate to the normal operating rotation speed as plotted by the dotted line in fig 10 b in fig 10 c raghunathan 1995 presented a suitable combination of rotor solidity σ t and hub to tip ratio ν for successful self starting 3 2 numerical achievements the cfd models should be verified before any detailed numerical investigations are conducted the turbulence model grid independence time step et al need to be validated carefully experiments can preliminarily reveal the effects of flow conditions and geometry parameters on the operating performance of air turbines and provide validation cases for cfd models the original numerical studies mainly focused on applying the numerical simulation to explore the physical mechanism of the wells turbine without guide vanes including the flow pattern around rotor blades the stalling phenomenon and the hysteretic characteristics after the establishment of the model and original explorations the research focus switched to the optimization of the turbine geometry such as the guide vane tip clearance hub to tip ratio and blade sweep table 3 summarizes the detailed information of the cfd models for the wells turbine 3 2 1 mechanism exploration watterson and raghunathan 1996 led the development of a cfd code to investigate the aerodynamics of the wells turbine as shown in fig 11 the cfd code solved the 3d rans equations based on the finite volume method jameson and baker 1987 an unstructured mesh method called newt dawes 1992 and the k ε turbulent model modified by lam and bremhorst 1981 the numerical contours of the relative mach number and velocity vectors indicated that the stalling is caused by the tip clearance vortex and its spread from tip to hub however the pioneering model conducted the simulations for only four flow coefficients with the triangular meshes illustrated in fig 11 a it failed to exactly predict the stalling point as shown in fig 11 b hence optimizations of the mesh type and structure and improvements in the turbulence model are required to enhance the accuracy of the numerical model in predicting turbine aerodynamics a clear and detailed description of 3d flows around the wells turbine was presented by suzuki and arakawa 2001 2006 numerical predictions of flow patterns and velocity vectors around the blade illustrated a strong counterclockwise vortex on the suction surface under the stall condition because of the flow separation in the forward area of the chord the commercial software fluent was first reported in the numerical study of a wells turbine without guide vanes kim et al 2002c the unsteady hysteretic characteristics were analyzed under a reciprocating flow condition the wells turbine has a hysteretic loop where the values of c t and c a in the accelerating flow are smaller than those in the decelerating flow as shown in fig 12 based on the vortex theorems the hysteretic behavior is closely associated with the intensity of the vortical flow occurring on the suction side of the blade kim et al 2002a the tip clearance rotor solidity and setting angle of rotor blade have significant effects on its hysteretic performance setoguchi et al 2003a the numerical results of the biplane wells turbine were reported by mamun et al 2004 and kinoue et al 2004 as shown in fig 13 a spiral type separation on the suction surface of the upstream blade enclosed in a red ellipse is evident in the decelerating flow than in the accelerating flow when the attack of angle is 14 meanwhile the biplane turbine with staggered blades could eliminate the clockwise hysteretic loops of c a for the turbine without stagger 3 2 2 geometry optimization based on the established model watterson and raghunathan 1998 investigated the effects of rotor solidity it was found that increasing the solidity can make the stalling point migrate to the larger flow coefficient region because the blade to blade interaction is strengthened in the hub region kim et al 2002c reported a good agreement between numerical results and experimental data especially on the maximum efficiency and the stalling point fig 14 presents the numerical results of the effects of the blade sweep under steady conditions as illustrated in fig 14 b a blade sweep ratio of s b 0 35 is optimal for a wells turbine with the profile of naca0020 govardhan and dhanasekaran 2001 created different 3d models with variable chord varc rotors and circular arc guide vanes for numerical investigations which have a better performance than the original turbine to obtain a higher peak efficiency and a wider operating range of flow coefficients the variable thickness blade vtb can reduce the interaction between the tip leakage vortex and suction surface of the blade nazeryan and lakzian 2018 at most a 63 37 increase in c t and 72 8 increase in η are achieved by the vtb in the deep stall condition torresi et al 2004 2008 conducted 3d numerical simulations on the wells turbines with low and high solidities respectively the investigation of tip clearance was demonstrated to be necessary to improve the reliability of predicting the hysteretic performance of wells turbine a smaller gap results in the occurrence of flow separation near the tip for lower flow coefficients whereas a larger gap causes a degradation of the performance due to a decrease in the pressure drop over the turbine numerical results obtained by taha et al 2010 2011 yielded similar conclusions on the effects of tip clearance shaaban and hafiz 2012 employed the form of venturi tube for the turbine duct and studied the effects of duct area ratio ar and duct angle on the turbine efficiency and stall point the turbine performance was predicted to improve by 9 in turbine efficiency and a substantial migration of the stalling point was predicted for ar 1 5 with a duct angle of 7 in addition the performance of the biplane wells turbine was studied in terms of the interaction between upstream and downstream rotors and their respective contributions to the turbine performance shaaban 2012 it was revealed that a high reynolds number and a swiveling angle of the blades can contribute to the better performance of a double stage wells turbine dorrell and hsieh 2008 according to the gouy stodola theorem bejan 1996 the difference between reversible and actual works in any thermodynamic system is the entropy generation shehata et al 2014 employed 2d numerical models with different airfoils to evaluate the entropy generation due to viscous dissipation the effects of the reynolds number and angle of attack on entropy generation are evident the turbine with naca0015 blades provides a smaller value of total entropy generation furthermore the global entropy generation rates of the wells turbine with different airfoils were assessed numerically under sinusoidal flow conditions shehata et al 2016a the second law efficiency of the turbine with naca0015 airfoil is 1 5 higher than other airfoils the application of passive flow control can help to increase the torque coefficient by more than 40 within the stalling regime shehata et al 2017 mahboubidoust and ramiar 2017 employed the similar methodology and found the dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator can increase the torque coefficient by 39 4 and decrease the lift coefficient by 30 5 averagely moreover the blade skew was designed and studied numerically to improve the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance of wells turbine starzmann and carolus 2013 the optimal backward forward blade skew can make the stalling point migrate to the larger flow coefficient region and widen the range of operation by 5 in terms of static pressure head hashem et al 2018 proposed to submerge the wells turbine in the sea water as the operating medium and found the airfoil of s146 can increase the values of c t and η by 1 4 and 1 8 times at ϕ 0 3 respectively the concept of a groove as a rotor tip treatment was applied to migrate the stalling point and enhance the turbine efficiency halder et al 2015 halder and samad 2015 which is somewhat similar to the concept of simple penetration proposed by hyun et al 2005 the schematic diagram of the groove is described in fig 15 a the basic idea is to render the tip clearance virtually zero the effects of groove depth and tip clearance on the turbine performance were studied under steady conditions it can be observed in fig 15 b that the groove influences the tip leakage flow and creates a smaller vortex near the downstream groove corner which is capable of migrating the stalling point another optimization of turbine geometry is to change the blade thickness from hub to tip by mixing the naca0015 and naca0024 profiles a smaller thickness at mid cross section is better at increasing the power output and restraining the flow separation halder and samad 2015 in addition the blade sweep angles at the tip and mid cross sections can be optimized to restrain the flow separation and increase the relative power output by 29 halder et al 2017a and 2017b 4 impulse turbine 4 1 operation principle the structure of velocity vectors over the guide vanes and rotor blades of an impulse turbine is shown in fig 16 the upstream guide vanes operate as stationary nozzles to guide and accelerate the incident flow into the rotor with a pre whirl angle α 2 resulting in a velocity increase and pressure drop as the airflow enter the rotor the airflow is then guided by rotor blades and enters the downstream guide vanes at a relative velocity w 3 generally the composition of aerodynamic losses for the impulse turbine is quite complicated among them the mechanical loss can be reduced by improving the level of manufacturing technology thakker et al 2005a the profile and secondary flow losses are of substantial significance which can be reduced by optimizing the geometries of rotor blades and guide vanes gomes et al 2012a for instance the incidence angle i defined as the angle between the direction of w2 and the blade inlet angle α r is a substantially important parameter to minimize the blade profile loss for the blade passage cho and choi 2004 furthermore the tip clearance is another parameter that has a significant effect on the turbine performance this is because the leakage flow emerging at the blade tip will interact with the passage flow to generate the tip leakage vortex thakker and dhanasekaran 2003 fig 17 shows a comparison of the rotating velocity variation between the impulse turbine and wells turbine under sinusoidal flow during self starting setoguchi et al 2001 the impulse turbine can start in a shorter period than the wells turbine which experiences a considerably difficult process and requires approximately a six fold starting period the rotational speed of the impulse turbine at the stable stage is approximately one third of the wells turbine from this view it can be expected to design an impulse turbine for owc plants which can effectively self start especially in a low density wave climate the impulse turbine with different setting angles of guide vanes are also compared in fig 17 for the impulse turbine the acceleration value for a smaller setting angle is larger than the large one 4 2 validation of cfd models a series of experimental tests of the impulse turbine were conducted at saga university japan which provided fruitful validated data for the numerical analysis maeda et al 1999 setoguchi et al 2001 both steady for a short time and oscillating airflow can be produced by controlling the motion of the piston many cfd studies referred to the above experimental data such as hyun et al 2004 2005 badhurshah and samad 2015a and 2015b cui and hyun 2016 and liu et al 2016a the research team from the university of limerick also conducted experimental studies on the impulse turbine curran and gato 1997 thakker and hourigan 2004 because the wind generation equipment was unidirectional only the upper halves of sinusoidal or irregular flows were generated for the tests of turbine performance thakker et al 2005a these experimental data were also popular for the validation of cfd models thakker et al 2004 2005b thakker and hourigan 2005a 4 3 numerical achievements numerical studies on the impulse turbine started later than those on the wells turbine some valuable experiences were borrowed from previous works on the wells turbine with respect to establishing the model and optimizing the design as mentioned in section 4 1 the operational mechanism of the impulse turbine is simpler than that of the wells turbine consequently cfd models of the impulse turbine are easier in terms of mesh generation and model validation the major objective of numerical simulations focuses on the optimization of turbine geometry detailed information of the cfd models for impulse turbine is listed in table 4 4 3 1 2d and 3d models thakker et al 2001 realized the first application of cfd analysis in the study of impulse turbines with fixed guide vanes the 2d cfd results were compared with experimental data which show similar trends in the same order of magnitude however the numerical results overestimated the performance of impulse turbine by approximately 14 due to the ignorance of the 3d characteristics of airflow and the effects of tip gap loss the 3d models were expected to overcome the above shortcomings the comparison of mesh structures for 2d and 3d models is shown in fig 18 subsequently the cfd works began to focus on the validation of 3d models with experimental data for the same turbine thakker et al 2004 thakker and hourigan 2005a 3d models with various tip clearances were established for exploring the mechanics of tip leakage flow based on abundant validations with experimental data thakker and dhanasekaran 2003 it was demonstrated that the performance of the impulse turbine is quite sensitive to the tip clearance furthermore visual contours of velocity and pressure provide valuable information to reveal the physics of fluid behavior in the impulse turbine which is technically difficult to traditional experiments two schemes of meshes were compared where the tip clearance was not modeled thakker and hourigan 2005b structured grids agreed better with experimental results thakker and dhanasekaran 2005 summarized their experimental and computational results and reported that the downstream guide vanes were responsible for the low efficiency of the turbine because of flow separation and loss of average pressure thakker and his team paved the path for the establishment of 2d and 3d models using the commercial cfd software fluent the parametric optimization and analysis of fluid behaviors were preliminarily conducted which provided sufficient supports for subsequent studies on the impulse turbine hyun et al 2004 also compared the accuracy and effectiveness of 2d and 3d models on basis of neglecting the effect of reynolds number and assuming an identical value for both guide vanes and rotor blades it was shown that the 2d model can qualitatively predict the turbine performance and has advantages over the 3d model of simpler and faster calculations in addition some optimal parameters were found such as a tip clearance of 0 5 mm and the setting angle of guide vane of 30 most former studies generally assumed the airflow to be quasi steady and applied the quasi steady method to the unsteady problems in order to the steady state coefficients this method has been validated by inoue et al 1986a however the quasi steady assumption has inherent shortcomings as it neglects the variation in the reynolds number and other complicated aerodynamics especially during the self starting process a fully transient simulation based on newtonian mechanics can be expected to reveal the detailed unsteady characteristics of air turbines liu et al 2011 first established a 3d transient numerical model to predict the self starting and stoppage performance of the impulse turbine under some unsteady flow conditions 4 3 2 performance improvement hyun et al 2005 proposed the design of a penetrating end plate installed vertically on the blade tip to minimize the adverse effects of tip clearance as shown in fig 19 a the 3d model was established using the relative moving reference frame and the standard k ε turbulence model as illustrated in fig 19 b the existence of the penetrating end plate results in an obvious decrease in the input coefficient c a furthermore the effects of the reynolds number on the turbine performance were predicted using a 3d model with all guide vanes and rotor blades involved as presented in fig 19 c the turbine efficiency increases up by 7 with the increase of re hyun et al 2006 liu et al 2013 conducted a series of 3d steady state simulations to provide guidance for the impulse turbine utilization in the 500 kw yongsoo owc plant on jeju island south korea as shown in fig 20 the flow path lines on rotor blades clearly demonstrated that a larger tip clearance would result in tip leakage flow marked by the red ellipse and vortex rollup marked by the green ellipse moreover a tip clearance of 3 mm was recommended to obtain better turbine efficiency liu et al 2013 subsequently liu and his team conducted a series of parametric studies with the aim of optimizing the geometry of impulse turbine and improving the energy conversion efficiency the numerical results recommended the rotor solidity defined as s r l r of 0 49 liu et al 2015 the solidity ratio defined as g n z of 0 63 cui and liu 2014 and the stagger angle of the rotor blades the rotor blade rotates a certain degree about the midpoint of blade section of 5 within the corresponding guide vane configurations cui et al 2015 shows better performance for improving the turbine efficiency pereiras et al 2014 numerically analyzed the flow field of a twin turbine configuration proposed by jayashankar et al 2009 both turbines operate throughout the cycle both exhalation and inhalation processes and only one operates in direct mode power output while the other operates in reverse mode backflow preventer the turbines alternate their roles following the direction change of the reciprocating airflow the numerical results showed that the major source of incidence losses occurs in the rotor for the direct mode and in the row of guide vanes for the reverse mode increasing the blockage by changing the solidity of the rotor and guide vanes might improve the efficiency of the whole system tog and tousi 2014 optimized the nozzle parameter to improve the axial gap flow pattern on basis of a genetic algorithm a 3d numerical study was conducted to obtain conclusive results using both transient and steady state calculations an improvement in turbine efficiency by 2 5 was finally obtained with a reduction in the total pressure losses and a decrease in the sensitivity of the nozzle to the expansion rate badhurshah and samad 2015a and badhurshah et al 2018 coupled the cfd analysis with multiple surrogate models for the optimization of both turbine design and flow parameters the coupled optimized design can enhance the turbine efficiency by 16 compared to the original design 5 discussions and perspectives 5 1 steady models and quasi steady method it can be concluded that the cfd simulations have been fully developed for predicting the steady performance of wells and impulse turbines with satisfactory accuracy different for experiments and analytical method the cfd analysis is capable of not only revealing the details of flow and pressure field distributions but also reducing the researching expenses and increasing the variety of objectives the steady state investigation plays a key role for understanding the fundamental characteristics of the turbine especially during preliminary study and geometry optimization which saves expenses and time for steady state cfd studies the general purpose commercial software can be used in the numerical simulations of owc turbines the sst k ω model is recommended to deal with the turbulence effects especially at near wall regions over rotor blades and guide vanes the mp model should be employed for the stator guide vanes and rotor blades interactions because the wells turbine is lift type the order of magnitude has better to be 106 for the number of structured hexahedral meshes with d d 300 mm the order of magnitude for y is recommended to be 1 with the enhanced wall treatment on the other hand the number of cooper tetrahedral meshes is usually at the order of 105 for the impulse turbine with d d 300 mm the number of y can be controlled at approximately 30 with application of the standard wall functions the periodic boundary condition allows only one row of the blade and guide vanes employed in steady calculations the length of extended upstream downstream computation domains is recommended not less than four times the chord length since the interaction between two energy conversion stages of an owc system is complicated and the variations in the free surface elevation air pressure in the chamber and air flow velocity are affected mutually reciprocating airflows over the turbine should be considered transient viscous and unsteady since the cost is still huge especially for limited computation resources during the preliminary desktop design stage the quasi steady method is usually employed as a compromise solution which can predict some unsteady behaviors of the turbine with much less computation cost during quasi steady analysis the airflow at each instant is considered quasi steady and the unsteady parameters can be calculated based on the steady coefficients cui et al 2015 hu and li 2018 the basic assumption of quasi steady analysis is that the incident wave frequency is much smaller than the blade passing frequency of the turbine under normal operating conditions where the interaction between the chamber and turbine can be ignored gato et al 1996 hyun et al 2006 in addition if the reduced frequency of the turbine defined as k f w l r v2 a u2 r 1 2 is usually of the order 10 4 the amplitude attenuation and phase lag can be ignored and the airflow is regarded as quasi steady setoguchi et al 1998 several attempts have been made to predict the unsteady performance of air turbines the quasi steady analysis was generally applied to predict the mean efficiency versus the flow coefficient and the rotating speed of rotor blades versus time setoguchi et al 1996 kim et al 2002d takao et al 2000b setoguchi et al 2003b and 2003c however the limitations are evident because the assumption of quasi steady airflow neglects the interaction between waves and turbines as well as the variation in the reynolds number during the self starting process therefore the transient cfd models should be developed for the direct simulations of unsteady turbine behaviors in addition the chamber turbine coupled models also should be considered to reflect the unsteady interactions between the energy conversion stages 5 2 development of transient cfd simulations with the rapid improvement of cfd technology it has become possible to simulate the transient behaviors of air turbines under reciprocating flow conditions such as the fully unsteady start and operation processes a 3d numerical model was created as a preliminary attempt of transient simulation in both constant and sinusoidal flows liu et al 2018 cui et al 2019 fig 21 presents the model setup and flow field demonstration of the 3d transient model as shown in fig 21 a the computational domains and meshes are generated in the software gambit with tet hybird tgrid meshes near the rotor blades and hex wedge cooper meshes in other regions the total cell number is approximately 1 7 106 the sliding mesh model and user define function udf are employed for the flow driven motion of the rotor unlike traditional calculations of forced rotations with a constant angular velocity the turbine in the present model is entirely driven by the airflows and rotates passively which is governed by newton s second law of motion the rotating velocity of the rotor and the inlet velocity of the airflow are both updated in real time more details of this fully flow driven model were described by liu et al 2018 transient calculations under sinusoidal flow conditions demonstrate different fluid structure interactions as illustrated in fig 21 b with the guidance of upstream guide vanes the airflow enters the rotor region and achieves a velocity up to 40 m s evident separation can be observed from the downstream guide vanes which might cause significant aerodynamic loss the airflow then moves in spiral to the exit of flow passage effects of air flow velocity amplitude and rotor s moment of inertia on the flow field and pressure distribution on the blades pneumatic torque and rotation speed and the transient input and torque coefficients were also studied it can be seen in fig 22 that a smaller moment of inertia results in rapid acceleration of the rotor a larger magnitude of oscillation and a higher rotating speed in the stable stage in the future the friction electricity generator loadings and air compressibility would be considered in accordance with the real physics incident airflows with irregular and random characteristics under real sea conditions should be considered for the calculations this would offer more valuable information to the designers and engineers of owc prototype facilities 5 3 establishment of chamber turbine model it is known that the overall efficiency of an owc plant depends on the combination of the primary conversion stage of air chamber and the secondary conversion stage of air turbines the above literature review indicates that numerous studies have been conducted to study the aerodynamic characteristics of air turbines similarly abundant studies have been conducted for the air chamber for instance experiments were conducted to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of a pile supported chamber structure he and huang 2014 nagata et al 2011 proposed a 2d theoretical method to specify the energy equations and motion equations and estimate the primary efficiency of a floating air chamber conde et al 2011 bouali and larbi 2013 and luo et al 2014 validated the reliability and accuracy of numerical simulations with corresponding experimental data in predicting the interaction between the waves and the chamber the majority of the reports studied the chamber and air turbine separately despite the fact that the chamber turbine coupling plays an important role in an owc system the initial attempt to theoretically study the combination of chamber and air turbines was based on an assumption that the turbine has a simplified relationship either linear or square between the pressure difference across the turbine and the relative flow rate falcão et al 2012 2014 gomes et al 2012b luo et al 2014 lópez and iglesias 2014 used a slot with various widths to produce different turbine damping and evaluated the pneumatic efficiency of a given owc murakami et al 2016 performed 2d wave tank tests in regular waves for a fixed owc plant with an impulse turbine the effects of chamber turbine coupling were included during evaluation of the primary and secondary conversion efficiencies lópez et al 2014 and liu et al 2016b created the 2d and 3d rans vof models using orifice plates instead of air turbine to study the optimum turbine chamber coupling the simplified assumption of turbine damping showed that the interaction between air chamber and turbines was still a one way simulation with the development of cfd technology and computer capacity it has become possible to realize a transient two way simulation of the overall owc system in the near future in addition future studies might focus on the synthesis of existing achievements and tentatively establish a system for designing a suitable air turbine according to different design conditions in european or asian oceans one such example in point is the design theory of marine propellers carlton 2007 the owc system requires the combined effects of key parameters such as the turbine diameter hub to tip ratio rotor profile blade numbers and rotating speed numerical simulations can help to establish a valuable turbine design database 6 conclusions with the development of renewable marine energy the owc wave energy converter has become one of the most popular technologies worldwide as a critical part of the owc system the axial flow self rectifying air turbines proposed in the mid 1970s have been well studied via model tests theoretical derivation and cfd simulations this review focuses on the cfd achievements for the wells and impulse turbines the operating principles and technological difficulties are presented in details in addition the cfd models for both turbines are listed in order of chronology and groups the following remarks could be concluded from the review the cfd method has advantages in describing the fundamental features of the flow field reducing the expenses and enriching the objectives although experimental validations are of significant importance and necessity cfd is popularly regarded as a reliable effective tool for exploring the mechanism of wells and impulse turbines and optimizing their geometries for wells and impulse turbines the accuracy of numerical models depends on the turbulence model flow reference frame reynolds number and the near wall treatment in addition the model of the wells turbine requires a better mesh quality than the impulse turbine this is embodied in the grid density near the rotor blades and the control of y numerical works on the wells turbine starting from the 1990s focused on the exploration of the physical mechanism and optimization of turbine geometries the prediction of stalling phenomena has been difficult additionally the numerical simulations of impulse turbine beginning in the 2000s gradually became reliable in improving the turbine performance in the near future it will be possible to realize a transformation from the quasi steady analysis to the transient simulation and investigate the unsteady performance of air turbines in a way that more closely reflects reality in addition the model of chamber turbine coupling can be established to predict the overall efficiency of owc system and facilitate turbine selection according to different design conditions acknowledgement the research is financially supported by the fundamental research funds for the central

22947,the typhoon kai tak that occurred in august 2012 produced strong winds heavy rain extreme wave and storm surge which also had a significant impact on the coastal areas of china and vietnam studying the formation and tracking the movement mechanism of this typhoon will help reduce future coastal disasters as well as have important scientific significance the impact of a typhoon creates strong mass transport and energy exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean which produces a strong interaction between the wind field and the flow field a coupled atmosphere ocean model in the south china sea was established based on the mesoscale atmospheric model wrf and the regional ocean model roms typhoon kai tak was simulated using this model the simulation results show that the coupled wrf roms model indicate high simulation accuracy with respect of storm surge in the south china sea under the influence of typhoon kai tak the simulation results also reveal the temporal and spatial distribution of typhoon kai tak s field storm surge and wind induced flow fields the spatial asymmetry and time lag in the spatial temporal distribution of sea surface temperature during typhoon kai tak have been discussed the heat exchange at the air sea interface was very strong under the influence of typhoon kai tak and the latent heat generated by water vapor evaporation plays a dominant role in the heat exchange at the air sea interface which shows that the heat carried by the vaporization of the sea surface is one of the important factors for the decrease of sea temperature under the influence of a typhoon keywords storm surge typhoon coupled atmosphere ocean model sea air interaction wrf roms 1 introduction the northwest pacific and the south china sea region are the birthplaces of most monsoons and typhoons and are an important channel for the generation and transmission of water vapor chia and ropelewski 2002 wang et al 2007 sun et al 2017 wu et al 2018 the northwest pacific plays a major role in regulating interdecadal and long term changes in climate hu et al 2015 xie et al 2016 china is the region with the largest number of typhoons and the most destructive power affected by typhoons in the world liu et al 2009 china is also one of the countries with the most serious marine and meteorological disasters in the context of global warming the probability of occurrence of extreme weather events has continuously increased and have caused a large degree of impact on the offshore areas wang et al 2010 compared with large scale phenomena such as global climate change small and medium scale phenomena such as typhoons and thunderstorms have an even greater impact on people s production and life yang et al 2018 typhoons and hurricanes present some of the greatest threats to life and damage to property mooney et al 2019 the influence of a typhoon on a region is often not only a heavy wind disaster at the same time the heavy rain extreme waves storm surges and beach erosion yang et al 2015 ge et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 mei et al 2018 that are produced will also have a huge impact on the region which will result in the formation of a typhoon disaster chain lee 2006 wu et al 2019 therefore studying the movement mechanism of typhoon accurately forecasting the influence of typhoon and reducing storm surge disasters have important social value for the protection of national economic development and human and property safety the current problem of marine environmental forecasting is attempting to predict the impact of such extreme weather due to the relative lack of marine data research on such issues mainly relies on numerical simulations scholars have developed a variety of models for forecasting storm surge as early as 1972 jelesnianski developed the splash model followed by the slosh model jelesnianski et al 1992 which was widely used in storm surge simulation in seas lakes and on land forbes et al 2014 hu et al 2015 neumann et al 2015 blumberg and mellor 1987 developed the pom model to simulate large scale ocean and coastal water levels and flow field changes xie et al 2004 li et al 2013 many ocean models have been developed and used for the simulation of storm surges such as the ecom model di et al 2011 blumberg et al 2015 roms model li et al 2006 you et al 2010 ch3d ims model sheng et al 2010 cest model zhang et al 2013 selfe model zhang and baptista 2008 delft3d model vu and lam 2005 adcirc model mattocks and forbes 2008 sebastian et al 2014 and fvcom model weisberg and zheng 2006 rego and li 2010 chen et al 2018 they have achieved very good results and laid the foundation for understanding the dynamic mechanism of storm surges there is a strong mass transport energy exchange and interaction between the atmosphere and the ocean during a typhoon black et al 2007 the physics fields such as the wind field flow field and wave field influence each other and restrict each other the forcing effect of the atmosphere on the ocean mainly includes wind stress pressure heat flux and solar radiation on the sea surface additionally the upper ocean responds to the atmospheric effects and its response results in atmospheric dynamics processes the role of the oceans in the atmosphere mainly includes two aspects first changes in the sea surface temperature sst lead to changes in the sea surface heat flux which affects the movement of the atmosphere second changes in the sea surface flow field cause the wind stress at the bottom of the atmosphere to change and affect the atmosphere movement structure liu et al 2010 during the evolution of storm surge induced by a typhoon there are many factors including the influence of different spatial and temporal scales and different physical factors such as wind speed air pressure runoff wave and astronomical tide and others which makes it difficult to accurately simulate storm surges mori et al 2014 takagi et al 2017 yin et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the development of a coupled atmospheric and ocean model had significant effects on improving the accuracy of numerical prediction liu et al 2015 yang and haas 2015 gronholz et al 2017 the establishment of a coupled atmosphere and ocean model is an effective method to solve this problem mesoscale meteorological models such as the mm5 model wang et al 2017 or the wrf model warner et al 2010 zambon et al 2014 pattanayak et al 2016 lakshmi et al 2017 were used to provide high accuracy and precision of wind and pressure field for the ocean model by establishing a coupled atmosphere and ocean model the sea air interface information exchange was achieved and the simulation accuracy of storm surge was improved the coupled wrf roms model in the south china sea has been established using the model coupling toolkit mct the mesoscale atmospheric model wrf and the regional ocean model roms based on the coawst modeling system in this study typhoon kai tak and storm surge were simulated based on this coupled model the characteristics of atmospheric motion and flow movement in the south china sea under the influence of typhoon were calculated the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of the storm surge in the south china sea were analyzed in this study 2 methodology and data 2 1 numerical tools 2 1 1 wrf atmospheric module the wrf weather research and forecasting model is the latest generation of mesoscale meteorological model jointly developed by research institutes such as the ncar national center for atmospheric research and ncep national centers for environmental prediction version v1 0 of the wrf model was released in november 2000 and the version 3 9 1 released on august 2017 have been used to simulate typhoon in this study the wrf model can be used to simulate climate change atmospheric motion and air quality at different scales such as global and regional scales it can also be used for simulation of typhoon or hurricane and atmosphere and ocean interaction the wrf model has a wide range of applications in different field and become the most popular mesoscale atmosphere model now the wrf model includes two different frameworks arw the advanced research wrf and nmm the non hydrostatic mesoscale model which maintained and developed by the ncar and ncep respectively the arw framework in the wrf model is used in this study this model adopts a fully compressible non hydrostatic model with arakawa c grid in the horizontal direction and terrain following quality coordinates in the vertical direction laprise 1992 2 1 2 roms oceanic module the regional ocean model system roms is one of the most advanced ocean model systems in the world the roms model adopts the stretched terrain following coordinates in the vertical direction which can properly describe the influence of the topography in the vertical direction non equal scale stratification can be used which can get higher simulation accuracy at the thermocline and the bottom boundary layer the momentum equations of roms model are as shown in eqs 1 3 haidvogel et al 2008 1 h z u t u h z u x v h z u y w h z u s f h z v h z ρ 0 p x h z g η x s u w

effectively simulate the ocean dynamic process under the influence of typhoon the mesoscale atmospheric model wrf and the regional ocean model roms was coupled based on the model coupling toolkit mct craig et al 2005 and the interaction between the ocean and typhoon has been considered in this study a coupled atmosphere and ocean model in the south china sea has been established the schematic diagram of the coupled model system is shown in fig 1 based on coawst modeling system warner et al 2008 it can be seen from the figure that there is a two way coupling between the wrf and roms model that is the surface stress net heat fluxes and sensible heat flux latent heat flux shortwave radiation flux and longwave radiation flux calculated by wrf and delivered to roms through the mct coupler while the sea surface temperature sst calculated by roms is feedback to the wrf through the mct coupler in summary the sea surface temperature can affect the intensity of the typhoon is a opinion easy to understand the asymmetric distribution of sea surface temperature affects the thermal radiation process and heat flux exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere thus affecting the water vapor exchange process the result of these dynamic processes is that the intensity of the typhoon changes for example if the ocean is warmer and the sea surface temperature is higher during the typhoon movement the typhoon can get more energy from the ocean and at the same time strengthen the exchange of water vapor at the sea air interface resulting in an increase in the intensity of the typhoon which will lead to an increase in storm surge 2 2 basic data and initial and boundary conditions the shoreline data comes from the global self consistent hierarchical high resolution shorelines gshhs

131 5 e and the roms child domain is from 12 5 n 105 5 e to 24 n 117 e the yellow and blue wireframes represent the parent and child simulation domains of the wrf and roms respectively the physical and parameterization schemes for typhoon kai tak in the wrf are as follows the gird resolution in horizontal direction using a two way nesting grid of 15 km and 5 km 35 layers has been taken in the vertical direction and the maximum top pressure recommended 2000pa the wsm6 parameterization scheme and kain fritsch scheme has been selected for the microphysical parameterization schemes and cumulus parameterization schemes respectively and the ysu scheme has been used for the boundary layer scheme in the wrf model the configuration of these parameterization schemes refers from some results of

1 the d1 model parent model outputs the results every 180 min and the d2 model child model outputs the results every 60 min the ocean model roms uses two way nesting grids with 170 170 nodes parent grid and 225 240 nodes child grid the grid size between parent grid and child grid is 3 1 which are 15 km 15 km and 5 km 5 km respectively the parent model encompasses the entire south china sea and nearby sea regions and the child model mainly includes the central and north of the south china sea as shown in fig 3 the vertical layer of the double grid is 16 layers and the vertical coordinate stretching parameters theta s 5 0 theta b 0 4 that is the sea surface and bottom layer are improved resolution in this study the atmospheric model has a spatial extent that covers most of the continental south china south china sea thailand gulf malay archipelago and philippine islands the atmospheric grid is large enough to provide surface forcing for the ocean model but the ocean model grids are rotated and with differing cell sizes the interpolation is required to transfer data between these grids to allow the models to exchange data fields on different grids we use the spherical coordinate remapping interpolation package scrip jones 1998 to compute interpolation weights the weights are computed as a pre processing step they are read in during initialization and used in the sparse matrix interpolation as described in warner et al 2008 currently we use the nearest neighbor method to compute the weights in the roms model as shown in fig 3 the east west south and north boundaries of the parent model are all set as open boundaries the harmonic constants for the eight main tidal of m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 and q1 obtained from the china seas and indonesia 2016 scheme in otis according to the mesh division of the roms model the value of the open boundary point in the model is interpolated by the osu tidal prediction software otps and the water level forecast value is obtained through the t predic function and the obtained water level is used as the open boundary of the roms model to drive the west and north boundaries of the child model are set as closed boundary and the boundary conditions on the south and east are provided by the parent model the water level forecast in the parent model is calculated according to the following formula 7 ζ i 1 n f i h i cos ω i t v 0 i u i g i where ζ is the water level h i g i ω i respectively represents the amplitude the late angle and the angular velocity of the i th component tide f i is the intersection point factor

and the horizontal mixing coefficient is taken as 0 1 in this study the coupled wrf roms model simulate start at 2012 08 15 00 00 utc and ended at 2012 08 18 06 00 utc for a total of 78 h including entering processes of landing and leaving of typhoon kai tak in the south china sea the time step of the atmosphere model wrf is set to 60 s and the timestep of the parent and child ocean model roms is set to 60 s and 20 s respectively the time step of the mct synchronization is set to 600 s 2 4 selection of typhoon typhoon kai tak 201213 formed a tropical depression in the eastern sea of the philippines on the evening of august 12 2012 it reached the southeast of taiwan 16 9 n 127 8 e at about 08 00 on the 13th and continued to strengthen the maximum wind speed reached 18 m s or more and the minimum air pressure was 998 hpa it moved northwestward at a speed of about 10 km h and gradually approached the southern coast of taiwan the track of typhoon kai tak is shown in fig 4 at 05 00 on august 16 2012 it strengthened to typhoon level over the north of the south china sea at 06 00 the center of typhoon was in the south of zhanjiang guangdong province 18 7 n 118 2 e the maximum wind speed near the center was more than 33 m s and the minimum pressure in the center is 975 hpa it made landfall on zhanjiang in guangdong province at approximately 12 30 on august 17th at the time of landing the maximum wind speed near the center was 38 m s and the minimum pressure in the center was 968 hpa at 21 30 on the 17th it landed again on the china vietnam coast and began to weaken and gradually dissipated on the 18th the typhoon kai tak caused heavy rainfall in most parts of southern china and caused floods and other disasters leading to serious losses in the affected areas 3 model validation 3 1 typhoon track fig 5 shows the track of typhoon kai tak in two simulation experiments one uses only the atmospheric model wrf exp wrf and the other the coupled wrf roms model exp cwr from the simulation results the typhoon tracks obtained under the two experiments are similar and correlate with the measured results however starting at 00 00 on the 16th the typhoon moving speed in the simulations of both experiments are slower than the measured results at 00 00 on the 17th it was actually observed that the typhoon center had landed and the numerical calculation results indicated a 3 6 h delay compared to the actual observations the typhoon track difference between the measured results and the two simulation experiments has been shown in fig 6 it can be seen from the figure that the track error is small in the early stage of the typhoon that is from 00 00 on the 15th to 00 00 on the 16th the path error obtained by the two experiments is within 15 km once the typhoon moved to the north and center of the south china sea the typhoon speed slowed in the two simulation results which lead to more simulated error the maximum simulation track error exceeded 60 km however the simulation results of the typhoon track for the kai tak is somewhat consistent with the measured results the difference in time and the resulting track error can be accepted by the numerical simulation 3 2 typhoon intensity and strength the comparison of calculated and observed wind speed at the observation station in fig 4 has been shown in fig 7 which compares the wind speed simulation results for the two different experiments it can be seen from fig 7 that in the coupled wrf roms model exp cwr the trend of the typhoon wind speed at the observation point is equivalent to the calculated value in the period of maximum and decreasing wind speed the calculated value of wind speed by the coupled model exp cwr is reduced relative to the exp wrf scheme only wrf model and the calculation result is closer to the observation value the wrf only case blue line contains larger errors than the coupled wrf roms case red line which was not a strong attempt to correct the track and intensity with strong data nudging rather a commitment to investigate the variability that develops as additional physics are activated the coupled wrf roms case allowed sst from roms to affect the atmosphere which then created a slight adjustment of the track the coupled model can improve the problem of larger wind speed simulated by the wrf model fig 8 shows the change of the minimum sea level pressure slp in the typhoon center over time for the two different experiments it can be seen from the figure that during the typhoon movement the minimum slp in the typhoon center continued to decrease in the 54th hour 2012 08 17 06 00 00 utc sea level pressure reached the lowest level approaching 960 hpa since then the intensity decreased and the minimum slp increased due to the landing of the typhoon as can be seen from the figure the curve slope of the rising phase is larger during the typhoon processes over time which indicates the typhoon pressure recovery rate after landing is greater than the typhoon pressure when the typhoon moves on the sea region the slp difference comparison of the two simulation experiments and the observation has been shown in fig 9 it can be found that the value of the simulation result minus the observation result is negative after the 24 h this indicates that the sea level pressure of the simulation result is less than the actual pressure showing that the intensity of simulation result is greater than the observation this is the same as the simulation results of the typhoon wind speed because the moving speed of typhoon in the simulation model is slower the simulated intensity is also stronger than the observation comparing the results of exp cwr exp wrf and the observation it can be seen that under the two different experimental scenarios the development trend of typhoon intensity error is quiet in the later stage of the typhoon process the simulation error slightly increases but the difference between the simulation value of the slp and the observation value is at a range of 10 hpa the simulation results of the coupled scheme exp cwr are better than those of the wrf only scheme exp wrf and they more accurately reflect the development and evolution of the typhoon sea level and dynamic processes and can simulate the intensity and strength of the typhoon kai tak 4 results and discussions 4 1 wind and pressure field fig 10 shows the spatial distribution of wind field at 10m and pressure field obtained by the coupled wrf roms model during the influence of typhoon kai tak it records that kai tak moved from the northern philippines to the south china sea as well as the process of the changing wind field and pressure field the arrows in the figure indicates the speed vector at 10 m and the color indicates the pressure value as can be seen from the figure after the kai tak moved to the south china sea region the cyclonic wind field had significantly increased and the wind speed was always maintained above 30 m s after landing in guangdong the wind field strength rapid declined from the spatial distribution of the wind field the wind speed on the right side of the typhoon center is significantly greater than the wind speed on the left side which is due to the influence of coriolis force it can also be seen in fig 10 that the pressure of the typhoon center was significantly reduced during the process of moving northwest after typhoon kai tak entered the south china sea from the northern philippines at 6 00 on august 16 the typhoon center pressure was less than 980 hpa during the typhoon movement the pressure in the center of the typhoon continued to decrease and the minimum was less than 970 hpa the pressure in the center of the typhoon began to rapidly rise after making landfall from the figure it can be seen that the center of the typhoon wind field is basically consistent with the center of the pressure field the only exception in the pressure gradient on the right side of the track is larger than the left side and the spatial distribution of the pressure field along the typhoon track is relatively symmetrical the shear stress at the sea air interface due to the strong rotation of the air during the influence of typhoon is one of the important relationships between within the sea air interaction fig 11 shows the spatial distribution of the shear stress components in the latitude direction surface u momentum stress and longitude direction surface v momentum stress over the north of the south china sea during the impact of the typhoon kai tak at 12 00 on the august 16 2012 the shear stress was about 3 n m2 in the latitude direction and slightly larger at the longitude direction is about 4 n m2 with the development of the typhoon the intensity of typhoon increased at 00 00 on august 17 2012 the shear stress of the sea surface in the latitude direction increased to 4 n m2 or more and the surface v momentum stress increased to 5 n m2 4 2 storm surge fig 12 shows the change of water level in the north of the south china sea under the influence of typhoon kai tak in the coupled wrf roms model to facilitate comparison the water level at each time is subtracted from the astronomical tide level before the typhoon is affected to obtain the results of storm surge under the influence of the typhoon kai tak as shown in fig 13 it can be seen from fig 13 that starting from 00 00 on august 16 2012 under the influence of the typhoon kai tak the northern south china sea region began to produce a higher storm surge with the development of typhoon kai tak the water level of storm surge will increase at the southwest coast of the pearl river estuary the maximum level of the storm surge will be more than 1 5m the increased water level on the right side of the typhoon track is greater than that on the left side and the spatial distribution of the storm surge is asymmetrical to further analyze the water level change process of storm surge five characteristic positions were selected near the track of typhoon kai tak and the pearl river estuary as shown in fig 14 a to record the changes in the water level fig 14 b f show the evolution of storm surge and typhoon pressure over time for each characteristic position from the figure it can be seen that the time with the maximum value of water level at each characteristic position is synchronized with the time of minimum value of the central pressure and no time lag is shown 4 3 flow field the strong rotating wind field formed by the typhoon above the sea surface will produce a clear wind flow at the sea surface fig 15 shows the flow field of the sea surface in the south china sea during the impact of typhoon kai tak as can be seen from the figure due to the impact of typhoon kai tak the surface currents in the south china sea have undergone significant changes on the sea surface the left side of the typhoon track forms a clear low velocity choke zone red wireframe in fig 15 b and c with a flow velocity of less than 0 2 m s and a local flow velocity even smaller a large horizontal flow velocity is generated on both sides of the choke zone and the direction is opposite the flow velocity on the right side is about twice as large as that on the left side the maximum flow velocity on the right side reaches 2 0 m s which is generated in the tail region of the right rear side of the typhoon the maximum flow velocity on the left side is about 0 8 m s the local flow choke zone is divided into two sides by the boundary line and produced a clear counterclockwise circulation field near the center of the typhoon from fig 15 a c it can be seen that the flow velocity on the right side in the circulation flow field is stronger than the flow velocity on the left side that is the flow field has an asymmetric distribution fig 15 d shows the spatial distribution of pressure at the same time the circle is the center of the typhoon and the triangle represents the center of the circulation flow field as can be seen from the figure the center of the flow field is located at the right rear of the typhoon center and the maximum flow velocity is also located at the right rear of the center of the typhoon therefore the wind flow field has significant lag time 4 4 sea surface temperature the sea surface temperature sst will be significantly reduced under the influence of the typhoon fig 16 shows the evolution of sst in the south china sea by the coupled wrf roms model during the impact of typhoon kai tak fig 17 shows the change variation distribution of the sea surface temperature in the south china sea relative to that before the typhoon which is the reference time at 00 00 on august 15 2012 as can be seen from fig 17 at 06 00 on the august 15 2012 utc the surface water is receiving external heat from factors such as solar radiation resulting in an increase in sea surface temperature where the sea surface temperature of the nearshore has increased by 4 c before the typhoon kai tak from 12 00 on the august 15 utc sea surface temperature began to cool at 00 00 on august 16 2012 due to the impact of the typhoon kai tak the temperature of the sea surrounding the typhoon center dropped significantly and the maximum temperature dropped more than 4 c the reduction of sea surface temperature under the influence of typhoon shows a clear asymmetrical distribution that is the temperature drop on the right side of the typhoon track is significantly larger than that on the left side as can be seen from fig 17 the temperature in the right side of the typhoon track can be cooled to more than 4 c while the temperature in the left side of the typhoon track is about 2 c to further analyze the changing characteristic of sst under the influence of typhoon as shown in fig 18 a five characteristic positions were selected around the typhoon track and the sea surface middle and bottom temperature and local pressure changes over time were plotted in fig 18 b f at the initial stage of the typhoon impact due to the influence of solar radiation and other factors on the sea water heat transfer was performed with the outside resulting in a cyclical rise and fall in sea surface temperature especially in the nearshore positions p1 and p2 fig 18 b and c are shown in red dashed wireframes the sea surface temperature in each characteristic position has dropped and was affected by the typhoon in the deep sea positions p3 p4 and p5 the sea surface temperature has dropped by more than 3 c and the sea surface temperature in nearshore positions p1 and p2 has dropped by more than 1 c this is due to the fact that under the influence of typhoon the strong mixing in the typhoon process results in large velocity shear at the bottom of the ocean mixed layer the cool water located in the lower layer of the ocean rises and become upwelling under the influence of pumping the cool water and the upper layer warm water mixing causes the temperature of the mixed layer water to cool in terms of time the decrease of the seawater temperature delays behind the moment when the atmospheric pressure extreme occurs that is the seawater temperature has a time lag in response to the typhoon 4 5 mixed layer depth during the impact of typhoon the depth of ocean mixed layer mixed layer depth mld will change significantly fig 19 shows the results of the mixed layer depth based on the two experiments respectively exp roms only roms model and the exp cwr coupled wrf roms model the mixed layer depth is calculated using the method by lorbacher et al 2006 in exp roms the mixed layer depth under the forcing condition from the astronomical tide during typhoon kai tak was calculated while in the exp cwr the mixed layer depth under influence of typhoon kai tak was calculated using the coupled atmosphere ocean model as can be seen from fig 19 the distribution of mixed layer depth under the influence of the astronomical tide at different times is relatively stable due to the influence of tides and coastal ocean currents in the nearshore the mixed layer depth can reach about 10 m outside the 1000 m isobath the mixed layer depth can reach about 60 m due to the larger depth of the water in the experiment of the coupled wrf roms model the spatial distribution of the mixed layer depth under the influence of typhoon kai tak changed significantly it can be seen from the figure that the mixed layer depth in the coupled wrf roms model under the influence of the typhoon is significantly greater than the mixed layer depth under the influence of the astronomical tide because the typhoon caused a strong vortex shedding force and triggered a strong ekman pumping the mixed layer depth near the typhoon track was large in the region within 100 m isobath the mixed layer depth can reach more than 60 m and that means almost all water in this region is mixed influenced by the typhoon 4 6 heat fluxes heat flux is an important method for heat exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean during a typhoon which is divided into latent heat and sensible heat latent heat flux is the release of latent heat due to the vaporization of water vapor which is the heat generated by vaporization of water vapor from the ocean surface and the value of latent heat flux is negative sensible heat flux is the heat exchange generated due to the temperature difference of sea and air and the value of sensible heat flux can be positive or negative a positive value indicates that the ocean transfers heat to the atmosphere and a negative value indicates that the atmosphere transfers heat to the ocean fig 20 shows the spatial distribution of the latent heat flux obtained by the coupled wrf roms model at different times in the northern south china sea during typhoon kai tak it can be seen from the figure that the extremum position of latent heat flux occurs near the center of the typhoon and can reach about 500 w m2 in the nearshore region the latent heat flux when the typhoon is landing can exceed 600 w m2 fig 21 shows the results of the sensible heat flux distribution at the corresponding time under the same conditions in the northern south china sea during typhoon kai tak it can be seen from the figure that the extremum position of the sensible heat flux also appears near the center of the typhoon and is a negative value which is about 100 w m2 in the center of the typhoon center and 100 km around the center the sensible heat flux is positive and the sensible heat flux of 100 km around the center of the typhoon center is about 50 w m2 through the comparison of latent heat flux and sensible heat flux it can be seen that the heat exchange at the sea air interface comes primarily from latent heat during the impact of typhoon kai tak the heat exchange at the air sea interface is very strong under the influence of typhoon the latent heat generated by water vapor evaporation plays a dominant role in the heat exchange at the air sea interface which shows that the heat carried by the vaporization of the sea surface is one of the important factors for the decrease of seawater temperature under the influence of the typhoon 5 conclusions a coupled atmosphere ocean model in the south china sea was established based on the mesoscale atmospheric model wrf and the regional ocean model roms the gshhs shoreline data and the etopo1 depth data have been used in this model the harmonic constants of the roms model are derived from the otis model provided from oregon state university the surface stress sensible heat flux latent heat flux shortwave radiation flux and longwave radiation flux calculated by wrf and delivered to roms through mct while the sst calculated by roms is feedback to the wrf through mct based on the two way coupled wrf roms model the atmosphere and ocean dynamics in the south china sea induced by typhoon kai tak has been calculated and the relationship between sea air interaction has been analyzed the typhoon track intensity and strength have been calculated from the coupled model and are compared with the observation results the verification results show that the typhoon track error is controlled within a range of 60 km and the calculated typhoon intensity and strength is slightly larger than the observation result from the spatial distribution of the wind field the wind speed air pressure and wind driven flow field on the right side of the typhoon center is significantly stronger than the left side which is due to the influence of coriolis force wind driven flow field has obvious lag in time sea surface temperature has an asymmetrical distribution in space and has lag in time the heat exchange at the air sea interface is very strong under the influence of typhoon the latent heat generated by water vapor evaporation plays a dominant role in the heat exchange at the

22947,the typhoon kai tak that occurred in august 2012 produced strong winds heavy rain extreme wave and storm surge which also had a significant impact on the coastal areas of china and vietnam studying the formation and tracking the movement mechanism of this typhoon will help reduce future coastal disasters as well as have important scientific significance the impact of a typhoon creates strong mass transport and energy exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean which produces a strong interaction between the wind field and the flow field a coupled atmosphere ocean model in the south china sea was established based on the mesoscale atmospheric model wrf and the regional ocean model roms typhoon kai tak was simulated using this model the simulation results show that the coupled wrf roms model indicate high simulation accuracy with respect of storm surge in the south china sea under the influence of typhoon kai tak the simulation results also reveal the temporal and spatial distribution of typhoon kai tak s field storm surge and wind induced flow fields the spatial asymmetry and time lag in the spatial temporal distribution of sea surface temperature during typhoon kai tak have been discussed the heat exchange at the air sea interface was very strong under the influence of typhoon kai tak and the latent heat generated by water vapor evaporation plays a dominant role in the heat exchange at the air sea interface which shows that the heat carried by the vaporization of the sea surface is one of the important factors for the decrease of sea temperature under the influence of a typhoon keywords storm surge typhoon coupled atmosphere ocean model sea air interaction wrf roms 1 introduction the northwest pacific and the south china sea region are the birthplaces of most monsoons and typhoons and are an important channel for the generation and transmission of water vapor chia and ropelewski 2002 wang et al 2007 sun et al 2017 wu et al 2018 the northwest pacific plays a major role in regulating interdecadal and long term changes in climate hu et al 2015 xie et al 2016 china is the region with the largest number of typhoons and the most destructive power affected by typhoons in the world liu et al 2009 china is also one of the countries with the most serious marine and meteorological disasters in the context of global warming the probability of occurrence of extreme weather events has continuously increased and have caused a large degree of impact on the offshore areas wang et al 2010 compared with large scale phenomena such as global climate change small and medium scale phenomena such as typhoons and thunderstorms have an even greater impact on people s production and life yang et al 2018 typhoons and hurricanes present some of the greatest threats to life and damage to property mooney et al 2019 the influence of a typhoon on a region is often not only a heavy wind disaster at the same time the heavy rain extreme waves storm surges and beach erosion yang et al 2015 ge et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 mei et al 2018 that are produced will also have a huge impact on the region which will result in the formation of a typhoon disaster chain lee 2006 wu et al 2019 therefore studying the movement mechanism of typhoon accurately forecasting the influence of typhoon and reducing storm surge disasters have important social value for the protection of national economic development and human and property safety the current problem of marine environmental forecasting is attempting to predict the impact of such extreme weather due to the relative lack of marine data research on such issues mainly relies on numerical simulations scholars have developed a variety of models for forecasting storm surge as early as 1972 jelesnianski developed the splash model followed by the slosh model jelesnianski et al 1992 which was widely used in storm surge simulation in seas lakes and on land forbes et al 2014 hu et al 2015 neumann et al 2015 blumberg and mellor 1987 developed the pom model to simulate large scale ocean and coastal water levels and flow field changes xie et al 2004 li et al 2013 many ocean models have been developed and used for the simulation of storm surges such as the ecom model di et al 2011 blumberg et al 2015 roms model li et al 2006 you et al 2010 ch3d ims model sheng et al 2010 cest model zhang et al 2013 selfe model zhang and baptista 2008 delft3d model vu and lam 2005 adcirc model mattocks and forbes 2008 sebastian et al 2014 and fvcom model weisberg and zheng 2006 rego and li 2010 chen et al 2018 they have achieved very good results and laid the foundation for understanding the dynamic mechanism of storm surges there is a strong mass transport energy exchange and interaction between the atmosphere and the ocean during a typhoon black et al 2007 the physics fields such as the wind field flow field and wave field influence each other and restrict each other the forcing effect of the atmosphere on the ocean mainly includes wind stress pressure heat flux and solar radiation on the sea surface additionally the upper ocean responds to the atmospheric effects and its response results in atmospheric dynamics processes the role of the oceans in the atmosphere mainly includes two aspects first changes in the sea surface temperature sst lead to changes in the sea surface heat flux which affects the movement of the atmosphere second changes in the sea surface flow field cause the wind stress at the bottom of the atmosphere to change and affect the atmosphere movement structure liu et al 2010 during the evolution of storm surge induced by a typhoon there are many factors including the influence of different spatial and temporal scales and different physical factors such as wind speed air pressure runoff wave and astronomical tide and others which makes it difficult to accurately simulate storm surges mori et al 2014 takagi et al 2017 yin et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the development of a coupled atmospheric and ocean model had significant effects on improving the accuracy of numerical prediction liu et al 2015 yang and haas 2015 gronholz et al 2017 the establishment of a coupled atmosphere and ocean model is an effective method to solve this problem mesoscale meteorological models such as the mm5 model wang et al 2017 or the wrf model warner et al 2010 zambon et al 2014 pattanayak et al 2016 lakshmi et al 2017 were used to provide high accuracy and precision of wind and pressure field for the ocean model by establishing a coupled atmosphere and ocean model the sea air interface information exchange was achieved and the simulation accuracy of storm surge was improved the coupled wrf roms model in the south china sea has been established using the model coupling toolkit mct the mesoscale atmospheric model wrf and the regional ocean model roms based on the coawst modeling system in this study typhoon kai tak and storm surge were simulated based on this coupled model the characteristics of atmospheric motion and flow movement in the south china sea under the influence of typhoon were calculated the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of the storm surge in the south china sea were analyzed in this study 2 methodology and data 2 1 numerical tools 2 1 1 wrf atmospheric module the wrf weather research and forecasting model is the latest generation of mesoscale meteorological model jointly developed by research institutes such as the ncar national center for atmospheric research and ncep national centers for environmental prediction version v1 0 of the wrf model was released in november 2000 and the version 3 9 1 released on august 2017 have been used to simulate typhoon in this study the wrf model can be used to simulate climate change atmospheric motion and air quality at different scales such as global and regional scales it can also be used for simulation of typhoon or hurricane and atmosphere and ocean interaction the wrf model has a wide range of applications in different field and become the most popular mesoscale atmosphere model now the wrf model includes two different frameworks arw the advanced research wrf and nmm the non hydrostatic mesoscale model which maintained and developed by the ncar and ncep respectively the arw framework in the wrf model is used in this study this model adopts a fully compressible non hydrostatic model with arakawa c grid in the horizontal direction and terrain following quality coordinates in the vertical direction laprise 1992 2 1 2 roms oceanic module the regional ocean model system roms is one of the most advanced ocean model systems in the world the roms model adopts the stretched terrain following coordinates in the vertical direction which can properly describe the influence of the topography in the vertical direction non equal scale stratification can be used which can get higher simulation accuracy at the thermocline and the bottom boundary layer the momentum equations of roms model are as shown in eqs 1 3 haidvogel et al 2008 1 h z u t u h z u x v h z u y w h z u s f h z v h z ρ 0 p x h z g η x s u w

effectively simulate the ocean dynamic process under the influence of typhoon the mesoscale atmospheric model wrf and the regional ocean model roms was coupled based on the model coupling toolkit mct craig et al 2005 and the interaction between the ocean and typhoon has been considered in this study a coupled atmosphere and ocean model in the south china sea has been established the schematic diagram of the coupled model system is shown in fig 1 based on coawst modeling system warner et al 2008 it can be seen from the figure that there is a two way coupling between the wrf and roms model that is the surface stress net heat fluxes and sensible heat flux latent heat flux shortwave radiation flux and longwave radiation flux calculated by wrf and delivered to roms through the mct coupler while the sea surface temperature sst calculated by roms is feedback to the wrf through the mct coupler in summary the sea surface temperature can affect the intensity of the typhoon is a opinion easy to understand the asymmetric distribution of sea surface temperature affects the thermal radiation process and heat flux exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere thus affecting the water vapor exchange process the result of these dynamic processes is that the intensity of the typhoon changes for example if the ocean is warmer and the sea surface temperature is higher during the typhoon movement the typhoon can get more energy from the ocean and at the same time strengthen the exchange of water vapor at the sea air interface resulting in an increase in the intensity of the typhoon which will lead to an increase in storm surge 2 2 basic data and initial and boundary conditions the shoreline data comes from the global self consistent hierarchical high resolution shorelines gshhs

simulation time includes the entire process of development and movement of kai tak in the south china sea region from 2012 to 08 15 00 00 to 2012 08 18 06 00 the simulation domains are the south china sea and the near region as shown in fig 3 the wrf parent domain is from 0 n 100 e to 32 n 132 5 e the wrf child domain is from 12 n 103 e to 26 n 131 e the roms parent domain is from 3 n 105 e to 28 n 131 5 e and the roms child domain is from 12 5 n 105 5 e to 24 n 117 e the yellow and blue wireframes represent the parent and child simulation domains of the wrf and roms respectively the physical and parameterization schemes for typhoon kai tak in the wrf are as follows the gird resolution in horizontal direction using a two way nesting grid of 15 km and 5 km 35 layers has been taken in the vertical direction and the maximum top pressure recommended 2000pa the wsm6 parameterization scheme and kain fritsch scheme has been selected for the microphysical parameterization schemes and cumulus parameterization schemes respectively and the ysu scheme has been used for the boundary layer scheme in the wrf model the configuration of these parameterization schemes refers from some results of previous scholars chen et al 2015 islam et al 2015 the initial conditions are provided by the global forecast model gfs fnl data of the ncep which has a time accuracy of 6 h and a spatial accuracy of 1 the d1 model parent model outputs the results every 180 min and the d2 model child model outputs the results every 60 min the ocean model roms uses two way nesting grids with 170 170 nodes parent grid and 225 240 nodes child grid the grid size between parent grid and child grid is 3 1 which are 15 km 15 km and 5 km 5 km respectively the parent model encompasses the entire south china sea and nearby sea regions and the child model mainly includes the central and north of the south china sea as shown in fig 3 the vertical layer of the double grid is 16 layers and the vertical coordinate stretching parameters theta s 5 0 theta b 0 4 that is the sea surface and bottom layer are improved resolution in this study the atmospheric model has a spatial extent that covers most of the continental south china south china sea thailand gulf malay archipelago and philippine islands the atmospheric grid is large enough to provide surface forcing for the ocean model but the ocean model grids are rotated and with differing cell sizes the interpolation is required to transfer data between these grids to allow the models to exchange data fields on different grids we use the spherical coordinate remapping interpolation package scrip jones 1998 to compute interpolation weights the weights are computed as a pre processing step they are read in during initialization and used in the sparse matrix interpolation as described in warner et al 2008 currently we use the nearest neighbor method to compute the weights in the roms model as shown in fig 3 the east west south and north boundaries of the parent model are all set as open boundaries the harmonic constants for the eight main tidal of m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 and q1 obtained from the china seas and indonesia 2016 scheme in otis according to the mesh division of the roms model the value of the open boundary point in the model is interpolated by the osu tidal prediction software otps and the water level forecast value is obtained through the t predic function and the obtained water level is used as the open boundary of the roms model to drive the west and north boundaries of the child model are set as closed boundary and the boundary conditions on the south and east are provided by the parent model the water level forecast in the parent model is calculated according to the following formula 7 ζ i 1 n f i h i cos ω i t v 0 i u i g i where ζ is the water level h i g i ω i respectively represents the amplitude the late angle and the angular velocity of the i th component tide f i is the intersection point factor of the tidal component u i is the correction angle of the tidal point intersection and v 0 i is the astronomical initial phase of the tidal range the mid bottom friction coefficient is taken as 0 0015 and the horizontal mixing coefficient is taken as 0 1 in this study the coupled wrf roms model simulate start at 2012 08 15 00 00 utc and ended at 2012 08 18 06 00 utc for a total of 78 h including entering processes of landing and leaving of typhoon kai tak in the south china sea the time step of the atmosphere model wrf is set to 60 s and the timestep of the parent and child ocean model roms is set to 60 s and 20 s respectively the time step of the mct synchronization is set to 600 s 2 4 selection of typhoon typhoon kai tak 201213 formed a tropical depression in the eastern sea of the philippines on the evening of august 12 2012 it reached the southeast of taiwan 16 9 n 127 8 e at about 08 00 on the 13th and continued to strengthen the maximum wind speed reached 18 m s or more and the minimum air pressure was 998 hpa it moved northwestward at a speed of about 10 km h and gradually approached the southern coast of taiwan the track of typhoon kai tak is shown in fig 4 at 05 00 on august 16 2012 it strengthened to typhoon level over the north of the south china sea at 06 00 the center of typhoon was in the south of zhanjiang guangdong province 18 7 n 118 2 e the maximum wind speed near the center was more than 33 m s and the minimum pressure in the center is 975 hpa it made landfall on zhanjiang in guangdong province at approximately 12 30 on august 17th at the time of landing the maximum wind speed near the center was 38 m s and the minimum pressure in the center was 968 hpa at 21 30 on the 17th it landed again on the china vietnam coast and began to weaken and gradually dissipated on the 18th the typhoon kai tak caused heavy rainfall in most parts of southern china and caused floods and other disasters leading to serious losses in the affected areas 3 model validation 3 1 typhoon track fig 5 shows the track of typhoon kai tak in two simulation experiments one uses only the atmospheric model wrf exp wrf and the other the coupled wrf roms model exp cwr from the simulation results the typhoon tracks obtained under the two experiments are similar and correlate with the measured results however starting at 00 00 on the 16th the typhoon moving speed in the simulations of both experiments are slower than the measured results at 00 00 on the 17th it was actually observed that the typhoon center had landed and the numerical calculation results indicated a 3 6 h delay compared to the actual observations the typhoon track difference between the measured results and the two simulation experiments has been shown in fig 6 it can be seen from the figure that the track error is small in the early stage of the typhoon that is from 00 00 on the 15th to 00 00 on the 16th the path error obtained by the two experiments is within 15 km once the typhoon moved to the north and center of the south china sea the typhoon speed slowed in the two simulation results which lead to more simulated error the maximum simulation track error exceeded 60 km however the simulation results of the typhoon track for the kai tak is somewhat consistent with the measured results the difference in time and the resulting track error can be accepted by the numerical simulation 3 2 typhoon intensity and strength the comparison of calculated and observed wind speed at the observation station in fig 4 has been shown in fig 7 which compares the wind speed simulation results for the two different experiments it can be seen from fig 7 that in the coupled wrf roms model exp cwr the trend of the typhoon wind speed at the observation point is equivalent to the calculated value in the period of maximum and decreasing wind speed the calculated value of wind speed by the coupled model exp cwr is reduced relative to the exp wrf scheme only wrf model and the calculation result is closer to the observation value the wrf only case blue line contains larger errors than the coupled wrf roms case red line which was not a strong attempt to correct the track and intensity with strong data nudging rather a commitment to investigate the variability that develops as additional physics are activated the coupled wrf roms case allowed sst from roms to affect the atmosphere which then created a slight adjustment of the track the coupled model can improve the problem of larger wind speed simulated by the wrf model fig 8 shows the change of the minimum sea level pressure slp in the typhoon center over time for the two different experiments it can be seen from the figure that during the typhoon movement the minimum slp in the typhoon center continued to decrease in the 54th hour 2012 08 17 06 00 00 utc sea level pressure reached the lowest level approaching 960 hpa since then the intensity decreased and the minimum slp increased due to the landing of the typhoon as can be seen from the figure the curve slope of the rising phase is larger during the typhoon processes over time which indicates the typhoon pressure recovery rate after landing is greater than the typhoon pressure when the typhoon moves on the sea region the slp difference comparison of the two simulation experiments and the observation has been shown in fig 9 it can be found that the value of the simulation result minus the observation result is negative after the 24 h this indicates that the sea level pressure of the simulation result is less than the actual pressure showing that the intensity of simulation result is greater than the observation this is the same as the simulation results of the typhoon wind speed because the moving speed of typhoon in the simulation model is slower the simulated intensity is also stronger than the observation comparing the results of exp cwr exp wrf and the observation it can be seen that under the two different experimental scenarios the development trend of typhoon intensity error is quiet in the later stage of the typhoon process the simulation error slightly increases but the difference between the simulation value of the slp and the observation value is at a range of 10 hpa the simulation results of the coupled scheme exp cwr are better than those of the wrf only scheme exp wrf and they more accurately reflect the development and evolution of the typhoon sea level and dynamic processes and can simulate the intensity and strength of the typhoon kai tak 4 results and discussions 4 1 wind and pressure field fig 10 shows the spatial distribution of wind field at 10m and pressure field obtained by the coupled wrf roms model during the influence of typhoon kai tak it records that kai tak moved from the northern philippines to the south china sea as well as the process of the changing wind field and pressure field the arrows in the figure indicates the speed vector at 10 m and the color indicates the pressure value as can be seen from the figure after the kai tak moved to the south china sea region the cyclonic wind field had significantly increased and the wind speed was always maintained above 30 m s after landing in guangdong the wind field strength rapid declined from the spatial distribution of the wind field the wind speed on the right side of the typhoon center is significantly greater than the wind speed on the left side which is due to the influence of coriolis force it can also be seen in fig 10 that the pressure of the typhoon center was significantly reduced during the process of moving northwest after typhoon kai tak entered the south china sea from the northern philippines at 6 00 on august 16 the typhoon center pressure was less than 980 hpa during the typhoon movement the pressure in the center of the typhoon continued to decrease and the minimum was less than 970 hpa the pressure in the center of the typhoon began to rapidly rise after making landfall from the figure it can be seen that the center of the typhoon wind field is basically consistent with the center of the pressure field the only exception in the pressure gradient on the right side of the track is larger than the left side and the spatial distribution of the pressure field along the typhoon track is relatively symmetrical the shear stress at the sea air interface due to the strong rotation of the air during the influence of typhoon is one of the important relationships between within the sea air interaction fig 11 shows the spatial distribution of the shear stress components in the latitude direction surface u momentum stress and longitude direction surface v momentum stress over the north of the south china sea during the impact of the typhoon kai tak at 12 00 on the august 16 2012 the shear stress was about 3 n m2 in the latitude direction and slightly larger at the longitude direction is about 4 n m2 with the development of the typhoon the intensity of typhoon increased at 00 00 on august 17 2012 the shear stress of the sea surface in the latitude direction increased to 4 n m2 or more and the surface v momentum stress increased to 5 n m2 4 2 storm surge fig 12 shows the change of water level in the north of the south china sea under the influence of typhoon kai tak in the coupled wrf roms model to facilitate comparison the water level at each time is subtracted from the astronomical tide level before the typhoon is affected to obtain the results of storm surge under the influence of the typhoon kai tak as shown in fig 13 it can be seen from fig 13 that starting from 00 00 on august 16 2012 under the influence of the typhoon kai tak the northern south china sea region began to produce a higher storm surge with the development of typhoon kai tak the water level of storm surge will increase at the southwest coast of the pearl river estuary the maximum level of the storm surge will be more than 1 5m the increased water level on the right side of the typhoon track is greater than that on the left side and the spatial distribution of the storm surge is asymmetrical to further analyze the water level change process of storm surge five characteristic positions were selected near the track of typhoon kai tak and the pearl river estuary as shown in fig 14 a to record the changes in the water level fig 14 b f show the evolution of storm surge and typhoon pressure over time for each characteristic position from the figure it can be seen that the time with the maximum value of water level at each characteristic position is synchronized with the time of minimum value of the central pressure and no time lag is shown 4 3 flow field the strong rotating wind field formed by the typhoon above the sea surface will produce a clear wind flow at the sea surface fig 15 shows the flow field of the sea surface in the south china sea during the impact of typhoon kai tak as can be seen from the figure due to the impact of typhoon kai tak the surface currents in the south china sea have undergone significant changes on the sea surface the left side of the typhoon track forms a clear low velocity choke zone red wireframe in fig 15 b and c with a flow velocity of less than 0 2 m s and a local flow velocity even smaller a large horizontal flow velocity is generated on both sides of the choke zone and the direction is opposite the flow velocity on the right side is about twice as large as that on the left side the maximum flow velocity on the right side reaches 2 0 m s which is generated in the tail region of the right rear side of the typhoon the maximum flow velocity on the left side is about 0 8 m s the local flow choke zone is divided into two sides by the boundary line and produced a clear counterclockwise circulation field near the center of the typhoon from fig 15 a c it can be seen that the flow velocity on the right side in the circulation flow field is stronger than the flow velocity on the left side that is the flow field has an asymmetric distribution fig 15 d shows the spatial distribution of pressure at the same time the circle is the center of the typhoon and the triangle represents the center of the circulation flow field as can be seen from the figure the center of the flow field is located at the right rear of the typhoon center and the maximum flow velocity is also located at the right rear of the center of the typhoon therefore the wind flow field has significant lag time 4 4 sea surface temperature the sea surface temperature sst will be significantly reduced under the influence of the typhoon fig 16 shows the evolution of sst in the south china sea by the coupled wrf roms model during the impact of typhoon kai tak fig 17 shows the change variation distribution of the sea surface temperature in the south china sea relative to that before the typhoon which is the reference time at 00 00 on august 15 2012 as can be seen from fig 17 at 06 00 on the august 15 2012 utc the surface water is receiving external heat from factors such as solar radiation resulting in an increase in sea surface temperature where the sea surface temperature of the nearshore has increased by 4 c before the typhoon kai tak from 12 00 on the august 15 utc sea surface temperature began to cool at 00 00 on august 16 2012 due to the impact of the typhoon kai tak the temperature of the sea surrounding the typhoon center dropped significantly and the maximum temperature dropped more than 4 c the reduction of sea surface temperature under the influence of typhoon shows a clear asymmetrical distribution that is the temperature drop on the right side of the typhoon track is significantly larger than that on the left side as can be seen from fig 17 the temperature in the right side of the typhoon track can be cooled to more than 4 c while the temperature in the left side of the typhoon track is about 2 c to further analyze the changing characteristic of sst under the influence of typhoon as shown in fig 18 a five characteristic positions were selected around the typhoon track and the sea surface middle and bottom temperature and local pressure changes over time were plotted in fig 18 b f at the initial stage of the typhoon impact due to the influence of solar radiation and other factors on the sea water heat transfer was performed with the outside resulting in a cyclical rise and fall in sea surface temperature especially in the nearshore positions p1 and p2 fig 18 b and c are shown in red dashed wireframes the sea surface temperature in each characteristic position has dropped and was affected by the typhoon in the deep sea positions p3 p4 and p5 the sea surface temperature has dropped by more than 3 c and the sea surface temperature in nearshore positions p1 and p2 has dropped by more than 1 c this is due to the fact that under the influence of typhoon the strong mixing in the typhoon process results in large velocity shear at the bottom of the ocean mixed layer the cool water located in the lower layer of the ocean rises and become upwelling under the influence of pumping the cool water and the upper layer warm water mixing causes the temperature of the mixed layer water to cool in terms of time the decrease of the seawater temperature delays behind the moment when the atmospheric pressure extreme occurs that is the seawater temperature has a time lag in response to the typhoon 4 5 mixed layer depth during the impact of typhoon the depth of ocean mixed layer mixed layer depth mld will change significantly fig 19 shows the results of the mixed layer depth based on the two experiments respectively exp roms only roms model and the exp cwr coupled wrf roms model the mixed layer depth is calculated using the method by lorbacher et al 2006 in exp roms the mixed layer depth under the forcing condition from the astronomical tide during typhoon kai tak was calculated while in the exp cwr the mixed layer depth under influence of typhoon kai tak was calculated using the coupled atmosphere ocean model as can be seen from fig 19 the distribution of mixed layer depth under the influence of the astronomical tide at different times is relatively stable due to the influence of tides and coastal ocean currents in the nearshore the mixed layer depth can reach about 10 m outside the 1000 m isobath the mixed layer depth can reach about 60 m due to the larger depth of the water in the experiment of the coupled wrf roms model the spatial distribution of the mixed layer depth under the influence of typhoon kai tak changed significantly it can be seen from the figure that the mixed layer depth in the coupled wrf roms model under the influence of the typhoon is significantly greater than the mixed layer depth under the influence of the astronomical tide because the typhoon caused a strong vortex shedding force and triggered a strong ekman pumping the mixed layer depth near the typhoon track was large in the region within 100 m isobath the mixed layer depth can reach more than 60 m and that means almost all water in this region is mixed influenced by the typhoon 4 6 heat fluxes heat flux is an important method for heat exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean during a typhoon which is divided into latent heat and sensible heat latent heat flux is the release of latent heat due to the vaporization of water vapor which is the heat generated by vaporization of water vapor from the ocean surface and the value of latent heat flux is negative sensible heat flux is the heat exchange generated due to the temperature difference of sea and air and the value of sensible heat flux can be positive or negative a positive value indicates that the ocean transfers heat to the atmosphere and a negative value indicates that the atmosphere transfers heat to the ocean fig 20 shows the spatial distribution of the latent heat flux obtained by the coupled wrf roms model at different times in the northern south china sea during typhoon kai tak it can be seen from the figure that the extremum position of latent heat flux occurs near the center of the typhoon and can reach about 500 w m2 in the nearshore region the latent heat flux when the typhoon is landing can exceed 600 w m2 fig 21 shows the results of the sensible heat flux distribution at the corresponding time under the same conditions in the northern south china sea during typhoon kai tak it can be seen from the figure that the extremum position of the sensible heat flux also appears near the center of the typhoon and is a negative value which is about 100 w m2 in the center of the typhoon center and 100 km around the center the sensible heat flux is positive and the sensible heat flux of 100 km around the center of the typhoon center is about 50 w m2 through the comparison of latent heat flux and sensible heat flux it can be seen that the heat exchange at the sea air interface comes primarily from latent heat during the impact of typhoon kai tak the heat exchange at the air sea interface is very strong under the influence of typhoon the latent heat generated by water vapor evaporation plays a dominant role in the heat exchange at the air sea interface which shows that the heat carried by the vaporization of the sea surface is one of the important factors for the decrease of seawater temperature under the influence of the typhoon 5 conclusions a coupled atmosphere ocean model in the south china sea was established based on the mesoscale atmospheric model wrf and the regional ocean model roms the gshhs shoreline data and the etopo1 depth data have been used in this model the harmonic constants of the roms model are derived from the otis model provided from oregon state university the surface stress sensible heat flux latent heat flux shortwave radiation flux and longwave radiation flux calculated by wrf and delivered to roms through mct while the sst calculated by roms is feedback to the wrf through mct based on the two way coupled wrf roms model the atmosphere and ocean dynamics in the south china sea induced by typhoon kai tak has been calculated and the relationship between sea air interaction has been analyzed the typhoon track intensity and strength have been calculated from the coupled model and are compared with the observation results the verification results show that the typhoon track error is controlled within a range of 60 km and the calculated typhoon intensity and strength is slightly larger than the observation result from the spatial distribution of the wind field the wind speed air pressure and wind driven flow field on the right side of the typhoon center is significantly stronger than the left side which is due to the influence of coriolis force wind driven flow field has obvious lag in time sea surface temperature has an asymmetrical distribution in space and has lag in time the heat exchange at the air sea interface is very strong under the influence of typhoon the latent heat generated by water vapor evaporation plays a dominant role in the heat exchange at the

impact velocity and water entry attitude angle the drag coefficient of the cavitating flat projectile undergoes a prominent drop as the penetration increases keywords high speed water entry slender projectile trajectory stability attitude deviation 1 introduction prediction of the trajectory of a high speed projectile in a water column has wide scientific significance and technical application especially for the naval engineering the water entry includes the processes of water splash propagation of pressure waves evolution of the cavity and so on determining the trajectory of the water entry projectile can contribute to the bomb breaching for mine and maritime improvised explosive device ied clearance in surf and very shallow water zones with depth shallower than 12 2 m according to u s navy s standards chu et al 2008 predicting accurate trajectory of the high speed body is difficult due to the complicated hydrodynamic forces and torques a great number of investigations should be devoted to fostering understanding and quantification of the dynamic process of the underwater navigating body since the earliest water entry theory proposed by von karman 1929 a series of subsequent researches has been performed mainly extended upon the von karman s physical picture of the problem to develop mathematical solutions for impact forces acting upon rigid bodies during water entry after world war ii the problem of device failure structural damage bounce and fluttering shown by underwater weapons such as torpedoes caused researchers to pay much attention to the area of hydroballistics and thus the cavity formation growth and missile trajectory may 1975 2015 investigated the vertical entry of torpedoes and found that more energy was transmitted into the production of cavity than what was lost by the projectile with increasing depths he suggested that the difference might be due to the radial motion of the fluid from the cavity wall waugh and stubstad 1975 summarized the research on modeling hydroballistics including different water entry structures and initial conditions in recent years mostafa et al 2001 employed the piv testing method and ccd camera to investigate the cavitating flow and the trajectory of horizontal and vertical water entry of different nosed projectiles kirschner 2001 and hrubes 2001 studied the cavity evolution produced by the projectile with a lager range of impact velocity from subsonic to transonic and supersonic the high speed images showed the stability during the tailslap indicating that the tailslap can keep the stability of the high speed projectile during the stage of the high speed supercavitation guo et al 2012 paid particular attention to the projectile dynamics and the cavity evolution of the horizontal water entry behaviors of different nosed projectiles experimentally and theoretically truscott et al 2009 discussed the projectile dynamics critical entry angle and cavity growth by firing the geometric modified projectile with shallow angles the experiment suggested that the initial disturbance added a rotational angular velocity on the projectile resulting in the tailslap for the low speed projectile with the increasing disturbance he suggested that the performance of the projectile could be improved by decreasing the area of the head to make it match with the cavity truscott et al 2014 studied the effect of the initial rotation speed and surface coating on the vertically water entry of the spherical projectile mirzaei et al 2015 discussed the high speed supercavitating projectile and established the theoretical dynamic model to deal with the projectile movements in the cavity when the tail impacted on the cavity wall chu et al 2008 2011 employed the diagnostic photographic method combined with the experimental data and semi empirical formulas to develop a 6dof trajectory model for the high speed rigid body in a water column where the ocean condition attitude angle ocean surface slope were considered under different surface conditions bodily et al 2014 investigated the forces velocities and trajectories of slender projectiles with different nose shapes and attitude angles using imu embedded inertial measurement unit all the experiment were conducted within a relatively low range of the initial velocity blow 4 m s the shock wave pressure generated by the high speed water entry is not only a significantly determining factor affecting the stability of trajectory but also the main reason for the structural failure this effect is known as hydrodynamic ram which has been studied extensively lundstrom and fung 1976 mcmillen 1945 mcmillen and harvey 1946 contrasting theory analysis and simulation m lee et al 1997 studied shock wave pressure generated by small sphere during water entry and proposed that the acoustic pressure generated by the penetration should be approximatively separated into vertical component and horizontal component swanson and luke 2007 performed impact tests to simulate the hydrodynamic ram effect in which a shadowgraph technique offering an additional comparison by providing visual images of the pressure wave propagation through the liquid they proposed empirical formulas to predict the pressure attenuation along the distance and angle of the spherical shock waves huang et al 2015 studied the propagation and attenuation of the initial shock wave generated by different nosed projectile experimentally and developed a modified empirical formula for the prediction of peak pressure ren et al 2018 studied the hydrodynamic ram effect on the evolution of the cavity and velocity decay of vertical water entry projectiles the characteristic of the shock wave such as rising time patterns of the shock wave and impact velocity was studied extensively mseddonkmoodie et al 2004 nishida and tanaka 2006 varas et al 2011 a few of current studies employed dynamic photographic method to study the dynamic response of the high speed water entry projectile in terms of the pressure profile the trajectory and cavity evolution by considering the effects of nose shapes and attitude angle of projectiles the objective of the present study is to characterize the trajectory of the high speed water entry slender projectile experimentally using the one stage light gas gun system together with the associated mechanisms the trajectory of the projectile including the centroid deviation and deflection of the attitude angle of the projectile are identified and quantified as functions of the nose shape impact velocity and water entry attitude by employing the dynamic photographic method additionally the pressure history generated by hydrodynamic ram effect and the evolution of the cavity are analyzed for the rigid projectile as well 2 experimental setup as shown in fig 1 the impact test is performed with the one stage gas gun system which has a ϕ 6 mm steel launch tube the frame of the water tank is made of high strength steel and the size of the tank is 310 mm 310 mm 660 mm during the test the dimension of the water filled area is identical and the free surface of the water is 60 mm away from the top of the water tube which means the volume of the filling water is 310 mm 310 mm 600 mm at the observation window a 20 mm thick pmma panel is fully clamped to provide enough stiffness to minimize bending and image distortion obtained by the high speed camera the contact between the pmma windows and the container are sealed with a thin silicone bond to avoid fluid leakage white paper with 10 10 mm2 grid is positioned at the back of the tank to calibrate the high speed camera and achieve the position and angle of the tested projectile additionally a protective frame is implemented at the outer of the water tube and the gun muzzle water is carefully poured at atmospheric pressure and room temperature to avoid the air bubbles entering into the water filled tank three different nose shape projectiles are employed in the experiment flat nose shaped projectile hemispherical projectile and ogival nose shaped projectile as depicted in fig 2 the material of the projectiles is 45 steel with full annealing to provide enough strength to avoid plastic deformation during the penetration in order to control the number of the initial variable all the projectiles are 6 mm in diameter and 4 9g in mass a similar and large ratio of length to diameter l d is also appropriate for the projectiles l 24 mm 22 mm and 21 mm for the flat nose shaped projectile hemispherical projectile and ogival nose shaped projectile respectively for the ogival nose shaped projectile the nose shape coefficient ψ caliber radius head crh is defined as ψ s 2r and employed to describe the projectile nose shapes where s is the radius of the arc of the ogival shapes and r is the projectile shank radius guo et al 2012 in this article ψ 1 is adopted for the ogival projectile meanwhile the shape coefficient ψ of the hemispherical and flat projectile is 0 5 and 0 respectively the projectiles used in this paper are regarded as rigid bodies all the projectiles are accelerated by the controlled gas gun to obtain the velocities in the range from 40 to 150 m s measured by the laser velocimeter to capture the dynamic process of the projectile in the water container a photron ultima apx rs is placed at the front of the transparent window of the protective frame the selected frame rate and resolution are 15 000 frames and 1024 848 pixels respectively additionally a pressure transducer kd2009a made in yangzhou china is adopted to record the pressure history of the projectile it can be subjected to the loading ranging from 10 kpa to 10 mpa and work in the fluid such as water and oil normally the transducer is positioned on one side of the water tank and 100 mm below the free surface of water the sensor designed for repeated transient events has specified sensitivity of 3 73 pc mpa and includes natural frequency exceeding 50 khz the major advantage of the pressure transducer compared to other types of pressure sensors is the rising time which is specified by the manufacturer as about 2 5 μs the direction perpendicular to the horizontal plane of the free surface of water is defined as the angle of 0 in this paper fig 2d shows the schematic diagram of trajectory vertical penetration in plane deviation and attitude angle due to the limitation of only one camera all the analysis performed blow is based on the in plane data 3 experimental results and discussion the initial conditions including mass impact velocity attitude angle of the projectiles with different nose shapes are listed in table 1 3 1 pressure history according to the effect of hydrodynamic ram a series of hemispherical pressure waves are generated and experience attenuation along the distance and angle during the water entry of the high speed projectile in the previous study huang et al 2015 the pressure characteristics in terms of the propagation of shock wave the magnitude and attenuation of peak pressure caused by the water entry projectile were discussed in detail in this paper the pressure history of the measured point is recorded fig 3 provides comparative studies of the pressure history for different nosed projectiles with the same initial velocity and the same nosed projectile at different initial velocities respectively fig 3 presents that the pressure histories shown by different cases are similar and a series of pressure waves following the initial shock wave at the same impact velocity the peak pressure shown by the flat projectile is significantly larger than that by the hemispherical projectile due to the different mechanisms of the energy dissipation the dominant energy dissipation of projectile with a sharper nose is the kinetic attenuation during the propagation rather than transmission to the surrounding water that is the reason why the pressure magnitude obtained by the ogival is too small to exhibit in the figure meanwhile the larger contact area with water shown by flat projectile results in a larger duration of the initial shock wave as well as illustrated in fig 3a it is clear that the peak pressure increases with the increasing impact velocity for the projectile with the same nose the detailed qualitative relationship and attenuation of the peak value of initial shock pressure versus the distance and angle from the impact point have been reported in the previous work huang et al 2015 3 2 trajectory stability analysis in the case of water entry of high speed projectile the water in the tank obtains the kinetic energy transferring from the onset of the initial contact of the projectile and water to move around on the initial stage of cavity the trajectory of the projectile exhibits significant instability because of the small wet area caused by the fact that only the nose of the projectile is in contact with water during this time with the penetration of the projectile a moment relative to the center of mass of the projectile aroused by the hydrodynamic force will lead to the rotation and change in the attitude angle of the projectile which will subsequently result in irregular fold of the cavity caused by the contact between the wall of cavity and tail of the projectile hrubes 2001 this tailslap will reinforce the effect of attitude deflection the theoretical analysis of drag lift torque of the water entry projectile has been performed by chu et al 2008 in this section the effects of nose shape impact velocity and water entry attitude on the trajectory of the high speed projectile are discussed experimentally with the diagnostic photographic method 3 2 1 process of vertical water entry fig 4 shows the vertically water entry process of the ogival nose projectile at 101 2 m s including the changing of the attitude angle and the evolution of the cavity after the water splash the projectile experiences a noticeable instability and attitude deflection at initial stage of water entry at 1 07 ms when the tail of the projectile begins to contact the wall of the cavity the clear cavity fold occurs and it does not change its location with the penetration of the projectile showing at the same location at 1 60 ms and 2 20 ms it is can be explained that the water particle on the wall of cavity moves radially with its expansion after that the tail of the projectile remains on the wall of the cavity and the attitude deflection increases with the increasing penetration meanwhile the necking of cavity occurs near the free surface of the water which results in the occurrence of the collapse of the cavitation and the block of the air between outside and cavitation this phenomenon shows a good agreement with the work performed by lee et al 1997 and truscott et al 2014 a clear wake flow appears behind the closed cavity after 1 60 ms when the cavity collapse occurs the projectile is actually reaching the bottom of the tank due to the limitation of the dimension of the water tank the collapse of the cavity is significantly affected by the waves and the rapidly changed boundary conditions of the cavity the complete collapse of the cavity is not captured because of the limitation of the time span of the camera according to the position of centroid obtained from the high speed camera the diagnostic photographic method provides a better understanding of the trajectory stability as shown in fig 4b meanwhile data collection of attitude deflection of the fast moving slender body by the high speed camera is plotted in the figure as well through measuring attitude angle the position of the centroid head and tail of the projectile it is clear that the slender projectile undergoes a significant attitude deflection and a curve trajectory 3 2 2 effect of nose shape the movement of the underwater projectile consists of the translation of centroid and the rotation around the centroid at similar impact velocities the underwater trajectory and attitude deflection of slender projectiles with different noses are compared to study the effect of nose shape on the trajectory stability fig 5 and fig 6 present the underwater penetration of the flat nose and hemispherical projectile at 106 8 m s and 100 0 m s respectively the evolution of cavity of the projectiles experiences the same characteristics as the ogival node projectile shown in fig 4 in fig 5 the entire cavitating sailing of the flat nose projectile undergoes a significant trajectory stability where the curve of the trajectory remains linear and the attitude deflection can be neglected as a comparison the trajectory remains stable at the initial stage of the water entry process with slight attitude deflection after 1 44 ms the trajectory and attitude deflection of hemispherical slender increase with the increasing penetration the irregular cavity fold happens after 2 40 ms whereas both the trajectory and attitude deflection show smaller change than that of the ogival projectile with the similar impact velocity according to the photographs shown in fig 4 and fig 6 the out of plane attitude and trajectory deflection can be observed as well according to the analysis of the images from the high speed camera the relationship between the in plane deviation of the centroid and the attitude angle versus time of the three nosed projectiles with similar impact velocities are plotted in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively according to the largest attitude angle and centroid deflection the result confirms that the ogival projectile has the worst stability of trajectory followed by the hemispherical projectile the flat projectile performs an outstanding stability of trajectory which can be attributed to the larger wet area of the flat slender as it moves through the water because it can help the slender to balance the hydrodynamic force at the interface of the water and head of the projectile with the smallest wet area ogival projectile is subjected to a significant disturbance affecting the stability of the trajectory greatly the curvature of the curves shown in fig 7 and fig 8 indicates that ogival projectile exhibits similar velocity of in plane deflection of centroid and change of attitude angle at the initial stage both of the two parameters experience a rapid increase due to the occurrence of the tailslap after 1 00 ms the effect of tailslap causes the instability of the slender in the form of the change in the in plane deflection of the centroid and the rotation around the centroid the instability of the projectile increases with the increasing penetration due to the continuous disturbance caused by tailslap at the tail and hydrodynamic force at the head therefore the ogival projectile undergoes an 84 rotation and 16 6 mm deflection of centroid at last 3 2 3 effect of impact velocity due to the obvious deflection of trajectory and attitude of the centroid the ogival nose projectile is adopted to study the effect of impact velocity on the trajectory stability fig 9 shows the evolution of the trajectory of the ogival nose projectile with the impact velocity v0 44 0 m s it is clear that the projectile experiences attitude deflection at the initial stage of the penetration the irregular fold of the cavity happens at 1 68 ms followed by the complete necking of cavity at 2 48 ms after it the collapse of the cavity emanates from the free surface to the deep water with the obvious wake flow about 90 rotation happens to the slender body at the end of the test compared with the case of 101 02 m s it is reasonable to confirm that the time span of the important phenomena fold necking and collapse of the cavity decreases with the increasing impact velocity the splash effect is more obvious for the larger impact velocity experiencing the similar change during the initial stage the in plane deviation of the centroid and attitude deflection of the projectile at different impact velocities shown in fig 10 and fig 11 presents that both of them increase with the increasing impact velocity at the same duration it corresponds to the hydrodynamic force work on the projectile and the earlier occurrence of tailslap due to the increasing impact velocity the largest in plane deflection of the centroid increases with the increase of the impact velocity whereas the largest angle of attitude deviation of the projectile with different impact velocities shows a slight difference at the end of the test even if it takes a significantly longer duration for the projectile with lower speed 3 2 4 effect of water entry attitude the water entry of high speed projectiles with a certain attitude angle is a common situation for the application of underwater weapons due to the launch angle wind force et al in order to study the effect of water entry attitude on the trajectory stability and attitude deviation the flat projectiles with different impact velocities are fired into the water tank with a 10 water entry attitude in this section fig 12 presents the evolution of the trajectory and attitude deflection of the flat projectile with a 10 water entry attitude at 67 0 m s the attitude undergoes a process from oblique to vertical a slight deflection of attitude angle occurs at the initial stage of the water entry which does not change obviously until the appearance of the tailslap at 5 0 ms then it begins to increase rapidly after that it is clear that the projectile experiences a rotation which makes it move forward vertically from 5 13 ms to 6 47 ms with the tail of the projectile closing to one side of the cavity wall the vertical attitude of the projectile remains to the end of the test the trajectory is a concave curve which deviates from the initial line with the increasing penetration the time of necking and collapse of the cavity is similar to the vertical case discussed above different from the result shown in fig 5 the flat projectile experiences a significant deflection of the trajectory and attitude angle when it launches into the water with an initial water entry angle as shown in fig 13 and fig 14 three different impact velocities with the same water entry angle are carried out compared with the stability of the trajectory in the vertically water entry case the centroid experiences the deviation at the initial stage of the water entry process and the velocity of the deviation increases obviously with the increase of the impact velocity the attitude of the projectile undergoes a continuous rotation with the increasing penetration which makes the projectile inclination change from one side of the vertical line to another side at the end of the sailing the deflection of the attitude is also sensitive to the impact velocity the main reason makes the projectile with a title water entry angle different from the vertical one can be attributed to the fact that the resultant force of the hydrodynamic force of the head and disturbance of tailslap do not work at the centroid of the slender with the increasing impact energy the resultant force deviating from the centroid makes a more significant influence on the trajectory and attitude of the projectile 3 3 evolution of cavity the evolution of the cavity radius at the point of 50 mm below the free surface of the water for different nosed projectiles with similarly vertical impact velocity is plotted in fig 15 the solid and hollow points in the figure are the measuring radius before and after the complete cavity necking which are discussed above it is clear that the cavity radius goes through a fast increase during the initial stage whereas the cavity radius starts to drop at a slower rate than it increases after the completion of the cavity necking due to the similar wet area and impact velocity the ogival and hemispherical projectiles produce almost same cavity radius and the expansion rate of the initial cavity is almost the same as well with the increasing penetration and deflection of trajectory the cavity radius produced by the hemispherical projectile which has a larger wet area exceeds that by the ogival projectile till the end of the test the cavity radius and its rate of expansion aroused by the flat projectile show larger values during the whole process to obtain the penetration time history and velocity attenuation of the water entry slender projectile with cavity the results provided by the vertical water entry of flat projectile are selected because of the trajectory stability during the whole process the penetration and velocity of the head of the projectile with different impact velocities are obtained from the high speed camera as plotted in fig 16 it is clear that the penetration increases with the increasing impact velocity and time the velocity attenuation which is normalized as v v0 in the figure indicates that the rate of attenuation increases with the increase of impact velocity as well which is likely the result of the increased drag coefficient disregarding the gravity distortion effects during the vertically water entry process the motion equation of the slender body can be obtained from newton s second law 1 m d v p d t 1 2 ρ w a 0 c d v p 2 where m v p and a 0 denote the mass the velocity and the area of the flat projectile respectively ρ w stands for the density of water and c d is the drag coefficient eq 1 can be given as 2 m d v p d t 1 2 c d ρ w v p d x p d t a 0 where x p is the vertical penetration of the projectile integrating eq 2 the drag coefficient is determined as 3 c d 2 m ρ w a 0 x p ln v 0 v p the penetration and velocity of the projectile are functions of time and eq 3 presents the relationship between the drag coefficient and time as well the penetration data x p can be obtained by high speed camera velocity data v p can be calculated by differentiating x p both x p and v p are time related the corresponding drag coefficient will be calculated in time series using eq 3 fig 17 presents the analytical calculations of the drag coefficient time relationship for the flat projectile with three different impact velocities the drag coefficient drops rapidly at the initial stage of water entry and it continuously decreases at a gradual slowing down rate at any time the drag coefficient of the projectile with a higher impact velocity is larger than that with lower impact velocities 4 concluding remarks in the present paper the vertical water entry of the high speed slender projectile has been evaluated experimentally the effect of nose shape impact velocity and water entry attitude of the projectiles on trajectory stability attitude deflection and associated mechanisms is identified and quantified respectively the dynamic photographic method is adopted to depict the underwater trajectory and attitude of the slender projectile the pressure history caused by the hydrodynamic ram effect shows that the peak pressure and duration of the initial shock wave increases with the decreasing shape coefficient ψ for the projectile with different nose shapes the peak pressure produced by the penetration of flat projectile is significantly larger than that by the other two kinds of projectiles because flat projectile transfers a large fraction of the initial kinetic energy to the surrounding water during the water entry process with a larger initial kinetic energy the initial shock wave achieves a larger magnitude of peak pressure after the initial stage of water entry the deflection of trajectory and attitude of the slender projectile is sensitive to the effect of nose shape impact velocity and water entry attitude the flat projectile experiences a vertical trajectory without obvious deviation of attitude angle with the increasing shape coefficient ψ the hemispherical projectile shows small deflection of trajectory and attitude the centroid of the ogival projectile undergoes a significantly curved trajectory and the body exhibits obvious rotation around the centroid this deflection increases rapidly after the occurrence of the irregular fold on the cavity wall the effect of nose shape on the trajectory and attitude of the water entry projectile with similar impact velocities mainly corresponds to the wet area of the head of the projectile during the penetration the body with a large wet area such as the flat projectile can help the slender balance the hydrodynamic force at the interface of the water and head of the projectile once the projectile with small shape coefficient deviates from the vertical path at the initial stage the continuous disturbance caused by tailslap at the tail and hydrodynamic force at the head will make the instability of the projectile increase with the increasing penetration for the same nosed projectile the in plane deviation of the centroid and attitude deflection increase as the impact velocity increases which is likely the result of the hydrodynamic force work on the nose and the earlier occurrence of tailslap due to the increasing impact velocity the largest angle of attitude deviation of the projectile with different impact velocities shows a slight difference at the end of the test even if it takes a significantly longer duration for the lower speed projectile compared with the trajectory stability in the vertically water entry case the centroid and the attitude angle experience in plane deviation initiating from the beginning of the water entry process the rate of the deviation increases obviously with the increase of the impact velocity the main reason can be attributed to the fact that the resultant force of the hydrodynamic force of the head and disturbance of tailslap do not work at the centroid of the slender with the increasing impact energy the resultant force deviating from the centroid makes a more significant influence on the trajectory and attitude of the projectile the cavity radius and its evolution significantly depend on the nose shape during the process of cavitating sailing the attenuation rate of the velocity increases with the increasing impact velocity due to the drag coefficient which decreases as the time grows especially at the initial stage of the water entry

with the largest nose shape coefficient shows significant instability of trajectory and attitude deflection for the same type of projectile the trajectory instability increases with the increasing impact velocity and water entry attitude angle the drag coefficient of the cavitating flat projectile undergoes a prominent drop as the penetration increases keywords high speed water entry slender projectile trajectory stability attitude deviation 1 introduction prediction of the trajectory of a high speed projectile in a water column has wide scientific significance and technical application especially for the naval engineering the water entry includes the processes of water splash propagation of pressure waves evolution of the cavity and so on determining the trajectory of the water entry projectile can contribute to the bomb breaching for mine and maritime improvised explosive device ied clearance in surf and very shallow water zones with depth shallower than 12 2 m according to u s navy s standards chu et al 2008 predicting accurate trajectory of the high speed body is difficult due to the complicated hydrodynamic forces and torques a great number of investigations should be devoted to fostering understanding and quantification of the dynamic process of the underwater navigating body since the earliest water entry theory proposed by von karman 1929 a series of subsequent researches has been performed mainly extended upon the von karman s physical picture of the problem to develop mathematical solutions for impact forces acting upon rigid bodies during water entry after world war ii the problem of device failure structural damage bounce and fluttering shown by underwater weapons such as torpedoes caused researchers to pay much attention to the area of hydroballistics and thus the cavity formation growth and missile trajectory may 1975 2015 investigated the vertical entry of torpedoes and found that more energy was transmitted into the production of cavity than what was lost by the projectile with increasing depths he suggested that the difference might be due to the radial motion of the fluid from the cavity wall waugh and stubstad 1975 summarized the research on modeling hydroballistics including different water entry structures and initial conditions in recent years mostafa et al 2001 employed the piv testing method and ccd camera to investigate the cavitating flow and the trajectory of horizontal and vertical water entry of different nosed projectiles kirschner 2001 and hrubes 2001 studied the cavity evolution produced by the projectile with a lager range of impact velocity from subsonic to transonic and supersonic the high speed images showed the stability during the tailslap indicating that the tailslap can keep the stability of the high speed projectile during the stage of the high speed supercavitation guo et al 2012 paid particular attention to the projectile dynamics and the cavity evolution of the horizontal water entry behaviors of different nosed projectiles experimentally and theoretically truscott et al 2009 discussed the projectile dynamics critical entry angle and cavity growth by firing the geometric modified projectile with shallow angles the experiment suggested that the initial disturbance added a rotational angular velocity on the projectile resulting in the tailslap for the low speed projectile with the increasing disturbance he suggested that the performance of the projectile could be improved by decreasing the area of the head to make it match with the cavity truscott et al 2014 studied the effect of the initial rotation speed and surface coating on the vertically water entry of the spherical projectile mirzaei et al 2015 discussed the high speed supercavitating projectile and established the theoretical dynamic model to deal with the projectile movements in the cavity when the tail impacted on the cavity wall chu et al 2008 2011 employed the diagnostic photographic method combined with the experimental data and semi empirical formulas to develop a 6dof trajectory model for the high speed rigid body in a water column where the ocean condition attitude angle ocean surface slope were considered under different surface conditions bodily et al 2014 investigated the forces velocities and trajectories of slender projectiles with different nose shapes and attitude angles using imu embedded inertial measurement unit all the experiment were conducted within a relatively low range of the initial velocity blow 4 m s the shock wave pressure generated by the high speed water entry is not only a significantly determining factor affecting the stability of trajectory but also the main reason for the structural failure this effect is known as hydrodynamic ram which has been studied extensively lundstrom and fung 1976 mcmillen 1945 mcmillen and harvey 1946 contrasting theory analysis and simulation m lee et al 1997 studied shock wave pressure generated by small sphere during water entry and proposed that the acoustic pressure generated by the penetration should be approximatively separated into vertical component and horizontal component swanson and luke 2007 performed impact tests to simulate the hydrodynamic ram effect in which a shadowgraph technique offering an additional comparison by providing visual images of the pressure wave propagation through the liquid they proposed empirical formulas to predict the pressure attenuation along the distance and angle of the spherical shock waves huang et al 2015 studied the propagation and attenuation of the initial shock wave generated by different nosed projectile experimentally and developed a modified empirical formula for the prediction of peak pressure ren et al 2018 studied the hydrodynamic ram effect on the evolution of the cavity and velocity decay of vertical water entry projectiles the characteristic of the shock wave such as rising time patterns of the shock wave and impact velocity was studied extensively mseddonkmoodie et al 2004 nishida and tanaka 2006 varas et al 2011 a few of current studies employed dynamic photographic method to study the dynamic response of the high speed water entry projectile in terms of the pressure profile the trajectory and cavity evolution by considering the effects of nose shapes and attitude angle of projectiles the objective of the present study is to characterize the trajectory of the high speed water entry slender projectile experimentally using the one stage light gas gun system together with the associated mechanisms the trajectory of the projectile including the centroid deviation and deflection of the attitude angle of the projectile are identified and quantified as functions of the nose shape impact velocity and water entry attitude by employing the dynamic photographic method additionally the pressure history generated by hydrodynamic ram effect and the evolution of the cavity are analyzed for the rigid projectile as well 2 experimental setup as shown in fig 1 the impact test is performed with the one stage gas gun system which has a ϕ 6 mm steel launch tube the frame of the water tank is made of high strength steel and the size of the tank is 310 mm 310 mm 660 mm during the test the dimension of the water filled area is identical and the free surface of the water is 60 mm away from the top of the water tube which means the volume of the filling water is 310 mm 310 mm 600 mm at the observation window a 20 mm thick pmma panel is fully clamped to provide enough stiffness to minimize bending and image distortion obtained by the high speed camera the contact between the pmma windows and the container are sealed with a thin silicone bond to avoid fluid leakage white paper with 10 10 mm2 grid is positioned at the back of the tank to calibrate the high speed camera and achieve the position and angle of the tested projectile additionally a protective frame is implemented at the outer of the water tube and the gun muzzle water is carefully poured at atmospheric pressure and room temperature to avoid the air bubbles entering into the water filled tank three different nose shape projectiles are employed in the experiment flat nose shaped projectile hemispherical projectile and ogival nose shaped projectile as depicted in fig 2 the material of the projectiles is 45 steel with full annealing to provide enough strength to avoid plastic deformation during the penetration in order to control the number of the initial variable all the projectiles are 6 mm in diameter and 4 9g in mass a similar and large ratio of length to diameter l d is also appropriate for the projectiles l 24 mm 22 mm and 21 mm for the flat nose shaped projectile hemispherical projectile and ogival nose shaped projectile respectively for the ogival nose shaped projectile the nose shape coefficient ψ caliber radius head crh is defined as ψ s 2r and employed to describe the projectile nose shapes where s is the radius of the arc of the ogival shapes and r is the projectile shank radius guo et al 2012 in this article ψ 1 is adopted for the ogival projectile meanwhile the shape coefficient ψ of the hemispherical and flat projectile is 0 5 and 0 respectively the projectiles used in this paper are regarded as rigid bodies all the projectiles are accelerated by the controlled gas gun to obtain the velocities in the range from 40 to 150 m s measured by the laser velocimeter to capture the dynamic process of the projectile in the water container a photron ultima apx rs is placed at the front of the transparent window of the protective frame the selected frame rate and resolution are 15 000 frames and 1024 848 pixels respectively additionally a pressure transducer kd2009a made in yangzhou china is adopted to record the pressure history of the projectile it can be subjected to the loading ranging from 10 kpa to 10 mpa and work in the fluid such as water and oil normally the transducer is positioned on one side of the water tank and 100 mm below the free surface of water the sensor designed for repeated transient events has specified sensitivity of 3 73 pc mpa and includes natural frequency exceeding 50 khz the major advantage of the pressure transducer compared to other types of pressure sensors is the rising time which is specified by the manufacturer as about 2 5 μs the direction perpendicular to the horizontal plane of the free surface of water is defined as the angle of 0 in this paper fig 2d shows the schematic diagram of trajectory vertical penetration in plane deviation and attitude angle due to the limitation of only one camera all the analysis performed blow is based on the in plane data 3 experimental results and discussion the initial conditions including mass impact velocity attitude angle of the projectiles with different nose shapes are listed in table 1 3 1 pressure history according to the effect of hydrodynamic ram a series of hemispherical pressure waves are generated and experience attenuation along the distance and angle during the water entry of the high speed projectile in the previous study huang et al 2015 the pressure characteristics in terms of the propagation of shock wave the magnitude and attenuation of peak pressure caused by the water entry projectile were discussed in detail in this paper the pressure history of the measured point is recorded fig 3 provides comparative studies of the pressure history for different nosed projectiles with the same initial velocity and the same nosed projectile at different initial velocities respectively fig 3 presents that the pressure histories shown by different cases are similar and a series of pressure waves following the initial shock wave at the same impact velocity the peak pressure shown by the flat projectile is significantly larger than that by the hemispherical projectile due to the different mechanisms of the energy dissipation the dominant energy dissipation of projectile with a sharper nose is the kinetic attenuation during the propagation rather than transmission to the surrounding water that is the reason why the pressure magnitude obtained by the ogival is too small to exhibit in the figure meanwhile the larger contact area with water shown by flat projectile results in a larger duration of the initial shock wave as well as illustrated in fig 3a it is clear that the peak pressure increases with the increasing impact velocity for the projectile with the same nose the detailed qualitative relationship and attenuation of the peak value of initial shock pressure versus the distance and angle from the impact point have been reported in the previous work huang et al 2015 3 2 trajectory stability analysis in the case of water entry of high speed projectile the water in the tank obtains the kinetic energy transferring from the onset of the initial contact of the projectile and water to move around on the initial stage of cavity the trajectory of the projectile exhibits significant instability because of the small wet area caused by the fact that only the nose of the projectile is in contact with water during this time with the penetration of the projectile a moment relative to the center of mass of the projectile aroused by the hydrodynamic force will lead to the rotation and change in the attitude angle of the projectile which will subsequently result in irregular fold of the cavity caused by the contact between the wall of cavity and tail of the projectile hrubes 2001 this tailslap will reinforce the effect of attitude deflection the theoretical analysis of drag lift torque of the water entry projectile has been performed by chu et al 2008 in this section the effects of nose shape impact velocity and water entry attitude on the trajectory of the high speed projectile are discussed experimentally with the diagnostic photographic method 3 2 1 process of vertical water entry fig 4 shows the vertically water entry process of the ogival nose projectile at 101 2 m s including the changing of the attitude angle and the evolution of the cavity after the water splash the projectile experiences a noticeable instability and attitude deflection at initial stage of water entry at 1 07 ms when the tail of the projectile begins to contact the wall of the cavity the clear cavity fold occurs and it does not change its location with the penetration of the projectile showing at the same location at 1 60 ms and 2 20 ms it is can be explained that the water particle on the wall of cavity moves radially with its expansion after that the tail of the projectile remains on the wall of the cavity and the attitude deflection increases with the increasing penetration meanwhile the necking of cavity occurs near the free surface of the water which results in the occurrence of the collapse of the cavitation and the block of the air between outside and cavitation this phenomenon shows a good agreement with the work performed by lee et al 1997 and truscott et al 2014 a clear wake flow appears behind the closed cavity after 1 60 ms when the cavity collapse occurs the projectile is actually reaching the bottom of the tank due to the limitation of the dimension of the water tank the collapse of the cavity is significantly affected by the waves and the rapidly changed boundary conditions of the cavity the complete collapse of the cavity is not captured because of the limitation of the time span of the camera according to the position of centroid obtained from the high speed camera the diagnostic photographic method provides a better understanding of the trajectory stability as shown in fig 4b meanwhile data collection of attitude deflection of the fast moving slender body by the high speed camera is plotted in the figure as well through measuring attitude angle the position of the centroid head and tail of the projectile it is clear that the slender projectile undergoes a significant attitude deflection and a curve trajectory 3 2 2 effect of nose shape the movement of the underwater projectile consists of the translation of centroid and the rotation around the centroid at similar impact velocities the underwater trajectory and attitude deflection of slender projectiles with different noses are compared to study the effect of nose shape on the trajectory stability fig 5 and fig 6 present the underwater penetration of the flat nose and hemispherical projectile at 106 8 m s and 100 0 m s respectively the evolution of cavity of the projectiles experiences the same characteristics as the ogival node projectile shown in fig 4 in fig 5 the entire cavitating sailing of the flat nose projectile undergoes a significant trajectory stability where the curve of the trajectory remains linear and the attitude deflection can be neglected as a comparison the trajectory remains stable at the initial stage of the water entry process with slight attitude deflection after 1 44 ms the trajectory and attitude deflection of hemispherical slender increase with the increasing penetration the irregular cavity fold happens after 2 40 ms whereas both the trajectory and attitude deflection show smaller change than that of the ogival projectile with the similar impact velocity according to the photographs shown in fig 4 and fig 6 the out of plane attitude and trajectory deflection can be observed as well according to the analysis of the images from the high speed camera the relationship between the in plane deviation of the centroid and the attitude angle versus time of the three nosed projectiles with similar impact velocities are plotted in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively according to the largest attitude angle and centroid deflection the result confirms that the ogival projectile has the worst stability of trajectory followed by the hemispherical projectile the flat projectile performs an outstanding stability of trajectory which can be attributed to the larger wet area of the flat slender as it moves through the water because it can help the slender to balance the hydrodynamic force at the interface of the water and head of the projectile with the smallest wet area ogival projectile is subjected to a significant disturbance affecting the stability of the trajectory greatly the curvature of the curves shown in fig 7 and fig 8 indicates that ogival projectile exhibits similar velocity of in plane deflection of centroid and change of attitude angle at the initial stage both of the two parameters experience a rapid increase due to the occurrence of the tailslap after 1 00 ms the effect of tailslap causes the instability of the slender in the form of the change in the in plane deflection of the centroid and the rotation around the centroid the instability of the projectile increases with the increasing penetration due to the continuous disturbance caused by tailslap at the tail and hydrodynamic force at the head therefore the ogival projectile undergoes an 84 rotation and 16 6 mm deflection of centroid at last 3 2 3 effect of impact velocity due to the obvious deflection of trajectory and attitude of the centroid the ogival nose projectile is adopted to study the effect of impact velocity on the trajectory stability fig 9 shows the evolution of the trajectory of the ogival nose projectile with the impact velocity v0 44 0 m s it is clear that the projectile experiences attitude deflection at the initial stage of the penetration the irregular fold of the cavity happens at 1 68 ms followed by the complete necking of cavity at 2 48 ms after it the collapse of the cavity emanates from the free surface to the deep water with the obvious wake flow about 90 rotation happens to the slender body at the end of the test compared with the case of 101 02 m s it is reasonable to confirm that the time span of the important phenomena fold necking and collapse of the cavity decreases with the increasing impact velocity the splash effect is more obvious for the larger impact velocity experiencing the similar change during the initial stage the in plane deviation of the centroid and attitude deflection of the projectile at different impact velocities shown in fig 10 and fig 11 presents that both of them increase with the increasing impact velocity at the same duration it corresponds to the hydrodynamic force work on the projectile and the earlier occurrence of tailslap due to the increasing impact velocity the largest in plane deflection of the centroid increases with the increase of the impact velocity whereas the largest angle of attitude deviation of the projectile with different impact velocities shows a slight difference at the end of the test even if it takes a significantly longer duration for the projectile with lower speed 3 2 4 effect of water entry attitude the water entry of high speed projectiles with a certain attitude angle is a common situation for the application of underwater weapons due to the launch angle wind force et al in order to study the effect of water entry attitude on the trajectory stability and attitude deviation the flat projectiles with different impact velocities are fired into the water tank with a 10 water entry attitude in this section fig 12 presents the evolution of the trajectory and attitude deflection of the flat projectile with a 10 water entry attitude at 67 0 m s the attitude undergoes a process from oblique to vertical a slight deflection of attitude angle occurs at the initial stage of the water entry which does not change obviously until the appearance of the tailslap at 5 0 ms then it begins to increase rapidly after that it is clear that the projectile experiences a rotation which makes it move forward vertically from 5 13 ms to 6 47 ms with the tail of the projectile closing to one side of the cavity wall the vertical attitude of the projectile remains to the end of the test the trajectory is a concave curve which deviates from the initial line with the increasing penetration the time of necking and collapse of the cavity is similar to the vertical case discussed above different from the result shown in fig 5 the flat projectile experiences a significant deflection of the trajectory and attitude angle when it launches into the water with an initial water entry angle as shown in fig 13 and fig 14 three different impact velocities with the same water entry angle are carried out compared with the stability of the trajectory in the vertically water entry case the centroid experiences the deviation at the initial stage of the water entry process and the velocity of the deviation increases obviously with the increase of the impact velocity the attitude of the projectile undergoes a continuous rotation with the increasing penetration which makes the projectile inclination change from one side of the vertical line to another side at the end of the sailing the deflection of the attitude is also sensitive to the impact velocity the main reason makes the projectile with a title water entry angle different from the vertical one can be attributed to the fact that the resultant force of the hydrodynamic force of the head and disturbance of tailslap do not work at the centroid of the slender with the increasing impact energy the resultant force deviating from the centroid makes a more significant influence on the trajectory and attitude of the projectile 3 3 evolution of cavity the evolution of the cavity radius at the point of 50 mm below the free surface of the water for different nosed projectiles with similarly vertical impact velocity is plotted in fig 15 the solid and hollow points in the figure are the measuring radius before and after the complete cavity necking which are discussed above it is clear that the cavity radius goes through a fast increase during the initial stage whereas the cavity radius starts to drop at a slower rate than it increases after the completion of the cavity necking due to the similar wet area and impact velocity the ogival and hemispherical projectiles produce almost same cavity radius and the expansion rate of the initial cavity is almost the same as well with the increasing penetration and deflection of trajectory the cavity radius produced by the hemispherical projectile which has a larger wet area exceeds that by the ogival projectile till the end of the test the cavity radius and its rate of expansion aroused by the flat projectile show larger values during the whole process to obtain the penetration time history and velocity attenuation of the water entry slender projectile with cavity the results provided by the vertical water entry of flat projectile are selected because of the trajectory stability during the whole process the penetration and velocity of the head of the projectile with different impact velocities are obtained from the high speed camera as plotted in fig 16 it is clear that the penetration increases with the increasing impact velocity and time the velocity attenuation which is normalized as v v0 in the figure indicates that the rate of attenuation increases with the increase of impact velocity as well which is likely the result of the increased drag coefficient disregarding the gravity distortion effects during the vertically water entry process the motion equation of the slender body can be obtained from newton s second law 1 m d v p d t 1 2 ρ w a 0 c d v p 2 where m v p and a 0 denote the mass the velocity and the area of the flat projectile respectively ρ w stands for the density of water and c d is the drag coefficient eq 1 can be given as 2 m d v p d t 1 2 c d ρ w v p d x p d t a 0 where x p is the vertical penetration of the projectile integrating eq 2 the drag coefficient is determined as 3 c d 2 m ρ w a 0 x p ln v 0 v p the penetration and velocity of the projectile are functions of time and eq 3 presents the relationship between the drag coefficient and time as well the penetration data x p can be obtained by high speed camera velocity data v p can be calculated by differentiating x p both x p and v p are time related the corresponding drag coefficient will be calculated in time series using eq 3 fig 17 presents the analytical calculations of the drag coefficient time relationship for the flat projectile with three different impact velocities the drag coefficient drops rapidly at the initial stage of water entry and it continuously decreases at a gradual slowing down rate at any time the drag coefficient of the projectile with a higher impact velocity is larger than that with lower impact velocities 4 concluding remarks in the present paper the vertical water entry of the high speed slender projectile has been evaluated experimentally the effect of nose shape impact velocity and water entry attitude of the projectiles on trajectory stability attitude deflection and associated mechanisms is identified and quantified respectively the dynamic photographic method is adopted to depict the underwater trajectory and attitude of the slender projectile the pressure history caused by the hydrodynamic ram effect shows that the peak pressure and duration of the initial shock wave increases with the decreasing shape coefficient ψ for the projectile with different nose shapes the peak pressure produced by the penetration of flat projectile is significantly larger than that by the other two kinds of projectiles because flat projectile transfers a large fraction of the initial kinetic energy to the surrounding water during the water entry process with a larger initial kinetic energy the initial shock wave achieves a larger magnitude of peak pressure after the initial stage of water entry the deflection of trajectory and attitude of the slender projectile is sensitive to the effect of nose shape impact velocity and water entry attitude the flat projectile experiences a vertical trajectory without obvious deviation of attitude angle with the increasing shape coefficient ψ the hemispherical projectile shows small deflection of trajectory and attitude the centroid of the ogival projectile undergoes a significantly curved trajectory and the body exhibits obvious rotation around the centroid this deflection increases rapidly after the occurrence of the irregular fold on the cavity wall the effect of nose shape on the trajectory and attitude of the water entry projectile with similar impact velocities mainly corresponds to the wet area of the head of the projectile during the penetration the body with a large wet area such as the flat projectile can help the slender balance the hydrodynamic force at the interface of the water and head of the projectile once the projectile with small shape coefficient deviates from the vertical path at the initial stage the continuous disturbance caused by tailslap at the tail and hydrodynamic force at the head will make the instability of the projectile increase with the increasing penetration for the same nosed projectile the in plane deviation of the centroid and attitude deflection increase as the impact velocity increases which is likely the result of the hydrodynamic force work on the nose and the earlier occurrence of tailslap due to the increasing impact velocity the largest angle of attitude deviation of the projectile with different impact velocities shows a slight difference at the end of the test even if it takes a significantly longer duration for the lower speed projectile compared with the trajectory stability in the vertically water entry case the centroid and the attitude angle experience in plane deviation initiating from the beginning of the water entry process the rate of the deviation increases obviously with the increase of the impact velocity the main reason can be attributed to the fact that the resultant force of the hydrodynamic force of the head and disturbance of tailslap do not work at the centroid of the slender with the increasing impact energy the resultant force deviating from the centroid makes a more significant influence on the trajectory and attitude of the projectile the cavity radius and its evolution significantly depend on the nose shape during the process of cavitating sailing the attenuation rate of the velocity increases with the increasing impact velocity due to the drag coefficient which decreases as the time grows especially at the initial stage of the water entry

22949,the performance of a self propelled foil in stationary fluid is numerically studied in this paper to conduct the numerical simulations an immersed boundary simplified circular function based gas kinetic method is used the investigation first compares the self propulsion performances of flapping foil with three different patterns i e pure heaving motion pure pitching motion and combined oscillating motion it is found that the combined oscillating foil generally outperforms the heaving foil whilst the heaving foil performs better than the pitching foil with the moderate motion frequency and amplitude moreover the effects of reynolds number phase difference and pivot location on the self propulsion of the combined oscillating foil are also examined the results obtained indicate that there exists a threshold value of reynolds number and below which the propulsion performance declines considerably in addition the phase difference can reverse the foil s auto propelled

foils which is different from the classical aerodynamics of fixed wings is complicated and still lack of well understanding due to the complex fluid structure interactions lee et al 2015 shyy et al 2010 investigating the dynamics of flapping foils is not only scientific but also technological because of its applications in the design of micro aerial underwater robots platzer et al 2008 bandyopadhyay 2005 therefore many researchers have concentrated on the fluid dynamics of flapping foils for several decades triantafyllou et al 2004 young et al 2014 it has been pointed out that the flapping foil had many significant advantages compared with the conventional propellers such as more stabilized propulsion in waves belibassakis and politis 2013 higher maneuverability ramamurti et al 2010 larger propulsive efficiency politis and tsarsitalidis 2014 and so on three flapping types pure pitching motion pure heaving motion and combined oscillating motion including both pitching and heaving motions are extensively used to study the dynamics of flapping foils das et al 2016 lai and platzer 1999 karbasian and esfahani 2017 floryan et al 2017 it has been pointed out that the thrust generation of a flapping foil related to the formation of reversed von kármán vortex streets no matter which flapping pattern is used lai and platzer 1999 triantafyllou et al 1991 godoy diana et al 2008 furthermore the effective angle of attack which also determines the formation of the leading edge vortex and the reversed von kármán wake anderson et al 1998 is important for thrust generation and propulsive efficiency read et al 2003 the moderate effective angle of attack with appropriate strouhal number can significantly improve the thrust and propulsive efficiency together schouveiler et al 2005 hover et al 2004 bøckmann and steen further indicated that the passively controlled angle of attack was better for the thrust and efficiency augment than the actively controlled angle of attack bøckmann and steen 2014 moreover the flexibility likewise influences the thrust generation and propulsive efficiency of the flapping foil ramamurti et al 2010 liu and bose 1997 since the effective angle of attack of foil is changed by the flexible deformation however the propulsion performance of flapping foils is also affected by many other parameters such as flapping frequency and amplitude phase difference pivot location and so on lewin and haj hariri 2003 indicated that the effect of frequency on the efficiency of a flapping foil was not monotonic and there was an intermediate frequency with which the heaving foil achieved the maximum efficiency mackowski and williamson 2017 revealed that the pivot location also affected the performance of a pitching foil young and lai predicted young and lai 2007 that the propulsive efficiency of a flapping foil could be maximized by optimizing the phase of heaving and pitching motions moreover ashraf et al 2011 investigated the effect of foil shape on the performance of a flapping foil and indicated that a thin foil performs better than a thick foil in addition there are many other studies about the dynamics of flapping foils one can find much more recent development about the dynamics of flapping foils in the literature review platzer et al 2008 triantafyllou et al 2004 it should be noted that a uniform incoming flow or the towing velocity is used instead of the self propulsive velocity in the previous work above which is different from the real self propulsion of flying swimming animals in nature recently the auto propelled foil is used by some researchers to investigate the dynamics of flapping foils vandenberghe et al 2006 indicated that both plunging frequency and amplitude determined the self propulsion velocity of a heaving foil moreover arora et al 2016 predicted that the heaving motion with low amplitude but high frequency is beneficial for high propulsive efficiency on the other hand zhang et al 2009 studied the effect of foil shape on the self propulsion and found that the slender heaving foil is easy to achieve a steady cruising state as for the self propelled pitching foil akoz and moored 2017 found that the intermittent motion obtained high propulsive efficiency as compared with the continuous motion moreover two parallel pitching foils were also used as the simplified model of jellyfish like flyer swimmer raspa et al 2013 fang et al 2017 which has good propulsion performance compared with a single pitching foil as reviewed above the self propulsion of a heaving or pitching foil is only studied solely and there is short of self propulsion performance comparison of heaving and pitching motions andersen et al 2017 indicated that a heaving foil was easier to produce thrust than a pitching foil but the flapping foil was fixed and there was no self propulsion in their experiment thus the question about whether a heaving foil performs better than a pitching foil in the self propulsion is still lack of well understanding this is one of the motivations of the current work moreover the real flapping motions used by the flying swimming animals include both heaving and pitching motions although there are many studies about the dynamics of a fixed flapping foil immersed in the uniform incoming flow the auto propulsion performance of the combined oscillating foil is still lack of complete investigation this is the other motivation of the current work in this paper the comparison of self propulsion performance of pure heaving and pitching foils is studied firstly then the performance of a combined oscillating foil which combines heaving and pitching motions the same in the below is investigated in detail finally the effects of oscillating parameters such as reynolds number phase difference and pivot location on the self propulsion of the combined oscillating foil are also discussed the simulations are carried out via an immersed boundary method based on a simplified circular function based gas kinetic scheme yang et al 2017 based on the simulation results obtained the influences of motion patterns and oscillating parameters on the self propulsion performance of a flapping foil are analytically demonstrated 2 problem description and methodology 2 1 problem description in this paper a rigid two dimensional naca 0012 airfoil is used as the profile of an auto propelled flapping foil as shown in fig 1 the positive thrust and propelled direction are defined along the negative x direction the foil experiences three different flapping patterns i e pure heaving pure pitching and combined oscillating respectively the length and time are respectively non dimensionalized by the chord c and flapping cycle t thus the flapping motions can be described as follows ashraf et al 2011 1 heaving y t a sin 2 π t 2 pitching θ t θ 0 sin 2 π t ϕ where t t t f t is the dimensionless time f is the flapping frequency y t is the is the dimensionless vertical position of the foil a a c is the dimensionless heaving pitching amplitude it should be pointed out that the amplitudes of heaving and pitching are denoted as a h and a p respectively θ t is the dimensionless pitching angle θ 0 is the dimensionless pitching amplitude which can be calculated as θ 0 asin a p ϕ is the phase difference between the heaving and pitching motions of the combined oscillating foil which is fixed as ϕ 0 for the pure pitching foil and the pivot location is fixed at the leading edge for the pure pitching foil the flapping foil is set as free and can propel in the horizontal direction x direction due to the force generated from the fluid structure interactions the non dimensional horizontal position and propulsive velocity of the foil are governed as follows arora et al 2016 3 m d 2 x d t 2 2 π 2 c 2 a 2 c t 4 u u v 1 2 π a d x d t 5 c t 2 f x ρ 0 v 2 c 6 v 2 π f a pure heaving motion 2 π f c θ 0 pure pitching motion 2 π f a 2 2 π

densities of foil and fluid respectively x x c is the dimensionless horizontal position of the foil c t is the thrust coefficient f x is the horizontal force applied on the foil surface v is the maximum flapping velocity of the foil u and u are the dimensionless and dimensional instantaneous horizontal velocity of the foil respectively the cycle averaged velocity and power coefficient and the

cycle averaged power coefficient is 8 c p 2 p m ρ 0 v 3 c 2 ρ 0 v 3 c t t t t f y d y t d t m d θ t d t d t where p m is the cycle averaged power consumption f y and m are the vertical force and torque applied on the foil surface respectively the propulsive efficiency is defined as follow 9 η e k p m t where e k 1 t t t t 1 2 m u 2 d t is the output power i e the kinetic energy in addition other parameters such as lift and torque coefficients can be calculated as 10 c l 2 f y ρ 0 v 2 c c m 2 m ρ 0 v 2 c 2 2 2 numerical method the two dimensional viscous flow over the flapping foil is simulated in the current work and the governing equations can be written as follows 11 ρ t ρ u 0 12 ρ u t ρ u u p i μ ρ u ρ u t f where ρ is the flow density u is the flow velocity vector p is the pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity of flow i is the unit tensor f is the force density applied by the immersed boundary the reynolds number is defined as r e ρ 0 u 0 c μ here u 0 is reference velocity in current work a simplified circular function based gas kinetic scheme yang et al 2017 is used to solve equations 11 and 12 and then they can be discretized as 13 d w i d t 1 ω i i 1 n f f n i s i 14 w ρ ρ u ρ v t 15 f n f ρ f ρ u f ρ v t where w is the conservative variable vector f n is the flux i is the index of the control cell ω i denotes the volume of the control cell i n f represents the number of the face of the control cell i and s i is the area of the ith interface of the control cell i u and v represent the horizontal and vertical velocities in the global cartesian coordinate system defined at the cell center respectively it is found that the key to solve such flux equation 13 is the calculation of flux f n to do that the local coordinate system defined at the cell interface is introduced thus the conservative variable vector and the flux in the local coordinate system can be written as 16 w ρ ρ u 1 ρ u 2 t 17 f n f ρ f ρ u 1 f ρ u 2 t 18 w n w 19 f n n f n where u u 1 u 2 is the velocity vector in the local coordinate system n denotes the unit vector of the local coordinate system and equations 18 and 19 represent the transformation from the local coordinates system to the global cartesian coordinate system in the local coordinate system the flux can be calculated as 20 f n f i τ v f i i f i where τ v τ v δ t δ t is the streaming time which can be calculated through δ t 0 4 min δ l δ r max u 1 u 2 c s where c s 2 u 0 m a δ l and δ r represent the lengths of the shortest edges of the left and right cells around the interface respectively the details of f i i and f i can be found in the reference yang et al 2017 moreover a velocity correction based immersed boundary method wu and shu 2009 is used to deal with the fluid structure interactions between the flapping foil and the surrounding flow the basic procedure of such immersed boundary method can be summarized in two steps 1 predict the flow velocity i e u by solving the normal navier stokes equations i e equations 11 and 12 with f 0 2 correct the flow velocity through the no slip boundary condition which can be carried out by solving the following equation 21 ax b where x δ u b 1 δ u b 2 δ u b n t a d 11 d 12 d 1 m d 21 d 22 d 2 m d n 1 d n 2 d n m d 11 d 12 d 1 n d 21 d 22 d 2 n d m 1 d m 2 d m n b u b 1 u b 2 u b n d 11 d 12 d 1 m d 21 d 22 d 2 m d n 1 d n 2 d n m u 1 u 2 u m where δ u b i is the unknown velocity correction of the ith boundary point n is the number of the boundary point m is the number of the eulerian point that around each boundary point u b i is the velocity of the ith boundary point u j is the predicted velocity obtained at step 1 and d k l is the delta function which can be written as d k l 1 δ h 2 δ x l x b k δ h δ y l y b k δ h where δh is the eulerian grid spacing x l y l and x b k y b k are the eulerian and lagrangian coordinates respectively by solving equation 21 the boundary velocity correction δ u b can be obtained and the flow velocity correction δ u can be further calculated through the interpolation thus the force density in equation 12 can be computed i e f ρ δ u δ t for more details one can refer to our previous work wu and shu 2009 2 3 numerical validation in order to validate the numerical method used in the current work the flow around an elliptic airfoil performing hovering flight is simulated in which the stationary fluid condition is the same as that in the current work the kinematics of the airfoil is controlled as follow 22 x t y t a 0 2 c cos 2 π f t cos β sin β 23 α t α 0 α m sin 2 π f t where x t y t are the coordinates of the center of the airfoil α t and α 0 are the instantaneous and initial angles of attack of the airfoil respectively a 0 c is the dimensionless flapping amplitude β is the inclined angle of the stroke plane with respect to the horizontal direction f is the flapping frequency α m is the rotating amplitude the reynolds number is defined as r e 0 a 0 π f c υ where υ is the kinematic viscosity of flow the parameters selected here are r e 0 157 a 0 c 2 5 α m α 0 π 4 β 60 which are the same as those used in the previous studies xu and wang 2006 srinidhi and vengadesan 2017 the validation simulation is carried out in a computational domain of 25 c 20 c with uniform domain of 4 c 4 c around the foil in which the mesh size is δ h 0 01 c the dirichlet boundary condition is applied on the boundaries of computational domain and the no slip boundary condition is applied on the foil surface fig 2 a and b show the time histories of the vertical force coefficient c v and the horizontal force coefficient c h it can be seen from the figure that the present results agree well with the previous numerical results xu and wang 2006 srinidhi and vengadesan 2017 moreover previous experimental work of wang et al 2004 is also selected for the current numerical validation the parameters are set as follow r e 0 75 β 0 a 0 c 2 8 α 0 π 2 α m π 4 the lift and drag coefficients are shown in fig 2 c and d it is clear that the present results agree well with the experimental and numerical results in ref wang et al 2004 consequently the adopted method is suitable for the current investigation 3 results and discussion in this section the self propulsion performances of heaving pitching and combined oscillating foils are studied in detail the size of computational domain is 70 c 20 c in which the size of fine and uniform domain is 60 c 10 c and the spacing of uniform mesh is δ h 0 01 c the dirichlet boundary condition is applied on the boundaries of computational domain and the no slip boundary condition is applied on the foil surface in order to make sure that the solutions achieved are independent of the mesh spacing a sensitivity test is accomplished fig 3 shows the time histories of the drag and lift coefficients of an auto propelled heaving foil which parameters are set as f 0 3 a h 0 5 and re 200 it can be seen from the figure that there is not much deviation between the cases of δ h 0 01 c and δ h 0 005 c moreover the difference of cycle averaged propulsive velocity is only 0 9 between the cases of δ h 0 01 c and δ h 0 005 c to strike a balance between computational expenses and accuracy that related to mesh the grid with δ h 0 01 c is chosen for the current simulations 3 1 performance comparison of pure heaving and pitching motion the propulsion performances of a flapping foil with pure heaving and pitching motion are studied firstly the computed parameters are chosen as re 200 f 0 15 0 3 a h a p 0 1 1 0 the mean auto propelled velocity u m mean power coefficient c p and propulsive efficiency η are shown in fig 4 it is found that the heaving foil achieves a higher u m compared with the pitching foil at the same parameters as shown in fig 4 a for the heaving foil u m increases with amplitude except for f 0 3 and a h 0 8 where u m decreases slightly as amplitude increases as for the pitching foil u m increases with amplitude firstly and then decreases when the amplitude further increases moreover it should be noted that the pitching foil cannot achieve a steady auto propelled velocity when its amplitude is very large this is the reason why some cases of pitching foil the cases of f 0 15 a p 0 8 1 0 and f 0 3 a p 1 0 are not plotted in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 b c p of heaving foil is larger than that of pitching foil at the same parameters moreover for both heaving and pitching foils c p is affected mainly by the amplitude but slightly by the frequency as the amplitude increases c p decreases sharply when a h 0 5 or a p 0 5 but slightly when a h 0 5 or a p 0 5 from fig 4 c on the other hand it is found that there exists an critical amplitude a c above which the heaving foil can generate a higher η compared with the pitching foil such critical amplitude associated with the frequency are a c 0 2 and 0 4 for f 0 3 and 0 15 respectively moreover the highest propulsive efficiency achieved by the heaving foil is at f 0 3 and a h 0 4 and by the pitching foil is at f 0 3 and a p 0 5 the time histories of the propulsive velocity and thrust coefficient of heaving and pitching foils are illustrated in fig 5 it is clear that the velocity fluctuation as shown in fig 5 a and b increases with the rise of motion amplitude and the same trend can be found for the thrust coefficient as shown in fig 5 c and d moreover the velocity fluctuation of the heaving foil is always smaller than that of the pitching foil at the same parameters in particular the heaving foil achieves the upper velocity peak when t t 0 2 and 0 7 and the lower velocity peak when t t 0 4 and 0 9 which corresponds to the moments of c t 0 however there is a phase difference about π 2 between the velocity evolutions of heaving and pitching foils this is due to the phase difference of thrust evolution between heaving and pitching foils which will be discussed in the later section fig 6 illustrates the instantaneous vorticity contours of heaving and pitching foil it can be seen that as compared with the heaving foil the wake of the pitching foil is easy to deflect as the amplitude increased although both heaving and pitching motions are symmetric in the current work as expected the thrust and velocity become much fluctuant when the deflected wake appears especially for the case of a p 0 7 fig 7 provides the instantaneous vorticity and pressure coefficient contours at four moments in the case of a p 0 7 i e t t 0 1 0 4 0 6 and 0 9 which corresponds to the peaks of thrust coefficient shown in fig 5 d as shown in fig 7 a and b it is clear that there is no obvious leading edge vortex lev during the first half stroke i e t t 0 0 5 since the trailing edge vortex tev formed in the previous cycle stands near the surface of the foil instead of transferring downstream i e tev 0 the tev 0 induces the surrounding flow streaming toward the foil surface and suppresses the formation of the lev however the strong lev i e lev 1 forms during the second half stroke i e t t 0 5 1 0 as shown in fig 7 c and d since the tev 1 formed during the previous half stroke sheds and transfers downstream together with the tev 0 thus the suppressive effect of the vortex induced velocity disappears comparing fig 7 e with fig 7 g it is found that the tev 0 results in a low pressure region near the lower leeside when t t 0 1 consequently the pitching foil experiences high drag at t t 0 1 although the propulsive velocity is smaller than that at t t 0 6 moreover comparing fig 7 f with fig 7 h it is clear that the tev 0 is good for producing a strong jet flow when the foil pitches down as a result the high positive pressure region is generated at the lower surface and the thrust is enhanced at this moment as shown in fig 5 d however a low pressure region near the upper leeside of pitching foil is generated by the lev 1 as shown in fig 7 h which is harmful to the thrust generation thus the thrust coefficient at t t 0 9 is smaller than that at t t 0 4 anderson et al indicated that the lev is good for the thrust generation of the flapping foil anderson et al 1998 but for the pitching foil considered here the lev seems to be bad for the thrust generation in summary the heaving foil propels not only fast but also stable compared with the pitching foil furthermore the heaving foil always swims more efficient than the pitching foil except when the much small amplitude is applied 3 2 propulsion performance of a combined oscillating foil as found in the section above the heaving foil outperforms the pitching foil at the same parameters in general however the flapping motions of wings fins of flying swimming animals are the combination of heaving and pitching motions in order to further investigate the dynamics of flapping wings fins in nature the self propulsion of a combined oscillating foil is studied in this section the pitching motions with different amplitudes a p are added to heaving motions the basic heaving parameters f 0 3 a h 0 4 and f 0 15 a h 0 9 which respectively corresponds to the optimal efficiency of the heaving foil are selected moreover f 0 3 a h 0 9 and f 0 15 a h 0 4 are also selected for comparison the pivot point is still fixed at the leading edge and the phase difference is set as ϕ 90 the auto propulsion performance of the combined oscillating foil such as the cycle averaged velocity the cycle averaged power coefficient and the propulsive efficiency are shown in fig 8 it is found that u m of the combined oscillating foil firstly increases with a p and then decreases after achieving the peak value at a p 0 2 0 3 as shown in fig 8 a it should be pointed out that in the current work the combined oscillating foil also propels faster than the pure heaving foil except two cases f 0 3 a p 0 5 however c p reduces as a p increases and it is always smaller than that of the pure heaving foil as shown in fig 8 b consequently with the increase of a p as shown in fig 8 c η of the combined oscillating foil firstly increases significantly and then decreases sharply after reaching the peak value at a p 0 3 0 4 moreover η of the combined oscillating foil is always higher than that of the pure heaving foil in the parameter space considered in the current work fig 9 a shows the velocity evolution of combined oscillating foil with different a p 0 1 0 3 0 6 it can be seen that the velocity fluctuation of combined oscillating foil increases with the rise of a p since the undulations in thrust coefficient increases as shown in fig 9 b moreover as shown in fig 9 c and d both lift and torque coefficients in the case of a p 0 3 are smaller than those in the case of a p 0 1 as a consequence the power consumption required for the oscillating motion firstly reduces as a p increases therefore the propulsive efficiency firstly increases with a p as shown in fig 8 c however the lift and torque coefficients in the case of a p 0 6 is larger than those in the case of a p 0 1 thus the oscillating foil must consume more power for its driving motion as a p further increases as a result the propulsive efficiency decreases when a p further increases as shown in fig 8 c in order to analyze the self propulsion behaviors of different flapping patterns in detail the pure heaving foil the pure pitching foil and the combined oscillating foil with the same parameters e g f 0 3 a h 0 4 a p 0 4 are selected for comparison as illustrated in fig 10 a all the flapping foils can achieve the steady cruising state after five flapping periods and the difference of instantaneous propulsive velocity mainly develops in the first period due to the thrust difference as shown in fig 10 b the combined oscillating foil generates highest thrust the mean thrust coefficient is 0 3 while the pitching foil has lowest thrust the mean thrust coefficient is 0 11 as compared with the heaving foil in the first period the mean thrust coefficient is 0 22 this is the reason why the combined oscillating foil can propel faster and the pitching foil propels much slower as compared with the heaving foil moreover it is noted that the cruising velocity fluctuation of combined oscillating foil is smaller than that of pitching foil but slightly larger than that of heaving foil it is because of the thrust difference between flapping patterns as shown in fig 10 c the more thrust fluctuation the more velocity fluctuation in addition there exists a phase difference which is close to π 2 between the thrust generation of pitching foil and heaving combined oscillating foil the heaving and combined oscillating foils achieve thrust peaks nearly at t t 0 05 and 0 55 but the pitching foil generates peak values at the moments close to t t 0 3 and 0 8 fig 10 d shows the lift coefficients of flapping foils in the steady cruising state it can be seen that the lift of combined oscillating foil is much smaller than that of heaving foil this is the reason why the combined oscillating foil consumes few power as compared with the heaving foil to further check the variation of forces in the steady cruising state the instantaneous vorticity and pressure coefficient contours at four typical instants i e t t 0 05 0 3 0 55 and 0 8 corresponding to the thrust peaks are illustrated in figs 11 and 12 when the foil moves upward just passing through the equilibrium position e g t t 0 05 the trailing edge vortex tev sheds from the upper surface of the foil and the leading edge vortex lev forms at the lower foil surface as shown in fig 11 consequently there exists a positive pressure region at the upper surface and a negative pressure region at the lower surface as shown in fig 12 thus the negative lift is produced at this moment as shown in fig 10 d moreover as compared with the pitching foil the pressure difference of heaving foil is larger and the combined oscillating foil is smaller as a result the magnitude of lift coefficient of heaving foil is higher while that of combined oscillating foil is lower than that of pitching foil as shown in fig 10 d on the other hand due to the non zero instantaneous angle of attack in the combined oscillating motion as shown in figs 11 a and 12 a the combined oscillating foil can produce a larger x component of pressure force compared with the heaving foil therefore the oscillating foil has a higher thrust as shown in fig 10 c for the pitching foil since the lev is weakened at this instant the negative pressure region at the leading edge is pushed backward as shown in figs 11 c and 12 c as a consequence the suction effect around the leading edge disappears compared with the heaving foil and then the pitching foil produces a negative thrust drag as shown in fig 10 c when the foil goes downward after passing through the upper extreme position e g t t 0 3 the lev starts to shed from the lower surface for the combined oscillating foil the lev is partly attached to the lower surface as shown in fig 11 a as a result the negative pressure region is still located at the lower surface as shown in fig 12 a therefore the lift of combine oscillating foil is much smaller than that of others moreover there exists a positive pressure region at the leading edge consequently the thrust at this moment is negative for the combined oscillating foil as shown in fig 10 c for the heaving foil the lev is departing from the lower surface as shown in fig 11 b thus the positive pressure region occurs at the lower surface meanwhile the negative pressure region exists at the upper surface due to the downward heaving motion as shown in fig 12 b this then results in the positive lift at this moment as shown in fig 10 d however the positive pressure region generated at the leading edge due to the new lev at the upper surface is weak so the thrust is negative as shown in fig 10 c in addition for the pitching foil the lev is so weak that only the negative pressure region is formed at the leading edge as shown in figs 11 c and 12 c at the same time the lower surface experiences the positive pressure while the upper surface experiences negative pressure due to the downward pitching motion moreover there has a larger x component of pressure fore due to the non zero instantaneous angle of attack as a result the positive thrust and lift are generated as shown in fig 10 c and d when the foil moves downward just after passing through the equilibrium position e g t t 0 55 the vorticity and pressure distributions are opposite to that at the moment of t t 0 05 so the thrust behavior is the same as that at t t 0 05 but the lift behavior is opposite to that at t t 0 05 as plotted in fig 10 c and d the same situation also can be found between the instant at t t 0 8 and 0 3 in summary the combined oscillating foil propels faster and is more efficient than the heaving or pitching foil 3 3 effect of other parameters as can be observed from the aforementioned sections the combined oscillating foil outperforms the pure heaving pitching foils in most of the parameter space comsidered in current work however it is known that the force behavior of a flapping foil is also affected by other parameters such as reynold number re das et al 2016 ashraf et al 2011 phase difference ϕ anderson et al 1998 read et al 2003 bøckmann and steen 2014 moriche et al 2017 wu et al 2015 and pivot location x p peng and zhu 2009 wang et al 2017 tian et al 2016 to further check the self propulsion performance of the combined ocsillating foil the effects of re ϕ and x p are investigated in this section the basic oscillating parameters are f 0 3 a h 0 4 a p 0 3 3 3 1 effect of reynold number the reynold number is one of the important parameters which influence the performance of flapping foils ashraf et al 2011 das et al 2016 indicated that the thrust and efficiency of a flapping foil increases with the rise of re and there exists a threshold value re 1000 above which the thrust and efficiency remains basically unvaried however the auto propulsion was not considered in the previous work thus the question about how the reynolds number influences the self propulsion performance of a flapping foil is still interested fig 13 shows the effect of re on the self propulsion performance of the combined oscillating foil and other parameters are set as ϕ 90 and x p 0 it can be seen from fig 13 a that u m increases sharply with re when r e 800 moreover the more flapping periods are needed for the foil to achieve the steady self propulsion state when the reynolds number is higher as shown in fig 13 d this is caused by the reduced viscous dissipation as the reynolds number increases arora et al 2016 however owing to the decreased viscosity effect as re increases the time histories of propulsive velocity are similar to each other when re beyond 800 consequently the cycle averaged propulsive speed maintains nearly unchanged when r e 800 and the peak value of u m 1 63 approximately occurs at re 1000 as shown in fig 13 b c p decreases firstly when r e 400 and then it increases when 400 r e 1000 and it starts to decrease again if re further increases as a result η rises significantly as re increases when r e 800 as shown in fig 13 c after that only slight change of η can be observed and the maximum efficiency about 50 3 is achieved at re 1000 as shown in fig 13 re 800 is a critical reynolds number and below which the self propulsion performance declines significantly so it means that the viscosity effect is only remarkable when r e 800 this phenomenon is consistent with the work of das et al 2016 moreover since the viscous dissipation decreases as re increases the wake structure of the combined oscillating foil will be different at different re as shown in fig 14 the number of vortices that shed during the half period gradually increases with re there is only one vortex shed at re 200 fig 14 a but two vortices shed when re is increased up to 600 fig 14 b and three vortices shed at re 1000 as shown in fig 14 c 3 3 2 effect of phase difference the phase shift between the heaving and pitching motions is another important parameter which also determines the propulsive efficiency and force generation of flapping foils anderson et al 1998 read et al 2003 bøckmann and steen 2014 moriche et al 2017 wu et al 2015 however the previous work only focuses on the performance of a fixed or hauled foil so the phase difference effect on the auto propulsion of a flapping foil is still lack of well understanding moreover the variation of phase investigated is fragmentary for example only the phase range of 70 ϕ 110 has been investigated in the work of read et al 2003 bøckmann steen just considered the phase of 40 ϕ 160 in their experiment bøckmann and steen 2014 in this section the full phase difference in the range of 0 ϕ 360 is considered fig 15 shows the self propulsion performance of the combined oscillating foil varying with ϕ other parameters are set as re 200 and x p 0 it is found that the self propelled direction is also affected by ϕ as shown in fig 15 a there exist rightward propulsion situation auto propelled in x direction with positive u m when the phase in the range of 170 ϕ 275 and leftward propulsion situation auto propelled in x direction with negative u m in the rest of phase shift region for the leftward self propulsion situation there is a largest value of u m which occurs at ϕ 60 anderson et al indicated that the phase of about 75 was optimal for the thrust generation of oscillating foil anderson et al 1998 the phase for the largest propulsive velocity in this study is close to that reported in the experimental work of anderson et al 1998 as for the rightward propulsion situation u m firstly increases and then decreases as the rise of ϕ and the highest value of u m appears at ϕ 240 as shown in fig 15 b for the leftward propulsion c p decreases firstly with the rise of ϕ and then increases with ϕ when ϕ 120 the similar trend of c p can be seen for the rightward propulsion as for the propulsive efficiency as shown in fig 15 c there are two peak values one occurs at ϕ 90 η 19 corresponding to the leftward propulsion whilst the other appears at ϕ 240 η 7 corresponding to the rightward propulsion fig 16 a shows the time histories of self propulsive velocity in the cases of ϕ 90 to 240 it is found that all the self propulsions become steady after five periods moreover the propelled direction is just determined at the beginning of propulsion this is caused by the different direction of initially generated thrust at different ϕ as shown in fig 16 b for the case of ϕ 240 the thrust coefficient maintains negative during most interval of the first period and its mean value is 0 14 this is because the instantaneous angle of attack is negative during the downstroke but positive during the upstroke as shown in fig 17 a and b consequently the x component pressure force always points to the right x direction and triggers the rightward propulsion however for the case of ϕ 90 the instantaneous angle of attack is negative during the upstroke while positive during the downstroke as shown in fig 17 c and d thus the x component pressure force points to x direction namely the positive thrust is generated as shown in fig 16 b its mean value in the first period is 0 32 which results in the actuating of leftward propulsion 3 3 3 effect of pivot location besides the reynolds number and phase difference the pivot location also is an important factor affecting the performance of flapping foils peng and zhu 2009 wang et al 2017 as reported by mackowski williamson mackowski and williamson 2017 and tian et al 2016 the thrust generation of a pitching foil varies significantly with the pivot location moreover the pivot location near the leading edge is beneficial for increasing the thrust however the previous work only focused on the performance of a pure pitching foil in the uniform incoming flow the effect of the pivot point on the self propulsion of a flapping foil is still lack of study here the combined oscillating foil with ϕ 90 and re 200 is considered the pivot location varies from the leading edge to the trailing edge i e x p c 0 1 fig 18 shows the propulsion performance of the combined flapping foil as the function of x p as can be observed from fig 18 a u m decreases smoothly as the pivot position moves toward the trailing edge this is caused by the reduction of thrust generated as shown in fig 19 a in the first period the mean thrust coefficients at x p c 0 0 4 and 0 8 are 0 32 0 26 and 0 23 respectively however as shown in fig 18 b the power coefficient reduces firstly as x p increases and then increases significantly after reaching the minimum peak at x p c 0 4 this is because the lift and torque are affected significantly by the change of pivot position as shown in fig 19 b and c when x p c 0 4 it means that the pivot location is near the center of mass since the density of the foil is uniform the peak value of torque coefficient is much smaller than that of others meanwhile the peak value of lift coefficient is also reduced as compared with other simuations consequently as shown in fig 18 c the auto propelled efficiency enhances firstly and then decreases considerably after achieving the peak value η 21 at x p c 0 4 4 conclusions the self propulsion performances of a rigid flapping foil with horizontal free in stationary fluid are investigated systematically in this work the two dimensional viscous flow over the flapping foil is simulated by an immersed boundary simplified circular function based gas kinetic method the performances of pure heaving and pure pitching foils are studied firstly and then the propulsion of the combined oscillating foil that includes both heaving and pitching motions is investigated based on the numerical results obtained it is found that the pure heaving foil always propels faster than the pure pitching foil at the same parameters and the propulsive efficiency of heaving foil is also higher than that of pitching foil in general on the other hand the combined oscillating foil can achieve higher self propulsive efficiency compared with the heaving foil in addition the auto propelled velocity of combined oscillating foil is larger than that of heaving foil generally moreover the auto propulsion performance of the combined oscillating foil is also significantly affected by the reynold number phase difference and pivot location there exists a threshold value of reynolds number re 800 and below which the self propulsion performance declines clearly on the other hand the phase difference at ϕ 90 is beneficial for achieving the highest efficiency meanwhile as the pivot point moves from the leading edge to the trailing edge the auto propelled velocity of the combined oscillating foil reduces monotonically but there exists a position near the center of mass x p c 0 4 that is good for decreasing the power consumption and increasing the efficiency significantly in summary the combined oscillating foil may be a more appropriate

22949,the performance of a self propelled foil in stationary fluid is numerically studied in this paper to conduct the numerical simulations an immersed boundary simplified circular function based gas kinetic method is used the investigation first compares the self propulsion performances of flapping foil with three different patterns i e pure heaving motion pure pitching motion and combined oscillating motion it is found that the combined oscillating foil generally outperforms the heaving foil whilst the heaving foil performs better than the pitching foil with the moderate motion frequency and amplitude moreover the effects of reynolds number phase difference and pivot location on the self propulsion of the combined oscillating foil are also examined the results obtained indicate that there exists a threshold value of reynolds number and below which the propulsion performance declines considerably in addition the phase difference can reverse the foil s auto propelled direction furthermore the pivot location near the center of mass can both reduce the power consumption and increase the efficiency significantly the results obtained here may be utilized to optimize

foils which is different from the classical aerodynamics of fixed wings is complicated and still lack of well understanding due to the complex fluid structure interactions lee et al 2015 shyy et al 2010 investigating the dynamics of flapping foils is not only scientific but also technological because of its applications in the design of micro aerial underwater robots platzer et al 2008 bandyopadhyay 2005 therefore many researchers have concentrated on the fluid dynamics of flapping foils for several decades triantafyllou et al 2004 young et al 2014 it has been pointed out that the flapping foil had many significant advantages compared with the conventional propellers such as more stabilized propulsion in waves belibassakis and politis 2013 higher maneuverability ramamurti et al 2010 larger propulsive efficiency politis and tsarsitalidis 2014 and so on three flapping types pure pitching motion pure heaving motion and combined oscillating motion including both pitching and heaving motions are extensively used to study the dynamics of flapping foils das et al 2016 lai and platzer 1999 karbasian and esfahani 2017 floryan et al 2017 it has been pointed out that the thrust generation of a flapping foil related to the formation of reversed von kármán vortex streets no matter which flapping pattern is used lai and platzer 1999 triantafyllou et al 1991 godoy diana et al 2008 furthermore the effective angle of attack which also determines the formation of the leading edge vortex and the reversed von kármán wake anderson et al 1998 is important for thrust generation and propulsive efficiency read et al 2003 the moderate effective angle of attack with appropriate strouhal number can significantly improve the thrust and propulsive efficiency together schouveiler et al 2005 hover et al 2004 bøckmann and steen further indicated that the passively controlled angle of attack was better for the thrust and efficiency augment than the actively controlled angle of attack bøckmann and steen 2014 moreover the flexibility likewise influences the thrust generation and propulsive efficiency of the flapping foil ramamurti et al 2010 liu and bose 1997 since the effective angle of attack of foil is changed by the flexible deformation however the propulsion performance of flapping foils is also affected by many other parameters such as flapping frequency and amplitude phase difference pivot location and so on lewin and haj hariri 2003 indicated that the effect of frequency on the efficiency of a flapping foil was not monotonic and there was an intermediate frequency with which the heaving foil achieved the maximum efficiency mackowski and williamson 2017 revealed that the pivot location also affected the performance of a pitching foil young and lai predicted young and lai 2007 that the propulsive efficiency of a flapping foil could be maximized by optimizing the phase of heaving and pitching motions moreover ashraf et al 2011 investigated the effect of foil shape on the performance of a flapping foil and indicated that a thin foil performs better than a thick foil in addition there are many other studies about the dynamics of flapping foils one can find much more recent development about the dynamics of flapping foils in the literature review platzer et al 2008 triantafyllou et al 2004 it should be noted that a uniform incoming flow or the towing velocity is used instead of the self propulsive velocity in the previous work above which is different from the real self propulsion of flying swimming animals in nature recently the auto propelled foil is used by some researchers to investigate the dynamics of flapping foils vandenberghe et al 2006 indicated that both plunging frequency and amplitude determined the self propulsion velocity of a heaving foil moreover arora et al 2016 predicted that the heaving motion with low amplitude but high frequency is beneficial for high propulsive efficiency on the other hand zhang et al 2009 studied the effect of foil shape on the self propulsion and found that the slender heaving foil is easy to achieve a steady cruising state as for the self propelled pitching foil akoz and moored 2017 found that the intermittent motion obtained high propulsive efficiency as compared with the continuous motion moreover two parallel pitching foils were also used as the simplified model of jellyfish like flyer swimmer raspa et al 2013 fang et al 2017 which has good propulsion performance compared with a single pitching foil as reviewed above the self propulsion of a heaving or pitching foil is only studied solely and there is short of self propulsion performance comparison of heaving and pitching motions andersen et al 2017 indicated that a heaving foil was easier to produce thrust than a pitching foil but the flapping foil was fixed and there was no self propulsion in their experiment thus the question about whether a heaving foil performs better than a pitching foil in the self propulsion is still lack of well understanding this is one of the motivations of the current work moreover the real flapping motions used by the flying swimming animals include both heaving and pitching motions although there are many studies about the dynamics of a fixed flapping foil immersed in the uniform incoming flow the auto propulsion performance of the combined oscillating foil is still lack of complete investigation this is the other motivation of the current work in this paper the comparison of self propulsion performance of pure heaving and pitching foils is studied firstly then the performance of a combined oscillating foil which combines heaving and pitching motions the same in the below is investigated in detail finally the effects of oscillating parameters such as reynolds number phase difference and pivot location on the self propulsion of the combined oscillating foil are also discussed the simulations are carried out via an immersed boundary method based on a simplified circular function based gas kinetic scheme yang et al 2017 based on the simulation results obtained the influences of motion patterns and oscillating parameters on the self propulsion performance of a flapping foil are analytically demonstrated 2 problem description and methodology 2 1 problem description in this paper a rigid two dimensional naca 0012 airfoil is used as the profile of an auto propelled flapping foil as shown in fig 1 the positive thrust and propelled direction are defined along the negative x direction the foil experiences three different flapping patterns i e pure heaving pure pitching and combined oscillating respectively the length and time are respectively non dimensionalized by the chord c and flapping cycle t thus the flapping motions can be described as follows ashraf et al 2011 1 heaving y t a sin 2 π t 2 pitching θ t θ 0 sin 2 π t ϕ where t t t f t is the dimensionless time f is the flapping frequency y t is the is the dimensionless vertical position of the foil a a c is the dimensionless heaving pitching amplitude it should be pointed out that the amplitudes of heaving and pitching are denoted as a h and a p respectively θ t is the dimensionless pitching angle θ 0 is the dimensionless pitching amplitude which can be calculated as θ 0 asin a p ϕ is the phase difference between the heaving and pitching motions of the combined oscillating foil which is fixed as ϕ 0 for the pure pitching foil and the pivot location is fixed at the leading edge for the pure pitching foil the flapping foil is set as free and can propel in the horizontal direction x direction due to the force generated from the fluid structure interactions the non dimensional horizontal position and propulsive velocity of the foil are governed as follows arora et al 2016 3 m d 2 x d t 2 2 π 2 c 2 a 2 c t 4 u u v 1 2 π a d x d t 5 c t 2 f x ρ 0 v 2 c 6 v 2 π f a pure heaving motion 2 π f c θ 0 pure pitching motion 2 π f a 2 2 π f c θ 2 combing oscillating motion where m ρ s is the dimensionless mass of the foil s is the area of the foil ρ ρ s ρ 0 is the density ratio which is fixed as ρ 10 in this paper ρ s and ρ 0 are the densities of foil and fluid respectively x x c is the dimensionless horizontal position of the foil c t is the thrust coefficient f x is the horizontal force applied on the foil surface v is the maximum flapping velocity of the foil u and u are the dimensionless and dimensional instantaneous horizontal velocity of the foil respectively the cycle averaged velocity and power coefficient and the propulsive efficiency are important measures of the self propulsion of a flapping foil which can be calculated as follows arora et al 2016 the cycle averaged velocity is 7 u m 1 t t t t u d t the cycle averaged power coefficient is 8 c p 2 p m ρ 0 v 3 c 2 ρ 0 v 3 c t t t t f y d y t d t m d θ t d t d t where p m is the cycle averaged power consumption f y and m are the vertical force and torque applied on the foil surface respectively the propulsive efficiency is defined as follow 9 η e k p m t where e k 1 t t t t 1 2 m u 2 d t is the output power i e the kinetic energy in addition other parameters such as lift and torque coefficients can be calculated as 10 c l 2 f y ρ 0 v 2 c c m 2 m ρ 0 v 2 c 2 2 2 numerical method the two dimensional viscous flow over the flapping foil is simulated in the current work and the governing equations can be written as follows 11 ρ t ρ u 0 12 ρ u t ρ u u p i μ ρ u ρ u t f where ρ is the flow density u is the flow velocity vector p is the pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity of flow i is the unit tensor f is the force density applied by the immersed boundary the reynolds number is defined as r e ρ 0 u 0 c μ here u 0 is reference velocity in current work a simplified circular function based gas kinetic scheme yang et al 2017 is used to solve equations 11 and 12 and then they can be discretized as 13 d w i d t 1 ω i i 1 n f f n i s i 14 w ρ ρ u ρ v t 15 f n f ρ f ρ u f ρ v t where w is the conservative variable vector f n is the flux i is the index of the control cell ω i denotes the volume of the control cell i n f represents the number of the face of the control cell i and s i is the area of the ith interface of the control cell i u and v represent the horizontal and vertical velocities in the global cartesian coordinate system defined at the cell center respectively it is found that the key to solve such flux equation 13 is the calculation of flux f n to do that the local coordinate system defined at the cell interface is introduced thus the conservative variable vector and the flux in the local coordinate system can be written as 16 w ρ ρ u 1 ρ u 2 t 17 f n f ρ f ρ u 1 f ρ u 2 t 18 w n w 19 f n n f n where u u 1 u 2 is the velocity vector in the local coordinate system n denotes the unit vector of the local coordinate system and equations 18 and 19 represent the transformation from the local coordinates system to the global cartesian coordinate system in the local coordinate system the flux can be calculated as 20 f n f i τ v f i i f i where τ v τ v δ t δ t is the streaming time which can be calculated through δ t 0 4 min δ l δ r max u 1 u 2 c s where c s 2 u 0 m a δ l and δ r represent the lengths of the shortest edges of the left and right cells around the interface respectively the details of f i i and f i can be found in the reference yang et al 2017 moreover a velocity correction based immersed boundary method wu and shu 2009 is used to deal with the fluid structure interactions between the flapping foil and the surrounding flow the basic procedure of such immersed boundary method can be summarized in two steps 1 predict the flow velocity i e u by solving the normal navier stokes equations i e equations 11 and 12 with f 0 2 correct the flow velocity through the no slip boundary condition which can be carried out by solving the following equation 21 ax b where x δ u b 1 δ u b 2 δ u b n t a d 11 d 12 d 1 m d 21 d 22 d 2 m d n 1 d n 2 d n m d 11 d 12 d 1 n d 21 d 22 d 2 n d m 1 d m 2 d m n b u b 1 u b 2 u b n d 11 d 12 d 1 m d 21 d 22 d 2 m d n 1 d n 2 d n m u 1 u 2 u m where δ u b i is the unknown velocity correction of the ith boundary point n is the number of the boundary point m is the number of the eulerian point that around each boundary point u b i is the velocity of the ith boundary point u j is the predicted velocity obtained at step 1 and d k l is the delta function which can be written as d k l 1 δ h 2 δ x l x b k δ h δ y l y b k δ h where δh is the eulerian grid spacing x l y l and x b k y b k are the eulerian and lagrangian coordinates respectively by solving equation 21 the boundary velocity correction δ u b can be obtained and the flow velocity correction δ u can be further calculated through the interpolation thus the force density in equation 12 can be computed i e f ρ δ u δ t for more details one can refer to our previous work wu and shu 2009 2 3 numerical validation in order to validate the numerical method used in the current work the flow around an elliptic airfoil performing hovering flight is simulated in which the stationary fluid condition is the same as that in the current work the kinematics of the airfoil is controlled as follow 22 x t y t a 0 2 c cos 2 π f t cos β sin β 23 α t α 0 α m sin 2 π f t where x t y t are the coordinates of the center of the airfoil α t and α 0 are the instantaneous and initial angles of attack of the airfoil respectively a 0 c is the dimensionless flapping amplitude β is the inclined angle of the stroke plane with respect to the horizontal direction f is the flapping frequency α m is the rotating amplitude the reynolds number is defined as r e 0 a 0 π f c υ where υ is the kinematic viscosity of flow the parameters selected here are r e 0 157 a 0 c 2 5 α m α 0 π 4 β 60 which are the same as those used in the previous studies xu and wang 2006 srinidhi and vengadesan 2017 the validation simulation is carried out in a computational domain of 25 c 20 c with uniform domain of 4 c 4 c around the foil in which the mesh size is δ h 0 01 c the dirichlet boundary condition is applied on the boundaries of computational domain and the no slip boundary condition is applied on the foil surface fig 2 a and b show the time histories of the vertical force coefficient c v and the horizontal force coefficient c h it can be seen from the figure that the present results agree well with the previous numerical results xu and wang 2006 srinidhi and vengadesan 2017 moreover previous experimental work of wang et al 2004 is also selected for the current numerical validation the parameters are set as follow r e 0 75 β 0 a 0 c 2 8 α 0 π 2 α m π 4 the lift and drag coefficients are shown in fig 2 c and d it is clear that the present results agree well with the experimental and numerical results in ref wang et al 2004 consequently the adopted method is suitable for the current investigation 3 results and discussion in this section the self propulsion performances of heaving pitching and combined oscillating foils are studied in detail the size of computational domain is 70 c 20 c in which the size of fine and uniform domain is 60 c 10 c and the spacing of uniform mesh is δ h 0 01 c the dirichlet boundary condition is applied on the boundaries of computational domain and the no slip boundary condition is applied on the foil surface in order to make sure that the solutions achieved are independent of the mesh spacing a sensitivity test is accomplished fig 3 shows the time histories of the drag and lift coefficients of an auto propelled heaving foil which parameters are set as f 0 3 a h 0 5 and re 200 it can be seen from the figure that there is not much deviation between the cases of δ h 0 01 c and δ h 0 005 c moreover the difference of cycle averaged propulsive velocity is only 0 9 between the cases of δ h 0 01 c and δ h 0 005 c to strike a balance between computational expenses and accuracy that related to mesh the grid with δ h 0 01 c is chosen for the current simulations 3 1 performance comparison of pure heaving and pitching motion the propulsion performances of a flapping foil with pure heaving and pitching motion are studied firstly the computed parameters are chosen as re 200 f 0 15 0 3 a h a p 0 1 1 0 the mean auto propelled velocity u m mean power coefficient c p and propulsive efficiency η are shown in fig 4 it is found that the heaving foil achieves a higher u m compared with the pitching foil at the same parameters as shown in fig 4 a for the heaving foil u m increases with amplitude except for f 0 3 and a h 0 8 where u m decreases slightly as amplitude increases as for the pitching foil u m increases with amplitude firstly and then decreases when the amplitude further increases moreover it should be noted that the pitching foil cannot achieve a steady auto propelled velocity when its amplitude is very large this is the reason why some cases of pitching foil the cases of f 0 15 a p 0 8 1 0 and f 0 3 a p 1 0 are not plotted in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 b c p of heaving foil is larger than that of pitching foil at the same parameters moreover for both heaving and pitching foils c p is affected mainly by the amplitude but slightly by the frequency as the amplitude increases c p decreases sharply when a h 0 5 or a p 0 5 but slightly when a h 0 5 or a p 0 5 from fig 4 c on the other hand it is found that there exists an critical amplitude a c above which the heaving foil can generate a higher η compared with the pitching foil such critical amplitude associated with the frequency are a c 0 2 and 0 4 for f 0 3 and 0 15 respectively moreover the highest propulsive efficiency achieved by the heaving foil is at f 0 3 and a h 0 4 and by the pitching foil is at f 0 3 and a p 0 5 the time histories of the propulsive velocity and thrust coefficient of heaving and pitching foils are illustrated in fig 5 it is clear that the velocity fluctuation as shown in fig 5 a and b increases with the rise of motion amplitude and the same trend can be found for the thrust coefficient as shown in fig 5 c and d moreover the velocity fluctuation of the heaving foil is always smaller than that of the pitching foil at the same parameters in particular the heaving foil achieves the upper velocity peak when t t 0 2 and 0 7 and the lower velocity peak when t t 0 4 and 0 9 which corresponds to the moments of c t 0 however there is a phase difference about π 2 between the velocity evolutions of heaving and pitching foils this is due to the phase difference of thrust evolution between heaving and pitching foils which will be discussed in the later section fig 6 illustrates the instantaneous vorticity contours of heaving and pitching foil it can be seen that as compared with the heaving foil the wake of the pitching foil is easy to deflect as the amplitude increased although both heaving and pitching motions are symmetric in the current work as expected the thrust and velocity become much fluctuant when the deflected wake appears especially for the case of a p 0 7 fig 7 provides the instantaneous vorticity and pressure coefficient contours at four moments in the case of a p 0 7 i e t t 0 1 0 4 0 6 and 0 9 which corresponds to the peaks of thrust coefficient shown in fig 5 d as shown in fig 7 a and b it is clear that there is no obvious leading edge vortex lev during the first half stroke i e t t 0 0 5 since the trailing edge vortex tev formed in the previous cycle stands near the surface of the foil instead of transferring downstream i e tev 0 the tev 0 induces the surrounding flow streaming toward the foil surface and suppresses the formation of the lev however the strong lev i e lev 1 forms during the second half stroke i e t t 0 5 1 0 as shown in fig 7 c and d since the tev 1 formed during the previous half stroke sheds and transfers downstream together with the tev 0 thus the suppressive effect of the vortex induced velocity disappears comparing fig 7 e with fig 7 g it is found that the tev 0 results in a low pressure region near the lower leeside when t t 0 1 consequently the pitching foil experiences high drag at t t 0 1 although the propulsive velocity is smaller than that at t t 0 6 moreover comparing fig 7 f with fig 7 h it is clear that the tev 0 is good for producing a strong jet flow when the foil pitches down as a result the high positive pressure region is generated at the lower surface and the thrust is enhanced at this moment as shown in fig 5 d however a low pressure region near the upper leeside of pitching foil is generated by the lev 1 as shown in fig 7 h which is harmful to the thrust generation thus the thrust coefficient at t t 0 9 is smaller than that at t t 0 4 anderson et al indicated that the lev is good for the thrust generation of the flapping foil anderson et al 1998 but for the pitching foil considered here the lev seems to be bad for the thrust generation in summary the heaving foil propels not only fast but also stable compared with the pitching foil furthermore the heaving foil always swims more efficient than the pitching foil except when the much small amplitude is applied 3 2 propulsion performance of a combined oscillating foil as found in the section above the heaving foil outperforms the pitching foil at the same parameters in general however the flapping motions of wings fins of flying swimming animals are the combination of heaving and pitching motions in order to further investigate the dynamics of flapping wings fins in nature the self propulsion of a combined oscillating foil is studied in this section the pitching motions with different amplitudes a p are added to heaving motions the basic heaving parameters f 0 3 a h 0 4 and f 0 15 a h 0 9 which respectively corresponds to the optimal efficiency of the heaving foil are selected moreover f 0 3 a h 0 9 and f 0 15 a h 0 4 are also selected for comparison the pivot point is still fixed at the leading edge and the phase difference is set as ϕ 90 the auto propulsion performance of the combined oscillating foil such as the cycle averaged velocity the cycle averaged power coefficient and the propulsive efficiency are shown in fig 8 it is found that u m of the combined oscillating foil firstly increases with a p and then decreases after achieving the peak value at a p 0 2 0 3 as shown in fig 8 a it should be pointed out that in the current work the combined oscillating foil also propels faster than the pure heaving foil except two cases f 0 3 a p 0 5 however c p reduces as a p increases and it is always smaller than that of the pure heaving foil as shown in fig 8 b consequently with the increase of a p as shown in fig 8 c η of the combined oscillating foil firstly increases significantly and then decreases sharply after reaching the peak value at a p 0 3 0 4 moreover η of the combined oscillating foil is always higher than that of the pure heaving foil in the parameter space considered in the current work fig 9 a shows the velocity evolution of combined oscillating foil with different a p 0 1 0 3 0 6 it can be seen that the velocity fluctuation of combined oscillating foil increases with the rise of a p since the undulations in thrust coefficient increases as shown in fig 9 b moreover as shown in fig 9 c and d both lift and torque coefficients in the case of a p 0 3 are smaller than those in the case of a p 0 1 as a consequence the power consumption required for the oscillating motion firstly reduces as a p increases therefore the propulsive efficiency firstly increases with a p as shown in fig 8 c however the lift and torque coefficients in the case of a p 0 6 is larger than those in the case of a p 0 1 thus the oscillating foil must consume more power for its driving motion as a p further increases as a result the propulsive efficiency decreases when a p further increases as shown in fig 8 c in order to analyze the self propulsion behaviors of different flapping patterns in detail the pure heaving foil the pure pitching foil and the combined oscillating foil with the same parameters e g f 0 3 a h 0 4 a p 0 4 are selected for comparison as illustrated in fig 10 a all the flapping foils can achieve the steady cruising state after five flapping periods and the difference of instantaneous propulsive velocity mainly develops in the first period due to the thrust difference as shown in fig 10 b the combined oscillating foil generates highest thrust the mean thrust coefficient is 0 3 while the pitching foil has lowest thrust the mean thrust coefficient is 0 11 as compared with the heaving foil in the first period the mean thrust coefficient is 0 22 this is the reason why the combined oscillating foil can propel faster and the pitching foil propels much slower as compared with the heaving foil moreover it is noted that the cruising velocity fluctuation of combined oscillating foil is smaller than that of pitching foil but slightly larger than that of heaving foil it is because of the thrust difference between flapping patterns as shown in fig 10 c the more thrust fluctuation the more velocity fluctuation in addition there exists a phase difference which is close to π 2 between the thrust generation of pitching foil and heaving combined oscillating foil the heaving and combined oscillating foils achieve thrust peaks nearly at t t 0 05 and 0 55 but the pitching foil generates peak values at the moments close to t t 0 3 and 0 8 fig 10 d shows the lift coefficients of flapping foils in the steady cruising state it can be seen that the lift of combined oscillating foil is much smaller than that of heaving foil this is the reason why the combined oscillating foil consumes few power as compared with the heaving foil to further check the variation of forces in the steady cruising state the instantaneous vorticity and pressure coefficient contours at four typical instants i e t t 0 05 0 3 0 55 and 0 8 corresponding to the thrust peaks are illustrated in figs 11 and 12 when the foil moves upward just passing through the equilibrium position e g t t 0 05 the trailing edge vortex tev sheds from the upper surface of the foil and the leading edge vortex lev forms at the lower foil surface as shown in fig 11 consequently there exists a positive pressure region at the upper surface and a negative pressure region at the lower surface as shown in fig 12 thus the negative lift is produced at this moment as shown in fig 10 d moreover as compared with the pitching foil the pressure difference of heaving foil is larger and the combined oscillating foil is smaller as a result the magnitude of lift coefficient of heaving foil is higher while that of combined oscillating foil is lower than that of pitching foil as shown in fig 10 d on the other hand due to the non zero instantaneous angle of attack in the combined oscillating motion as shown in figs 11 a and 12 a the combined oscillating foil can produce a larger x component of pressure force compared with the heaving foil therefore the oscillating foil has a higher thrust as shown in fig 10 c for the pitching foil since the lev is weakened at this instant the negative pressure region at the leading edge is pushed backward as shown in figs 11 c and 12 c as a consequence the suction effect around the leading edge disappears compared with the heaving foil and then the pitching foil produces a negative thrust drag as shown in fig 10 c when the foil goes downward after passing through the upper extreme position e g t t 0 3 the lev starts to shed from the lower surface for the combined oscillating foil the lev is partly attached to the lower surface as shown in fig 11 a as a result the negative pressure region is still located at the lower surface as shown in fig 12 a therefore the lift of combine oscillating foil is much smaller than that of others moreover there exists a positive pressure region at the leading edge consequently the thrust at this moment is negative for the combined oscillating foil as shown in fig 10 c for the heaving foil the lev is departing from the lower surface as shown in fig 11 b thus the positive pressure region occurs at the lower surface meanwhile the negative pressure region exists at the upper surface due to the downward heaving motion as shown in fig 12 b this then results in the positive lift at this moment as shown in fig 10 d however the positive pressure region generated at the leading edge due to the new lev at the upper surface is weak so the thrust is negative as shown in fig 10 c in addition for the pitching foil the lev is so weak that only the negative pressure region is formed at the leading edge as shown in figs 11 c and 12 c at the same time the lower surface experiences the positive pressure while the upper surface experiences negative pressure due to the downward pitching motion moreover there has a larger x component of pressure fore due to the non zero instantaneous angle of attack as a result the positive thrust and lift are generated as shown in fig 10 c and d when the foil moves downward just after passing through the equilibrium position e g t t 0 55 the vorticity and pressure distributions are opposite to that at the moment of t t 0 05 so the thrust behavior is the same as that at t t 0 05 but the lift behavior is opposite to that at t t 0 05 as plotted in fig 10 c and d the same situation also can be found between the instant at t t 0 8 and 0 3 in summary the combined oscillating foil propels faster and is more efficient than the heaving or pitching foil 3 3 effect of other parameters as can be observed from the aforementioned sections the combined oscillating foil outperforms the pure heaving pitching foils in most of the parameter space comsidered in current work however it is known that the force behavior of a flapping foil is also affected by other parameters such as reynold number re das et al 2016 ashraf et al 2011 phase difference ϕ anderson et al 1998 read et al 2003 bøckmann and steen 2014 moriche et al 2017 wu et al 2015 and pivot location x p peng and zhu 2009 wang et al 2017 tian et al 2016 to further check the self propulsion performance of the combined ocsillating foil the effects of re ϕ and x p are investigated in this section the basic oscillating parameters are f 0 3 a h 0 4 a p 0 3 3 3 1 effect of reynold number the reynold number is one of the important parameters which influence the performance of flapping foils ashraf et al 2011 das et al 2016 indicated that the thrust and efficiency of a flapping foil increases with the rise of re and there exists a threshold value re 1000 above which the thrust and efficiency remains basically unvaried however the auto propulsion was not considered in the previous work thus the question about how the reynolds number influences the self propulsion performance of a flapping foil is still interested fig 13 shows the effect of re on the self propulsion performance of the combined oscillating foil and other parameters are set as ϕ 90 and x p 0 it can be seen from fig 13 a that u m increases sharply with re when r e 800 moreover the more flapping periods are needed for the foil to achieve the steady self propulsion state when the reynolds number is higher as shown in fig 13 d this is caused by the reduced viscous dissipation as the reynolds number increases arora et al 2016 however owing to the decreased viscosity effect as re increases the time histories of propulsive velocity are similar to each other when re beyond 800 consequently the cycle averaged propulsive speed maintains nearly unchanged when r e 800 and the peak value of u m 1 63 approximately occurs at re 1000 as shown in fig 13 b c p decreases firstly when r e 400 and then it increases when 400 r e 1000 and it starts to decrease again if re further increases as a result η rises significantly as re increases when r e 800 as shown in fig 13 c after that only slight change of η can be observed and the maximum efficiency about 50 3 is achieved at re 1000 as shown in fig 13 re 800 is a critical reynolds number and below which the self propulsion performance declines significantly so it means that the viscosity effect is only remarkable when r e 800 this phenomenon is consistent with the work of das et al 2016 moreover since the viscous dissipation decreases as re increases the wake structure of the combined oscillating foil will be different at different re as shown in fig 14 the number of vortices that shed during the half period gradually increases with re there is only one vortex shed at re 200 fig 14 a but two vortices shed when re is increased up to 600 fig 14 b and three vortices shed at re 1000 as shown in fig 14 c 3 3 2 effect of phase difference the phase shift between the heaving and pitching motions is another important parameter which also determines the propulsive efficiency and force generation of flapping foils anderson et al 1998 read et al 2003 bøckmann and steen 2014 moriche et al 2017 wu et al 2015 however the previous work only focuses on the performance of a fixed or hauled foil so the phase difference effect on the auto propulsion of a flapping foil is still lack of well understanding moreover the variation of phase investigated is fragmentary for example only the phase range of 70 ϕ 110 has been investigated in the work of read et al 2003 bøckmann steen just considered the phase of 40 ϕ 160 in their experiment bøckmann and steen 2014 in this section the full phase difference in the range of 0 ϕ 360 is considered fig 15 shows the self propulsion performance of the combined oscillating foil varying with ϕ other parameters are set as re 200 and x p 0 it is found that the self propelled direction is also affected by ϕ as shown in fig 15 a there exist rightward propulsion situation auto propelled in x direction with positive u m when the phase in the range of 170 ϕ 275 and leftward propulsion situation auto propelled in x direction with negative u m in the rest of phase shift region for the leftward self propulsion situation there is a largest value of u m which occurs at ϕ 60 anderson et al indicated that the phase of about 75 was optimal for the thrust generation of oscillating foil anderson et al 1998 the phase for the largest propulsive velocity in this study is close to that reported in the experimental work of anderson et al 1998 as for the rightward propulsion situation u m firstly increases and then decreases as the rise of ϕ and the highest value of u m appears at ϕ 240 as shown in fig 15 b for the leftward propulsion c p decreases firstly with the rise of ϕ and then increases with ϕ when ϕ 120 the similar trend of c p can be seen for the rightward propulsion as for the propulsive efficiency as shown in fig 15 c there are two peak values one occurs at ϕ 90 η 19 corresponding to the leftward propulsion whilst the other appears at ϕ 240 η 7 corresponding to the rightward propulsion fig 16 a shows the time histories of self propulsive velocity in the cases of ϕ 90 to 240 it is found that all the self propulsions become steady after five periods moreover the propelled direction is just determined at the beginning of propulsion this is caused by the different direction of initially generated thrust at different ϕ as shown in fig 16 b for the case of ϕ 240 the thrust coefficient maintains negative during most interval of the first period and its mean value is 0 14 this is because the instantaneous angle of attack is negative during the downstroke but positive during the upstroke as shown in fig 17 a and b consequently the x component pressure force always points to the right x direction and triggers the rightward propulsion however for the case of ϕ 90 the instantaneous angle of attack is negative during the upstroke while positive during the downstroke as shown in fig 17 c and d thus the x component pressure force points to x direction namely the positive thrust is generated as shown in fig 16 b its mean value in the first period is 0 32 which results in the actuating of leftward propulsion 3 3 3 effect of pivot location besides the reynolds number and phase difference the pivot location also is an important factor affecting the performance of flapping foils peng and zhu 2009 wang et al 2017 as reported by mackowski williamson mackowski and williamson 2017 and tian et al 2016 the thrust generation of a pitching foil varies significantly with the pivot location moreover the pivot location near the leading edge is beneficial for increasing the thrust however the previous work only focused on the performance of a pure pitching foil in the uniform incoming flow the effect of the pivot point on the self propulsion of a flapping foil is still lack of study here the combined oscillating foil with ϕ 90 and re 200 is considered the pivot location varies from the leading edge to the trailing edge i e x p c 0 1 fig 18 shows the propulsion performance of the combined flapping foil as the function of x p as can be observed from fig 18 a u m decreases smoothly as the pivot position moves toward the trailing edge this is caused by the reduction of thrust generated as shown in fig 19 a in the first period the mean thrust coefficients at x p c 0 0 4 and 0 8 are 0 32 0 26 and 0 23 respectively however as shown in fig 18 b the power coefficient reduces firstly as x p increases and then increases significantly after reaching the minimum peak at x p c 0 4 this is because the lift and torque are affected significantly by the change of pivot position as shown in fig 19 b and c when x p c 0 4 it means that the pivot location is near the center of mass since the density of the foil is uniform the peak value of torque coefficient is much smaller than that of others meanwhile the peak value of lift coefficient is also reduced as compared with other simuations consequently as shown in fig 18 c the auto propelled efficiency enhances firstly and then decreases considerably after achieving the peak value η 21 at x p c 0 4 4 conclusions the self propulsion performances of a rigid flapping foil with horizontal free in stationary fluid are investigated systematically in this work the two dimensional viscous flow over the flapping foil is simulated by an immersed boundary simplified circular function based gas kinetic method the performances of pure heaving and pure pitching foils are studied firstly and then the propulsion of the combined oscillating foil that includes both heaving and pitching motions is investigated based on the numerical results obtained it is found that the pure heaving foil always propels faster than the pure pitching foil at the same parameters and the propulsive efficiency of heaving foil is also higher than that of pitching foil in general on the other hand the combined oscillating foil can achieve higher self propulsive efficiency compared with the heaving foil in addition the auto propelled velocity of combined oscillating foil is larger than that of heaving foil generally moreover the auto propulsion performance of the combined oscillating foil is also significantly affected by the reynold number phase difference and pivot location there exists a threshold value of reynolds number re 800 and below which the self propulsion performance declines clearly on the other hand the phase difference at ϕ 90 is beneficial for achieving the highest efficiency meanwhile as the pivot point moves from the leading edge to the trailing edge the auto propelled velocity of the combined oscillating foil reduces monotonically but there exists a position near the center of mass x p c 0 4 that is good for decreasing the power consumption and increasing the efficiency significantly in summary the combined oscillating foil may be a more appropriate choice for the design of biomimetic propellers as compared with the foil conducting pure heaving pitching motion the current results may be utilized to optimize the design of propellers of micro
