22475,the k ω sst turbulence model was coupled with a homogenous cavitation model to simulate cavitating turbulent flow around a highly skewed propeller behind a ship hull the influence of the mesh resolution was investigated by an uncertainty analysis and comparisons with experimental data the main contribution in this paper is to study the cavitating flow around the propeller behind the hull by the relative vorticity transport equation and particle trajectories the results show that the present method can accurately simulate the transient cavitating flow around a marine propeller behind a hull the predicted thrust coefficients cavitation patterns and pressure fluctuations agree well with experimental data furthermore the relative vorticity transport equation was used to analyze the cavitation influence on the vorticity transport these results show that the leading edge vortex mass transfer across the liquid vapor interface and the side entrant jet significantly influence the relative vorticity distribution moreover particle trajectories were predicted using a three dimensional lagrangian technology to study the local cavitating flow structure from the lagrangian viewpoint the particle tracks demonstrate that the propeller rotation and the twisted geometry lead to a much more complex distorted flow structures keywords cavitating flow cavitation marine propeller mesh resolution vorticity transport equation particle tracks 1 introduction propellers are the most commonly used ship propulsion method but cavitation that frequently occurs on the propellers results in many undesirable effects such as noise vibrations and surface erosion these negative effects have been widely investigated to explore the driving mechanisms che et al 2019 huang et al 2019 moreover propeller cavitation together with the hull propeller interactions has significantly complicated these studies cavitating flow simulations around propellers are a powerful tool for enhancing understanding of the physical mechanisms in the complex cavitating flows especially for a marine propeller operating behind the hull numerical investigations of cavitating turbulent flows have advanced rapidly in recent years cheng et al 2019 tao et al 2018 wang et al 2018 yu et al 2019 the noticeable progress is directly linked to the developing of cavitation models which are vital for capturing the liquid vapor two phase flow features generally cavitation models can be divided into barotropic equation models bem and transport equation based models tem deshpande et al 1994 used a barotropic state law to link the density to the pressure however there are still many uncertainties related to the bem selection in addition the bem has been shown to fail to predict the vorticity generation during the collapse of a cloud cavity gopalan and katz 2000 thus tem have become the most popular method for cavitation simulations with various cavitation models proposed in the literature kunz et al 2000 passandideh fard and roohi 2008 schnerr and sauer 2001 singhal et al 2002 zwart et al 2004 singhal et al 2002 proposed a full cavitation model and applied it in a hydrofoil a cylindrical body and an orifice the cavitation models developed by schnerr and sauer 2001 and zwart et al 2004 have been widely used in cavitation studies due to their good robustness and accuracy roohi et al 2015 zahiri and roohi 2019 pendar and roohi 2016 2018 used the schnerr and sauer cavitation model to investigate the cavitation and supercavitation around a sphere hemispherical head form body and conical cavitator well predictions about the cavitation suppressing instability and the correlation between the cavity length and geometry diameter have been presented wang et al 2017 used zwart cavitation model to study the cavitating flow around a blunt axisymmetric body together with the influence of a free surface to show that non condensable air can help the cavity grow larger wu et al 2018 used the zwart cavitation model to investigate unsteady cloud cavitation around a marine propeller their results showed that the modeled cavitation behavior was in good agreement with experimental observations and propeller loading noise and cavitation noise had been predicted owing to these successful predictions of cavitating flows and good calculation robustness bai et al 2018 long et al 2019 the zwart cavitation model is also used in this study cavitating flows around a propeller are generally high reynolds number flows and the turbulence model choice significantly affects the model accuracy direct numerical simulation has been successfully used for simple turbulence flows but is not practical for cavitating flows around marine propellers many numerical studies have used large eddy simulation les the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans or hybrid les rans methods these methods have been used to study the cavitation influence on the propeller flow structures les has been used to simulate complex flows around the propeller and has been shown to be capable of accurately modeling complex flows around propellers such as cavitating flows around highly skewed propellers lu et al 2014 and propeller wake instabilities kumar and mahesh 2017 however les require complex rigorous mesh generation and long calculation time so many researchers have used rans or hybrid les rans models with inspiring results presented in the literature di et al 2014 used the detached eddy simulation des method to study the propeller wake dynamics baek et al 2015 provided a numerical investigation of the effect of the advance ratio on the wake characteristics with the k ω sst turbulence model with the results agreeing reasonably well with experimental data ji et al 2012a presented unsteady simulations of cavitating flow around a model propeller using the k ω sst turbulence model the cavitating flow including the sheet cavitation and tip vortex cavitation were well reproduced with the study showing that the cavity volume changes were the main exciting source of the far field pressure fluctuations francisco et al 2016 established a quantitative correlation and model between the pressure fluctuations and cavity changes using a high speed camera and data processing further although the interactions of the propeller hull make the numerical simulation more difficult it is needed to provide useful results for practical applications paik et al 2013 simulated the cavitating flow and hull pressure fluctuations for a marine propeller behind a hull using the rans method their predictions agreed well with experimental observations of cavitation as well as the hull pressure fluctuations han et al 2018 used an integral calculation technology to simulate the cavitating flow around a marine propeller behind a ship hull the time evolution of the unsteady cavitation and the cavitation induced hull pressure fluctuation were effectively reproduced if compared to experimental data the detailed flow structures around complex hull and propeller geometries are difficult to capture however numerical investigations of the cavitating flow around a propeller operating behind a ship hull are very important for engineering applications and the propeller hull interactions are worth exploring the k ω sst turbulence model was used to model the propeller cavity in this study based on the reported accuracies of previous studies in addition further understanding of these complex flows requires new methods to investigate the cavitating flows around a propeller behind a hull the vorticity transport equation and the lagrangian method have been found to be useful methods for studying cavitating flows but few studies have used these methods in propeller cavitation ji et al 2015 studied cavitation vorticity interactions around the naca66 hydrofoil using the vorticity transport equation and they revealed that the mass transfer increased the vortex dilatation on the cavity surface and the baroclinic torque was very important along the liquid vapor interface the vorticity transport equation has been widely used in cavitation investigations of the flows around hydrofoils ji et al 2017 and waterjet pumps huang et al 2015 the lagrangian method has recently been widely used to investigate cavitating flow structures haller 2015 especially for cavitating flows around a hydrofoil wu et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 wu et al 2016 analyzed the lagrangian coherent structures around a pitching hydrofoil to clearly show the transient flow structures and vortical structures long et al 2017a used a three dimension lagrangian method to study cavity shedding by a side entrant jet and a re entrant jet with the interactions between the cavitation and the vortex analyzed cheng et al 2018 the lagrangian method can show the particle tracks and identify flow structures but few researches have used particle tracking to study the flow structures around propellers especially with the propeller operating behind a hull thus this study acquires more knowledge of propeller cavitation using the vorticity transport equation and the lagrangian method this study extends these previous investigations with numerical simulations of unsteady cavitating flows around a highly skewed propeller behind a hull the k ω sst turbulence model coupled with the zwart cavitation model is used the cavitating flows around the propeller are modeled behind a hull with structured grids the influence of the mesh resolution was investigated using three systematic refined meshes the cavitation influences on the vorticity transport were investigated with the relative vorticity transport equation and the flow structures around the propeller were analyzed using the particle trajectories from the lagrangian viewpoint the main contribution in this paper is to study the unsteady cavitating flow around the marine propeller operating behind the hull by the relative vorticity transport equation and particle trajectories 2 numerical methods and models 2 1 governing equations the governing equations for numerical simulations of cavitating flow around a propeller for two phase flow with the homogeneous assumption are 1 ρ m t ρ m u j x j 0 2 ρ m u i t ρ m u i u j x j ρ f i p x i x j μ m μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 u k x k δ i j the fluid is

dynamic viscosity which can be scaled by the vapor volume fraction α v 3 ρ m ρ v α v ρ l 1 α v 4 μ m μ v α v μ l 1 α v where subscripts l and v denote the liquid and vapor phases 2 2 k ω sst turbulence model the k ω sst turbulence model was developed by menter 1994 to improve predictions of adverse pressure gradient flows its advantages in predicting cavitating flows around rotating machinery have been widely validated baek et al 2015 huang et al 2015 ji et al 2012a the k ω sst turbulence model uses a blending function f 1 to blend the k ω model in the near wall region with the k

model zwart et al 2004 was employed to capture the two phase flow features caused by cavitation as in the present study the mass transfer is dealt with the vapor transport equation with two source terms on the right side as 14 ρ v α v t ρ v α v u j x j m m the mass change rate in a single bubble is combined with the simplified rayleigh plesset equation to close equation 14 with the vaporization and condensation source terms finally given as 15 m f vap 3 α nuc 1 α v ρ v r 2 3 p v p ρ l 16 m f cond 3 α v ρ v r 2 3 p v p ρ l the model parameters are 17 r 1 10 6 m 18 α nuc 2 10 3 19 f vap 50 20 f cond 0 01 the nucleation site volume fraction α nuc should be suitably modified as there was a significant amount of non condensable gas in the experiments inspired by the optimization investigation of morgut and nobile 2011 to define α nuc for various cavitation models α nuc was adjusted here until the calculation gave a good balance between predicting the well pressure fluctuations and good convergence then α nuc was set a constant for all the meshes and calculations α nuc in the original zwart cavitation model was 5 10 4 and was modified to 2 10 3 in this study based on many tests the cavity patterns around the propeller for these two values of α nuc are shown in fig 1 the differences between experimental data and the predicted first blade frequency components of the pressure fluctuations at monitoring points p1 p2 p3 and p4 on the hull surface shown in fig 2 are presented in table 1 the differences are defined as predicted value experimental value experimental value the details of the three systematic refined meshes mesh 1 mesh 2 and mesh 3 used for the mesh influence study are listed in table 2 the cavity is larger along the propeller radius in the chord length direction for setup 1 the results show that the differences are all lower for the larger α nuc in table 1 further investigation showed that the predicted cavities and pressure fluctuations agree well with the experimental data for setup 1 as shown in section 5 1 3 experimental data the cavitation areas and pressure fluctuations were measured by the china ship scientific research center cssrc the ship model was installed in a large cavitation channel the hull and propeller models are shown in fig 3 the model propeller diameter d m was 0 253 m the designed waterline breadth b was 1 35 m and the designed waterline length l wl was about 9 m the propeller rotation propeller rotation direction is to the right and the pressure monitoring points are shown in fig 2 the pressure monitoring points were all arranged on the hull surface above the propeller the locations of these pressure monitoring points shown in fig 2 were obtained by projecting the hull onto the horizontal plane 4 computational methods a full hull body was used in the calculations to accurately predict the transient non uniform wake to reproduce the unsteady cavitating flow around the propeller the computational domain is shown in fig 4 which was divided into a rotating part including the propeller and inner domain and a stationary part including the ship hull and outer domain the rotating and stationary domains were joined together by ggi interfaces the propeller rotational speed n was the same as in the experiments n 28 rps the rotating domain diameter was 1 2d m a smaller rectangular domain surrounding the hull visible in fig 4 is for a highly refined mesh around the ship hull compared to the coarser outer domain mesh this refined mesh better captures the turbulent flow around the hull while reducing the total number of elements the distance between the side of the smaller rectangular domain and the hull surface was about 0 5b the inlet boundary was 1l wl upstream of the bow and the pressure outlet boundary was 2l wl downstream of the stern the two sides and bottom which were modeled as free slip walls were 1l wl away from ship surface the free surface was set as a symmetry boundary condition the hull propeller and hub surfaces were all set as no slip walls the inlet velocity was adjusted until the modeled and measured thrust coefficients were almost equal with a final value of u 6 6 m s the thrust coefficient k t is defined as k t t ρ l n 2 d m 4 where t is propeller thrust the reynolds number re 1 3 106 is defined as c 0 7 r u 2 0 7 π n d m 2 ν where c 0 7r is chord length at 0 7r and v is the water kinetic viscosity detailed results for the modeled and measured thrust coefficients are given later the outlet boundary pressure was derived from the cavitation number σ n 0 8 r p out p v 0 5 ρ l 0 8 π n d m 2 0 2493 which was based on the location at 0 8r on the blade position at 0 12 o clock all the domains were generated with hexahedral grids typical meshes around the hull and propeller are shown in fig 5 the meshes were especially refined in the rotating domain and in the stern region the rotating domain was generated with hexahedral elements as a whole without any interfaces the rectangular domain surrounding the hull was divided into three parts to improve the whole grid quality as shown in fig 4 the three parts were joined together with few differences between the mesh interfaces as shown in fig 5 the same grid topology was used to generate the three refined meshes with a mesh refinement ratio of 2 to investigate the cavitating flow around the propeller the unsteady cavitation calculations were started from the convergent non cavitating results the transient rotor stator model was used in the unsteady calculations the time dependent governing equations were discretized in both space and time the high resolution is arranged for the advection term with the central difference scheme for the diffusion terms in the governing equations the unsteady second order implicit formation was used for the unsteady terms 30 inner iterations per time step with a 10 3 residual criterion were used for the unsteady calculations and a 10 6 residual criterion for the initial non cavitating calculations the unsteady simulations used 5 per time step for the first two revolutions and then 1 per time step for the next 8 revolutions these transient results during the first 10 revolutions were not used to remove the influence of the initial conditions and 10 more revolutions calculated with 1 per time step have been retained to get the results presented at the discussion and for mesh 1 with largest number of elements 20 propeller revolutions were calculated by 2 threads with 32 processers spending about 1 month on the supercomputing system 5 results and discussion 5 1 influence of mesh resolution an uncertainty analysis was used to assess the accuracy of the numerical results based on the procedure recommended by the international towing tank conference ittc and our previous studies long et al 2017b 2018b the numerical uncertainty u n can be estimated using the grid convergence index gci method proposed by roache 1998 numerical error occurs in every computing simulation but it is difficult to know the true value of numerical error so the estimated numerical error will generally be converted into numerical uncertainty and we can use this to know the calculation accuracy information usually three systematic refined meshes are required to calculate the numerical uncertainty from numerical error with gci method the convergence ration r is used and it is defined as r ϕ 2 ϕ 1 ϕ 3 ϕ 2 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 correspond to the solutions by fine medium and coarse meshes respectively monotonic convergence has achieved when 0 r 1 monotonic convergence was needed on three systematic refined meshes to use gci to estimate the numerical uncertainty more detailed information has been presented in our previous study long et al 2017b the three refined meshes detailed in table 2 were used to predict the thrust coefficients and numerical uncertainty shown in table 3 the differences in table 3 were defined as predicted value experimental value experimental value the thrust coefficients predicted using the three meshes are all very close to the experimental results the predictions show that the calculated k t is monotonic convergence and approaches a constant value as the mesh is refined the numerical uncertainty is quite small so these results illustrate the reliability of these numerical methods the propeller inlet velocity distribution significantly influences the propeller cavitation the wake fields predicted using the three meshes are shown in fig 6 the contours in fig 6 are the dimensionless averaged axial velocity u x u with the velocity vectors normalized to only denote the local velocity direction the horizontal axis y l wl and the vertical axis z l wl denote the dimensionless distances from the ship center line and the designed waterline the wake fields predicted by meshes 1 2 and 3 are similar with some small differences with the more refined meshes the velocity changes become sharper and the wake is much more non uniform the results indicate that the predicted cavitation in fig 7 becomes more turbulent and unstable in fig 7 it compares the predicted instantaneous cavitation regions around the propeller with the experimental observations during the propeller rotation the experimental data in this paper are provided by cssrc the cavitation patterns were visualized by the iso surface of the vapor volume fraction α v 0 1 the six black lines along each blade surface denote the intersections between the blade surface and cylindrical surface of 0 5r 0 6r 0 7r 0 8r 0 9r and 0 95r fig 7 shows four snapshots of the cavity for propeller rotations from 0 to 60 with increments of 20 when the propeller enters the wake field at the blade position of 0 the sheet cavity begins to grow from the leading edge from 0 to 40 the sheet cavity develops and the trailing of cavity gradually rolls up into the tip vortex the sheet cavity is seen to move away from the blade surface due to the side entrant jet effect with the sheet cavity in the trailing intermediate cavity region growing into a partial cloud cavity at the blade angle position of 60 the propeller moves out of the non uniform hull wake and the tip vortex cavity is visible in addition the unstable cavitation is clearer with the more refined mesh the instability is closely related to the inlet velocity distribution in front of the propeller illustrated by the hull wake distribution in fig 6 the tip vortex cavitation can be clearly seen at the 60 blade position in meshes 1 and 2 comparison of the predictions with the experimental data shows that the unsteady cavity patterns are reasonably well reproduced by the present method even although there is some over prediction of the cavitation in the middle region of the blade leading edge this might be due to slightly excessive prediction of the non uniform wake at the propeller inflow these over predictions of cavity extent have been however reported in many computations even without operating behind hull bensow and bark 2010 the changes of the cavity volume lead to large pressure fluctuations during propeller rotation the predicted and measured pressure fluctuations at monitoring points p1 p2 p3 and p4 are shown in fig 8 the fluctuating pressure amplitudes in fig 8 show the first blade frequency components of the pressure fluctuations obtained using fast fourier transforms the results show that the measured pressure fluctuations are well reproduced by the numerical calculations moreover the predictions illustrate that the monitoring pressure fluctuates more as the number of elements increases ji et al 2012a 2012b showed that the far field pressure fluctuations are excited by the cavity volume acceleration the calculated total cavity volume for mesh 2 the pressure fluctuations at p1 and the cavity volume acceleration for mesh 2 are shown in fig 9 the fluctuating pressure is characterized by a dimensionless number as 21 k p p 0 p out ρ l n 2 d m 2 where p 0 is the fluctuating pressure at the monitoring point the total cavity volume v cav is calculated as 22 v cav i 1 n α i v i where n is the total number of mesh cells α i is the vapor volume fraction in each cell and v i is the volume of each cell fig 9 shows that the pressure changes as the cavity volume acceleration changes which verifies that the far field pressure fluctuation on the hull surface is highly related to the cavity volume changes the curve crests and troughs of the fluctuating pressures in fig 9 b are labeled with t1 and t2 with the same moments indicated by t1 and t2 in fig 9 a for the total cavity volume in fig 10 it shows the cavity patterns corresponding to the curve crest t1 and curve trough t2 on the fluctuating pressure curve in fig 9 b points t1 and t2 are very closed to the blade angles of 0 and 40 in fig 7 thus the pressure crest at t1 is directly linked to the sharp change in the cavitation area when the propeller enters the hull wake from t1 to t2 the sheet cavitation develops from the blade leading edge to the trailing edge as the propeller rotates from t2 to the next crest the cavity size decreases and another new sheet cavitation grows along the next blade a correlation coefficient is used to quantitatively analyze the relationship between the pressure fluctuations and the cavity volume acceleration the correlation coefficient between two signals x t and y t is given as 23 c o r r x y i 1 h x i x y i y i 1 h x i x 2 i 1 h y i y 2 1 c o r r x y 1 where x and y are the two target signals the second derivative of the calculated cavity volume and the dimensionless fluctuating pressure h is the number of target variables and the over bar means the averaged value the data for the last five revolutions was used to calculate the correlation coefficient with the results given in table 4 if corr x y 1 the two target variables are linearly related while if corr x y 0 they are unrelated the results in table 4 show that the correlation coefficient relating the cavity volume change and dimensionless fluctuating pressure is very high which verifies that the far field pressure fluctuations are strongly correlated with the second derivative of the cavity volume the correlation coefficients decrease with increasing number of elements and with the distance of the monitoring point away from the ship center line the predicted cavity volume changes and pressure fluctuations at monitoring point p1 for all three meshes are shown in fig 11 these show that the pressure fluctuation amplitude increases with increasing number of elements the curve of the second derivative of the cavity volume fluctuates more and is rougher as the number of elements increases while the pressure fluctuation curves are very smooth for all three meshes this shows that the differences between the cavity volume changes and the pressure fluctuations increase with increasing number of elements which then reduces the correlation coefficient for more elements 5 2 analysis of the cavitation influence on the vorticity the investigations in section 5 1 show that mesh 2 can well simulate the cavitating flow around the propeller as a balance between the numerical accuracy and the calculation time therefore the predictions using mesh 2 are used in the following discussion the vorticity has been shown to be strongly influenced by the complex unsteady cavitation around hydrofoils through use of the vorticity transport equation ji et al 2015 2017 the effect of the cavitation around a propeller seen in this study on the vorticity is also investigated using the relative vorticity transport equation the curl of the incompressible navier stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates gives the relative vorticity transport equation as 24 ω r e l t ω r e l ω r e l ω r e l ω r e l 1 ρ m 2 ρ m p 2 ω u r e l ν 2 ω r e l ω ω r ν 2 ω r where subscript rel indicates the relative coordinate i e cylindrical coordinates in this paper ω r e l is the relative vorticity u r e l is the relative velocity and ν is the kinematic viscosity since ω is constant in this study ω 28 rps the last two terms in equation 24 ω ω r and ν 2 ω r are equal to zero the simplified relative vorticity transport equation is then 25 ω r e l t ω r e l ω r e l ω r e l ω r e l 1 ρ m 2 ρ m p 2 ω u r e l ν 2 ω r e l in equation 25 the first term on the right side is the relative vortex stretching term which denotes the effect of vortex stretching and tilting by the velocity gradients the second term on the right is the relative vortex dilation due to the volumetric expansion or contraction the last three terms on the right are the baroclinic torque term due to misaligned pressure and mixture density gradients the coriolis force term due to the rotation and the viscous diffusion effect ν 2 ω r e l leads to relative vorticity diffusion by the viscous effect in the high reynolds numbers flows in this study this term has little effect the interactions between the cavitation and vorticity are shown by the predictions in figs 12 15 fig 12 shows a sketch of planes s1 s2 s3 and s4 and the cylindrical coordinate planes s1 s4 denote four parallel surfaces with each perpendicular to the x axis the x coordinates of these planes are x s1 0 2d m x s2 0 16d m x s3 0 12d m x s4 0 1d m the relationship between the cartesian coordinates x y z and the cylindrical coordinates x r θ are also shown in fig 12 fig 13 shows a sketch of the angular evolution of the cavitation visualized by the vapor volume fraction contours using plane s1 for example in fig 13 six transient results are combined into one figure with the results for the propeller rotating from 10 to 40 enlarged on the right side the results in fig 14 were obtained by the process as in fig 13 the top blade regions within these enlarged figures correspond to the blade leading edge for s1 s2 and s3 and near the blade tip for s4 in fig 14 it shows the predicted vapor volume fractions and contours of the vortex stretching vortex dilatation coriolis force and baroclinic torque terms on the s1 s2 s3 and s4 planes in cylindrical coordinates each contour is the combination of six instantaneous numerical results for angle θ from 10 to 40 as shown in fig 14 when the main flow moves from the s1 to the s4 plane the largest cavitation region moves from 10 in fig 14 a to 40 in fig 14 d as the cavity changes from a slender to a plump shape the distributions of the four vortex terms show the same tendency thus the vorticity distribution and its transport are significantly influenced by the cavitation in fig 14 the relative vorticity occurs mainly at the liquid vapor interface and in the cavity shedding wake while it is small inside the attached cavity the results in fig 15 are likely to demonstrate this phenomenon fig 15 shows contours of the vapor volume fraction and the radial velocity u r for θ 20 on the s2 plane the velocity gradient becomes much larger along the liquid vapor interface and near the cavity shedding region while it is suppressed inside the cavity these factors lead to the relative vorticity distribution in fig 14 the side entrant jet has been also revealed in fig 15 which results the cavity separating from the blade surface the vortex stretching term in fig 14 is larger than the other three terms in the top region along the liquid vapor interface and in the cavity shedding region while it is much smaller inside the cavity the leading edge vortex and sheet cavity significantly increase the vortex stretching term from s1 to s3 the shrunken but strong tip vortex however is the dominant influence on the vortex stretching term distribution on s4 lars 2018 showed that vortex stretching and tilting will increase the fluid element rotation rate and increase the velocity fluctuations which means that the pressure decreases in the vortex core with increases of the turbulence as shown in fig 14 the cavitation prevents the pressure decrease in the vortex core and suppresses the vortex generation however the highly unsteady processes of cavity shedding and mass transfer along the cavity surface promote the vortex generation and turbulence the vortex stretching term distribution along the blade pressure side on plane s3 has a zigzag configuration characterized by alternating positive and negative values this may be caused by the relative vorticity changes or the velocity transformation from cartesian to cylinder coordinates which needs further investigation the vortex dilatation is directly linked to the velocity divergence while the baroclinic torque is related to the pressure and density gradients the effects of the vortex dilatation and baroclinic torque are significant along the cavity surface and in the cavity shedding region on s3 and s4 the baroclinic torque is sometimes much larger in the top region and in the region influenced by the side entrant jet due to the misalignment of the large density and pressure gradients the non zero velocity divergence caused by the cavitation and the misalignment between the density and pressure gradients make the vortex dilatation and baroclinic torque terms both very important as significant source terms generating the vorticity and modifying the vorticity field in cavitating flows the coriolis force term is quite small and can be neglected compared with the other three terms 5 3 particle trajectories showing the flow structure around the propeller particle trajectories computed using the lagrangian method provide useful visualization of the cavitating flow which has recently been used extensively to identify local cavitating flows around hydrofoils long et al 2018a wu et al 2016 this study visualized the particle trajectories to study the three dimensional flow around the propeller behind the hull the particle trajectories were derived from the existing eulerian flow field the mesh 3 results were used to visualize the particle tracks as a balance between the computational times and the flow visualization needs in fig 16 it shows the initial locations of the three groups of particles group a group b and group c at time t0 the group a particles were mainly initially located around the blade tip the group b particles were mainly located in the middle of the sheet cavitation and the group c particles were mainly located in the initial part of the sheet cavitation the blade rotation at t0 is about 20 as shown in fig 7 the three groups of particles tracks are shown in figs 17 19 as the propeller rotates from t0 to t53 only part of the results are presented for convenience the particle locations cannot be easily followed as the propeller rotates and the particles move therefore the particles tracks are drawn as black lines for each particle from t0 to t53 with the red circles indicating the locations at each time in the figures the propeller is semitransparent to avoid obstructing the particles tracks in fig 17 these particles rotate rapidly away from the blade tip as the propeller rotates due to the influence of the blade tip vortex the strongest particle rotation occurs in the intermediate region indicated by the green dotted arrow in fig 17 within group a with the upper and lower particles in group a rotating much more slowly most of the particles stop rotating after t29 in fig 17 from t29 to t53 the particles move to a quite wider space dispersedly rather than rotating and gathering together indicated by the orange dotted arrow in fig 17 this change from t0 to t53 is directly linked to the tip vortex the tip vortex is transported to the far wake region in the experiments but is significantly weaker in the flow predictions so its influence rapidly declines due to the insufficient mesh resolution and the numerical dissipation in fig 18 the upper particles in group b indicated by the green dotted arrow in fig 18 initially rotate slowly and finally stop rotating at t39 while the lower particles indicated by the orange dotted arrow in fig 18 are transported by the main flow with almost no rotation from t0 to t53 the lower particles at t0 are transported to a much larger propeller radius in the end however the height of the upper particles increases only a little from the initial to final locations so some of the lower particles end up higher than the upper particles at t53 a similar phenomenon is observed in fig 19 with the lower particles of group c at t0 moving higher in the end however the group c upper particles move more rapidly and go much further in the chordwise direction than the lower particles this may be related to the propeller rotation and the twisted propeller geometry with the angle of attack increasing with the larger propeller radius earlier studies cheng et al 2018 long et al 2018a indicated that large scale cavity shedding around a hydrofoil strongly impacted the particle tracks however the unsteady cavitating flow around the propeller in this study shows less influence on the particles than the hydrofoil cavitation the unsteady cavitation has an important influence on the initial particle tracks near the initial locations for these three groups but the influence decreases rapidly when the particles move away from the propeller surface as the propeller rotating at other regions away from the initial locations for these three groups the strongly distorted and rotating flow due to the propeller rotation and the twisted propeller has a greater effect on the particle motion than the cavitation 6 conclusions the k ω sst turbulence model was coupled with a homogenous cavitation model to simulate unsteady cavitating flows around a highly skewed propeller operating behind the hull the influence of the mesh resolution is discussed in detail the effects of cavitation on the relative vorticity were investigated using the relative vorticity transport equation with the flow structure around the propeller investigated using particle tracks the main conclusions are 1 the numerical uncertainty in the predicted thrust coefficients shown by the gci method is very small the simulated thrust coefficient k t approaches a constant as the mesh is refined the hull wake fields predicted by the three meshes are very non uniform the hydrodynamics of the highly skewed propeller behind the hull are correctly reproduced by the calculations 2 the predicted cavity patterns agree well with experimental observations with some over prediction of the cavity size the results show the sheet cavity shedding from the blade surface caused by the side entrant jet the predicted pressure fluctuations also agree well with experimental data the magnitudes of the predicted pressure fluctuations increase a small amount as the mesh is refined furthermore the results show that the far field pressure fluctuations are strongly correlated with the cavity volume changes with very high correlation coefficients the correlation coefficient decreases as the number of elements increases but the predicted unsteady cavitating flows becomes more turbulent 3 the simplified relative vorticity transport equation was used to analyze the cavitation influence on the flow structure around the propeller the relative vorticity mainly develops along the blade leading edge the liquid vapor interface and in the cavity shedding region with almost negligible magnitude inside the attached cavity the vortex stretching term is larger than the other terms along the blade leading edge and in the cavity shedding region but is much small inside the cavity the leading edge vortex the mass transfer across the liquid vapor interface and the side entrant jet all significantly influence the vorticity distribution and transport in addition the cavitation prevents the pressure decrease in the vortex core and suppresses the vortex growth while the cavity shedding promotes the vortex generation and flow unsteadiness the vortex dilatation has a significant effect along the liquid cavity surface the baroclinic torque plays an important role in the cavitation wake due to the high misalignment of the density and pressure gradients the coriolis force has little effect compared with the other three terms 4 the particle trajectory was also used to investigate the cavitating flow around the propeller behind a hull from the lagrangian viewpoint the blade tip vortex has a large impact on the particle tracks and causes the particles to rapidly rotate away from the blade surface in group a in groups b and c due to the influence of propeller rotation and the twisted propeller geometry the lower particles are transported and delivered out along the propeller radius and some of the initially lower particles even reach higher locations than the initially upper particles the upper particles move more rapidly and go much further in the chordwise direction

22475,the k ω sst turbulence model was coupled with a homogenous cavitation model to simulate cavitating turbulent flow around a highly skewed propeller behind a ship hull the influence of the mesh resolution was investigated by an uncertainty analysis and comparisons with experimental data the main contribution in this paper is to study the cavitating flow around the propeller behind the hull by the relative vorticity transport equation and particle trajectories the results show that the present method can accurately simulate the transient cavitating flow around a marine propeller behind a hull the predicted thrust coefficients cavitation patterns and pressure fluctuations agree well with experimental data furthermore the relative vorticity transport equation was used to analyze the cavitation influence on the vorticity transport these results show that the leading edge vortex mass transfer across the liquid vapor interface and the side entrant jet significantly influence the relative vorticity distribution moreover particle trajectories were predicted using a three dimensional lagrangian technology to study the local cavitating flow structure from the lagrangian viewpoint the particle tracks demonstrate that the propeller rotation and the twisted geometry lead to a much more complex distorted flow structures keywords cavitating flow cavitation marine propeller mesh resolution vorticity transport equation particle tracks 1 introduction propellers are the most commonly used ship propulsion method but cavitation that frequently occurs on the propellers results in many undesirable effects such as noise vibrations and surface erosion these negative effects have been widely investigated to explore the driving mechanisms che et al 2019 huang et al 2019 moreover propeller cavitation together with the hull propeller interactions has significantly complicated these studies cavitating flow simulations around propellers are a powerful tool for enhancing understanding of the physical mechanisms in the complex cavitating flows especially for a marine propeller operating behind the hull numerical investigations of cavitating turbulent flows have advanced rapidly in recent years cheng et al 2019 tao et al 2018 wang et al 2018 yu et al 2019 the noticeable progress is directly linked to the developing of cavitation models which are vital for capturing the liquid vapor two phase flow features generally cavitation models can be divided into barotropic equation models bem and transport equation based models tem deshpande et al 1994 used a barotropic state law to link the density to the pressure however there are still many uncertainties related to the bem selection in addition the bem has been shown to fail to predict the vorticity generation during the collapse of a cloud cavity gopalan and katz 2000 thus tem have become the most popular method for cavitation simulations with various cavitation models proposed in the literature kunz et al 2000 passandideh fard and roohi 2008 schnerr and sauer 2001 singhal et al 2002 zwart et al 2004 singhal et al 2002 proposed a full cavitation model and applied it in a hydrofoil a cylindrical body and an orifice the cavitation models developed by schnerr and sauer 2001 and zwart et al 2004 have been widely used in cavitation studies due to their good robustness and accuracy roohi et al 2015 zahiri and roohi 2019 pendar and roohi 2016 2018 used the schnerr and sauer cavitation model to investigate the cavitation and supercavitation around a sphere hemispherical head form body and conical cavitator well predictions about the cavitation suppressing instability and the correlation between the cavity length and geometry diameter have been presented wang et al 2017 used zwart cavitation model to study the cavitating flow around a blunt axisymmetric body together with the influence of a free surface to show that non condensable air can help the cavity grow larger wu et al 2018 used the zwart cavitation model to investigate unsteady cloud cavitation around a marine propeller their results showed that the modeled cavitation behavior was in good agreement with experimental observations and propeller loading noise and cavitation noise had been predicted owing to these successful predictions of cavitating flows and good calculation robustness bai et al 2018 long et al 2019 the zwart cavitation model is also used in this study cavitating flows around a propeller are generally high reynolds number flows and the turbulence model choice significantly affects the model accuracy direct numerical simulation has been successfully used for simple turbulence flows but is not practical for cavitating flows around marine propellers many numerical studies have used large eddy simulation les the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans or hybrid les rans methods these methods have been used to study the cavitation influence on the propeller flow structures les has been used to simulate complex flows around the propeller and has been shown to be capable of accurately modeling complex flows around propellers such as cavitating flows around highly skewed propellers lu et al 2014 and propeller wake instabilities kumar and mahesh 2017 however les require complex rigorous mesh generation and long calculation time so many researchers have used rans or hybrid les rans models with inspiring results presented in the literature di et al 2014 used the detached eddy simulation des method to study the propeller wake dynamics baek et al 2015 provided a numerical investigation of the effect of the advance ratio on the wake characteristics with the k ω sst turbulence model with the results agreeing reasonably well with experimental data ji et al 2012a presented unsteady simulations of cavitating flow around a model propeller using the k ω sst turbulence model the cavitating flow including the sheet cavitation and tip vortex cavitation were well reproduced with the study showing that the cavity volume changes were the main exciting source of the far field pressure fluctuations francisco et al 2016 established a quantitative correlation and model between the pressure fluctuations and cavity changes using a high speed camera and data processing further although the interactions of the propeller hull make the numerical simulation more difficult it is needed to provide useful results for practical applications paik et al 2013 simulated the cavitating flow and hull pressure fluctuations for a marine propeller behind a hull using the rans method their predictions agreed well with experimental observations of cavitation as well as the hull pressure fluctuations han et al 2018 used an integral calculation technology to simulate the cavitating flow around a marine propeller behind a ship hull the time evolution of the unsteady cavitation and the cavitation induced hull pressure fluctuation were effectively reproduced if compared to experimental data the detailed flow structures around complex hull and propeller geometries are difficult to capture however numerical investigations of the cavitating flow around a propeller operating behind a ship hull are very important for engineering applications and the propeller hull interactions are worth exploring the k ω sst turbulence model was used to model the propeller cavity in this study based on the reported accuracies of previous studies in addition further understanding of these complex flows requires new methods to investigate the cavitating flows around a propeller behind a hull the vorticity transport equation and the lagrangian method have been found to be useful methods for studying cavitating flows but few studies have used these methods in propeller cavitation ji et al 2015 studied cavitation vorticity interactions around the naca66 hydrofoil using the vorticity transport equation and they revealed that the mass transfer increased the vortex dilatation on the cavity surface and the baroclinic torque was very important along the liquid vapor interface the vorticity transport equation has been widely used in cavitation investigations of the flows around hydrofoils ji et al 2017 and waterjet pumps huang et al 2015 the lagrangian method has recently been widely used to investigate cavitating flow structures haller 2015 especially for cavitating flows around a hydrofoil wu et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 wu et al 2016 analyzed the lagrangian coherent structures around a pitching hydrofoil to clearly show the transient flow structures and vortical structures long et al 2017a used a three dimension lagrangian method to study cavity shedding by a side entrant jet and a re entrant jet with the interactions between the cavitation and the vortex analyzed cheng et al 2018 the lagrangian method can show the particle tracks and identify flow structures but few researches have used particle tracking to study the flow structures around propellers especially with the propeller operating behind a hull thus this study acquires more knowledge of propeller cavitation using the vorticity transport equation and the lagrangian method this study extends these previous investigations with numerical simulations of unsteady cavitating flows around a highly skewed propeller behind a hull the k ω sst turbulence model coupled with the zwart cavitation model is used the cavitating flows around the propeller are modeled behind a hull with structured grids the influence of the mesh resolution was investigated using three systematic refined meshes the cavitation influences on the vorticity transport were investigated with the relative vorticity transport equation and the flow structures around the propeller were analyzed using the particle trajectories from the lagrangian viewpoint the main contribution in this paper is to study the unsteady cavitating flow around the marine propeller operating behind the hull by the relative vorticity transport equation and particle trajectories 2 numerical methods and models 2 1 governing equations the governing equations for numerical simulations of cavitating

turbulence model the k ω sst turbulence model was developed by menter 1994 to improve predictions of adverse pressure gradient flows its advantages in predicting cavitating flows around rotating machinery have been widely validated baek et al 2015 huang et al 2015 ji et al 2012a the k ω sst turbulence model uses a blending function f 1 to blend the k ω model in the near wall region with the k

model zwart et al 2004 was employed to capture the two phase flow features caused by cavitation as in the present study the mass transfer is dealt with the vapor transport equation with two source terms on the right side as 14 ρ v α v t ρ v α v u j x j m m the mass change rate in a single bubble is combined with the simplified rayleigh plesset equation to close equation 14 with the vaporization

f cond 0 01 the nucleation site volume fraction α nuc should be suitably modified as there was a significant amount of non condensable gas in the experiments inspired by the optimization investigation of morgut and nobile 2011 to define α nuc for various cavitation models α nuc was adjusted here until the calculation gave a good balance between predicting the well pressure fluctuations and good convergence then α nuc was set a constant for all the meshes and calculations α nuc in the original zwart cavitation model was 5 10 4 and was modified to 2 10 3 in this study based on many tests the cavity patterns around the propeller for these two values of α nuc are shown in fig 1 the differences between experimental data and the predicted first blade frequency components of the pressure fluctuations at monitoring points p1 p2 p3 and p4 on the hull surface shown in fig 2 are presented in table 1 the differences are defined as predicted value experimental value experimental value the details of the three systematic refined meshes mesh 1 mesh 2 and mesh 3 used for the mesh influence study are listed in table 2 the cavity is larger along the propeller radius in the chord length direction for setup 1 the results show that the differences are all lower for the larger α nuc in table 1 further investigation showed that the predicted cavities and pressure fluctuations agree well with the experimental data for setup 1 as shown in section 5 1 3 experimental data the cavitation areas and pressure fluctuations were measured by the china ship scientific research center cssrc the ship model was installed in a large cavitation channel the hull and propeller models are shown in fig 3 the model propeller diameter d m was 0 253 m the designed waterline breadth b was 1 35 m and the designed waterline length l wl was about 9 m the propeller rotation propeller rotation direction is to the right and the pressure monitoring points are shown in fig 2 the pressure monitoring points were all arranged on the hull surface above the propeller the locations of these pressure monitoring points shown in fig 2 were obtained by projecting the hull onto the horizontal plane 4 computational methods a full hull body was used in the calculations to accurately predict the transient non uniform wake to reproduce the unsteady cavitating flow around the propeller the computational domain is shown in fig 4 which was divided into a rotating part including the propeller and inner domain and a stationary part including the ship hull and outer domain the rotating and stationary domains were joined together by ggi interfaces the propeller rotational speed n was the same as in the experiments n 28 rps the rotating domain diameter was 1 2d m a smaller rectangular domain surrounding the hull visible in fig 4 is for a highly refined mesh around the ship hull compared to the coarser outer domain mesh this refined mesh better captures the turbulent flow around the hull while reducing the total number of elements the distance between the side of the smaller rectangular domain and the hull surface was about 0 5b the inlet boundary was 1l wl upstream of the bow and the pressure outlet boundary was 2l wl downstream of the stern the two sides and bottom which were modeled as free slip walls were 1l wl away from ship surface the free surface was set as a symmetry boundary condition the hull propeller and hub surfaces were all set as no slip walls the inlet velocity was adjusted until the modeled and measured thrust coefficients were almost equal with a final value of u 6 6 m s the thrust coefficient k t is defined as k t t ρ l n 2 d m 4 where t is propeller thrust the reynolds number re 1 3 106 is defined as c 0 7 r u 2 0 7 π n d m 2 ν where c 0 7r is chord length at 0 7r and v is the water kinetic viscosity detailed results for the modeled and measured thrust coefficients are given later the outlet boundary pressure was derived from the cavitation number σ n 0 8 r p out p v 0 5 ρ l 0 8 π n d m 2 0 2493 which was based on the location at 0 8r on the blade position at 0 12 o clock all the domains were generated with hexahedral grids typical meshes around the hull and propeller are shown in fig 5 the meshes were especially refined in the rotating domain and in the stern region the rotating domain was generated with hexahedral elements as a whole without any interfaces the rectangular domain surrounding the hull was divided into three parts to improve the whole grid quality as shown in fig 4 the three parts were joined together with few differences between the mesh interfaces as shown in fig 5 the same grid topology was used to generate the three refined meshes with a mesh refinement ratio of 2 to investigate the cavitating flow around the propeller the unsteady cavitation calculations were started from the convergent non cavitating results the transient rotor stator model was used in the unsteady calculations the time dependent governing equations were discretized in both space and time the high resolution is arranged for the advection term with the central difference scheme for the diffusion terms in the governing equations the unsteady second order implicit formation was used for the unsteady terms 30 inner iterations per time step with a 10 3 residual criterion were used for the unsteady calculations and a 10 6 residual criterion for the initial non cavitating calculations the unsteady simulations used 5 per time step for the first two revolutions and then 1 per time step for the next 8 revolutions these transient results during the first 10 revolutions were not used to remove the influence of the initial conditions and 10 more revolutions calculated with 1 per time step have been retained to get the results presented at the discussion and for mesh 1 with largest number of elements 20 propeller revolutions were calculated by 2 threads with 32 processers spending about 1 month on the supercomputing system 5 results and discussion 5 1 influence of mesh resolution an uncertainty analysis was used to assess the accuracy of the numerical results based on the procedure recommended by the international towing tank conference ittc and our previous studies long et al 2017b 2018b the numerical uncertainty u n can be estimated using the grid convergence index gci method proposed by roache 1998 numerical error occurs in every computing simulation but it is difficult to know the true value of numerical error so the estimated numerical error will generally be converted into numerical uncertainty and we can use this to know the calculation accuracy information usually three systematic refined meshes are required to calculate the numerical uncertainty from numerical error with gci method the convergence ration r is used and it is defined as r ϕ 2 ϕ 1 ϕ 3 ϕ 2 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 correspond to the solutions by fine medium and coarse meshes respectively monotonic convergence has achieved when 0 r 1 monotonic convergence was needed on three systematic refined meshes to use gci to estimate the numerical uncertainty more detailed information has been presented in our previous study long et al 2017b the three refined meshes detailed in table 2 were used to predict the thrust coefficients and numerical uncertainty shown in table 3 the differences in table 3 were defined as predicted value experimental value experimental value the thrust coefficients predicted using the three meshes are all very close to the experimental results the predictions show that the calculated k t is monotonic convergence and approaches a constant value as the mesh is refined the numerical uncertainty is quite small so these results illustrate the reliability of these numerical methods the propeller inlet velocity distribution significantly influences the propeller cavitation the wake fields predicted using the three meshes are shown in fig 6 the contours in fig 6 are the dimensionless averaged axial velocity u x u with the velocity vectors normalized to only denote the local velocity direction the horizontal axis y l wl and the vertical axis z l wl denote the dimensionless distances from the ship center line and the designed waterline the wake fields predicted by meshes 1 2 and 3 are similar with some small differences with the more refined meshes the velocity changes become sharper and the wake is much more non uniform the results indicate that the predicted cavitation in fig 7 becomes more turbulent and unstable in fig 7 it compares the predicted instantaneous cavitation regions around the propeller with the experimental observations during the propeller rotation the experimental data in this paper are provided by cssrc the cavitation patterns were visualized by the iso surface of the vapor volume fraction α v 0 1 the six black lines along each blade surface denote the intersections between the blade surface and cylindrical surface of 0 5r 0 6r 0 7r 0 8r 0 9r and 0 95r fig 7 shows four snapshots of the cavity for propeller rotations from 0 to 60 with increments of 20 when the propeller enters the wake field at the blade position of 0 the sheet cavity begins to grow from the leading edge from 0 to 40 the sheet cavity develops and the trailing of cavity gradually rolls up into the tip vortex the sheet cavity is seen to move away from the blade surface due to the side entrant jet effect with the sheet cavity in the trailing intermediate cavity region growing into a partial cloud cavity at the blade angle position of 60 the propeller moves out of the non uniform hull wake and the tip vortex cavity is visible in addition the unstable cavitation is clearer with the more refined mesh the instability is closely related to the inlet velocity distribution in front of the propeller illustrated by the hull wake distribution in fig 6 the tip vortex cavitation can be clearly seen at the 60 blade position in meshes 1 and 2 comparison of the predictions with the experimental data shows that the unsteady cavity patterns are reasonably well reproduced by the present method even although there is some over prediction of the cavitation in the middle region of the blade leading edge this might be due to slightly excessive prediction of the non uniform wake at the propeller inflow these over predictions of cavity extent have been however reported in many computations even without operating behind hull bensow and bark 2010 the changes of the cavity volume lead to large pressure fluctuations during propeller rotation the predicted and measured pressure fluctuations at monitoring points p1 p2 p3 and p4 are shown in fig 8 the fluctuating pressure amplitudes in fig 8 show the first blade frequency components of the pressure fluctuations obtained using fast fourier transforms the results show that the measured pressure fluctuations are well reproduced by the numerical calculations moreover the predictions illustrate that the monitoring pressure fluctuates more as the number of elements increases ji et al 2012a 2012b showed that the far field pressure fluctuations are excited by the cavity volume acceleration the calculated total cavity volume for mesh 2 the pressure fluctuations at p1 and the cavity volume acceleration for mesh 2 are shown in fig 9 the fluctuating pressure is characterized by a dimensionless number as 21 k p p 0 p out ρ l n 2 d m 2 where p 0 is the fluctuating pressure at the monitoring point the total cavity volume v cav is calculated as 22 v cav i 1 n α i v i where n is the total number of mesh cells α i is the vapor volume fraction in each cell and v i is the volume of each cell fig 9 shows that the pressure changes as the cavity volume acceleration changes which verifies that the far field pressure fluctuation on the hull surface is highly related to the cavity volume changes the curve crests and troughs of the fluctuating pressures in fig 9 b are labeled with t1 and t2 with the same moments indicated by t1 and t2 in fig 9 a for the total cavity volume in fig 10 it shows the cavity patterns corresponding to the curve crest t1 and curve trough t2 on the fluctuating pressure curve in fig 9 b points t1 and t2 are very closed to the blade angles of 0 and 40 in fig 7 thus the pressure crest at t1 is directly linked to the sharp change in the cavitation area when the propeller enters the hull wake from t1 to t2 the sheet cavitation develops from the blade leading edge to the trailing edge as the propeller rotates from t2 to the next crest the cavity size decreases and another new sheet cavitation grows along the next blade a correlation coefficient is used to quantitatively analyze the relationship between the pressure fluctuations and the cavity volume acceleration the correlation coefficient between two signals x t and y t is given as 23 c o r r x y i 1 h x i x y i y i 1 h x i x 2 i 1 h y i y 2 1 c o r r x y 1 where x and y are the two target signals the second derivative of the calculated cavity volume and the dimensionless fluctuating pressure h is the number of target variables and the over bar means the averaged value the data for the last five revolutions was used to calculate the correlation coefficient with the results given in table 4 if corr x y 1 the two target variables are linearly related while if corr x y 0 they are unrelated the results in table 4 show that the correlation coefficient relating the cavity volume change and dimensionless fluctuating pressure is very high which verifies that the far field pressure fluctuations are strongly correlated with the second derivative of the cavity volume the correlation coefficients decrease with increasing number of elements and with the distance of the monitoring point away from the ship center line the predicted cavity volume changes and pressure fluctuations at monitoring point p1 for all three meshes are shown in fig 11 these show that the pressure fluctuation amplitude increases with increasing number of elements the curve of the second derivative of the cavity volume fluctuates more and is rougher as the number of elements increases while the pressure fluctuation curves are very smooth for all three meshes this shows that the differences between the cavity volume changes and the pressure fluctuations increase with increasing number of elements which then reduces the correlation coefficient for more elements 5 2 analysis of the cavitation influence on the vorticity the investigations in section 5 1 show that mesh 2 can well simulate the cavitating flow around the propeller as a balance between the numerical accuracy and the calculation time therefore the predictions using mesh 2 are used in the following discussion the vorticity has been shown to be strongly influenced by the complex unsteady cavitation around hydrofoils through use of the vorticity transport equation ji et al 2015 2017 the effect of the cavitation around a propeller seen in this study on the vorticity is also investigated using the relative vorticity transport equation the curl of the incompressible navier stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates gives the relative vorticity transport equation as 24 ω r e l t ω r e l ω r e l ω r e l ω r e l 1 ρ m 2 ρ m p 2 ω u r e l ν 2 ω r e l ω ω r ν 2 ω r where subscript rel indicates the relative coordinate i e cylindrical coordinates in this paper ω r e l is the relative vorticity u r e l is the relative velocity and ν is the kinematic viscosity since ω is constant in this study ω 28 rps the last two terms in equation 24 ω ω r and ν 2 ω r are equal to zero the simplified relative vorticity transport equation is then 25 ω r e l t ω r e l ω r e l ω r e l ω r e l 1 ρ m 2 ρ m p 2 ω u r e l ν 2 ω r e l in equation 25 the first term on the right side is the relative vortex stretching term which denotes the effect of vortex stretching and tilting by the velocity gradients the second term on the right is the relative vortex dilation due to the volumetric expansion or contraction the last three terms on the right are the baroclinic torque term due to misaligned pressure and mixture density gradients the coriolis force term due to the rotation and the viscous diffusion effect ν 2 ω r e l leads to relative vorticity diffusion by the viscous effect in the high reynolds numbers flows in this study this term has little effect the interactions between the cavitation and vorticity are shown by the predictions in figs 12 15 fig 12 shows a sketch of planes s1 s2 s3 and s4 and the cylindrical coordinate planes s1 s4 denote four parallel surfaces with each perpendicular to the x axis the x coordinates of these planes are x s1 0 2d m x s2 0 16d m x s3 0 12d m x s4 0 1d m the relationship between the cartesian coordinates x y z and the cylindrical coordinates x r θ are also shown in fig 12 fig 13 shows a sketch of the angular evolution of the cavitation visualized by the vapor volume fraction contours using plane s1 for example in fig 13 six transient results are combined into one figure with the results for the propeller rotating from 10 to 40 enlarged on the right side the results in fig 14 were obtained by the process as in fig 13 the top blade regions within these enlarged figures correspond to the blade leading edge for s1 s2 and s3 and near the blade tip for s4 in fig 14 it shows the predicted vapor volume fractions and contours of the vortex stretching vortex dilatation coriolis force and baroclinic torque terms on the s1 s2 s3 and s4 planes in cylindrical coordinates each contour is the combination of six instantaneous numerical results for angle θ from 10 to 40 as shown in fig 14 when the main flow moves from the s1 to the s4 plane the largest cavitation region moves from 10 in fig 14 a to 40 in fig 14 d as the cavity changes from a slender to a plump shape the distributions of the four vortex terms show the same tendency thus the vorticity distribution and its transport are significantly influenced by the cavitation in fig 14 the relative vorticity occurs mainly at the liquid vapor interface and in the cavity shedding wake while it is small inside the attached cavity the results in fig 15 are likely to demonstrate this phenomenon fig 15 shows contours of the vapor volume fraction and the radial velocity u r for θ 20 on the s2 plane the velocity gradient becomes much larger along the liquid vapor interface and near the cavity shedding region while it is suppressed inside the cavity these factors lead to the relative vorticity distribution in fig 14 the side entrant jet has been also revealed in fig 15 which results the cavity separating from the blade surface the vortex stretching term in fig 14 is larger than the other three terms in the top region along the liquid vapor interface and in the cavity shedding region while it is much smaller inside the cavity the leading edge vortex and sheet cavity significantly increase the vortex stretching term from s1 to s3 the shrunken but strong tip vortex however is the dominant influence on the vortex stretching term distribution on s4 lars 2018 showed that vortex stretching and tilting will increase the fluid element rotation rate and increase the velocity fluctuations which means that the pressure decreases in the vortex core with increases of the turbulence as shown in fig 14 the cavitation prevents the pressure decrease in the vortex core and suppresses the vortex generation however the highly unsteady processes of cavity shedding and mass transfer along the cavity surface promote the vortex generation and turbulence the vortex stretching term distribution along the blade pressure side on plane s3 has a zigzag configuration characterized by alternating positive and negative values this may be caused by the relative vorticity changes or the velocity transformation from cartesian to cylinder coordinates which needs further investigation the vortex dilatation is directly linked to the velocity divergence while the baroclinic torque is related to the pressure and density gradients the effects of the vortex dilatation and baroclinic torque are significant along the cavity surface and in the cavity shedding region on s3 and s4 the baroclinic torque is sometimes much larger in the top region and in the region influenced by the side entrant jet due to the misalignment of the large density and pressure gradients the non zero velocity divergence caused by the cavitation and the misalignment between the density and pressure gradients make the vortex dilatation and baroclinic torque terms both very important as significant source terms generating the vorticity and modifying the vorticity field in cavitating flows the coriolis force term is quite small and can be neglected compared with the other three terms 5 3 particle trajectories showing the flow structure around the propeller particle trajectories computed using the lagrangian method provide useful visualization of the cavitating flow which has recently been used extensively to identify local cavitating flows around hydrofoils long et al 2018a wu et al 2016 this study visualized the particle trajectories to study the three dimensional flow around the propeller behind the hull the particle trajectories were derived from the existing eulerian flow field the mesh 3 results were used to visualize the particle tracks as a balance between the computational times and the flow visualization needs in fig 16 it shows the initial locations of the three groups of particles group a group b and group c at time t0 the group a particles were mainly initially located around the blade tip the group b particles were mainly located in the middle of the sheet cavitation and the group c particles were mainly located in the initial part of the sheet cavitation the blade rotation at t0 is about 20 as shown in fig 7 the three groups of particles tracks are shown in figs 17 19 as the propeller rotates from t0 to t53 only part of the results are presented for convenience the particle locations cannot be easily followed as the propeller rotates and the particles move therefore the particles tracks are drawn as black lines for each particle from t0 to t53 with the red circles indicating the locations at each time in the figures the propeller is semitransparent to avoid obstructing the particles tracks in fig 17 these particles rotate rapidly away from the blade tip as the propeller rotates due to the influence of the blade tip vortex the strongest particle rotation occurs in the intermediate region indicated by the green dotted arrow in fig 17 within group a with the upper and lower particles in group a rotating much more slowly most of the particles stop rotating after t29 in fig 17 from t29 to t53 the particles move to a quite wider space dispersedly rather than rotating and gathering together indicated by the orange dotted arrow in fig 17 this change from t0 to t53 is directly linked to the tip vortex the tip vortex is transported to the far wake region in the experiments but is significantly weaker in the flow predictions so its influence rapidly declines due to the insufficient mesh resolution and the numerical dissipation in fig 18 the upper particles in group b indicated by the green dotted arrow in fig 18 initially rotate slowly and finally stop rotating at t39 while the lower particles indicated by the orange dotted arrow in fig 18 are transported by the main flow with almost no rotation from t0 to t53 the lower particles at t0 are transported to a much larger propeller radius in the end however the height of the upper particles increases only a little from the initial to final locations so some of the lower particles end up higher than the upper particles at t53 a similar phenomenon is observed in fig 19 with the lower particles of group c at t0 moving higher in the end however the group c upper particles move more rapidly and go much further in the chordwise direction than the lower particles this may be related to the propeller rotation and the twisted propeller geometry with the angle of attack increasing with the larger propeller radius earlier studies cheng et al 2018 long et al 2018a indicated that large scale cavity shedding around a hydrofoil strongly impacted the particle tracks however the unsteady cavitating flow around the propeller in this study shows less influence on the particles than the hydrofoil cavitation the unsteady cavitation has an important influence on the initial particle tracks near the initial locations for these three groups but the influence decreases rapidly when the particles move away from the propeller surface as the propeller rotating at other regions away from the initial locations for these three groups the strongly distorted and rotating flow due to the propeller rotation and the twisted propeller has a greater effect on the particle motion than the cavitation 6 conclusions the k ω sst turbulence model was coupled with a homogenous cavitation model to simulate unsteady cavitating flows around a highly skewed propeller operating behind the hull the influence of the mesh resolution is discussed in detail the effects of cavitation on the relative vorticity were investigated using the relative vorticity transport equation with the flow structure around the propeller investigated using particle tracks the main conclusions are 1 the numerical uncertainty in the predicted thrust coefficients shown by the gci method is very small the simulated thrust coefficient k t approaches a constant as the mesh is refined the hull wake fields predicted by the three meshes are very non uniform the hydrodynamics of the highly skewed propeller behind the hull are correctly reproduced by the calculations 2 the predicted cavity patterns agree well with experimental observations with some over prediction of the cavity size the results show the sheet cavity shedding from the blade surface caused by the side entrant jet the predicted pressure fluctuations also agree well with experimental data the magnitudes of the predicted pressure fluctuations increase a small amount as the mesh is refined furthermore the results show that the far field pressure fluctuations are strongly correlated with the cavity volume changes with very high correlation coefficients the correlation coefficient decreases as the number of elements increases but the predicted unsteady cavitating flows becomes more turbulent 3 the simplified relative vorticity transport equation was used to analyze the cavitation influence on the flow structure around the propeller the relative vorticity mainly develops along the blade leading edge the liquid vapor interface and in the cavity shedding region with almost negligible magnitude inside the attached cavity the vortex stretching term is larger than the other terms along the blade leading edge and in the cavity shedding region but is much small inside the cavity the leading edge vortex the mass transfer across the liquid vapor interface and the side entrant jet all significantly influence the vorticity distribution and transport in addition the cavitation prevents the pressure decrease in the vortex core and suppresses the vortex growth while the cavity shedding promotes the vortex generation and flow unsteadiness the vortex dilatation has a significant effect along the liquid cavity surface the baroclinic torque plays an important role in the cavitation wake due to the high misalignment of the density and pressure gradients the coriolis force has little effect compared with the other three terms 4 the particle trajectory was also used to investigate the cavitating flow around the propeller behind a hull from the lagrangian viewpoint the blade tip vortex has a large impact on the particle tracks and causes the particles to rapidly rotate away from the blade surface in group a in groups b and c due to the influence of propeller rotation and the twisted propeller geometry the lower particles are transported and delivered out along the propeller radius and some of the initially lower particles even reach higher locations than the initially upper particles the upper particles move more rapidly and go much further in the chordwise direction

equations sst shear stress transport ukc under keel clearance vof volume of fluid 1 introduction a ship manoeuvring in shallow water usually experiences much larger hydrodynamic forces than in open waters due to the hydrodynamic interactions between the ship and the bottom of the waterway called shallow water effects these hydrodynamic interactions have detrimental influences on ship manoeuvrability in particular the dynamic sinkage and trim of the ship commonly termed as squat briggs et al 2010 may greatly reduce the under keel clearance ukc between the ship and the bottom of the waterway a decrease of the net ukc caused by the squat may affect ship manoeuvrability dramatically resulting in loss of control and marine accidents such as collision or grounding in the report of ittc manoeuvring committee 2014 it was pointed out that the knowledge of ship motions in shallow water remains a challenging issue in addition to squat ship manoeuvrability in shallow water is affected by many different factors such as water depth waterway width ship speed etc therefore to ensure a safe navigation it is of great importance to accurately predict the hydrodynamic forces acting on the ship manoeuvring in shallow water taking these effects into account ship manoeuvring in shallow water has been the subject of studies for a long time traditionally the investigations mainly relied on model tests and semi empirical methods eloot 2006 developed a mathematical model for the prediction of ship manoeuvres under shallow water conditions based on a series of planar motion mechanism pmm tests then the mathematical model was validated by the free running model tests in shallow water eloot et al 2015 a similar procedure was adopted for a pusher barge system in deep and shallow waters maimun et al 2011 eloot et al 2016 carried out model tests of pure sway and pure yaw for the duisburg test case dtc container ship under 20 ukc at flanders hydraulics research fhr these tests were contributed as benchmark tests for the 4th conference on manoeuvring in shallow and confined water mashcon 2016 which aimed to gain a better understanding of the interaction between ship and tank bottom nowadays with the rapid developments of both computer technique and computational fluid dynamics cfd method the cfd based numerical prediction of hydrodynamic forces on manoeuvring ships has become increasingly promising stern et al 2013 the viscous flow methods typically the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method are shown to be able to produce effective and reliable predictions of ship manoeuvrability the advantage of cfd methods compared to model tests in restricted waters is that on the one hand the model tests need to be carried out in a special shallow water towing tank which is not always available in most of the research institutes on the other hand it is not possible to arbitrarily change the tank width in the model tests to investigate the side wall effect while these can be easily realized for the cfd methods in the past focuses were mainly placed on the simulation of static manoeuvres in restricted waters böttner et al 2014 lee and hong 2017 meng and wan 2016 toxopeus et al 2013 in toxopeus et al 2013 the importance of the domain width in numerical predictions of ship manoeuvrability in shallow water was stressed it was pointed out that the blockage effects might contribute to the scatter in the results of static manoeuvres meng and wan 2016 applied an overset rans code to simulate the flow around a ship in steady oblique motion in shallow water without taking into account the sinkage and trim effect considering that ships in shallow water usually undergo more notable dynamic sinkage and trim böttner et al 2014 predicted the sinkage and trim of a ship model in oblique motion and presented the details of the viscous flow fields between the ship and the seabed by using rans method similarly lee and hong 2017 analyzed the ship s course stability under different water depths by numerically simulating static drift and static yaw tests roychoudhury et al 2017 conducted cfd simulations of steady drift and yaw motions in deep and shallow waters for the tanker kvlcc2 using the rans solver shipflow in most of the previous studies the numerical simulations of dynamic manoeuvres were mainly carried out in deep water e g kim et al 2015 sakamoto et al 2012 yao et al 2016 there were also a few studies which simulated pmm tests in very shallow water by applying unsteady rans methods deng et al 2016 he et al 2016 liu et al 2016 from the existing literatures there are some research issues and challenges of the cfd based manoeuvring predictions in shallow water the shallow water effects on dynamic pmm tests are still not fully understood due to the large difficulty in numerical simulation especially considering the dynamic sinkage and trim the limited space between the ship and the seabed may easily give rise to more remarkable flow separations around the hull and more notable dynamic sinkage and trim because of the blockage effects while the periodic plane motion of the ship model during the dynamic pmm tests further aggravates the complicacy of the flow since the turbulent flows and the ship motions are more unstable in shallow water cases the flow separation features and the vortex structure are difficult to precisely capture by the numerical simulations in previous numerical studies it was found that the predicted hydrodynamic force and moment on the hull based on simulation of dynamic pmm tests were still not accurate enough for a reliable prediction of ship manoeuvrability the simulations of the dynamic sinkage and trim are even more difficult than prediction of the hydrodynamic force and moment as the ship motion is more sensitive to the restricted water effects the ship may also touch the seabed in the simulation due to its non physical oscillation caused by the poor mesh quality therefore the dynamic sinkage and trim were ignored in most of the previous studies due to the difficulty while in the simulations including sinkage and trim the overlapping mesh techniques were applied to predict the ship motion but with low accuracy more suitable mesh techniques are needed to improve the prediction of the dynamic sinkage and trim in shallow water besides in most shallow water cases the hydrodynamic derivatives especially the nonlinear ones were not evaluated thus the present paper intends to improve the accuracy in numerical predictions for the same benchmark tests comparing to the previous study liu et al 2016 by adopting appropriate numerical models and then to conduct more comprehensive investigations to get deeper understanding of the shallow water effects on the hydrodynamic quantities during the pure sway tests this paper is organized as follows firstly the mesh and time dependency studies are performed for the benchmark tests to estimate the numerical errors due to the insufficient spatial or temporal discretization then the cfd results are compared with those of he et al 2016 and the benchmark test data of eloot et al 2016 to validate the present numerical method finally the effects of water depth dynamic sinkage and trim as well as the side wall effect are assessed to provide more extensive knowledge about the hydrodynamic behaviours of a ship manoeuvring in restricted waters 2 numerical method 2 1 coordinated systems as shown in fig 1 for the pure sway tests a ship model is towed along the tank with a constant speed u 0 and simultaneously undergoes a pure sway motion with a lateral displacement y the water depth and the tank width are h and w respectively an inertial coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 and a ship fixed coordinate system o xyz are adopted to describe the ship motion the flow field is solved in the inertial coordinate system while the ship motions are modelled in the ship fixed coordinate system to facilitate the direct comparison with the benchmark tests by eloot et al 2016 another reference coordinate system o x y z is established the o 0 x 0 y 0 plane is fixed on the undisturbed free surface and the z 0 axis is pointing vertically downwards the origin of the coordinate system o xyz locates at the intersection of the water line plane and the centre line plane at the mid ship section it is also the captive point in the tests the x axis is pointing to the bow y axis to the starboard and z axis pointing from deck to keel the reference coordinate system o x y z does not change its position during the heave and pitch motions it coincides with the coordinate system o xyz when the ship has no sinkage and trim this coordinate system is used to compute the hydrodynamic forces and moments on the hull u and v are the surge and sway velocities respectively r is the yaw rate in the pure sway tests u u 0 x and y are the force components in the longitudinal and transverse directions respectively n is the yaw moment the drift angle β is defined by β tan 1 v u the resultant speed v is defined as v u 2 v 2 sinkage σ is defined as the vertical displacement at the mid ship position and positive downwards while trim τ is defined as the relative difference between the draughts t at the fore and aft perpendiculars in the o x y z coordinate system and is positive bow up 2 2 governing equations the fluid can be treated as viscous and incompressible fluid and the flow is governed by the equation of continuity and the navier stokes ns equations after averaging the equations over time it follows ferziger and peric 2002 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u j u i x j p x i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j where x i i 1 2 3 is the ith component of the earth fixed coordinate system ρ is the density of fluid u i is the ith mean velocity component p is the mean pressure μ is the viscosity of fluid and ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress which needs to be solved through turbulence modelling eq 2 are the rans equations where the terms on the left hand side are the transient and convective terms respectively pressure gradient viscous flux terms are given on the right hand side the motion of ship model in pure sway tests can be expressed in terms of the velocities i e u u 0 r 0 and v changes harmonically the sway displacement y the sway velocity v and the sway acceleration v are given as 3 y y max cos 2 π t t m 4 v v max sin 2 π t t m v max y max 2 π t m 5 v v max cos 2 π t t m v max y max 2 π t m 2 where y max is the sway amplitude v max is the amplitude of sway velocity v max is the amplitude of sway acceleration and t m is the motion period 2 3 numerical scheme to solve the unsteady rans equations and simulate the pure sway tests the cfd solver star ccm cd adapco 2014 is adopted a finite volume method fvm is used to discretize the flow domain into a finite number of cvs control volumes corresponding to computational mesh cells the unsteady rans equations are closed by modelling the reynolds stress tensor using the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model menter 1994 the equations are solved as an uncoupled system using a segregated flow solver which employs a semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple algorithm for pressure velocity coupling the temporal discretization is based on a first order euler difference and the spatial discretization is performed with a second order upwind scheme for the convection term and secondary gradients for the diffusion term flow quantities near the hull surface seabed and tank walls are simulated according to an all y wall treatment by using a blended wall law to estimate shear stresses this approach is flexible with its ability to handle a range of local mesh refinements near the wall the air water interface is captured using the volume of fluid vof hirt and nichols 1981 method vof assumes a common velocity and pressure field for both phases within a single cv and monitors the phase fraction the governing equations for mass and momentum continuity in a single phase flow are thus solved for an equivalent fluid whose physical properties density and laminar viscosity are functions of the constituent phase s properties and volume fractions the transport of volume fraction is described by an additional conservation equation 6 α t u i α x i 0 where α represents the volume fraction indicating the relative proportion of fluid in each cell its value is always between 0 and 1 typical low order schemes tend to smear the interface and introduce artificial mixing of the two fluids thus the high resolution interface capturing hric convection discretization scheme muzaferija et al 1998 is designed to mimic the convective transport of immiscible fluid components to improve the vof interface tracking capabilities particularly the ship motion and the corresponding velocity are specified with the dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi morphing module it involves actual displacement of the mesh vertices and can use control points and their associated displacements to generate an interpolation field throughout the region which can model the six degrees of freedom dof motion of a rigid body within the fluid then the resultant force and moment acting on the body due to all influences are calculated and the flow field is updated to find the new position and orientation of the ship 3 description of benchmark test 3 1 ship model in the tests of fhr the pure sway tests with a bare hull dtc model were conducted at a steady captive speed eloot et al 2016 the dtc is a typical 14000 teu container carrier with bulbous bow large bow flare large stern overhang and transom its main particulars are given in table 1 the geometry of the hull and the body plan are illustrated in fig 2 in the captive model tests the ship model was constrained in all degrees of freedom except for dynamic sinkage and trim fr στ the width of the towing tank is 7m the test cases with the very shallow water condition 20 ukc are used in the benchmark study in which the corresponding water depth in model scale is 0 195m 3 2 test conditions table 2 lists the details of the benchmark test conditions two ship speeds cases a0 and b0 are considered corresponding to froude numbers fr u 0 g l p p 0 096 and 0 140 g is the acceleration of the gravity which are the typical moderate froude numbers for a container carrier in deep water while under the 20 ukc condition the corresponding froude depth numbers fr h u 0 g h are 0 43 and 0 63 respectively indicating the non negligible shallow water effects the limiting froude depth number fr hcrit and schijf s limiting ship speed v crit briggs et al 2010 are critical quantities which are suggested not to exceed due to the shallow water effects fr hcrit and v crit are defined as 7 f r h c r i t v c r i t g h 2 cos π 3 arccos 1 m b 3 3 2 where m b is the blockage factor defined as m b b t h w the higher speed in case b0 is close to the schijf s limiting speed v crit 17 5 knots at full scale β max tan 1 v max u 0 is the maximum drift angle during the tests the amplitude y max and period t m of sway motion are 0 2m and 20s respectively 4 computation setup and mesh generation the computational domain is shown in fig 3 which is bounded by seven boundaries the inlet plane in front of the hull the outlet plane behind the hull the hull surface the top plane above the hull the water bottom as well as the two side walls as in the shallow water towing tank the domain extends 3 5l pp from the aft perpendicular to the outlet plane 1 5l pp from the bow to the inlet plane the domain width is equal to the width of the towing tank i e 1 757l pp the top plane reaches 1 2l pp above the undisturbed free surface while the domain extends downwards to the considered water depth as to the imposed boundary conditions on the boundaries the velocity inlet condition is set at the inlet plane where boundary pressure is extrapolated by using reconstruction gradients and a constant velocity value is fixed the pressure outlet condition is used on the outlet plane where the boundary pressure is governed by a field function which monitors the instantaneous pressure on above and below the free surface a symmetry condition is set at the top plane where the shear stress is zero the no slip condition is satisfied on the hull it should be noted that in shallow water the boundary layer developed on the water bottom may influence the flow in the gap between the ship and the water bottom thus a moving no slip condition is used on the bottom the unstructured predominantly hexahedral mesh is applied in the computational domain fig 3 depicts a general view of the computational mesh in shallow water while fig 4 provides a closer look at the volume mesh in the stern and bow region of the ship the mesh is refined towards the free surface the hull in the gap between the ship and the water bottom and in the wake to ensure that the complicated flow features can be appropriately captured the refined mesh density in these zones is achieved using volumetric controls orthogonal prismatic cells are generated next to the hull and water bottom to improve the accuracy of the flow resolution the number of prism layer is 10 near the hull and the number is 3 near the water bottom with stretching ratio of 1 5 to avoid numerical difficulty related to the mesh morphing approach as much as possible for shallow water computations y is larger than 30 in order to use wall function on the water bottom while y is smaller than 1 near the hull surface to get a more precise flow field close to the wall 5 numerical simulation of the benchmark tests the simulation starts when the hull locates at the tank centerline while the experiment data starts to export when the hull reaches to the maximum lateral position in order to compare with the experimental data directly the first t m 4 computation has been ignored furthermore the release time and ramp time are set to 20s to allow some time for the flow to be stable 5 1 computation and reconstruction of the hydrodynamic derivatives according to the motion characteristics of pure sway tests the linear acceleration derivatives y v n v linear derivatives x y v n v and nonlinear derivatives x vv y vvv n vvv can be determined by imposing dynamically varying v and v then the hydrodynamic forces and moment can be reconstructed by the following mathematical model 8 x x x v v v 2 y y y v v y v v y v v v v 3 n n n v v n v v n v v v v 3 the fourier series fs method is adopted to derive those hydrodynamic derivatives from the obtained forces and moment by using the fs method the sway motions are prescribed by cosine and sine functions the responses of forces and moment are assumed to be reconstructed as follows yoon et al 2015 9 f f 0 n 1 3 f c n cos n ω t n 1 3 f s n sin n ω t where ω 2π t m is the angular frequency f represents the time series of forces x y and moment n or the motion variables f cn and f sn are nth order fourier cosine and sine coefficients respectively alternatively eq 9 can be further formulated as 10 f f 0 n 1 3 a n cos n ω t ϕ n where a n f c n 2 f s n 2 and ϕ n tan 1 f s n f c n are the amplitude and phase of the nth order harmonic component of f respectively the harmonic forms of hydrodynamic quantities determined by substituting the motion equations eqs 4 and 5 into eq 8 are 11 x x 0 x c 2 cos 2 ω t y y s 1 sin ω t y c 1 cos ω t y s 3 sin 3 ω t n n s 1 sin ω t n c 1 cos ω t n s 3 sin 3 ω t 12 x 0 x v max 2 x v v 2 x c 2 1 2 v max 2 x v v y c 1 v max y v y s 1 v max y v 3 4 v max 3 y v v v y s 3 1 4 v max 3 y v v v n c 1 v max n v n s 1 v max n v 3 4 v max 3 n v v v n s 3 1 4 v max 3 n v v v all the related hydrodynamic derivatives can be calculated by solving eq 12 then with the hydrodynamic derivatives the time histories of the hydrodynamic forces and moment can be reproduced by eq 8 which is called reconstruction of the results sakamoto et al 2012 the reconstruction procedure can be used to evaluate how well the mathematical model with the hydrodynamic derivatives can reproduce original forces and moment instead of performing trajectory simulations by the resultant hydrodynamic derivatives toxopeus 2009 it is also regarded as the most acceptable measure to evaluate the quality of the hydrodynamic derivatives obtained from the cfd simulations for better comparison the longitudinal force x sway force y yaw moment n are non dimensionalized as follows 13 x x 1 2 ρ u 0 2 l p p 2 y y 1 2 ρ u 0 2 l p p 2 n n 1 2 ρ u 0 2 l p p 3 all the hydrodynamic derivatives in the paper are also non dimensionalized in the similar way 5 2 verification study prior to the systematic computations a verification study is performed to estimate the numerical accuracy related to the spatial or temporal discretization following the grid convergence index gci method developed by roache 1998 and further introduced by celik et al 2008 this method was used and recommended by american society of mechanical engineers asme and the american institute of aeronautics and astronautics aiaa the discretization errors caused by mesh size and time step resolution are evaluated for case a0 assuming that the numerical uncertainties for the other cases are of the same order all mesh quantities are given as percentages in terms of a base size in order to refine the mesh as systematically as possible three mesh sets coarse medium and fine are adopted in the study and the mesh refinement is achieved by applying a uniform refinement factor r k 2 to the basic size the fine mesh consists of approximately 5 7m cells the medium mesh contains about 2 7m and the coarse one has about 1 3m the time step is refined in the same way with r k 2 for pure sway simulations in shallow water 1000 time steps per period is necessary to ensure numerical stability deng et al 2016 therefore the three time steps from fine to coarse are 0 0071s 0 01s and 0 014s respectively referring to linde et al 2016 the mesh convergence analysis is performed with the medium time step and the time step convergence study is executed with the medium mesh the changes in solutions between two successive densities are defined as 14 ε 32 φ 3 φ 2 ε 21 φ 2 φ 1 where φ 1 φ 2 and φ 3 correspond to the solutions with fine medium and coarse mesh or time step the apparent order p k of the method is expressed by 15 p k 1 ln r k ln ε 32 ε 21 the extrapolated values φ e x t 21 can be calculated by 16 φ e x t 21 r k p k φ 1 φ 2 r k p k 1 the approximate relative error between the medium fine solutions e a 21 and the extrapolated relative error e e x t 21 can be computed as follows 17 e a 21 φ 1 φ 2 φ 1 18 e e x t 21 φ e x t 21 φ 1 φ e x t 21 the fine mesh convergence index g c i f i n e 21 is calculated by 19 g c i f i n e 21 1 25 e a 21 r k p k 1 traditionally the verification of the static simulations is focused on constant forces or moments while for dynamic simulations the verification study is generally conducted for forces and moments in terms of time series such as the procedure adopted by simonsen and stern 2008 however approximating the time series of the forces and moment with fs coefficients is recommended for the verification of dynamic simulations according to the ittc recommended procedures and guidelines 2018 as it was done in sakamoto et al 2012 the dynamic sinkage and trim results are also reconstructed with fs coefficients table 3 summarizes the results of the mesh and time step convergence studies for x 0 y c1 y s1 n c1 n s1 τ 0 and σ 0 where y c1 y s1 n c1 n s1 are 1st order fourier cosine and sine coefficients of y and n as defined in eq 9 as can be seen from table 3 all the coefficients have small approximate relative errors and extrapolated relative errors while τ 0 is more sensitive to the mesh resolutions since its e a 21 is up to 12 the numerical uncertainties in the fine mesh solution for those fs coefficients are less than 3 except for τ 0 about 11 for the time step convergence all the seven coefficients are fairly insensitive to the time step since the maximum e a 21 is up to 3 64 n c 1 and σ 0 converge relatively slow since their observed apparent order p k is smaller than 1 and the corresponding numerical uncertainties in the smallest time step solution are around 20 the numerical uncertainties of other five coefficients are smaller than 5 the time histories of non dimensional hydrodynamic forces and moment dynamic sinkage and trim for the three mesh density solutions and the three time step solutions are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively it can be seen that the non dimensional hydrodynamic forces and moment change little among different mesh densities or time steps while the non dimensional yaw moment n is more sensitive to the mesh density moreover some instability is observed for the dynamic sinkage σ and trim τ as they are more sensitive to the mesh size and time step than the hydrodynamic forces and moment in order to analyze the grid resolution in the gap between the ship and the tank bottom fig 7 presents the grid convergence tendency of the surge velocity u sway velocity v and the dynamic pressure p along a longitudinal cut line between the hull and the tank bottom y 0 1m z 0 193m at a motion phase 90 when the ship model reaches the central position of the tank where a positive x represents a location in the fore part of the hull it can be seen that the pressure or the surge velocity changes little among these three mesh densities while for the sway velocity the grid convergence is not achieved at some of the positions especially near the bow region the grid uncertainties especially for the sway velocity are larger near the bow regions because the flow around the bow regions is more complicated since the local flow quantities are more sensitive to the mesh density and they are more location dependent denser meshes are required to obtain more precise flow quantities with higher resolutions it is shown that the adopted medium mesh size is applicable for the predictions of integrated quantities and to a certain extent can also give an acceptable prediction of the basic quantities of the local flow field thus the medium mesh density and medium time step are used in the subsequent systematic computations 5 3 validation with benchmark tests in this subsection comparisons between the computed and measured results are presented for the non dimensional longitudinal force x sway force y and yaw moment n as well as the dynamic sinkage σ and trim τ the corresponding computed hydrodynamic derivatives and the reconstructed hydrodynamic forces are also compared with the test ones the average comparison error is defined as sakamoto et al 2012 20 e d 1 k i 1 k d i s i 1 k i 1 k d i 100 e r e f d d 1 k i 1 k d i d r i 1 k i 1 k d i 100 e r c f d d 1 k

represents the reconstructed experimental data and s ri denotes the reconstructed computation result e e r e f d and e r c f d are the corresponding average errors particularly when the computed hydrodynamic derivatives are compared with the experimental data a comparison error e is defined as e d d s d 100 in figs 8 and 9 comparisons between computed cfd and measured efd results for case a0 and case b0 are presented for the longitudinal force x sway force y and yaw moment n as well as the dynamic sinkage σ and trim τ the numerical results by he et al 2016 cfd he et al using an in house cfd tool with the sst k ω turbulence model and the overset grid technique are also presented it can be seen that there is a promising correspondence between the present cfd results and the experimental data the prediction results of sway force y and yaw moment n by he et al 2016 are also satisfactory but for the longitudinal forces x and dynamic sinkage σ and trim τ their computed results are more unstable compared with the benchmark test data moreover compared with the previous results liu et al 2016 the accuracy has been improved in the present study especially for the sinkage and trim for both case a0 and case b0 the maximum values of the sway force y and yaw moment n are well predicted as shown in fig 8 even though the variation in the longitudinal force x predicted by the present cfd method is smaller than the experimental one implying more notable fluctuations during the experiments the mean longitudinal force is well captured by the present cfd method the fluctuations might be caused by noise in the experiment and the force sensor with wide measurement range may lead to notable fluctuations when a small force is measured for case a0 a peak value of n can be seen at the maximum velocity point t t m 0 25 0 75 i e when the ship model is at the middle of the tank while y peaks approximately appear at t t m 0 2 0 7 when the froude number is larger case b0 the phase of y delays i e y peaks approximately appear at the maximum velocity point while n peaks appear at t t m 0 35 0 85 this phase difference may be caused by the memory effects induced by the motion of the ship model the surge velocity greatly influences the ship wake when the ship model sways side to side moreover a little asymmetric trend for both y and n can be observed for case a0 and an increasing asymmetry can be seen for case b0 it can be seen from fig 9 that the ship sinkage and trim at twice the frequency of the sway motion give rise to a strong coupling of horizontal and vertical motions which is in accordance with the observation reported by eloot 2006 moreover the dynamic sinkage and trim are in phase i e the maximum sinkage corresponds to a maximum trim for case a0 the peak values of sinkage and trim appear at the maximum velocity point t t m 0 25 0 75 and the minimum values are at t t m 0 5 and 1 the maximum and the minimum values get larger when the ship speed is larger for case b0 the critical velocity is almost reached which gives increasing amplitudes of sinkage and trim this means the critical velocity greatly influences the dynamic sinkage and trim table 4 presents the hydrodynamic derivatives obtained from test data and the present cfd results it can be seen that for the hydrodynamic derivatives in general all the predicted linear hydrodynamic derivatives and acceleration derivatives are more accurate than the nonlinear hydrodynamic derivatives the current β max range is small which makes it difficult to calculate the nonlinear derivatives in case a0 the error in n v is large since this derivative is induced by the added inertia and is a small quantity it is difficult for both the simulation and the experiment to determine it accurately it should be noted that in case b0 the non dimensional acceleration derivative y v or the added mass due to sway motion becomes more than four times larger than that in case a0 frequency dependence of the added mass is a notable problem in shallow water this phenomenon was explained in detail in eloot 2006 fig 10 presents the reconstructed computation results cfd recons and experiment results efd recons of x y and n by using the hydrodynamic derivatives for a clearer demonstration the original computed cfd raw and measured efd raw results are also given in this figure it can be seen that the reconstruction results can reproduce original forces and moment which further validates the quality of the hydrodynamic derivatives obtained from the present cfd computations for a quantitative comparison table 5 presents e e r e f d and e r c f d it can be seen that all the average comparison errors are around 20 since an uncertainty analysis on model test data was not explicitly implemented the discrepancy might be due to the experimental errors at low speed and in very shallow water or tank resonance and unrealistic combinations of oscillating and translation motions during the tests the accuracy in the trim prediction is worse compared to that in the sinkage prediction as trim value is small during the tests at relatively low speed e r c f d is slightly larger than e r e f d but still of the same order of magnitude this implies that the present cfd simulations can provide reliable predictions of hydrodynamic quantities as the model tests 6 effects of relevant factors in the last section the pure sway tests are numerically simulated for two benchmark tests in very shallow water from which the numerical errors are investigated in detail and the numerical method is validated with the benchmark test data considering that in practical applications many factors affect the pure sway tests in towing tank it is worthwhile to study the effects of these factors given that serious fluctuations were found in the dynamic sinkage and trim in the benchmark tests the effects of the ship dynamic sinkage and trim on the hydrodynamic forces and hydrodynamic derivatives are further investigated two numerical simulations case af and case bf with the ship model constrained at zero sinkage and trim fx0 are conducted and the numerical results are compared with those of benchmark tests case a0 and case b0 where the ship model is free to dynamic sinkage and trim fr στ furthermore four other water depths in combination with two ship speeds are considered to investigate the effects of water depth and ship speed details about the computational conditions of all the cases are listed in table 6 the ratios of water depth to draught h t represent very shallow water h t 1 2 shallow water 1 2 h t 1 5 medium deep water 1 5 h t 3 0 and deep water h t 3 0 according to the ittc report ittc manoeuvring committee 2002 note that the prism layer is not used on the bottom surface in deep water cases h t 8 0 where the blockage effect is minor although different meshes are applied for each water depth the same cell size is used on the hull surface for all cases to minimize the influence of the mesh refinement near the hull toxopeus et al 2013 the computations are performed using the similar settings as in the previous benchmark case study here the results of benchmark tests case a0 and case b0 are used as references for analyzing the results of systematic computations 6 1 effects of ship squat to quantify the effects of dynamic sinkage and trim squat the ratio ξ η η 0 is defined where η 0 and η represent the quantities under fx0 case af and case bf and fr στ case a0 and case b0 conditions respectively the non dimensional hydrodynamic forces and moment x y and n for fx0 and fr στ at two ship speeds are shown in fig 11 for each speed x fluctuations can be seen in both fx0 and fr στ cases but the average value of x changes slightly with ξ 1 00 and 1 21 at fr 0 096 and 0 140 for x 0 respectively x 0 is the steady component of x to present the average value of x time history and is calculated from the x time history by using eq 9 or eq 10 as for the sway force y the data in general exhibit a clear distinction between fx0 and fr στ cases for each speed this distinction can be reflected from the ratio ξ 1 23 for y a1 at fr 0 096 y a1 is the 1st order harmonic amplitude of y time history calculated by using eq 10 when the speed increases to fr 0 140 the ratio ξ for y a1 increases to 1 69 similar trends are observed for the yaw moment n with ξ 1 27 and 1 92 at fr 0 096 and 0 140 for n a1 respectively n a1 is the 1st order harmonic amplitude of n time history calculated by using eq 10 the corresponding hydrodynamic derivatives for the cases af and bf are presented in table 7 for each ship speed the length of the instability arm n v y v slightly decreases when the ship is fixed in sinkage and trim the ratios of the linear derivatives x y v n v for the fx0 and fr στ cases in average are 1 11 and 1 50 at fr 0 096 and 0 140 respectively while the standard deviations from the average are 0 15 and 0 57 similarly the average ratios of the nonlinear derivatives x vv y vvv n vvv and the corresponding standard deviations the values in the parentheses at fr 0 096 and 0 140 are 1 02 1 47 and 4 63 2 4 respectively those of the acceleration derivatives n v y v at fr 0 096 and 0 140 are 1 22 0 18 and 1 43 1 62 respectively thus the hydrodynamic derivatives are greatly influenced by ship squat in the very shallow water especially for the nonlinear ones 6 2 effects of water depth the time histories of hydrodynamic forces and moment at different water depths and two ship speeds u 0 0 599 m s fr 0 096 and 0 872 m s fr 0 140 are shown in fig 12 to give a more clear comparison several ratios are presented in table 8 ξ 1 2 η 1 2 η deep ξ 1 5 η 1 5 η deep ξ 2 η 2 η deep and ξ 3 η 3 η deep where η 1 2 η 1 5 η 2 η 3 and η deep are variables x 0 y a1 n a1 σ a2 and τ a2 under five water depth conditions corresponding to the water depth draught ratio h t 1 2 1 5 2 0 3 0 and 8 0 respectively σ a2 and τ a2 are the 2nd order harmonic amplitude of σ and τ time histories since the time histories of sinkage and trim are mainly 2nd order harmonic the ratios for σa 2 and τa 2 are computed and presented it can be seen that except for x 0 the ratios of both y a1 and n a1 are decreasing as the water depth increases with the largest value for ξ 1 2 the differences between h t 3 0 and 8 0 are negligible for all variables with ξ 3 0 9 1 02 and 1 10 for x y and n respectively it means that the shallow water effects on the hydrodynamic forces and moment tend to be small when the ratio of water depth to draught is not less than 3 0 fig 13 compares the time histories of the dynamic sinkage and trim at different water depths and two speeds fr 0 096 and 0 140 it shows that the sinkage σ is always positive at all the water depths except for the deep water case at fr 0 096 at fr 0 096 the trim τ is negative at h t 1 2 and 1 5 but fluctuates around zero at h t 2 0 then becomes positive when h t 3 0 the trim has the similar trend at fr 0 140 as the one at fr 0 096 except that the trim is not always negative at h t 1 2 the larger amplitudes for both sinkage and trim appear in h t 1 2 case at the two speeds and these are quantified by the ratio ξ 1 2 for τ a2 and σ a2 as listed in table 8 the ratios of ξ 1 5 ξ 2 and ξ 3 for most of the variables including hydrodynamic forces and moment in the higher speed case are smaller than those of the lower speed case while ξ 1 2 is larger for all the variables the corresponding hydrodynamic derivatives at different water depths are given in table 7 a decreasing water depth results in an increasing non dimensional acceleration derivatives y v or the added mass it is shown that when the water depth draught ratio is larger than 2 0 the added mass is almost the same at the two different ship speeds in addition y v n v and the length of the instability arm n v y v increase considerably with the decreasing water depth and at the larger ship speed since the shallow water effects turn to be minor at h t 3 0 the differences of all the hydrodynamic quantities between the cases h t 3 0 and deep water are small except for the nonlinear derivatives x vv which might be caused by some numerical damping error the blockage effects of the shallow water on the hydrodynamic forces and moment are further estimated by a 4th polynomial regression formula 21 d s h a l l o w d d e e p 1 c 1 t h c 2 t h 2 c 3 t h 3 c 4 t h 4 where d s h a l l o w and d d e e p are the hydrodynamic derivatives in shallow and deep waters respectively c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 are the polynomial coefficients the ratios of the hydrodynamic derivatives in shallow water to those in deep water and the fitting curves under the two ship speeds are presented in fig 14 the corresponding polynomial coefficients are listed in table 9 it can be seen that the ship speed greatly affects the hydrodynamic derivatives at different water depths for the lower ship speed fr 0 096 all the ratios increase exponentially as h t decreases except for x since it changes slightly however when the ship speed fr 0 140 approaches the limiting speed the variations of the ratios of x vv y v n vvv are irregular especially for x vv and n vvv the obtained ratios have an opposite sign in the very shallow water to demonstrate the effects of water depth on the flow field the surge velocity contours at fr 0 096 for three water depths h t 1 2 1 5 and 3 0 at the cross section around the stern x l pp 0 471 are shown in fig 15 seen from aft into the propeller plane where po indicates the port side while st indicates the starboard side since the details of the flow field in the model tests are not available in the literature a qualitative analysis of the flow is conducted the cases at two successive motion phases when the ship model reaches the central position of the tank 90 and the maximum lateral postion to port 180 are considered the pure sway motion at the phase angle of 90 instantaneously gives the maximum drift angle β max 6 it can be seen that the shallowest case has the largest wake region indicating that the viscous effects are significant in shallow water the thickest boundary layer can be observed also in the shallowest case while the boundary layer gets thinner when h t 2 0 moreover compared with phase 90 the boundary layer near the port side is much thicker at phase 180 fig 16 shows the axial vorticity distributions on several cross sections along the hull and the pressure distributions on the hull for three water depths conditions h t 1 2 1 5 and 2 0 at 90 and 180 phases the streamlines around the hull coloured with the corresponding velocity magnitude are also shown in the figure in fig 16 remarkable pressure reductions and more pronounced flow separations at smaller water depth can be observed the velocity magnitude indicates that as the water depth becomes smaller the flow field changes more intensely around the hull especially in the bottom area this flux change is the most severe in shallowest water owing to the increased flux in the bottom area of the aft body part the pressure applied to the hull becomes lower leading to a positive sinkage at phase 90 as can be seen from the streamline plots the flow is asymmetric about the hull centerline since the hull has a drift angle vortices shedding from fore and aft body keel can be seen in all cases and they are more close to the tank bottom in the shallowest case pure sway motion causes the increase of the local drift angle which results in more intensive vortex formed near the stern area moreover the large leeward vortex on the starboard side generated at the fore bilge keel becomes stronger when the water depth tends to be smaller for the h t 1 2 case at phase 90 the pressure on the port side in the bow region is obviously larger than that on the starboard side while the pressure on the port side in the stern region is slightly smaller than that on the starboard side resulting in positive large sway force and yaw moment as can be seen in fig 12 a at the phase 180 in h t 2 0 case the flow about the hull centerline distributes more symmetrically as sway velocity is zero the vorticity is less pronounced than the cases at the phase 90 for the same reason a pair of fore body keel vortices at both port side and starboard side can be observed and the shape becomes obscure at the midship they are inward turning vortices such that the ones at the port side are rotating counter clockwise and the other ones at the starboard side are rotating clockwise a similar pair of aft body vortices also can be seen but in the opposite direction and the starboard side vortex seems larger toward the stern region because of the memory effect for the h t 1 2 case at phase 180 the pressure on the port side of bow and stern regions is slightly largerthan that on the starboard side while the pressure on the port side near the midship region is obviously smaller than that on the starboard side resulting in negative sway force and small yaw moment as can be seen in fig 12 a 7 side wall effect normally the model tests are conducted in an existing towing tank whose dimension is fixed in principal the size of the ship model should be chosen as large as possible to avoid the scale effects on the measured hydrodynamic forces on the other hand the amplitudes of the pmm tests should be large enough to obtain the nonlinear hydrodynamic derivatives therefore the model test results of the hydrodynamic derivatives are likely to be affected by the side wall effects in this section the effects of the tank width are numerically investigated the case considered follows the main conditions in the benchmark case b0 where the tank width is w 1 757l pp and the ship speed is close to the schijf s limiting speed but with a larger tank width w 5 0l pp the corresponding blockage factor m b for case b0 and the present case is 0 068 and 0 024 respectively the comparisons of the time histories of the non dimensional hydrodynamic forces and moment as well as the sinkage and trim between the two cases are shown in fig 17 it can be seen that there is a clear distinction between the numerical results of narrow and wide tank cases indicating that the hydrodynamic forces and moment obtained in case b0 suffer from the side wall effects to facilitate the quantitative comparisons a ratio ξ η η w is defined where η w and η are variables for wide and narrow tank cases respectively the ratios for x 0 y a1 and n a1 are computed and the results are ξ 1 22 1 66 and 1 51 respectively the ratios for σ a2 and τ a2 are also computed giving the results ξ 2 27 and 2 99 the corresponding hydrodynamic derivatives are given in table 10 the hydrodynamic derivatives of case b0 are also given in the table for comparison purpose it can be seen that the hydrodynamic derivatives are greatly influenced by the tank width the absolute values of the computed hydrodynamic derivatives in case b0 are all larger than those in the wide tank case except x vv and y v indicating that the side wall effects lead to an overestimation of the hydrodynamic derivatives except x vv and y v the instability arm n v y v is larger in the narrow tank case than that in the wide tank case the average ratio of the narrow tank result to the wide tank result of the x component derivatives x x vv is 1 14 while the corresponding standard deviation from the average is 0 22 similarly the average ratios and the corresponding standard deviations the values in the parentheses of the y component derivatives y v y v y vvv and the n component derivatives n v n v n vvv are 1 60 1 16 and 5 22 10 1 respectively thus the side wall effects for pure sway tests in shallow water are less significant on the x component derivatives but are considerable on the y and n component derivatives to demonstrate the side wall effects on the flow field the dynamic pressure distributions at phases 90 and 180 are shown in fig 18 it can be seen that a remarkable difference in pressure distributions on the hull exists between the two cases the negative pressure region in the narrow tank case is obviously larger than that in the wide tank case since the ship is moving with a prescribed sway motion towards the transverse direction the pronounced pressure difference between the windward and the leeward sides of the hull can be seen as a result of the cross flow during the motion there is a remarkable pressure reduction on the leeward side especially near the parallel middle body namely the starboard side at phase 90 and the port side at phase 180 while in the bow region the pressure variation or reduction at different phases is not remarkable compared to that near the parallel middle body as the cross flow effect is more or less weakened but it is still affected by the side wall to a certain extent 8 conclusions taking the dtc container ship model as study object pure sway tests in shallow water towing tank are numerically simulated by using cfd method the hydrodynamic forces the hydrodynamic derivatives the dynamic sinkage and trim and the complicated viscous flow field are presented and discussed to guarantee the accuracy of numerical computations the verification studies in terms of mesh and time step dependency are performed by using a gci method in which the fs coefficients are used for estimating the numerical error and uncertainty the gci indexes of most hydrodynamic forces in terms of the first dominant harmonics are small while those of the dynamic sinkage and trim in terms of the steady harmonics are slightly larger it can be concluded that the sinkage and trim are more sensitive to the mesh and time step than the hydrodynamic forces then two benchmark cases in extremely shallow water are considered for the validation study the predicted non dimensional hydrodynamic forces and dynamic sinkage and trim are compared with the benchmark test data and other numerical results there is a promising correspondence between the present cfd results and the benchmark test data for both hydrodynamic forces and dynamic sinkage and trim the linear and nonlinear hydrodynamic derivatives are obtained from the computed non dimensional hydrodynamic forces and the numerical results are compared with those of benchmark tests which shows reasonable agreement it shows that the increase in ship speed leads to a less reliable prediction of the acceleration derivatives in very shallow water moreover the comparison errors of the hydrodynamic forces between the experimental data and the reconstructed results based on the hydrodynamic derivatives are close to those between the numerical results and the reconstructed results based on the verification and validation study systematic simulations are carried out to investigate the effects of relevant factors such as ship squat and water depth on the hydrodynamic forces the effects of dynamic sinkage and trim in very shallow water are analyzed by comparing the numerical results with and without dynamic sinkage and trim there are remarkable differences in the hydrodynamic derivatives because of the considerable ship squat especially in the nonlinear ones these differences increase as the ship speed gets larger then the effect of water depth is studied by comparing the numerical results obtained at different water depths it appears at medium water depths h t 2 0 and dominates in very shallow water h t 1 2 as the water depth decreases the influence of ship speed on the hydrodynamic derivatives increases considerably the polynomial regression formulae for shallow water correction of the hydrodynamic derivatives under two ship speeds are then proposed by comparing the numerical results of the benchmark case and a case with larger tank width at a ship speed close to the schijf s limiting speed in very shallow water it is found that the tank width has a significant influence on the hydrodynamic quantities in the pure sway tests in shallow water towing tank the computed hydrodynamic derivatives in benchmark case suffer from the side wall effects and most are overestimated thus side wall effect corrections of the hydrodynamic derivatives are needed in this case in the practical application special attentions should be paid to the side wall effects on the hydrodynamic derivatives obtained from the captive model tests in the towing tank from the present study the ability of cfd method in evaluating the shallow water effect and side wall effect on the results of pure sway tests in towing tank is demonstrated in the future work the pure sway tests could be numerically conducted with more factors such as different speed and motion amplitude under different water depths and tank widths to get more comprehensive insights into the problem and to give guidance to avoid or revise the side wall effects on the predictions of hydrodynamic derivatives

equations sst shear stress transport ukc under keel clearance vof volume of fluid 1 introduction a ship manoeuvring in shallow water usually experiences much larger hydrodynamic forces than in open waters due to the hydrodynamic interactions between the ship and the bottom of the waterway called shallow water effects these hydrodynamic interactions have detrimental influences on ship manoeuvrability in particular the dynamic sinkage and trim of the ship commonly termed as squat briggs et al 2010 may greatly reduce the under keel clearance ukc between the ship and the bottom of the waterway a decrease of the net ukc caused by the squat may affect ship manoeuvrability dramatically resulting in loss of control and marine accidents such as collision or grounding in the report of ittc manoeuvring committee 2014 it was pointed out that the knowledge of ship motions in shallow water remains a challenging issue in addition to squat ship manoeuvrability in shallow water is affected by many different factors such as water depth waterway width ship speed etc therefore to ensure a safe navigation it is of great importance to accurately predict the hydrodynamic forces acting on the ship manoeuvring in shallow water taking these effects into account ship manoeuvring in shallow water has been the subject of studies for a long time traditionally the investigations mainly relied on model tests and semi empirical methods eloot 2006 developed a mathematical model for the prediction of ship manoeuvres under shallow water conditions based on a series of planar motion mechanism pmm tests then the mathematical model was validated by the free running model tests in shallow water eloot et al 2015 a similar procedure was adopted for a pusher barge system in deep and shallow waters maimun et al 2011 eloot et al 2016 carried out model tests of pure sway and pure yaw for the duisburg test case dtc container ship under 20 ukc at flanders hydraulics research fhr these tests were contributed as benchmark tests for the 4th conference on manoeuvring in shallow and confined water mashcon 2016 which aimed to gain a better understanding of the interaction between ship and tank bottom nowadays with the rapid developments of both computer technique and computational fluid dynamics cfd method the cfd based numerical prediction of hydrodynamic forces on manoeuvring ships has become increasingly promising stern et al 2013 the viscous flow methods typically the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method are shown to be able to produce effective and reliable predictions of ship manoeuvrability the advantage of cfd methods compared to model tests in restricted waters is that on the one hand the model tests need to be carried out in a special shallow water towing tank which is not always available in most of the research institutes on the other hand it is not possible to arbitrarily change the tank width in the model tests to investigate the side wall effect while these can be easily realized for the cfd methods in the past focuses were mainly placed on the simulation of static manoeuvres in restricted waters böttner et al 2014 lee and hong 2017 meng and wan 2016 toxopeus et al 2013 in toxopeus et al 2013 the importance of the domain width in numerical predictions of ship manoeuvrability in shallow water was stressed it was pointed out that the blockage effects might contribute to the scatter in the results of static manoeuvres meng and wan 2016 applied an overset rans code to simulate the flow around a ship in steady oblique motion in shallow water without taking into account the sinkage and trim effect considering that ships in shallow water usually undergo more notable dynamic sinkage and trim böttner et al 2014 predicted the sinkage and trim of a ship model in oblique motion and presented the details of the viscous flow fields between the ship and the seabed by using rans method similarly lee and hong 2017 analyzed the ship s course stability under different water depths by numerically simulating static drift and static yaw tests roychoudhury et al 2017 conducted cfd simulations of steady drift and yaw motions in deep and shallow waters for the tanker kvlcc2 using the rans solver shipflow in most of the previous studies the numerical simulations of dynamic manoeuvres were mainly carried out in deep water e g kim et al 2015 sakamoto et al 2012 yao et al 2016 there were also a few studies which simulated pmm tests in very shallow water by applying unsteady rans methods deng et al 2016 he et al 2016 liu et al 2016 from the existing literatures there are some research issues and challenges of the cfd based manoeuvring predictions in shallow water the shallow water effects on dynamic pmm tests are still not fully understood due to the large difficulty in numerical simulation especially considering the dynamic sinkage and trim the limited space between the ship and the seabed may easily give rise to more remarkable flow separations around the hull and more notable dynamic sinkage and trim because of the blockage effects while the periodic plane motion of the ship model during the dynamic pmm tests further aggravates the complicacy of the flow since the turbulent flows and the ship motions are more unstable in shallow water cases the flow separation features and the vortex structure are difficult to precisely capture by the numerical simulations in previous numerical studies it was found that the predicted hydrodynamic force and moment on the hull based on simulation of dynamic pmm tests were still not accurate enough for a reliable prediction of ship manoeuvrability the simulations of the dynamic sinkage and trim are even more difficult than prediction of the hydrodynamic force and moment as the ship motion is more sensitive to the restricted water effects the ship may also touch the seabed in the simulation due to its non physical oscillation caused by the poor mesh quality therefore the dynamic sinkage and trim were ignored in most of the previous studies due to the difficulty while in the simulations including sinkage and trim the overlapping mesh techniques were applied to predict the ship motion but with low accuracy more suitable mesh techniques are needed to improve the prediction of the dynamic sinkage and trim in shallow water besides in most shallow water cases the hydrodynamic derivatives especially the nonlinear ones were not evaluated thus the present paper intends to improve the accuracy in numerical predictions for the same benchmark tests comparing to the previous study liu et al 2016 by adopting appropriate numerical models and then to conduct more comprehensive investigations to get deeper understanding of the shallow water effects on the hydrodynamic quantities during the pure sway tests this paper is organized as follows firstly the mesh and time dependency studies are performed for the benchmark tests to estimate the numerical errors due to the insufficient spatial or temporal discretization then the cfd results are compared with those of he et al 2016 and the benchmark test data of eloot et al 2016 to validate the present numerical method finally the effects of water depth dynamic sinkage and trim as well as the side wall effect are assessed to provide more extensive knowledge about the hydrodynamic behaviours of a ship manoeuvring in restricted waters 2 numerical method 2 1 coordinated systems as shown in fig 1 for the pure sway tests a ship model is towed along the tank with a constant speed u 0 and simultaneously undergoes a pure sway motion with a lateral displacement y the water depth and the tank width are h and w respectively an inertial coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 and a ship fixed coordinate system o xyz are adopted to describe the ship motion the flow field is solved in the inertial coordinate system while the ship motions are modelled in the ship fixed coordinate system to facilitate the direct comparison with the benchmark tests by eloot et al 2016 another reference coordinate system o x y z is established the o 0 x 0 y 0 plane is fixed on the undisturbed free surface and the z 0 axis is pointing vertically downwards the origin of the coordinate system o xyz locates at the intersection of the water line plane and the centre line plane at the mid ship section it is also the captive point in the tests the x axis is pointing to the bow y axis to the starboard and z axis pointing from deck to keel the reference coordinate system o x y z does not change its position during the heave and pitch motions it coincides with the coordinate system o xyz when the ship has no sinkage and trim this coordinate system is used to compute the hydrodynamic forces and moments on the hull u and v are the surge and sway velocities respectively r is the yaw rate in the pure sway tests u u 0 x and y are the force components in the longitudinal and transverse directions respectively n is the yaw moment the drift angle β is defined by β tan 1 v u the resultant speed v is defined as v u 2 v 2 sinkage σ is defined as the vertical displacement at the mid ship position and positive downwards while trim τ is defined as the relative difference between the draughts t at the fore and aft perpendiculars in the o x y z coordinate system and is positive bow up 2 2 governing equations the fluid can be treated as viscous and incompressible fluid and the flow is governed by the equation of continuity and the navier stokes ns equations after averaging the equations over time it follows ferziger and peric 2002 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u j u i x j p x i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j where x i i 1 2 3 is the ith component of the earth fixed coordinate system ρ is the

2 are the rans equations where the terms on the left hand side are the transient and convective terms respectively pressure gradient viscous flux terms are given on the right hand side the motion of ship model in pure sway tests can be expressed in terms of the velocities i e u u 0 r 0 and v changes harmonically the sway displacement y the sway velocity v and the sway acceleration v are given as 3 y y max cos 2 π t t m 4 v v max sin 2 π t t m v max y max 2 π t m 5 v v max cos 2 π t t m v max y max 2 π t m 2 where y max is the sway amplitude v max is the amplitude of sway velocity v max is the amplitude of sway acceleration and t m is the motion period 2 3 numerical scheme to solve the unsteady rans equations and simulate the pure sway tests the cfd solver star ccm cd adapco 2014 is adopted a finite volume method fvm is used to discretize the flow domain into a finite number of cvs control volumes corresponding to computational mesh cells the unsteady rans equations are closed by modelling the reynolds stress tensor using the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model menter 1994 the equations are solved as an uncoupled system using a segregated flow solver which employs a semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple algorithm for pressure velocity coupling the temporal discretization is based on a first order euler difference and the spatial discretization is performed with a second order upwind scheme for the convection term and secondary gradients for the diffusion term flow quantities near the hull surface seabed and tank walls are simulated according to an all y wall treatment by using a blended wall law to estimate shear stresses this approach is flexible with its ability to handle a range of local mesh refinements near the wall the air water interface is captured using the volume of fluid vof hirt and nichols 1981 method vof assumes a common velocity and pressure field for both phases within a single cv and monitors the phase fraction the governing equations for mass and momentum continuity in a single phase flow are thus solved for an equivalent fluid whose physical properties density and laminar viscosity are functions of the constituent phase s properties and volume fractions the transport of volume fraction is described by an additional conservation equation 6 α t u i α x i 0 where α represents the volume fraction indicating the relative proportion of fluid in each cell its value is always between 0 and 1 typical low order schemes tend to smear the interface and introduce artificial mixing of the two fluids thus the high resolution interface capturing hric convection discretization scheme muzaferija et al 1998 is designed to mimic the convective transport of immiscible fluid components to improve the vof interface tracking capabilities particularly the ship motion and the corresponding velocity are specified with the dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi morphing module it involves actual displacement of the mesh vertices and can use control points and their associated displacements to generate an interpolation field throughout the region which can model the six degrees of freedom dof motion of a rigid body within the fluid then the resultant force and moment acting on the body due to all influences are calculated and the flow field is updated to find the new position and orientation of the ship 3 description of benchmark test 3 1 ship model in the tests of fhr the pure sway tests with a bare hull dtc model were conducted at a steady captive speed eloot et al 2016 the dtc is a typical 14000 teu container carrier with bulbous bow large bow flare large stern overhang and transom its main particulars are given in table 1 the geometry of the hull and the body plan are illustrated in fig 2 in the captive model tests the ship model was constrained in all degrees of freedom except for dynamic sinkage and trim fr στ the width of the towing tank is 7m the test cases with the very shallow water condition 20 ukc are used in the benchmark study in which the corresponding water depth in model scale is 0 195m 3 2 test conditions table 2 lists the details of the benchmark test conditions two ship speeds cases a0 and b0 are considered corresponding to froude numbers fr u 0 g l p p 0 096 and 0 140 g is the acceleration of the gravity which are the typical moderate froude numbers for a container carrier in deep water while under the 20 ukc condition the corresponding froude depth numbers fr h u 0 g h are 0 43 and 0 63 respectively indicating the non negligible shallow water effects the limiting froude depth number fr hcrit and schijf s limiting ship speed v crit briggs et al 2010 are critical quantities which are suggested not to exceed due to the shallow water effects fr hcrit and v crit are defined as 7 f r h c r i t v c r i t g h 2 cos π 3 arccos 1 m b 3 3 2 where m b is the blockage factor defined as m b b t h w the higher speed in case b0 is close to the schijf s limiting speed v crit 17 5 knots at full scale β max tan 1 v max u 0 is the maximum drift angle during the tests the amplitude y max and period t m of sway motion are 0 2m and 20s respectively 4 computation setup and mesh generation the computational domain is shown in fig 3 which is bounded by seven boundaries the inlet plane in front of the hull the outlet plane behind the hull the hull surface the top plane above the hull the water bottom as well as the two side walls as in the shallow water towing tank the domain extends 3 5l pp from the aft perpendicular to the outlet plane 1 5l pp from the bow to the inlet plane the domain width is equal to the width of the towing tank i e 1 757l pp the top plane reaches 1 2l pp above the undisturbed free surface while the domain extends downwards to the considered water depth as to the imposed boundary conditions on the boundaries the velocity inlet condition is set at the inlet plane where boundary pressure is extrapolated by using reconstruction gradients and a constant velocity value is fixed the pressure outlet condition is used on the outlet plane where the boundary pressure is governed by a field function which monitors the instantaneous pressure on above and below the free surface a symmetry condition is set at the top plane where the shear stress is zero the no slip condition is satisfied on the hull it should be noted that in shallow water the boundary layer developed on the water bottom may influence the flow in the gap between the ship and the water bottom thus a moving no slip condition is used on the bottom the unstructured predominantly hexahedral mesh is applied in the computational domain fig 3 depicts a general view of the computational mesh in shallow water while fig 4 provides a closer look at the volume mesh in the stern and bow region of the ship the mesh is refined towards the free surface the hull in the gap between the ship and the water bottom and in the wake to ensure that the complicated flow features can be appropriately captured the refined mesh density in these zones is achieved using volumetric controls orthogonal prismatic cells are generated next to the hull and water bottom to improve the accuracy of the flow resolution the number of prism layer is 10 near the hull and the number is 3 near the water bottom with stretching ratio of 1 5 to avoid numerical difficulty related to the mesh morphing approach as much as possible for shallow water computations y is larger than 30 in order to use wall function on the water bottom while y is smaller than 1 near the hull surface to get a more precise flow field close to the wall 5 numerical simulation of the benchmark tests the simulation starts when the hull locates at the tank centerline while the experiment data starts to export when the hull reaches to the maximum lateral position in order to compare with the experimental data directly the first t m 4 computation has been ignored furthermore the release time and ramp time are set to 20s to allow some time for the flow to be stable 5 1 computation and reconstruction of the hydrodynamic derivatives according to the motion characteristics of pure sway tests the linear acceleration derivatives y v n v linear derivatives x y v n v and nonlinear derivatives x vv y vvv n vvv can be determined by imposing dynamically varying v and v then the hydrodynamic forces and moment can be reconstructed by the following mathematical model 8 x x x v v v 2 y y y v v y v v y v v v v 3 n n n v v n v v n v v v v 3 the fourier series fs method is adopted to derive those hydrodynamic derivatives from the obtained forces and moment by using the fs method the sway motions are prescribed by cosine and sine functions the responses of forces and moment are assumed to be reconstructed as follows yoon et al 2015 9 f f 0 n 1 3 f c n cos n ω t n 1 3 f s n sin n ω t where ω 2π t m is the angular frequency f represents the time series of forces x y and moment n or the motion variables f cn and f sn are nth order fourier cosine and sine coefficients respectively alternatively eq 9 can be further formulated as 10 f f 0 n 1 3 a n cos n ω t ϕ n where a n f c n 2 f s n 2 and ϕ n tan 1 f s n f c n are the amplitude and phase of the nth order harmonic component of f respectively the harmonic forms of hydrodynamic quantities determined by substituting the motion equations eqs 4 and 5 into eq 8 are 11 x x 0 x c 2 cos 2 ω t y y s 1 sin ω t y c 1 cos ω t y s 3 sin 3 ω t n n s 1 sin ω t n c 1 cos ω t n s 3 sin 3 ω t 12 x 0 x v max 2 x v v 2 x c 2 1 2 v max 2 x v v y c 1 v max y v y s 1 v max y v 3 4 v max 3 y v v v y s 3 1 4 v max 3 y v v v n c 1 v max n v n s 1 v max n v 3 4 v max 3 n v v v n s 3 1 4 v max 3 n v v v all the related hydrodynamic derivatives can be calculated by solving eq 12 then with the hydrodynamic derivatives the time histories of the hydrodynamic forces and moment can be reproduced by eq 8 which is called reconstruction of the results sakamoto et al 2012 the reconstruction procedure can be used to evaluate how well the mathematical model with the hydrodynamic derivatives can reproduce original forces and moment instead of performing trajectory simulations by the resultant hydrodynamic derivatives toxopeus 2009 it is also regarded as the most acceptable measure to evaluate the quality of the hydrodynamic derivatives obtained from the cfd simulations for better comparison the longitudinal force x sway force y yaw moment n are non dimensionalized as follows 13 x x 1 2 ρ u 0 2 l p p 2 y y 1 2 ρ u 0 2 l p p 2 n n 1 2 ρ u 0 2 l p p 3 all the hydrodynamic derivatives in the paper are also non dimensionalized in the similar way 5 2 verification study prior to the systematic computations a verification study is performed to estimate the numerical accuracy related to the spatial or temporal discretization following the grid convergence index gci method developed by roache 1998 and further introduced by celik et al 2008 this method was used and recommended by american society of mechanical engineers asme and the american institute of aeronautics and astronautics aiaa the discretization errors caused by mesh size and time step resolution are evaluated for case a0 assuming that the numerical uncertainties for the other cases are of the same order all mesh quantities are given as percentages in terms of a base size in order to refine the mesh as systematically as possible three mesh sets coarse medium and fine are adopted in the study and the mesh refinement is achieved by applying a uniform refinement factor r k 2 to the basic size the fine mesh consists of approximately 5 7m cells the medium mesh contains about 2 7m and the coarse one has about 1 3m the time step is refined in the same way with r k 2 for pure sway simulations in shallow water 1000 time steps per period is necessary to ensure numerical stability deng et al 2016 therefore the three time steps from fine to coarse are 0 0071s 0 01s and 0 014s respectively referring to linde et al 2016 the mesh convergence analysis is performed with the medium time step and the time step convergence study is executed with the medium mesh the changes in solutions between two successive densities are defined as 14 ε 32 φ 3 φ 2 ε 21 φ 2 φ 1 where φ 1 φ 2 and φ 3 correspond to the solutions with fine medium and coarse mesh or time step the apparent order p k of the method is expressed by 15 p k 1 ln r k ln ε 32 ε 21 the extrapolated values φ e x t 21 can be calculated by 16 φ e x t 21 r k p k φ 1 φ 2 r k p k 1 the approximate relative error between the medium fine solutions e a 21 and the extrapolated relative error e e x t 21 can be computed as follows 17 e a 21 φ 1 φ 2 φ 1 18 e e x t 21 φ e x t 21 φ 1 φ e x t 21 the fine mesh convergence index g c i f i n e 21 is calculated by 19 g c i f i n e 21 1 25 e a 21 r k p k 1 traditionally the verification of the static simulations is focused on constant forces or moments while for dynamic simulations the verification study is generally conducted for forces and moments in terms of time series such as the procedure adopted by simonsen and stern 2008 however approximating the time series of the forces and moment with fs coefficients is recommended for the verification of dynamic simulations according to the ittc recommended procedures and guidelines 2018 as it was done in sakamoto et al 2012 the dynamic sinkage and trim results are also reconstructed with fs coefficients table 3 summarizes the results of the mesh and time step convergence studies for x 0 y c1 y s1 n c1 n s1 τ 0 and σ 0 where y c1 y s1 n c1 n s1 are 1st order fourier cosine and sine coefficients of y and n as defined in eq 9 as can be seen from table 3 all the coefficients have small approximate relative errors and extrapolated relative errors while τ 0 is more sensitive to the mesh resolutions since its e a 21 is up to 12 the numerical uncertainties in the fine mesh solution for those fs coefficients are less than 3 except for τ 0 about 11 for the time step convergence all the seven coefficients are fairly insensitive to the time step since the maximum e a 21 is up to 3 64 n c 1 and σ 0 converge relatively slow since their observed apparent order p k is smaller than 1 and the corresponding numerical uncertainties in the smallest time step solution are around 20 the numerical uncertainties of other five coefficients are smaller than 5 the time histories of non dimensional hydrodynamic forces and moment dynamic sinkage and trim for the three mesh density solutions and the three time step solutions are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively it can be seen that the non dimensional hydrodynamic forces and moment change little among different mesh densities or time steps while the non dimensional yaw moment n is more sensitive to the mesh density moreover some instability is observed for the dynamic sinkage σ and trim τ as they are more sensitive to the mesh size and time step than the hydrodynamic forces and moment in order to analyze the grid resolution in the gap between the ship and the tank bottom fig 7 presents the grid convergence tendency of the surge velocity u sway velocity v and the dynamic pressure p along a longitudinal cut line between the hull and the tank bottom y 0 1m z 0 193m at a motion phase 90 when the ship model reaches the central position of the tank where a positive x represents a location in the fore part of the hull it can be seen that the pressure or the surge velocity changes little among these three mesh densities while for the sway velocity the grid convergence is not achieved at some of the positions especially near the bow region the grid uncertainties especially for the sway velocity are larger near the bow regions because the flow around the bow regions is more complicated since the local flow quantities are more sensitive to the mesh density and they are more location dependent denser meshes are required to obtain more precise flow quantities with higher resolutions it is shown that the adopted medium mesh size is applicable for the predictions of integrated quantities and to a certain extent can also give an acceptable prediction of the basic quantities of the local flow field thus the medium mesh density and medium time step are used in the subsequent systematic computations 5 3 validation with benchmark tests in this subsection comparisons between the computed and measured results are presented for the non dimensional longitudinal force x sway force y and yaw moment n as well as the dynamic sinkage σ and trim τ the corresponding computed hydrodynamic derivatives and the reconstructed hydrodynamic forces are also compared with the test ones the average comparison error is defined as sakamoto et al 2012 20 e d 1 k i 1 k d i s i 1 k i 1 k d i 100 e r e f d d 1 k i 1 k d i d r i 1 k i 1 k d i 100 e r c f d d 1 k i 1 k d i s r i 1 k i 1 k d i 100 where k is the total number of the experimental data d i is the instantaneous experimental data and s i is the instantaneous cfd result at the same time d ri represents the reconstructed experimental data and s ri denotes the reconstructed computation result e e r e f d and e r c f d are the corresponding average errors particularly when the computed hydrodynamic derivatives are compared with the experimental data a comparison error e is defined as e d d s d 100 in figs 8 and 9 comparisons between computed cfd and measured efd results for case a0 and case b0 are presented for the longitudinal force x sway force y and yaw moment n as well as the dynamic sinkage σ and trim τ the numerical results by he et al 2016 cfd he et al using an in house cfd tool with the sst k ω turbulence model and the overset grid technique are also presented it can be seen that there is a promising correspondence between the present cfd results and the experimental data the prediction results of sway force y and yaw moment n by he et al 2016 are also satisfactory but for the longitudinal forces x and dynamic sinkage σ and trim τ their computed results are more unstable compared with the benchmark test data moreover compared with the previous results liu et al 2016 the accuracy has been improved in the present study especially for the sinkage and trim for both case a0 and case b0 the maximum values of the sway force y and yaw moment n are well predicted as shown in fig 8 even though the variation in the longitudinal force x predicted by the present cfd method is smaller than the experimental one implying more notable fluctuations during the experiments the mean longitudinal force is well captured by the present cfd method the fluctuations might be caused by noise in the experiment and the force sensor with wide measurement range may lead to notable fluctuations when a small force is measured for case a0 a peak value of n can be seen at the maximum velocity point t t m 0 25 0 75 i e when the ship model is at the middle of the tank while y peaks approximately appear at t t m 0 2 0 7 when the froude number is larger case b0 the phase of y delays i e y peaks approximately appear at the maximum velocity point while n peaks appear at t t m 0 35 0 85 this phase difference may be caused by the memory effects induced by the motion of the ship model the surge velocity greatly influences the ship wake when the ship model sways side to side moreover a little asymmetric trend for both y and n can be observed for case a0 and an increasing asymmetry can be seen for case b0 it can be seen from fig 9 that the ship sinkage and trim at twice the frequency of the sway motion give rise to a strong coupling of horizontal and vertical motions which is in accordance with the observation reported by eloot 2006 moreover the dynamic sinkage and trim are in phase i e the maximum sinkage corresponds to a maximum trim for case a0 the peak values of sinkage and trim appear at the maximum velocity point t t m 0 25 0 75 and the minimum values are at t t m 0 5 and 1 the maximum and the minimum values get larger when the ship speed is larger for case b0 the critical velocity is almost reached which gives increasing amplitudes of sinkage and trim this means the critical velocity greatly influences the dynamic sinkage and trim table 4 presents the hydrodynamic derivatives obtained from test data and the present cfd results it can be seen that for the hydrodynamic derivatives in general all the predicted linear hydrodynamic derivatives and acceleration derivatives are more accurate than the nonlinear hydrodynamic derivatives the current β max range is small which makes it difficult to calculate the nonlinear derivatives in case a0 the error in n v is large since this derivative is induced by the added inertia and is a small quantity it is difficult for both the simulation and the experiment to determine it accurately it should be noted that in case b0 the non dimensional acceleration derivative y v or the added mass due to sway motion becomes more than four times larger than that in case a0 frequency dependence of the added mass is a notable problem in shallow water this phenomenon was explained in detail in eloot 2006 fig 10 presents the reconstructed computation results cfd recons and experiment results efd recons of x y and n by using the hydrodynamic derivatives for a clearer demonstration the original computed cfd raw and measured efd raw results are also given in this figure it can be seen that the reconstruction results can reproduce original forces and moment which further validates the quality of the hydrodynamic derivatives obtained from the present cfd computations for a quantitative comparison table 5 presents e e r e f d and e r c f d it can be seen that all the average comparison errors are around 20 since an uncertainty analysis on model test data was not explicitly implemented the discrepancy might be due to the experimental errors at low speed and in very shallow water or tank resonance and unrealistic combinations of oscillating and translation motions during the tests the accuracy in the trim prediction is worse compared to that in the sinkage prediction as trim value is small during the tests at relatively low speed e r c f d is slightly larger than e r e f d but still of the same order of magnitude this implies that the present cfd simulations can provide reliable predictions of hydrodynamic quantities as the model tests 6 effects of relevant factors in the last section the pure sway tests are numerically simulated for two benchmark tests in very shallow water from which the numerical errors are investigated in detail and the numerical method is validated with the benchmark test data considering that in practical applications many factors affect the pure sway tests in towing tank it is worthwhile to study the effects of these factors given that serious fluctuations were found in the dynamic sinkage and trim in the benchmark tests the effects of the ship dynamic sinkage and trim on the hydrodynamic forces and hydrodynamic derivatives are further investigated two numerical simulations case af and case bf with the ship model constrained at zero sinkage and trim fx0 are conducted and the numerical results are compared with those of benchmark tests case a0 and case b0 where the ship model is free to dynamic sinkage and trim fr στ furthermore four other water depths in combination with two ship speeds are considered to investigate the effects of water depth and ship speed details about the computational conditions of all the cases are listed in table 6 the ratios of water depth to draught h t represent very shallow water h t 1 2 shallow water 1 2 h t 1 5 medium deep water 1 5 h t 3 0 and deep water h t 3 0 according to the ittc report ittc manoeuvring committee 2002 note that the prism layer is not used on the bottom surface in deep water cases h t 8 0 where the blockage effect is minor although different meshes are applied for each water depth the same cell size is used on the hull surface for all cases to minimize the influence of the mesh refinement near the hull toxopeus et al 2013 the computations are performed using the similar settings as in the previous benchmark case study here the results of benchmark tests case a0 and case b0 are used as references for analyzing the results of systematic computations 6 1 effects of ship squat to quantify the effects of dynamic sinkage and trim squat the ratio ξ η η 0 is defined where η 0 and η represent the quantities under fx0 case af and case bf and fr στ case a0 and case b0 conditions respectively the non dimensional hydrodynamic forces and moment x y and n for fx0 and fr στ at two ship speeds are shown in fig 11 for each speed x fluctuations can be seen in both fx0 and fr στ cases but the average value of x changes slightly with ξ 1 00 and 1 21 at fr 0 096 and 0 140 for x 0 respectively x 0 is the steady component of x to present the average value of x time history and is calculated from the x time history by using eq 9 or eq 10 as for the sway force y the data in general exhibit a clear distinction between fx0 and fr στ cases for each speed this distinction can be reflected from the ratio ξ 1 23 for y a1 at fr 0 096 y a1 is the 1st order harmonic amplitude of y time history calculated by using eq 10 when the speed increases to fr 0 140 the ratio ξ for y a1 increases to 1 69 similar trends are observed for the yaw moment n with ξ 1 27 and 1 92 at fr 0 096 and 0 140 for n a1 respectively n a1 is the 1st order harmonic amplitude of n time history calculated by using eq 10 the corresponding hydrodynamic derivatives for the cases af and bf are presented in table 7 for each ship speed the length of the instability arm n v y v slightly decreases when the ship is fixed in sinkage and trim the ratios of the linear derivatives x y v n v for the fx0 and fr στ cases in average are 1 11 and 1 50 at fr 0 096 and 0 140 respectively while the standard deviations from the average are 0 15 and 0 57 similarly the average ratios of the nonlinear derivatives x vv y vvv n vvv and the corresponding standard deviations the values in the parentheses at fr 0 096 and 0 140 are 1 02 1 47 and 4 63 2 4 respectively those of the acceleration derivatives n v y v at fr 0 096 and 0 140 are 1 22 0 18 and 1 43 1 62 respectively thus the hydrodynamic derivatives are greatly influenced by ship squat in the very shallow water especially for the nonlinear ones 6 2 effects of water depth the time histories of hydrodynamic forces and moment at different water depths and two ship speeds u 0 0 599 m s fr 0 096 and 0 872 m s fr 0 140 are shown in fig 12 to give a more clear comparison several ratios are presented in table 8 ξ 1 2 η 1 2 η deep ξ 1 5 η 1 5 η deep ξ 2 η 2 η deep and ξ 3 η 3 η deep where η 1 2 η 1 5 η 2 η 3 and η deep are variables x 0 y a1 n a1 σ a2 and τ a2 under five water depth conditions corresponding to the water depth draught ratio h t 1 2 1 5 2 0 3 0 and 8 0 respectively σ a2 and τ a2 are the 2nd order harmonic amplitude of σ and τ time histories since the time histories of sinkage and trim are mainly 2nd order harmonic the ratios for σa 2 and τa 2 are computed and presented it can be seen that except for x 0 the ratios of both y a1 and n a1 are decreasing as the water depth increases with the largest value for ξ 1 2 the differences between h t 3 0 and 8 0 are negligible for all variables with ξ 3 0 9 1 02 and 1 10 for x y and n respectively it means that the shallow water effects on the hydrodynamic forces and moment tend to be small when the ratio of water depth to draught is not less than 3 0 fig 13 compares the time histories of the dynamic sinkage and trim at different water depths and two speeds fr 0 096 and 0 140 it shows that the sinkage σ is always positive at all the water depths except for the deep water case at fr 0 096 at fr 0 096 the trim τ is negative at h t 1 2 and 1 5 but fluctuates around zero at h t 2 0 then becomes positive when h t 3 0 the trim has the similar trend at fr 0 140 as the one at fr 0 096 except that the trim is not always negative at h t 1 2 the larger amplitudes for both sinkage and trim appear in h t 1 2 case at the two speeds and these are quantified by the ratio ξ 1 2 for τ a2 and σ a2 as listed in table 8 the ratios of ξ 1 5 ξ 2 and ξ 3 for most of the variables including hydrodynamic forces and moment in the higher speed case are smaller than those of the lower speed case while ξ 1 2 is larger for all the variables the corresponding hydrodynamic derivatives at different water depths are given in table 7 a decreasing water depth results in an increasing non dimensional acceleration derivatives y v or the added mass it is shown that when the water depth draught ratio is larger than 2 0 the added mass is almost the same at the two different ship speeds in addition y v n v and the length of the instability arm n v y v increase considerably with the decreasing water depth and at the larger ship speed since the shallow water effects turn to be minor at h t 3 0 the differences of all the hydrodynamic quantities between the cases h t 3 0 and deep water are small except for the nonlinear derivatives x vv which might be caused by some numerical damping error the blockage effects of the shallow water on the hydrodynamic forces and moment are further estimated by a 4th polynomial regression formula 21 d s h a l l o w d d e e p 1 c 1 t h c 2 t h 2 c 3 t h 3 c 4 t h 4 where d s h a l l o w and d d e e p are the hydrodynamic derivatives in shallow and deep waters respectively c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 are the polynomial coefficients the ratios of the hydrodynamic derivatives in shallow water to those in deep water and the fitting curves under the two ship speeds are presented in fig 14 the corresponding polynomial coefficients are listed in table 9 it can be seen that the ship speed greatly affects the hydrodynamic derivatives at different water depths for the lower ship speed fr 0 096 all the ratios increase exponentially as h t decreases except for x since it changes slightly however when the ship speed fr 0 140 approaches the limiting speed the variations of the ratios of x vv y v n vvv are irregular especially for x vv and n vvv the obtained ratios have an opposite sign in the very shallow water to demonstrate the effects of water depth on the flow field the surge velocity contours at fr 0 096 for three water depths h t 1 2 1 5 and 3 0 at the cross section around the stern x l pp 0 471 are shown in fig 15 seen from aft into the propeller plane where po indicates the port side while st indicates the starboard side since the details of the flow field in the model tests are not available in the literature a qualitative analysis of the flow is conducted the cases at two successive motion phases when the ship model reaches the central position of the tank 90 and the maximum lateral postion to port 180 are considered the pure sway motion at the phase angle of 90 instantaneously gives the maximum drift angle β max 6 it can be seen that the shallowest case has the largest wake region indicating that the viscous effects are significant in shallow water the thickest boundary layer can be observed also in the shallowest case while the boundary layer gets thinner when h t 2 0 moreover compared with phase 90 the boundary layer near the port side is much thicker at phase 180 fig 16 shows the axial vorticity distributions on several cross sections along the hull and the pressure distributions on the hull for three water depths conditions h t 1 2 1 5 and 2 0 at 90 and 180 phases the streamlines around the hull coloured with the corresponding velocity magnitude are also shown in the figure in fig 16 remarkable pressure reductions and more pronounced flow separations at smaller water depth can be observed the velocity magnitude indicates that as the water depth becomes smaller the flow field changes more intensely around the hull especially in the bottom area this flux change is the most severe in shallowest water owing to the increased flux in the bottom area of the aft body part the pressure applied to the hull becomes lower leading to a positive sinkage at phase 90 as can be seen from the streamline plots the flow is asymmetric about the hull centerline since the hull has a drift angle vortices shedding from fore and aft body keel can be seen in all cases and they are more close to the tank bottom in the shallowest case pure sway motion causes the increase of the local drift angle which results in more intensive vortex formed near the stern area moreover the large leeward vortex on the starboard side generated at the fore bilge keel becomes stronger when the water depth tends to be smaller for the h t 1 2 case at phase 90 the pressure on the port side in the bow region is obviously larger than that on the starboard side while the pressure on the port side in the stern region is slightly smaller than that on the starboard side resulting in positive large sway force and yaw moment as can be seen in fig 12 a at the phase 180 in h t 2 0 case the flow about the hull centerline distributes more symmetrically as sway velocity is zero the vorticity is less pronounced than the cases at the phase 90 for the same reason a pair of fore body keel vortices at both port side and starboard side can be observed and the shape becomes obscure at the midship they are inward turning vortices such that the ones at the port side are rotating counter clockwise and the other ones at the starboard side are rotating clockwise a similar pair of aft body vortices also can be seen but in the opposite direction and the starboard side vortex seems larger toward the stern region because of the memory effect for the h t 1 2 case at phase 180 the pressure on the port side of bow and stern regions is slightly largerthan that on the starboard side while the pressure on the port side near the midship region is obviously smaller than that on the starboard side resulting in negative sway force and small yaw moment as can be seen in fig 12 a 7 side wall effect normally the model tests are conducted in an existing towing tank whose dimension is fixed in principal the size of the ship model should be chosen as large as possible to avoid the scale effects on the measured hydrodynamic forces on the other hand the amplitudes of the pmm tests should be large enough to obtain the nonlinear hydrodynamic derivatives therefore the model test results of the hydrodynamic derivatives are likely to be affected by the side wall effects in this section the effects of the tank width are numerically investigated the case considered follows the main conditions in the benchmark case b0 where the tank width is w 1 757l pp and the ship speed is close to the schijf s limiting speed but with a larger tank width w 5 0l pp the corresponding blockage factor m b for case b0 and the present case is 0 068 and 0 024 respectively the comparisons of the time histories of the non dimensional hydrodynamic forces and moment as well as the sinkage and trim between the two cases are shown in fig 17 it can be seen that there is a clear distinction between the numerical results of narrow and wide tank cases indicating that the hydrodynamic forces and moment obtained in case b0 suffer from the side wall effects to facilitate the quantitative comparisons a ratio ξ η η w is defined where η w and η are variables for wide and narrow tank cases respectively the ratios for x 0 y a1 and n a1 are computed and the results are ξ 1 22 1 66 and 1 51 respectively the ratios for σ a2 and τ a2 are also computed giving the results ξ 2 27 and 2 99 the corresponding hydrodynamic derivatives are given in table 10 the hydrodynamic derivatives of case b0 are also given in the table for comparison purpose it can be seen that the hydrodynamic derivatives are greatly influenced by the tank width the absolute values of the computed hydrodynamic derivatives in case b0 are all larger than those in the wide tank case except x vv and y v indicating that the side wall effects lead to an overestimation of the hydrodynamic derivatives except x vv and y v the instability arm n v y v is larger in the narrow tank case than that in the wide tank case the average ratio of the narrow tank result to the wide tank result of the x component derivatives x x vv is 1 14 while the corresponding standard deviation from the average is 0 22 similarly the average ratios and the corresponding standard deviations the values in the parentheses of the y component derivatives y v y v y vvv and the n component derivatives n v n v n vvv are 1 60 1 16 and 5 22 10 1 respectively thus the side wall effects for pure sway tests in shallow water are less significant on the x component derivatives but are considerable on the y and n component derivatives to demonstrate the side wall effects on the flow field the dynamic pressure distributions at phases 90 and 180 are shown in fig 18 it can be seen that a remarkable difference in pressure distributions on the hull exists between the two cases the negative pressure region in the narrow tank case is obviously larger than that in the wide tank case since the ship is moving with a prescribed sway motion towards the transverse direction the pronounced pressure difference between the windward and the leeward sides of the hull can be seen as a result of the cross flow during the motion there is a remarkable pressure reduction on the leeward side especially near the parallel middle body namely the starboard side at phase 90 and the port side at phase 180 while in the bow region the pressure variation or reduction at different phases is not remarkable compared to that near the parallel middle body as the cross flow effect is more or less weakened but it is still affected by the side wall to a certain extent 8 conclusions taking the dtc container ship model as study object pure sway tests in shallow water towing tank are numerically simulated by using cfd method the hydrodynamic forces the hydrodynamic derivatives the dynamic sinkage and trim and the complicated viscous flow field are presented and discussed to guarantee the accuracy of numerical computations the verification studies in terms of mesh and time step dependency are performed by using a gci method in which the fs coefficients are used for estimating the numerical error and uncertainty the gci indexes of most hydrodynamic forces in terms of the first dominant harmonics are small while those of the dynamic sinkage and trim in terms of the steady harmonics are slightly larger it can be concluded that the sinkage and trim are more sensitive to the mesh and time step than the hydrodynamic forces then two benchmark cases in extremely shallow water are considered for the validation study the predicted non dimensional hydrodynamic forces and dynamic sinkage and trim are compared with the benchmark test data and other numerical results there is a promising correspondence between the present cfd results and the benchmark test data for both hydrodynamic forces and dynamic sinkage and trim the linear and nonlinear hydrodynamic derivatives are obtained from the computed non dimensional hydrodynamic forces and the numerical results are compared with those of benchmark tests which shows reasonable agreement it shows that the increase in ship speed leads to a less reliable prediction of the acceleration derivatives in very shallow water moreover the comparison errors of the hydrodynamic forces between the experimental data and the reconstructed results based on the hydrodynamic derivatives are close to those between the numerical results and the reconstructed results based on the verification and validation study systematic simulations are carried out to investigate the effects of relevant factors such as ship squat and water depth on the hydrodynamic forces the effects of dynamic sinkage and trim in very shallow water are analyzed by comparing the numerical results with and without dynamic sinkage and trim there are remarkable differences in the hydrodynamic derivatives because of the considerable ship squat especially in the nonlinear ones these differences increase as the ship speed gets larger then the effect of water depth is studied by comparing the numerical results obtained at different water depths it appears at medium water depths h t 2 0 and dominates in very shallow water h t 1 2 as the water depth decreases the influence of ship speed on the hydrodynamic derivatives increases considerably the polynomial regression formulae for shallow water correction of the hydrodynamic derivatives under two ship speeds are then proposed by comparing the numerical results of the benchmark case and a case with larger tank width at a ship speed close to the schijf s limiting speed in very shallow water it is found that the tank width has a significant influence on the hydrodynamic quantities in the pure sway tests in shallow water towing tank the computed hydrodynamic derivatives in benchmark case suffer from the side wall effects and most are overestimated thus side wall effect corrections of the hydrodynamic derivatives are needed in this case in the practical application special attentions should be paid to the side wall effects on the hydrodynamic derivatives obtained from the captive model tests in the towing tank from the present study the ability of cfd method in evaluating the shallow water effect and side wall effect on the results of pure sway tests in towing tank is demonstrated in the future work the pure sway tests could be numerically conducted with more factors such as different speed and motion amplitude under different water depths and tank widths to get more comprehensive insights into the problem and to give guidance to avoid or revise the side wall effects on the predictions of hydrodynamic derivatives

22477,this paper combines random forests with physics based models to forecast the electricity output of the mutriku wave farm on the bay of biscay the period analysed was 2014 2016 and the forecast horizon was 24 h in 4 h steps the random forest rf machine learning technique was used with three sets of inputs i the electricity generated at mutriku ii the wave energy flux wef prediction made by the ecmwf wave model at mutriku s nearest gridpoint and iii ocean and atmospheric data for the bay of biscay for this last input extended empirical orthogonal functions eofs were calculated to reduce the dimensionality of these data while retaining most of the information the forecasts are evaluated using the r squared mean absolute error mae and mean absolute percentage error mape the model easily outperforms a persistence forecast at 8 10 h and beyond the most accurate forecasts are achieved by using all three of these inputs this approach may help to effectively integrate wave farms into the electricity market keywords mutriku wave farm electric power forecasting random forest machine learning fluid mechanics 1 introduction 1 1 wave energy development the sea and oceans are a potential source of renewable energy marine energy which includes both offshore wind and waves among others could enable the european union eu to reach its environmental goals as well as record major economic growth in fact the commission s blue growth strategy recently singled out the ocean energy sector as one of the emerging areas in the blue economy blue energy 2014 and major investments and efforts are currently in place especially throughout europe the ocean energy sector includes different technologies such as wave energy tidal energy salinity gradient and ocean thermal energy conversion otec whose main aim is to transform the power from seas and oceans into low polluting energy o hagan et al 2016 according to the 2018 annual economic report on the eu blue economy blue economy 2018 the eu is the principal developer of ocean energy technology aiming to install 100 gw of ocean energy capacity by 2050 thus creating more than 400 000 jobs thus far waves and tidal energy are the most mature ocean energy technologies and they are expected to evolve to commercial status in the medium term by the end of 2013 ocean energy capacity was about 530 mw world energy outlook 2015 with most of this coming from tidal power the majority of the tidal power projects currently in operation are located in korea canada and france reaching capacities of up to 254 mw in the case of korea smaller pre commercial wave and tidal power projects in the order of 11 mw have gained increasing relevance especially in united kingdom santos et al 2017 the eu is one of the main developers of ocean energy technology in terms of the companies involved in the development of converters devices and technology in general 50 focus on the field of wave energy and 45 on tidal moreover most of the ocean energy test and implementation sites are located on european coasts magagna and uihlein 2015 a higher percentage of the world s electricity could be generated from ocean based energy sources so there is a clear need to provide an economic incentive promoting the use of this type of renewable energy esteban and leary 2012 the characterisation and mapping of ocean energy resources including the identification of areas with high wave energy and its quantification constitute a necessary first step for the development of ocean energy additionally it is important to accurately estimate available wave energy sources with a high spatial and temporal resolution the simulation and forecasting of parameters such as wave energy flux or electric power is therefore crucial for optimising the design of wave energy converters wecs as well as predicting the electricity available to the grid reikard et al 2011 2017 pinson et al 2012 parkinson et al 2015 widén et al 2015 to date the mutriku wave farm on the bay of biscay fig 1 is the only one in the world continuously supplying electricity to the grid o hagan et al 2016 ibarra berastegi et al 2018 the energy production data used in this work have been provided by the basque energy agency eve ente vasco de la energía www eve eus making them available for research and thus solving one of the main limitations when trying to obtain more realistic wave energy forecasting results reikard 2017 mutriku has 14 oscillating water column owc operating turbines and supplies energy to the grid 74 4 of the time one of the more significant parameters recorded at the wave farm is the average power generated by each turbine over the preceding 5 min leading to an energy output of 246 469 kwh per year in the 2014 2016 period under analysis the aim of this paper is therefore to predict the power output at mutriku with a 24 h forecast lead time 1 2 forecasting electricity production the participation of renewable energy sources in electricity market mechanisms may incur economic sanctions if any imbalances are detected between generation and supply kaur et al 2016 mazzi and pinson 2017 this issue has received increasing attention in the past especially in the field of solar and wind power generation where some authors esteban et al 2010 2012 propose the use of energy storage devices e g batteries or hydrogen to solve the intermittency problems associated with renewable energies surplus electricity would therefore be stored during high production periods and then be made available for subsequent peak demand periods in order to reduce the high levels of uncertainty around renewable energy production information needs to be predicted for better decision making processes in electricity markets thus a reliable forecasting method will lead to a reduction in integration cost lower average annual operating costs and fewer penalties for mismatches between the power contracted and its effective delivery all of which will impact directly on the economy botterud 2017 notton et al 2018 short term forecasting ranging from a few hours to a few days is normally used for planning and controlling economic load supplies as well as for competitive negotiation in electricity markets long term forecasts ranging from a few days to a week are generally used for operations that need forward information from renewable sources in the long term such as energy storage approaches or maintenance programming of both renewable and conventional power plants taşcıkaraoğlu 2017 all forecasting strategies whether short or long term contribute to a more accurate economic and reliable modus operandi the accuracy of the power forecast is a crucial factor for the system s optimum performance because both under and over forecasting incur additional costs for offsetting the differences between estimation and reality in the particular case of wave energy a particular wec s electricity production at a given moment and location is driven mainly by local waves hence building cost effective strategies and models for the short term prediction of electricity production at a wave farm can largely benefit from the experience methods and strategies developed for forecasting wave energy ibarra berastegi et al 2015a 2016 statistical techniques and physics based models are commonly used for wave forecasting the wam wave model included in the integrated forecast system ifs of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf is an example of a wave forecasting system based on physical models statistical techniques include random forest rf regression based neural networks and genetic programming in general statistical models are more accurate for short time horizons of 3 18 h e g for utilities operating wave farms while physics based models are better predictors for longer horizons of 18 20 h and beyond e g ocean conditions for sailing reikard and rogers 2011 uihlein and magagna 2016 the combination of both techniques statistical and physics based models is also analysed by reikard et al 2011 concluding that this way they yield more accurate predictions than when used individually spain does not have any specific price regulations on the electricity generated at wave farms however there is a more general regulation applicable to all the electricity generated at facilities based on emerging renewable technologies as in the case of mutriku the prices of the electricity generated at these facilities are not currently informed by the unregulated interaction of the players in a free market as they are fixed by law for a given period of time after which the applicable regulations may change boe 2017 the experience gained by the authors through building short term forecasting models for precipitation fernández ferrero et al 2009 2010 or the wave energy flux in the bay of biscay ibarra berastegi et al 2015a 2016 has now been applied to the short term prediction of the electricity output at mutriku the approach described in this paper is a further development of our previous studies in this field i e the use of the rf technique among others for predicting a target variable additionally based on the data analysed at mutriku during the 2014 2016 period we now go one step further by using mutriku s output as the predicted variable log records of sea states in the bay of biscay and future electricity production are mathematically related using the machine learning rf technique due to the highly non linear relationships to be expected in operations rf is a most appropriate option for developing the aforementioned forecasting models the objective of this paper is therefore to build a set of rf based models to forecast the electricity generated at the mutriku with forecast lead times of up to 24 h the models shown here are fed with current and past observations corresponding to the power generated by the turbines in mutriku as well as with wide area oceanic and atmospheric information from ecmwf reanalyses however in a first step a reduction in the dimensionality will be applied using extended eofs this is undertaken with two goals in mind the first one is to reduce the spurious spatial correlations common in spatial meteorological fields as the information at all the grid points is not effectively independent it is common to use eofs involving information that is closer to the effective number of degrees of freedom in model output fields bretherton et al 1999 wang and shen 1999 the second goal is related to the effective use of combined eofs from several variables to handle all the information involved in the forecast additionally the rf model s performance will be evaluated and compared to the most obvious and simplest model persistence of electric power persistence assumes that what we are currently observing will also be replicated exactly over the fothcoming hours and is considered here as a benchmark that can be used to compare the forecasting ability of alternative models as it is the simplest forecasting tool available the originality of this work lies in the combination of rf as a statistical technique and the use of predictions made by physics based models as inputs for rf models this method has been tested for mutriku and has proven to predict electric power effectively in the following sections the data and methodology used will first be explained the results obtained with both the rf model and persistence will be compared and discussed and finally the more salient conclusions will be presented the main lines of future research will also be discussed 2 data and methodology 2 1 data data from two different sources have been used 1 data from the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf corresponding to the era5 reanalysis https www ecmwf int en forecasts datasets reanalysis datasets era5 hourly data for the 2014 2016 period and the bay of biscay 48 9 n 349 5 e 43 2 n 358 5 e have been used fig 1 era5 has a resolution of 0 3 0 3 so 548 sea gridpoints were initially used for this study however a preliminary screening of these gridpoints led to the conclusion that using only one out of every nine available 61 was enough due to the high spatial correlation of the information contained in them which led to a low number of independent degrees of freedom these are the same variables and geographical environment used in our previous studies although now the more recent era5 reanalysis has been used as the input source instead of era interim as is the case in the field of wind energy olauson 2018 era5 s higher time and space resolution will probably make it the benchmark for wave energy studies over the coming years furthermore era interim is soon to be discontinued so state of the art forecasting systems need to be built using the new era5 reanalysis the following variables of interest have been chosen significant wave height hs mean wave period tm mean wave direction mwd mean sea level pressure mslp and finally zonal and meridional components of wind speed at 10 m u10 v10 the wave energy flux wef kw m at all the gridpoints has been calculated under the hypothesis of deep waters multon 2012 lavidas and venugopal 2018 according to eq 2 2 wef ρg2hs2tm 64π 0 489hs2tm where ρ 1025 kg m3 is the density of sea water variable and g 9 8 m s2 is gravitational acceleration whose theoretical value varies according to latitude the combination of the wef values and the mean wave direction mwd at each gridpoint allows calculating the zonal wefu and meridional wefv components of this wef all these variables have been used for the whole area in analysis mode although era5 also provides forecasts at hourly steps for the same variables at each gridpoint up to a horizon of 18 h ahead at 06 00 and 18 00 gmt as this paper s objective is to forecast the electric power at mutriku up to 24 h ahead and as electricity production is driven by ocean waves era5 forecasts of hs and tm have also been used at the nearest gridpoint 21 km to mutriku fig 2 at 4 8 12 16 and 18 h ahead as a first step hs and tm have been combined using eq 2 to calculate the wef forecast at 4 8 12 16 and 18 h ahead the idea is that the era5 forecasts of forthcoming sea states may also be used to feed the models and provide more accurate predictions of the electricity generated 2 hourly data from the mutriku scada computer data recording system corresponding to the same period 2014 2016 this is the initial period of systematic data gathering and validation and most available cases have been recorded only every 4 h predictions have therefore been calculated at 4 h steps from 4 to 24 h ahead from the total of 14 wells type turbines using owc technology installed not all of them are continually generating electricity on average and due to maintenance work or experimental purposes only around 10 turbines are normally running at any given moment the electricity produced may also vary from one turbine to another due to the irregular seabed and the spatial configuration of mutriku s breakwater more details on the general operational characteristics of mutriku can be found elsewhere ibarra berastegi et al 2018 although the instantaneous power generated by each turbine is regularly recorded its value may be due to the action of a particular wave that is not necessarily representative of the current sea state a more reasonable indicator of electric power has therefore been chosen for current and previous studies namely the average power generated by each turbine over the previous 5 min as the yield of the operating turbines may differ the average power generated across the active turbines over the previous 5 min has been used as a reference of overall electric power this will be the target variable to be predicted up to 24 h ahead and it will be referred to here simply as the electricity generated at mutriku after a strict data screening and pre processing stage a total of 2855 hourly cases were available for building the models the first 1427 were used to train the models and the last 1428 to test them all the results on model performance shown in this paper have been obtained exclusively from the 1428 cases corresponding to the test database 2 2 methodology the general aim here was to use rf based statistical models to forecast the electricity generated by waves using the data recorded at mutriku over the 2014 2016 period the results obtained were compared to the ones provided by persistence the maximum forecasting lead time has been set at 24 h within this forecast lead time the rf predictions have been made up to 24 h ahead at 4 h time steps 2 2 1 building the models an rf model has been built for each forecast lead time in each model the output or target variable at a given time t is the average power generated through the active turbines at mutriku over the previous 5 min t h h 4 8 12 16 20 24 this means a total of six models have been built because as mentioned above in most cases data from mutriku s scada are available only every 4 h the inputs for all the models have been as follows i the observed electric power generated at time t ii the era5 wave energy flux forecasts at t k k 4 8 12 16 and 18 at the nearest gridpoint to mutriku fig 2 iii the era5 data for the bay of biscay using observations analyses not only at t but also at t 6 t 12 t 18 and t 24 to capture the daily evolution of the sea states in the area twenty inputs have been used after a phase of dimensionality reduction via extended eof see below 2 2 2 extended empirical orthogonal functions when it was used as a tool for statistical weather forecasting at the end of the 1940s north 1984 monahan et al 2009 the principal component analysis technique was referred to as empirical orthogonal functions eofs the method seeks the optimal decomposition of a field that is a function of time and space into a set of patterns that are only a function of space eofs and associated time indices principal components pcs eofs followed by a sensible truncation of the number of pcs retained allow optimally reducing the dimensionality of the system to a smaller number of pcs that permit depicting the system s dynamics in a space with fewer dimensions the use of eofs for the analysis of spatiotemporal modes is frequently challenged dommenget and latif 2002 monahan et al 2009 conversely their use as a dimensionality reduction technique is commonly accepted hannachi et al 2007 the extended eof exteof technique is oriented toward the identification of temporally varying patterns in multivariate datasets weare and nasstrom 1982 designed to deal with both the spatial and temporal correlations observed in the data this method is normally used with variables with a strong temporal autocorrelation hannachi et al 2007 ibarra berastegi et al 2011 fukutomi and yasunari 2013 after variable standardisation 20 exteofs were used in this study with at least 92 of the total variance being retained accordingly instead of working with 61 highly correlated gridpoints x seven variables hs tm msl u10 v10 wefu wefv x five time steps t t 6 t 12 t 18 t 24 2 135 variables we only use 20 inputs retaining most of the relevant information with the additional advantage that the variables introduced into the next step of the statistical model are uncorrelated by construction 2 2 3 random forests the need to deal with big data in many fields of science has led to the development of a whole family of algorithms commonly known as machine learning among them one of the techniques being increasingly used in the field of geophysical fluids involves random forests rfs a rf has the double advantage of its rather simple implementation and that its outputs tend to be easy to interpret ahmad et al 2017 rfs can be used either for classification or for regression purposes and can also yield results in probabilistic mode in regression mode rfs perform well at modelling highly nonlinear relationships between a set of inputs and an output mathematically speaking rfs can be considered a further development of the classification and regression trees cart that have the additional advantage over other algorithms such as the neural networks intended to deal with nonlinearities of always being free from overfitting a rf can be understood as the result of multiple random perturbations applied to a regression tree see fig 3 whereby a high number of perturbated trees are obtained this group of slightly different trees constitutes a forest in regression mode the final output given by an rf is simply the average of the output that all the individual regression trees would yield the trees are perturbated by randomly selecting both the input cases and the number of m variables at the different split nodes of the regression tree jiang et al 2009 in fact m is the most important parameter to be selected in an rf with the second one being the number of perturbated trees usually more than 1000 that form the forest several recommendations can be found in the literature regarding the selection of m breiman 2001 liaw and wiener 2002 gromping 2009 siroky 2009 more specific aspects of the practical implementation of the rf technique applied to the prediction of wef have largely been explained by our research group in journals and conference papers ibarra berastegi et al 2015 the six rf models that forecast the electricity generated at t h use 26 inputs current electric power at t era5 wef forecasts at t k k 4 8 12 16 18 20 exteof therefore following the general recommendations for rf implementation in all cases breiman 2001 liaw and wiener 2002 gromping 2009 siroky 2009 each forest contained 1000 tress and the m parameter was set at 26 3 9 additionally the models performance has been compared to persistence the persistence of electricity generated is the simplest and cheapest forecast that can be made as it is always possible to predict a value that matches the present value in the particular case of the production at mutriku recorded by the plant s electricity meter the slowly decaying autocorrelation observed with values of 0 6 at 24 h lags ibarra berastegi et al 2018 suggests that persistence seems to perform fairly well in the short term in order to confirm that the rf prediction model is a good forecasting tool the indicators used for the analysis of the differences between real and predicted data must be better for the prediction model than for persistence this latter is not a prediction model per se but only a bottom line or reference to be taken into account as any modelling effort will only be justified if it can outperform persistence 2 3 evaluation of models after fitting the models with data from the training dataset for the different forecasting horizons performance has been assessed here by comparing the forecasts provided by persistence and the rf models with observations belonging exclusively to the test dataset the three statistical indicators selected are those commonly used in wave energy studies i r squared because it provides a general idea of the variance fraction explained by each model ii mean absolute error mae because the target variable is kw and an absolute estimation of the error is illustrative both in engineering terms and for developing future wave farm management strategies iii nevertheless percentage errors are also interesting as they are independent of the scale and hence different datasets can be easily compared in further developments of this study model performance as described by such a scale independent indicator may also be helpful for electricity auctions and ultimately for a better integration of wave energy into the electricity grid the most commonly used measure is the mean absolute percentage error mape it is defined as the average value of abs log of forecast log of actual 100 this indicator is a derivation of the mae but instead of raw values of observations and predictions natural logarithmic values are used thus providing an estimation of the error in percentage terms it is therefore possible to rescale the differences in the data ranges and obtain a homogeneous comparison based on the proportional error for each model to correctly evaluate rf models and persistence performance for the different forecasting scenarios the confidence ranges of these indicators have been calculated here by bootstrap resampling 5000 resamples whereby model performance has been evaluated at a 95 confidence level according to these three indicators r language r core team 2018 was used to evaluate the data here and the principal packages used for the calculations were as follows i randomforest liaw and wiener 2002 ii factominer for the calculation of eof le et al 2008 iii sp maps and rgdal for creating and managing maps pebesma and bivand 2005 bivand et al 2013 2018 becker et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 results fig 4 a c shows the r squared mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error results respectively obtained for both rf and persistence models at a 95 confidence level the results from fig 4c show that errors for the rf model fall within the range of 46 65 all the results indicate that the rf based models outperform persistence beyond the 8 10 h horizon confirming the good performance of the rf model used to predict the electric power at mutriku fig 4a c shows it is important to stress that when compared to persistence the deterioration in the rf model s performance with the forecasting horizon follows a slow downward trend the mape moves from values of around 50 at t 10 60 at t 24 rf errors correspond to the overprediction of future values for all forecasting horizons the positive bias detected in our model s error can be related in general terms to the fact that the most influential inputs also tend to have a positive bias results not shown however an in depth study of the error requires many more cases and a systematic analysis depending on the season electric power observed wef and frequencies an interesting aspect of rf is that it allows identifying the most influential input variables by calculating the percentage increase in the mean square error incmse due to the case shuffling of these variables at the model fitting stage gromping 2009 as the incmse number decreases the importance of the input variable analysed also decreases an analysis of the input variables see left hand column in table 1 indicates that the most influential input for the rf model at t 4 was the current electric power at time t followed by the wef forecasts referred to as wef fcst variable number in the table and the exteofs referred to as exteof variable number in the table which provide an estimation of the regional atmospheric and oceanic conditions for t 8 and t 12 the wef forecasts were followed with almost the same weight by the current electric power as the main inputs while the exteofs played a moderate role this means that at those forecast ranges the results from a numerical model of the ocean s state provide substantial information for the short range forecast thus as the system s atmosphere and ocean state at the time the forecast is issued forgoes any connection with the state of the system at longer lead times numerical forecasts provide information about the system that corrects these forecasts from t 16 the leading factors were the wef numerical forecasts followed by the general sea state in the bay of biscay as described by the exteofs while the relevance of the observed power at time t significantly decreased this reveals that pure persistence cannot provide valid information for such long forecast lead times the system s memory is playing a significant role in providing the models with predictive capabilities for forecasts up to 12 h ahead this is consistent with the high autocorrelation shown by the overall electricity production at mutriku ibarra berastegi et al 2018 and stresses the need to compare the rf models results with persistence 3 2 discussion as mentioned above this is an initial study to explore whether electricity output can be predicted at a wave farm and the first one ever applied to an operational facility namely mutriku on the bay of biscay it should be stressed that the data gathered by the scada substantially improve the models results particularly at the initial lead times thus any improvement in this feature will lead to better generation forecasts on the other hand real time inputs from the ecmwf can also be obtained for real time applications for commercial uses albeit depending on the number of fields their resolution and the number of forecast steps that need to be used during the real time application of the forecasting scheme presented here a rough estimate of the cost of the input data required ranges from 30 keur to 50 keur per year although detailed estimates of this cost must be negotiated in each case with the appropriate national meteorological services or the ecmwf itself they must also be refined depending on the spatial and temporal resolution requested from the ecmwf the results obtained here highlight the possibility of predicting the average electricity generated by the farm s working turbines through the use of rf models these models outperform persistence beyond 8 10 h thus if this forecasting method is finally implemented the actual number of turbines in operation at mutriku will be known and assuming a constant value of the electricity predicted during an hour the total electricity kwh generated at mutriku could also be predicted for the same forecasting horizons as used here electricity production at mutriku is driven by waves so it depends on the sea state and follows a markedly seasonal cycle the results of this research therefore correspond to an average performance over the period analysed however the forecasting results may vary according to the season or sea state so an analysis of a longer time series for the site is needed for a more detailed characterisation of the prediction of the electricity generated at mutriku mutriku is currently the only wave farm in the world continuously delivering electricity to the grid and has been doing so now for more than seven years the models described here are the initial design of a cost effective forecasting strategy applied to a real world wave farm and not only prototypes simulated wave farms or standalone devices operating for short periods although the results shown here might be highly site dependent and associated with mutriku s particular conditions and technology owc they provide a sound methodological framework on how to tackle the issue of the intermittency of wave generated electricity and may be applied in other environments as shown by reikard et al in a recent publication reikard et al 2015 it is important to stress that the approach described in this study is the authors latest effort to predict wave energy and characterise the mutriku wave farm this study would not have been possible without our prior research concerning renewable energies one of the eu s main goals for 2030 is that at least 27 of the energy consumed will come from renewable sources and one of the strategies involves the delivery of renewable energy to the power grid the importance of the development of smart grid technologies has therefore been stressed gouardères et al 2018 waves wind and sun share a common drawback namely the intermittent availability of the resource this means that the electricity supplied to the grid by an intermittent resource is also intermittent and this poses serious grid management challenges accordingly the forecasting of both the resource and the electricity generated by renewables below certain error thresholds is a key aspect for including such varying energy sources into the electricity market in the case of more developed renewable energies such as wind or solar power this means different forecasting strategies are used wind is the renewable energy that is spreading more rapidly and it is expected to reach 2000 gw by 2030 accounting for 17 19 of overall electricity generation to support this growth higher quality forecasting methods are required costa et al 2008 wang et al 2011 so two approaches are being pursued the direct forecasting of power values and the use of power curves to convert the predicted wind speed into forecasted power in the case of wind farms which include turbines with different power ratings the latter option may be more expedient concerning forecasting models two major types are normally used physical and statistical in general physical models provide better results for longer term horizons while statistical ones are normally used for relatively short terms as regards statistical models machine learning based methods are considered to be the most effective due to their ability to model nonlinear relationships however there is no perfect forecasting model and so it is important to use the one that gives the most accurate results depending on different factors such as the characteristics and size of the data and the prediction horizon in 2014 taşcıkaraoğlu and uzunoglu 2014 presented a table comparing the more widely used wind forecasting models and their different approaches there are also recent studies that use hybrid methods combining statistical and physics based model forecasting and which provide very accurate results for specific wind farms liu et al 2017 in terms of the most widely studied sites in europe the performance of single wind farm forecasting in power production is between 8 and 10 24 h ahead according to mae by contrast chinese forecasting techniques for wind farms present r squared values of almost 20 for the same forecasting period concerning wind speed prediction the prediktor forecasting system watson et al 2001 records a mae of 2 4 m s in one day that is a deviation of 40 for a typical site with an average wind speed of 6 m s with subsequent errors for the prediction of wind power output if we compare the results obtained with the advanced forecasting models used in wind energy to the ones obtained here for mutriku forecasting errors from 40 to 60 for a 24 h horizon the latter can be considered satisfactory results in view of the recent emergence of the wave energy field regarding solar power forecasts and as with wind energy two different methods are normally used the prediction of power values using power measurements and the use of power conversion models for converting the predicted solar irradiance into power forecasts in the latter case other variables such as wind speed humidity and temperature are also used besides irradiance to obtain more accurate forecasts some recent studies propose a hypothetical 100 renewable energy scenario esteban et al 2012 2018 the authors therefore simulate future hourly energy generation based on wind solar and ocean sources and propose the use of storage devices such as batteries or hydrogen to balance the system they also highlight the importance of levelling the generation peaks through the use of interconnection lines between different regions or countries especially in europe other studies have focused on the demand for electricity by pointing to the need for better energy policies related to more efficient energy consumption roldan et al 2016 in this study focused on spain a seven year period is analysed 2008 2014 and a series of scenarios are proposed to analyse the effects of renewable energy production and the demand side management of the electricity market iberian electricity market operator omie manages the wholesale electricity market on the iberian peninsula electricity prices are set every day at 12 a m in the day ahead market and are valid for the following 24 h according to the eu marginal pricing model the intersection between the demand and supply curves establishes the volume of energy and each hourly price after the day ahead market electricity can be bought and sold on the intraday market which is structured into six different trading sessions and allows agents to readjust their bids up to 4 h before real time omie thus both electricity market agents and system operators are gaining experience in the field of renewable energy forecasting but more effort is required to develop prediction tools that can be used within the energy market s decision making framework the models presented here based on rf fed with era5 data in both analysis and forecasting mode may constitute the general approach that will enable wave energy to take a major step towards its full integration in the electricity grid in the particular case of mutriku and within the context of the spanish electricity market the models shown here provide reasonable results from 8 to 10 h ahead onwards and can be an interesting tool for auctions in the day ahead market they can also provide useful insights for the intraday market however beyond these initial comments further studies with more data are needed to better establish the specific role that rf based models can play in the day ahead and intraday markets further studies with more data will also help elucidate how forecasting models with errors such as those reported in this study can be effectively implemented and incorporated into successful strategies for electricity market auctions thus the analysis and construction of reliable models based on real data like the ones presented here are needed to obtain accurate forecasting that would make it easier to integrate renewable energies into the electricity grid 4 conclusions and future outlook 4 1 conclusions the electricity generated at the mutriku wave farm on the bay of biscay was predicted for a 24 h forecast lead time through the use of rf based models for short lead times t 4 the most influential input variable was the current electric power at time t thus indicating the important role that system memory has in the prediction as the prediction horizons increased t 8 and t 12 the era5 wave energy flux wef forecast gained in importance while the current electric power at time t became less important for longer horizons t 16 and beyond when comparing the r squared mae and mape at a 95 confidence level the rf model proved to be a better prediction tool than persistence beyond 8 10 h rf models tend to overpredict electric power with forecasting errors ranging from 40 to 60 for a 24 h horizon this is the first time the output power of a fully operational wave farm has been forecast up to a 24 h ahead horizon through the use of logged electric power data the role of era5 at providing observational data and especially wave energy flux forecasts with an unprecedented time and space resolution has also been crucial for this study in general terms and before becoming a reliable source wave energy needs major improvements in many aspects among them an important point is to maximise the accuracy of the forecasting methods to solve the intermittency and variability problems associated with renewable energies in this sense and taking into account day ahead and intraday market performance in the electricity market more accurate prediction tools would enable this energy to be better accommodated within the grid and so government and private sector engagement and funding are crucial for a renewable energy based future the study presented here makes an initial contribution to this objective and the general availability of era5 the rf based methodology although so far developed only for mutriku can also be applied to future wave energy facilities which while continuously supplying electricity to the grid operate with systematic protocols of operational data recording and management 4 2 future outlook as noted in the introduction 246 469 kwh of energy was produced each year at the mutriku wave farm during the period 2014 2016 according to the emission factors proposed by the spanish government for 2017 ca 0 3 kg of co2 kwh ministry of agriculture and fisheries food and the environment 2018 this means that the atmospheric discharge of 75 tonnes of co2 was avoided each year indicating that higher percentages of renewable energy are needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions however some improvements are needed for the optimum use and management of renewable energies for instance despite the advances in forecasting models there are still several targets to be achieved one of them is the development of probabilistic spatiotemporal forecasting methods to improve the operation of power systems probabilistic methods provide information on the probabilities of predicted values as well as uncertainty values which is very important for power systems especially for the renewable energy sector in addition analysing the high volume of data available would currently require the use of different big data techniques to select the most relevant information mazzi and pinson 2017 taşcıkaraoğlu 2017 in our case the use of a larger volume of data from the mutriku wave farm and their corresponding screening would permit a more accurate analysis of the sea state and the establishment of better and more precise forecasting limits for the rf model the results shown in this paper provide a general or average model performance characterisation however the electricity production at mutriku is very variable so using a higher number of cases will allow a more detailed characterisation of the models performance by sea state or season of the year as a result a deeper understanding may be gained of the specific role these models play in the day ahead and intraday electricity markets when more cases are available the rf technique also allows obtaining probabilistic forecasting outputs that can be more useful for electricity market auctions a further advantage of future research with more data is that rf models will be developed for hourly instead of 4 h time steps thus increasing the general accuracy in electric power predictions and allowing a better characterisation of model errors the authors are currently conducting further research along these lines the authors have also developed a calibration method for studying and analysing the wave energy resource s evolution over the last century in the bay of biscay ulazia et al 2017 and ireland penalba et al 2018 they have implemented these variations in different wecs to show the subsequent energy production trends in terms of capacity width and not electricity production strong positive decadal increments of wave energy have been found in general which cannot be absorbed properly by the wecs this study therefore allows obtaining a transfer function from the resource to the electrical power in each sea state in the time series another future research line is to analyse the hypothetical annual energy production at the mutriku owc plant in each year of the last century as well as other important aspects about seasonality and historical trends in electricity production acknowledgements

22477,this paper combines random forests with physics based models to forecast the electricity output of the mutriku wave farm on the bay of biscay the period analysed was 2014 2016 and the forecast horizon was 24 h in 4 h steps the random forest rf machine learning technique was used with three sets of inputs i the electricity generated at mutriku ii the wave energy flux wef prediction made by the ecmwf wave model at mutriku s nearest gridpoint and iii ocean and atmospheric data for the bay of biscay for this last input extended empirical orthogonal functions eofs were calculated to reduce the dimensionality of these data while retaining most of the information the forecasts are evaluated using the r squared mean absolute error mae and mean absolute percentage error mape the model easily outperforms a persistence forecast at 8 10 h and beyond the most accurate forecasts are achieved by using all three of these inputs this approach may help to effectively integrate wave farms into the electricity market keywords mutriku wave farm electric power forecasting random forest machine learning fluid mechanics 1 introduction 1 1 wave energy development the sea and oceans are a potential source of renewable energy marine energy which includes both offshore wind and waves among others could enable the european union eu to reach its environmental goals as well as record major economic growth in fact the commission s blue growth strategy recently singled out the ocean energy sector as one of the emerging areas in the blue economy blue energy 2014 and major investments and efforts are currently in place especially throughout europe the ocean energy sector includes different technologies such as wave energy tidal energy salinity gradient and ocean thermal energy conversion otec whose main aim is to transform the power from seas and oceans into low polluting energy o hagan et al 2016 according to the 2018 annual economic report on the eu blue economy blue economy 2018 the eu is the principal developer of ocean energy technology aiming to install 100 gw of ocean energy capacity by 2050 thus creating more than 400 000 jobs thus far waves and tidal energy are the most mature ocean energy technologies and they are expected to evolve to commercial status in the medium term by the end of 2013 ocean energy capacity was about 530 mw world energy outlook 2015 with most of this coming from tidal power the majority of the tidal power projects currently in operation are located in korea canada and france reaching capacities of up to 254 mw in the case of korea smaller pre commercial wave and tidal power projects in the order of 11 mw have gained increasing relevance especially in united kingdom santos et al 2017 the eu is one of the main developers of ocean energy technology in terms of the companies involved in the development of converters devices and technology in general 50 focus on the field of wave energy and 45 on tidal moreover most of the ocean energy test and implementation sites are located on european coasts magagna and uihlein 2015 a higher percentage of the world s electricity could be generated from ocean based energy sources so there is a clear need to provide an economic incentive promoting the use of this type of renewable energy esteban and leary 2012 the characterisation and mapping of ocean energy resources including the identification of areas with high wave energy and its quantification constitute a necessary first step for the development of ocean energy additionally it is important to accurately estimate available wave energy sources with a high spatial and temporal resolution the simulation and forecasting of parameters such as wave energy flux or electric power is therefore crucial for optimising the design of wave energy converters wecs as well as predicting the electricity available to the grid reikard et al 2011 2017 pinson et al 2012 parkinson et al 2015 widén et al 2015 to date the mutriku wave farm on the bay of biscay fig 1 is the only one in the world continuously supplying electricity to the grid o hagan et al 2016 ibarra berastegi et al 2018 the energy production data used in this work have been provided by the basque energy agency eve ente vasco de la energía www eve eus making them available for research and thus solving one of the main limitations when trying to obtain more realistic wave energy forecasting results reikard 2017 mutriku has 14 oscillating water column owc operating turbines and supplies energy to the grid 74 4 of the time one of the more significant parameters recorded at the wave farm is the average power generated by each turbine over the preceding 5 min leading to an energy output of 246 469 kwh per year in the 2014 2016 period under analysis the aim of this paper is therefore to predict the power output at mutriku with a 24 h forecast lead time 1 2 forecasting electricity production the participation of renewable energy sources in electricity market mechanisms may incur economic sanctions if any imbalances are detected between generation and supply kaur et al 2016 mazzi and pinson 2017 this issue has received increasing attention in the past especially in the field of solar and wind power generation where some authors esteban et al 2010 2012 propose the use of energy storage devices e g batteries or hydrogen to solve the intermittency problems associated with renewable energies surplus electricity would therefore be stored during high production periods and then be made available for subsequent peak demand periods in order to reduce the high levels of uncertainty around renewable energy production information needs to be predicted for better decision making processes in electricity markets thus a reliable forecasting method will lead to a reduction in integration cost lower average annual operating costs and fewer penalties for mismatches between the power contracted and its effective delivery all of which will impact directly on the economy botterud 2017 notton et al 2018 short term forecasting ranging from a few hours to a few days is normally used for planning and controlling economic load supplies as well as for competitive negotiation in electricity markets long term forecasts ranging from a few days to a week are generally used for operations that need forward information from renewable sources in the long term such as energy storage approaches or maintenance programming of both renewable and conventional power plants taşcıkaraoğlu 2017 all forecasting strategies whether short or long term contribute to a more accurate economic and reliable modus operandi the accuracy of the power forecast is a crucial factor for the system s optimum performance because both under and over forecasting incur additional costs for offsetting the differences between estimation and reality in the particular case of wave energy a particular wec s electricity production at a given moment and location is driven mainly by local waves hence building cost effective strategies and models for the short term prediction of electricity production at a wave farm can largely benefit from the experience methods and strategies developed for forecasting wave energy ibarra berastegi et al 2015a 2016 statistical techniques and physics based models are commonly used for wave forecasting the wam wave model included in the integrated forecast system ifs of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf is an example of a wave forecasting system based on physical models statistical techniques include random forest rf regression based neural networks and genetic programming in general statistical models are more accurate for short time horizons of 3 18 h e g for utilities operating wave farms while physics based models are better predictors for longer horizons of 18 20 h and beyond e g ocean conditions for sailing reikard and rogers 2011 uihlein and magagna 2016 the combination of both techniques statistical and physics based models is also analysed by reikard et al 2011 concluding that this way they yield more accurate predictions than when used individually spain does not have any specific price regulations on the electricity generated at wave farms however there is a more general regulation applicable to all the electricity generated at facilities based on emerging renewable technologies as in the case of mutriku the prices of the electricity generated at these facilities are not currently informed by the unregulated interaction of the players in a free market as they are fixed by law for a given period of time after which the applicable regulations may change boe 2017 the experience gained by the authors through building short term forecasting models for precipitation fernández ferrero et al 2009 2010 or the wave energy flux in the bay of biscay ibarra berastegi et al 2015a 2016 has now been applied to the short term prediction of the electricity output at mutriku the approach described in this paper is a further development of our previous studies in this field i e the use of the rf technique among others for predicting a target variable additionally based on the data analysed at mutriku during the 2014 2016 period we now go one step further by using mutriku s output as the predicted variable log records of sea states in the bay of biscay and future electricity production are mathematically related using the machine learning rf technique due to the highly non linear relationships to be expected in operations rf is a most appropriate option for developing the aforementioned forecasting models the objective of this paper is therefore to build a set of rf based models to forecast the electricity generated at the mutriku with forecast lead times of up to 24 h the models shown here are fed with current and past observations corresponding to the power generated by the turbines in mutriku as well as with wide area oceanic and atmospheric information from ecmwf reanalyses however in a first step a reduction in the dimensionality will be applied using extended eofs this is undertaken with two goals in mind the first one is to reduce the spurious spatial correlations common in spatial meteorological fields as the information at all the grid points is not effectively independent it is common to use eofs involving information that is closer to the effective number of degrees of freedom in model output fields bretherton et al 1999 wang and shen 1999 the second goal is related to the effective use of combined eofs from several variables to handle all the information involved in the forecast additionally the rf model s performance will be evaluated and compared to the most obvious and simplest model persistence of electric power persistence assumes that what we are currently observing will also be replicated exactly over the fothcoming hours and is considered here as a benchmark that can be used to compare the forecasting ability of alternative models as it is the simplest forecasting tool available the originality of this work lies in the combination of rf as a statistical technique and the use of predictions made by physics based models as inputs for rf models this method has been tested for mutriku and has proven to predict electric power effectively in the following sections the data and methodology used will first be explained the results obtained with both the rf model and persistence will be compared and discussed and finally the more salient conclusions will be presented the main lines of future research will also be discussed 2 data and methodology 2 1 data data from two different sources have been used 1 data from the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf corresponding to the era5 reanalysis https www ecmwf int en forecasts datasets reanalysis datasets era5 hourly data for the 2014 2016 period and the bay of biscay 48 9 n 349 5 e 43 2 n 358 5 e have been used fig 1 era5 has a resolution of 0 3 0 3 so 548 sea gridpoints were initially used for this study however a preliminary screening of these gridpoints led to the conclusion that using only one out of every nine available 61 was enough due to the high spatial correlation of the information contained in them which led to a low number of independent degrees of freedom these are the same variables and geographical environment used in our previous studies although now the more recent era5 reanalysis has been used as the input source instead of era interim as is the case in the field of wind energy olauson 2018 era5 s higher time and space resolution will probably make it the benchmark for wave energy studies over the coming years furthermore era interim is soon to be discontinued so state of the art forecasting systems need to be built using the new era5 reanalysis the following variables of interest have been chosen significant wave height hs mean wave period tm mean wave direction mwd mean sea level pressure mslp and finally zonal and meridional components of wind speed at 10 m u10 v10 the wave energy flux wef kw m at all the gridpoints has been calculated under the hypothesis of deep waters multon 2012 lavidas and venugopal 2018 according to eq 2 2 wef ρg2hs2tm 64π 0 489hs2tm where ρ 1025 kg m3 is the density of sea water variable and g 9 8 m s2 is gravitational acceleration whose theoretical value varies according to latitude the combination of the wef values and the mean wave direction mwd at each gridpoint allows calculating the zonal wefu and meridional wefv components of this wef all these variables have been used for the whole area in analysis mode although era5 also provides forecasts at hourly steps for the same variables at each gridpoint up to a horizon of 18 h ahead at 06 00 and 18 00 gmt as this paper s objective is to forecast the electric power at mutriku up to 24 h ahead and as electricity production is driven by ocean waves era5 forecasts of hs and tm have also been used at the nearest gridpoint 21 km to mutriku fig 2 at 4 8 12 16 and 18 h ahead as a first step hs and tm have been combined using eq 2 to calculate the wef forecast at 4 8 12 16 and 18 h ahead the idea is that the era5 forecasts of forthcoming sea states may also be used to feed the models and provide more accurate predictions of the electricity generated 2 hourly data from the mutriku scada computer data recording system corresponding to the same period 2014 2016 this is the initial period of systematic data gathering and validation and most available cases have been recorded only every 4 h predictions have therefore been calculated at 4 h steps from 4 to 24 h ahead from the total of 14 wells type turbines using owc technology installed not all of them are continually generating electricity on average and due to maintenance work or experimental purposes only around 10 turbines are normally running at any given moment the electricity produced may also vary from one turbine to another due to the irregular seabed and the spatial configuration of mutriku s breakwater more details on the general operational characteristics of mutriku can be found elsewhere ibarra berastegi et al 2018 although the instantaneous power generated by each turbine is regularly recorded its value may be due to the action of a particular wave that is not necessarily representative of the current sea state a more reasonable indicator of electric power has therefore been chosen for current and previous studies namely the average power generated by each turbine over the previous 5 min as the yield of the operating turbines may differ the average power generated across the active turbines over the previous 5 min has been used as a reference of overall electric power this will be the target variable to be predicted up to 24 h ahead and it will be referred to here simply as the electricity generated at mutriku after a strict data screening and pre processing stage a total of 2855 hourly cases were available for building the models the first 1427 were used to train the models and the last 1428 to test them all the results on model performance shown in this paper have been obtained exclusively from the 1428 cases corresponding to the test database 2 2 methodology the general aim here was to use rf based statistical models to forecast the electricity generated by waves using the data recorded at mutriku over the 2014 2016 period the results obtained were compared to the ones provided by persistence the maximum forecasting lead time has been set at 24 h within this forecast lead time the rf predictions have been made up to 24 h ahead at 4 h time steps 2 2 1 building the models an rf model has been built for each forecast lead time in each model the output or target variable at a given time t is the average power generated through the active turbines at mutriku over the previous 5 min t h h 4 8 12 16 20 24 this means a total of six models have been built because as mentioned above in most cases data from mutriku s scada are available only every 4 h the inputs for all the models have been as follows i the observed electric power generated at time t ii the era5 wave energy flux forecasts at t k k 4 8 12 16 and 18 at the nearest gridpoint to mutriku fig 2 iii the era5 data for the bay of biscay using observations analyses not only at t but also at t 6 t 12 t 18 and t 24 to capture the daily evolution of the sea states in the area twenty inputs have been used after a phase of dimensionality reduction via extended eof see below 2 2 2 extended empirical orthogonal functions when it was used as a tool for statistical weather forecasting at the end of the 1940s north 1984 monahan et al 2009 the principal component analysis technique was referred to as empirical orthogonal functions eofs the method seeks the optimal decomposition of a field that is a function of time and space into a set of patterns that are only a function of space eofs and associated time indices principal components pcs eofs followed by a sensible truncation of the number of pcs retained allow optimally reducing the dimensionality of the system to a smaller number of pcs that permit depicting the system s dynamics in a space with fewer dimensions the use of eofs for the analysis of spatiotemporal modes is frequently challenged dommenget and latif 2002 monahan et al 2009 conversely their use as a dimensionality reduction technique is commonly accepted hannachi et al 2007 the extended eof exteof technique is oriented toward the identification of temporally varying patterns in multivariate datasets weare and nasstrom 1982 designed to deal with both the spatial and temporal correlations observed in the data this method is normally used with variables with a strong temporal autocorrelation hannachi et al 2007 ibarra berastegi et al 2011 fukutomi and yasunari 2013 after variable standardisation 20 exteofs were used in this study with at least 92 of the total variance being retained accordingly instead of working with 61 highly correlated gridpoints x seven variables hs tm msl u10 v10 wefu wefv x five time steps t t 6 t 12 t 18 t 24 2 135 variables we only use 20 inputs retaining most of the relevant information with the additional advantage that the variables introduced into the next step of the statistical model are uncorrelated by construction 2 2 3 random forests the need to deal with big data in many fields of science has led to the development of a whole family of algorithms commonly known as machine learning among them one of the techniques being increasingly used in the field of geophysical fluids involves random forests rfs a rf has the double advantage of its rather simple implementation and that its outputs tend to be easy to interpret ahmad et al 2017 rfs can be used either for classification or for regression purposes and can also yield results in probabilistic mode in regression mode rfs perform well at modelling highly nonlinear relationships between a set of inputs and an output mathematically speaking rfs can be considered a further development of the classification and regression trees cart that have the additional advantage over other algorithms such as the neural networks intended to deal with nonlinearities of always being free from overfitting a rf can be understood as the result of multiple random perturbations applied to a regression tree see fig 3 whereby a high number of perturbated trees are obtained this group of slightly different trees constitutes a forest in regression mode the final output given by an rf is simply the average of the output that all the individual regression trees would yield the trees are perturbated by randomly selecting both the input cases and the number of m variables at the different split nodes of the regression tree jiang et al 2009 in fact m is the most important parameter to be selected in an rf with the second one being the number of perturbated trees usually more than 1000 that form the forest several recommendations can be found in the literature regarding the selection of m breiman 2001 liaw and wiener 2002 gromping 2009 siroky 2009 more specific aspects of the practical implementation of the rf technique applied to the prediction of wef have largely been explained by our research group in journals and conference papers ibarra berastegi et al 2015 the six rf models that forecast the electricity generated at t h use 26 inputs current electric power at t era5 wef forecasts at t k k 4 8 12 16 18 20 exteof therefore following the general recommendations for rf implementation in all cases breiman 2001 liaw and wiener 2002 gromping 2009 siroky 2009 each forest contained 1000 tress and the m parameter was set at 26 3 9 additionally the models performance has been compared to persistence the persistence of electricity generated is the simplest and cheapest forecast that can be made as it is always possible to predict a value that matches the present value in the particular case of the production at mutriku recorded by the plant s electricity meter the slowly decaying autocorrelation observed with values of 0 6 at 24 h lags ibarra berastegi et al 2018 suggests that persistence seems to perform fairly well in the short term in order to confirm that the rf prediction model is a good forecasting tool the indicators used for the analysis of the differences between real and predicted data must be better for the prediction model than for persistence this latter is not a prediction model per se but only a bottom line or reference to be taken into account as any modelling effort will only be justified if it can outperform persistence 2 3 evaluation of models after fitting the models with data from the training dataset for the different forecasting horizons performance has been assessed here by comparing the forecasts provided by persistence and the rf models with observations belonging exclusively to the test dataset the three statistical indicators selected are those commonly used in wave energy studies i r squared because it provides a general idea of the variance fraction explained by each model ii mean absolute error mae because the target variable is kw and an absolute estimation of the error is illustrative both in engineering terms and for developing future wave farm management strategies iii nevertheless percentage errors are also interesting as they are independent of the scale and hence different datasets can be easily compared in further developments of this study model performance as described by such a scale independent indicator may also be helpful for electricity auctions and ultimately for a better integration of wave energy into the electricity grid the most commonly used measure is the mean absolute percentage error mape it is defined as the average value of abs log of forecast log of actual 100 this indicator is a derivation of the mae but instead of raw values of observations and predictions natural logarithmic values are used thus providing an estimation of the error in percentage terms it is therefore possible to rescale the differences in the data ranges and obtain a homogeneous comparison based on the proportional error for each model to correctly evaluate rf models and persistence performance for the different forecasting scenarios the confidence ranges of these indicators have been calculated here by bootstrap resampling 5000 resamples whereby model performance has been evaluated at a 95 confidence level according to these three indicators r language r core team 2018 was used to evaluate the data here and the principal packages used for the calculations were as follows i randomforest liaw and wiener 2002 ii factominer for the calculation of eof le et al 2008 iii sp maps and rgdal for creating and managing maps pebesma and bivand 2005 bivand et al 2013 2018 becker et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 results fig 4 a c shows the r squared mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error results respectively obtained for both rf and persistence models at a 95 confidence level the results from fig 4c show that errors for the rf model fall within the range of 46 65 all the results indicate that the rf based models outperform persistence beyond the 8 10 h horizon confirming the good performance of the rf model used to predict the electric power at mutriku fig 4a c shows it is important to stress that when compared to persistence the deterioration in the rf model s performance with the forecasting horizon follows a slow downward trend the mape moves from values of around 50 at t 10 60 at t 24 rf errors correspond to the overprediction of future values for all forecasting horizons the positive bias detected in our model s error can be related in general terms to the fact that the most influential inputs also tend to have a positive bias results not shown however an in depth study of the error requires many more cases and a systematic analysis depending on the season electric power observed wef and frequencies an interesting aspect of rf is that it allows identifying the most influential input variables by calculating the percentage increase in the mean square error incmse due to the case shuffling of these variables at the model fitting stage gromping 2009 as the incmse number decreases the importance of the input variable analysed also decreases an analysis of the input variables see left hand column in table 1 indicates that the most influential input for the rf model at t 4 was the current electric power at time t followed by the wef forecasts referred to as wef fcst variable number in the table and the exteofs referred to as exteof variable number in the table which provide an estimation of the regional atmospheric and oceanic conditions for t 8 and t 12 the wef forecasts were followed with almost the same weight by the current electric power as the main inputs while the exteofs played a moderate role this means that at those forecast ranges the results from a numerical model of the ocean s state provide substantial information for the short range forecast thus as the system s atmosphere and ocean state at the time the forecast is issued forgoes any connection with the state of the system at longer lead times numerical forecasts provide information about the system that corrects these forecasts from t 16 the leading factors were the wef numerical forecasts followed by the general sea state in the bay of biscay as described by the exteofs while the relevance of the observed power at time t significantly decreased this reveals that pure persistence cannot provide valid information for such long forecast lead times the system s memory is playing a significant role in providing the models with predictive capabilities for forecasts up to 12 h ahead this is consistent with the high autocorrelation shown by the overall electricity production at mutriku ibarra berastegi et al 2018 and stresses the need to compare the rf models results with persistence 3 2 discussion as mentioned above this is an initial study to explore whether electricity output can be predicted at a wave farm and the first one ever applied to an operational facility namely mutriku on the bay of biscay it should be stressed that the data gathered by the scada substantially improve the models results particularly at the initial lead times thus any improvement in this feature will lead to better generation forecasts on the other hand real time inputs from the ecmwf can also be obtained for real time applications for commercial uses albeit depending on the number of fields their resolution and the number of forecast steps that need to be used during the real time application of the forecasting scheme presented here a rough estimate of the cost of the input data required ranges from 30 keur to 50 keur per year although detailed estimates of this cost must be negotiated in each case with the appropriate national meteorological services or the ecmwf itself they must also be refined depending on the spatial and temporal resolution requested from the ecmwf the results obtained here highlight the possibility of predicting the average electricity generated by the farm s working turbines through the use of rf models these models outperform persistence beyond 8 10 h thus if this forecasting method is finally implemented the actual number of turbines in operation at mutriku will be known and assuming a constant value of the electricity predicted during an hour the total electricity kwh generated at mutriku could also be predicted for the same forecasting horizons as used here electricity production at mutriku is driven by waves so it depends on the sea state and follows a markedly seasonal cycle the results of this research therefore correspond to an average performance over the period analysed however the forecasting results may vary according to the season or sea state so an analysis of a longer time series for the site is needed for a more detailed characterisation of the prediction of the electricity generated at mutriku mutriku is currently the only wave farm in the world continuously delivering electricity to the grid and has been doing so now for more than seven years the models described here are the initial design of a cost effective forecasting strategy applied to a real world wave farm and not only prototypes simulated wave farms or standalone devices operating for short periods although the results shown here might be highly site dependent and associated with mutriku s particular conditions and technology owc they provide a sound methodological framework on how to tackle the issue of the intermittency of wave generated electricity and may be applied in other environments as shown by reikard et al in a recent publication reikard et al 2015 it is important to stress that the approach described in this study is the authors latest effort to predict wave energy and characterise the mutriku wave farm this study would not have been possible without our prior research concerning renewable energies one of the eu s main goals for 2030 is that at least 27 of the energy consumed will come from renewable sources and one of the strategies involves the delivery of renewable energy to the power grid the importance of the development of smart grid technologies has therefore been stressed gouardères et al 2018 waves wind and sun share a common drawback namely the intermittent availability of the resource this means that the electricity supplied to the grid by an intermittent resource is also intermittent and this poses serious grid management challenges accordingly the forecasting of both the resource and the electricity generated by renewables below certain error thresholds is a key aspect for including such varying energy sources into the electricity market in the case of more developed renewable energies such as wind or solar power this means different forecasting strategies are used wind is the renewable energy that is spreading more rapidly and it is expected to reach 2000 gw by 2030 accounting for 17 19 of overall electricity generation to support this growth higher quality forecasting methods are required costa et al 2008 wang et al 2011 so two approaches are being pursued the direct forecasting of power values and the use of power curves to convert the predicted wind speed into forecasted power in the case of wind farms which include turbines with different power ratings the latter option may be more expedient concerning forecasting models two major types are normally used physical and statistical in general physical models provide better results for longer term horizons while statistical ones are normally used for relatively short terms as regards statistical models machine learning based methods are considered to be the most effective due to their ability to model nonlinear relationships however there is no perfect forecasting model and so it is important to use the one that gives the most accurate results depending on different factors such as the characteristics and size of the data and the prediction horizon in 2014 taşcıkaraoğlu and uzunoglu 2014 presented a table comparing the more widely used wind forecasting models and their different approaches there are also recent studies that use hybrid methods combining statistical and physics based model forecasting and which provide very accurate results for specific wind farms liu et al 2017 in terms of the most widely studied sites in europe the performance of single wind farm forecasting in power production is between 8 and 10 24 h ahead according to mae by contrast chinese forecasting techniques for wind farms present r squared values of almost 20 for the same forecasting period concerning wind speed prediction the prediktor forecasting system watson et al 2001 records a mae of 2 4 m s in one day that is a deviation of 40 for a typical site with an average wind speed of 6 m s with subsequent errors for the prediction of wind power output if we compare the results obtained with the advanced forecasting models used in wind energy to the ones obtained here for mutriku forecasting errors from 40 to 60 for a 24 h horizon the latter can be considered satisfactory results in view of the recent emergence of the wave energy field regarding solar power forecasts and as with wind energy two different methods are normally used the prediction of power values using power measurements and the use of power conversion models for converting the predicted solar irradiance into power forecasts in the latter case other variables such as wind speed humidity and temperature are also used besides irradiance to obtain more accurate forecasts some recent studies propose a hypothetical 100 renewable energy scenario esteban et al 2012 2018 the authors therefore simulate future hourly energy generation based on wind solar and ocean sources and propose the use of storage devices such as batteries or hydrogen to balance the system they also highlight the importance of levelling the generation peaks through the use of interconnection lines between different regions or countries especially in europe other studies have focused on the demand for electricity by pointing to the need for better energy policies related to more efficient energy consumption roldan et al 2016 in this study focused on spain a seven year period is analysed 2008 2014 and a series of scenarios are proposed to analyse the effects of renewable energy production and the demand side management of the electricity market iberian electricity market operator omie manages the wholesale electricity market on the iberian peninsula electricity prices are set every day at 12 a m in the day ahead market and are valid for the following 24 h according to the eu marginal pricing model the intersection between the demand and supply curves establishes the volume of energy and each hourly price after the day ahead market electricity can be bought and sold on the intraday market which is structured into six different trading sessions and allows agents to readjust their bids up to 4 h before real time omie thus both electricity market agents and system operators are gaining experience in the field of renewable energy forecasting but more effort is required to develop prediction tools that can be used within the energy market s decision making framework the models presented here based on rf fed with era5 data in both analysis and forecasting mode may constitute the general approach that will enable wave energy to take a major step towards its full integration in the electricity grid in the particular case of mutriku and within the context of the spanish electricity market the models shown here provide reasonable results from 8 to 10 h ahead onwards and can be an interesting tool for auctions in the day ahead market they can also provide useful insights for the intraday market however beyond these initial comments further studies with more data are needed to better establish the specific role that rf based models can play in the day ahead and intraday markets further studies with more data will also help elucidate how forecasting models with errors such as those reported in this study can be effectively implemented and incorporated into successful strategies for electricity market auctions thus the analysis and construction of reliable models based on real data like the ones presented here are needed to obtain accurate forecasting that would make it easier to integrate renewable energies into the electricity grid 4 conclusions and future outlook 4 1 conclusions the electricity generated at the mutriku wave farm on the bay of biscay was predicted for a 24 h forecast lead time through the use of rf based models for short lead times t 4 the most influential input variable was the current electric power at time t thus indicating the important role that system memory has in the prediction as the prediction horizons increased t 8 and t 12 the era5 wave energy flux wef forecast gained in importance while the current electric power at time t became less important for longer horizons t 16 and beyond when comparing the r squared mae and mape at a 95 confidence level the rf model proved to be a better prediction tool than persistence beyond 8 10 h rf models tend to overpredict electric power with forecasting errors ranging from 40 to 60 for a 24 h horizon this is the first time the output power of a fully operational wave farm has been forecast up to a 24 h ahead horizon through the use of logged electric power data the role of era5 at providing observational data and especially wave energy flux forecasts with an unprecedented time and space resolution has also been crucial for this study in general terms and before becoming a reliable source wave energy needs major improvements in many aspects among them an important point is to maximise the accuracy of the forecasting methods to solve the intermittency and variability problems associated with renewable energies in this sense and taking into account day ahead and intraday market performance in the electricity market more accurate prediction tools would enable this energy to be better accommodated within the grid and so government and private sector engagement and funding are crucial for a renewable energy based future the study presented here makes an initial contribution to this objective and the general availability of era5 the rf based methodology although so far developed only for mutriku can also be applied to future wave energy facilities which while continuously supplying electricity to the grid operate with systematic protocols of operational data recording and management 4 2 future outlook as noted in the introduction 246 469 kwh of energy was produced each year at the mutriku wave farm during the period 2014 2016 according to the emission factors proposed by the spanish government for 2017 ca 0 3 kg of co2 kwh ministry of agriculture and fisheries food and the environment 2018 this means that the atmospheric discharge of 75 tonnes of co2 was avoided each year indicating that higher percentages of renewable energy are needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions however some improvements are needed for the optimum use and management of renewable energies for instance despite the advances in forecasting models there are still several targets to be achieved one of them is the development of probabilistic spatiotemporal forecasting methods to improve the operation of power systems probabilistic methods provide information on the probabilities of predicted values as well as uncertainty values which is very important for power systems especially for the renewable energy sector in addition analysing the high volume of data available would currently require the use of different big data techniques to select the most relevant information mazzi and pinson 2017 taşcıkaraoğlu 2017 in our case the use of a larger volume of data from the mutriku wave farm and their corresponding screening would permit a more accurate analysis of the sea state and the establishment of better and more precise forecasting limits for the rf model the results shown in this paper provide a general or average model performance characterisation however the electricity production at mutriku is very variable so using a higher number of cases will allow a more detailed characterisation of the models performance by sea state or season of the year as a result a deeper understanding may be gained of the specific role these models play in the day ahead and intraday electricity markets when more cases are available the rf technique also allows obtaining probabilistic forecasting outputs that can be more useful for electricity market auctions a further advantage of future research with more data is that rf models will be developed for hourly instead of 4 h time steps thus increasing the general accuracy in electric power predictions and allowing a better characterisation of model errors the authors are currently conducting further research along these lines the authors have also developed a calibration method for studying and analysing the wave energy resource s evolution over the last century in the bay of biscay ulazia et al 2017 and ireland penalba et al 2018 they have implemented these variations in different wecs to show the subsequent energy production trends in terms of capacity width and not electricity production strong positive decadal increments of wave energy have been found in general which cannot be absorbed properly by the wecs this study therefore allows obtaining a transfer function from the resource to the electrical power in each sea state in the time series another future research line is to analyse the hypothetical annual energy production at the mutriku owc plant in each year of the last century as well as other important aspects about seasonality and historical trends in electricity production acknowledgements

22478,the current paper presents simulations for steady turning of a planing craft by developing a new mathematical model to solve the problem it is assumed that the craft is free in six degrees of freedom and all motions are strongly coupled maneuvering forces and moments acting on the vessel are computed using 2d t theory virtual added mass terms of two dimensional 2d sections are integrated over the entire length of the craft the final equation for the motion of the vessel in six degrees of freedom is obtained which is then solved in the time domain final three dimensional 3d forces and moments contain strongly coupled added mass damping steady maneuvering and restoring hydrostatic forces and moments simulations are compared against experimental data and it is shown that the developed method has reasonable accuracy in prediction of turning motion of two planing vessels effects of beam froude number and rudder angle on steady turning motion of a planing hull have also been studied it is found that when the vessel is free in six degrees of freedom the turning radius and yaw rate of the vessel are smaller while the steady surge speed is not affected significantly keywords

craft nonlinear behavior of the vessel as well as coupled heave pitch and roll motions which can generate forces and moments in the horizontal plane tend to complicate the problem see e g tavakoli et al 2017b traditional mathematical models used for maneuvering simulation of ships are not suitable for simulation of maneuvering motion of planing hulls see discussions of morabito et al 2014 and conclusion of morabito 2015 recent advances in mathematical modeling based on the 2d t theory of heeled yawed planing hulls can be further developed for maneuvering simulation of these vessels see e g tavakoli et al 2018a specifically two different mathematical models have developed by authors for mathematical simulations of steady drift test dashtimanesh et al 2019a and planar motion mechanism pmm test of planing hulls tavakoli and dashtimanesh 2018 both mathematical models showed good ability to compute maneuvering forces moments acting on a planing hull note that authors performed a wide range of comparison against experimental data of brown and klosinski 1994a b katayama et al 2006 and tajima et al 1999 in their recent publications at the current stage previous progress in mathematical modelling of planing hulls motion can be followed as we will show to develop a mathematical model for simulation of six degrees of freedom 6dof of planing hulls in turning in the current paper a mathematical model is established using 2d t theory to simulate the turning motion of planing hulls in 6dof early studies in the context of planing hulls maneuvering were performed by smiley 1952 and savitsky 1958 who respectively explored hydrodynamic forces acting on yawed and heeled planing hulls later the majority of the researchers such as sugai 1964 as well as blount and codega 1992 investigated the instabilities of planing hulls in the horizontal plane meanwhile denny 1991 proposed a maneuvering simulation for planing hulls by neglecting the effects of heave pitch and roll motions lewandowski 1994 1995 presented a mathematical model for prediction of the trajectory of a planing hull in the horizontal plane his method was extremely helpful in gaining insight into the turning motion of planing hulls and their stability in the horizontal plane but his method relies on empirical equations and is unable to consider six degrees of freedom for a wide range of planing hulls see discussion in morabito 2015 toxopeus 1996a developed a mathematical model for prediction of the 6dof motion of planing hulls his method was able to simulate the motion of the vessel but for many cases especially for the case of added mass forces traditional equations developed for displacement ships were utilized which are not accurate for the case of planing hulls dashtimanesh et al 2017 furthermore he presented specific equations for the computation of maneuvering forces of a series of planing hulls toxopeus 1996b in addition to the mentioned research katayama et al 2005 conducted steady drift tests on planing hulls commenting that during the turning motion of planing hulls heave and pitch motions vary in time affecting the hydrodynamic maneuvering forces and moments katayama et al 2006 performed experimental tests and mathematical simulations by considering the effects of heave and pitch motion of forces and moments of the turning motion of a prismatic planing hull it was found that when heave and pitch motions are considered i e heave and pitch motions are set to be free the accuracy of mathematical simulations increases to simulate the turning motion of planing hulls more accurately katayama et al 2009 used a large range of steady test data and interpolated hydrodynamic coefficients of the vessel using its instantaneous heave and pitch their method can work well however the availability of steady test data is a prerequisite which cannot be easily accessed i e we need all drift test data of a vessel we want to model to use that mathematical model also morabito et al 2014 as well as bhawsinka 2008 have discussed about the importance of considering heave and pitch motions on forces moments in the maneuvering motion the other option to simulate maneuvering motion of planing hulls is to use the 2d t theory this method utilizes the solution of water entry of a solid wedge section which is similar to the section of a planing craft sun and faltinsen 2007 in recent years this method has shown good ability in hydrodynamic modeling of planing hulls ghadimi et al 2017a tavakoli et al 2017b the key to its success lies in the possibility to provide a pattern for coupling motions in vertical horizontal and transverse planes which in turn allows the simulation of 6dof motion of vessel see the work of xu et al 1999 and judge et al 2004 where they have discussed this idea the other advantage of this method is that rapid simulations can be undertaken see e g zarnick 1978 as well as garme and rosen 2003 recently morabito 2015 as well as tavakoli and dashtimanesh 2017 have shown that this method provides accurate results for the drift test of a planing hull in addition by combining previous asymmetric 2d t models see tavakoli et al 2015 ghadimi et al 2016a dashtimanesh et al 2019a as well as tavakoli and dashtimanesh 2018 presented oblique asymmetric simulations for steady asymmetric drift and pmm tests of planing hulls as mentioned earlier in the first paragraph of the current section in the current paper an attempt has been made to extend 2d t theory for modeling of planing hulls turning maneuver in 6dof to provide understanding about the turning motion of these vessels in the present paper a mathematical model for simulation of the steady turning motion of a planing craft has been developed by using 2d t theory and solution of water entry of a wedge section into water mathematical formulations for the prediction of hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the body are presented in section 2 these formulations are developed by extending 2d vertical forces and angular moments over the wetted length of the vessel 3d forces and moments all have nonlinear nature and effects of vertical motion on horizontal forces moments are implemented the guideline for simulation of the problem has been explained in section 3 the results of the simulation have been presented in section 4 comparative analysis against previous experimental data is presented and it is shown that the current 6dof simulation can predict the turning motion of two different prismatic planing hulls accurately turning motion of a planing vessel in different situations is simulated and it is shown how the changes in froude number and thrust angle can affect the turning motion of a planing boat the effects of the degrees of freedom on the turning motion of the vessel are also investigated concluding remarks and future work have been included in section 5 2 mathematical model 2 1 problem definition a hard chine planing vessel with a beam of b deadirse angle of β is assumed to advance in the planing regime while it turns into port starboard see fig 1 as the craft undergoes unsteady turning all motions are coupled and therefore changes in running attitudes see katayama et al 2005 2006 tavakoli et al 2018 roll motion see bowles and blount 2012 and speed reduction occur it is expected that the craft finally reaches steady state condition see kim and kim 2017 the governing equation on the motion of the vessel is formulated using three right handed coordinate systems see examples of the coordinates systems in the research of subramanian and beck 2015 as shown in fig 2 the first one is an earth fixed coordinate system shown by ox e y e z e the second coordinate system is a hydrodynamic coordinate system denoted with o x h y h z h which moves with the vessel this coordinate system has only transitional and rotational speeds of the vessel and has no vertical motion the final coordinate system considered in the current study is a body fixed coordinate system gxyz which is placed at the center of gravity cg the governing equation on the motion of the vessel can be written as 1 m u m q w v r x t cos δ m v m u r p w y t sin δ m w m p v q u z w i x x p i y y i z z q r k i y y q i z z i x x p r m i z z r i x x i y y p q n x δ t sin δ where m is the mass of the vessel i ii is the mass moment of inertia in direction of i further information about the inertia of planing boats can be found in the work of toxopeus 1996a u v and w are surge sway and heave velocities respectively p q and r are the rotational velocities in roll pitch and yaw directions respectively x y and z respectively show the surge sway and heave forces k m and n denote roll pitch and yaw moments t refers to the thrust force and δ stands for the inclination angle of thrust force x δ is the distance between the thrust force and cg w is the weight force of the vessel 2 2 2d t theory it is assumed that the vessel travels through a transverse plane as displayed in fig 3 further information can be found in tavakoli et al 2018c and niazmand bilandi 2019 the problem is simplified to the water entry of a wedge section with oblique and rotational speeds vertical and oblique velocities of the section are computed by 2 ξ u sin θ w cos θ x θ 3 χ u sin ψ v cos ψ x ψ using the momentum variation see von karman 1929 2d vertical and horizontal forces and the angular moment see fig 4 acting on the section are computed as 4 y 2 d m χ χ χ m χ χ χ m χ ξ ξ m χ ξ ξ m χ ϕ φ m χ ϕ φ 5 z 2 d m ξ χ χ m ξ χ χ m ξ ξ ξ m

that is a product of the time rate of the added mass and the velocity shows the 2d damping force see faltinsen et al 1977 payne 1995 ghadimi et al 2017b added mass terms are computed as 7 m i j ρ s ϕ j n i d s where ϕ j is the potential due to motion in j direction and n i is the normal unit vector see tavakoli et al 2017a in i direction newman 1977 using previous findings of dashtimanesh et al 2019a and ghadimi et al 2017c added mass terms can be computed see equations in dashtimanesh et al 2019 to compute added mass terms β 1 β φ instantaneous deadrise angle of the starboard and β 2 β φ instantaneous deadrise angle of the port are needed besides c and μ which are half wetted beam and asymmetric parameters see korobkin and malenica 2005 as well as qin et al 2011 should be computed the method for computation of half wetted beam and asymmetric parameter is presented in appendix a the 2d hydrostatic force f b is computed by 8 f b ρ g c 1 d 2 c 2 d 2 where d is water draft at section note that 2d hydrostatic force is computed by considering the wagner water pile up tavakoli 2018a the 2d angular moment m b caused by hydrostatic pressure is computed by 9 m b ρ g c 1 d 2 c 1 3 c 2 d

moments are computed by extending sectional forces and moments over the entire length of the vessel see martin 1976 3d forces are computed by 10 x l r x z 2 d x d x sin θ l r x y 2 d x d x sin ψ 1 2 ρ

presented in appendices b c d and e respectively 3 guideline for simulation to simulate the problem the craft is initially located at the origin of the earth fixed coordinate system the initial surge speed is set to be equal to the speed of the craft and other velocities are set to be zero at t 0 the initial trim angle and heave of the vessel are set to be equal to running attitudes of the vessel in the calm water condition ghadimi et al 2016c the initial roll and yaw angles of the vessel are set to be zero an unknown variable vector is defined as 31 η u v w p q r forces in the hydrodynamic frame are found at each time step a runge kutta method like the one used in ghadimi et al 2016b is used to numerically solve the problem in the time domain at each time step accelerations the η vector

the simulation and no artificial restoring force or moment for sway and yaw motions is considered 4 results 4 1 comparative analysis to explore the validity of the developed 2d t method the mathematical results of the 2d t method have been compared against the results of previous experimental studies one of these studies was conducted by katayama et al 2006 and the other was performed by kim and kim 2017 principal characteristics of these planing hulls studied by these authors are illustrated in table 1 results computed by the 2d t theory of turning simulation including the rajectory of the vessel and speed reduction of the planing craft studied by katayama et al 2006 are presented in fig 5 simulations are performed for the thrust angle of δ 20 at beam froude number of 2 13 experimental results blue circles with solid line of katayama et al 2006 are also presented in this figure moreover the results of two other simulations both of which were performed by katayama et al 2006 are reported first simulation dashed black was performed using a conventional method by katayama et al 2006 the other dotted green was performed using an interpolation method which uses the instant hydrodynamic coefficient of the vessel by katayama et al 2006 the trajectory curve fig 5a shows that the 2d t theory predicts the turning radius with proper accuracy 2d t method predicts the turning radius to be 6 1 m and the experimentally measured turning radius is 5 8 m conventional method and interpolation method under predict the turning radius of the planing hull 2d t method predicts a smaller advance i e the turning is shifted backward in comparison with experimentally measured turning circle also a larger transit is predicted by the 2d t theory turning circle is shifted toward the right side the possible reason of this error in prediction of the transit and advance of the vessel is the initial conditions of the vessel in the laboratory test we are not sure about but the proper accuracy of the 2d t theory in the prediction of the turning radius shows that this method 2d t provides hydrodynamic forces including added mass damping and steady turning forces with proper accuracy the speed reduction curve time history of u a u shows that 2d t method provides similar results not absolutely to experimental data at the final stage of simulations the experimentally measured value of u a u is found to be 0 72 2d t method predicts the u a u to be 0 79 at the end conventional and interpolation methods respectively over predict and under predict u a u but the accuracy of the interpolation method is better than the conventional method fig 6 presents the comparison of the predicted results by 2d t method against experimental data of kim and kim 2017 who provided time history of pitch and roll angles in addition to the trajectory of the vessel the craft is supposed to turn with a speed of 7 71 m s and δ 15 the comparison of the trajectory curves shows that the current simulation solid red predicts the turning radius with relatively good accuracy note that the error in prediction of the turning radius is 5 8 the trajectory of the vessel is shifted backward 1 2 m which means the advance and transit of the vessel are not predicted with proper accuracy note that we are not sure about the initial conditions of the experimental tests which can highly affect these two values time history of speed reduction fig 6b of both 2d t simulation and experiment show similarities the final speed of the vessel in the steady phase is predicted by an error of 11 2 some fluctuations sudden jumps can be seen in the measurements which cannot be computed by the 2d t method these fluctuations can be attributed to a real craft and real condition of the sea which is not considered in the current model since water is assumed to be perfectly calm the time history of the yaw rate can be seen in fig 6c the steady yaw rate of the 2d t simulation 11 8 per second almost agrees with the mean value 11 17 per second of the measurements measurements show some fluctuations 2d t theory cannot model there are some differences between the results of the 2d t method and experiments at the early stage of the turning for example the measured yaw rate is seen to reach its peak at t 3 2 s but 2d t results show that this peak occurs slightly sooner 1 s note that we are sure about the maximum thrust inclination angle in sea trials but we are not sure about the time history of the thrust inclination angle this angle is initially set to be 15 in simulations one possible reason for this difference between the peak time the time at which the yaw rate reaches its maximum value is the uncertainty about the initial value of the thrust inclination angle in sea trials the time history of the mathematically predicted roll angle is in good agreement with the time history of the experimentally measured roll angle fig 6d predicted roll angle reaches its maximum value at t 4 3 s then its value highly decreases and becomes smaller than 2 some fluctuations can be seen in the experimentally measured time history of the roll motion finally the predicted pitch vs time curves of the simulations and measurements show similarities at the beginning of the turning motion their values decrease and then converge to a constant value for the case of experiments the final value refers to the time average of the pitch after the unsteady motion it should be noted that the experimental data fluctuate for different reasons such as the vibration of the body however the current method cannot model fluctuations 4 2 effects of parameters using the current mathematical model effects of speed and inclination angle of thrust force on the motion of a planing hull in steady turning have been investigated simulations were performed to model the planing hull studied by katayama et al 2006 fig 7 shows the results of simulation at three different thrust angles δ 10 20 and 30 at the beam froude number of 2 13 the turning radius of the vessel is seen to decrease by the increase in δ speed reduction becomes more significant by the increase in δ larger inclination angle leads to larger force in sway direction and smaller force in surge direction causing more reduction in speed the yaw rate of the vessel becomes larger with the increase in δ fig 7c on the other hand the drift angle increases with the increase in δ the roll angle of the vessel increases and reaches a peak and then decreases and finally converges the peak roll highly increases with the increase in δ at the steady state condition when the roll angle converges to a constant value the effects of δ on roll angle vanish for example the maximum roll angle at δ 10 and 30 are 4 4 and 17 2 respectively but the steady roll angles are 1 4 and 3 8 at δ 10 and 30 under the action of yaw and sway speeds larger angular moments izadi et al 2018 as it was seen in formulated equations see equation 29 act on the vessel therefore at a very early stage of turning when instantaneous speeds are larger compare to the steady state condition surge and sway speed lead in a larger exciting moment in the roll direction when the vessel reaches the steady state condition surge and sway speed decrease their influences on roll angle are reduced compared with the early stage of turning finally the pitch angle of the vessel decreases in all cases however this decrease is larger when δ is larger simulations performed by 2d t method of turning motion of the considered planing hull with δ 20 at three different beam froude numbers of 2 13 2 63 and 3 13 are displayed in fig 8 larger speed has a larger turning radius fig 8a speed reduction becomes more significant as the beam froude number increases fig 8b the results of the yaw rate also indicate that an increase in speed increases the yaw rate fig 8c the drift angle of the vessel becomes smaller with the increase in speed fig 8d when the speed of the vessel becomes larger the angle between sway speed and surge speed becomes smaller according to the results presented for the roll angle fig 8d peak roll increases by the increase in speed and the final heel angle of the vessel is larger when speed is larger fig 8e at higher speeds the wetted surface of the craft becomes lesser and the contribution of the hydrostatic force thereby reduces esfandiari et al 2019 moreover the pitch angle is reduced by the increase in speed fig 8f it is obvious that dynamic trim angle of a vessel becomes smaller when speed becomes larger ghadimi et al 2015 4 3 effects of degrees of freedom on the turning simulation the effects of degrees of freedom on steady turning motion of the planing hull are studied simulation of the turning motion of the model studied by katayama et al 2006 is performed for 6dof 4dof surge sway roll and yaw and 3dof surge sway and yaw cases at beam froude number of 2 13 inoculation angle of thrust is set to be 20 results are presented in fig 9 showing that the number of degrees of freedom can affect the results the turning radius of the vessel becomes larger by the decrease in degrees of freedom fig 9a when the degrees of freedom are less the contribution of heave and pitch motions as well as roll motion for the case of 3dof motion becomes less therefore smaller forces act on the bottom of the vessel allowing it to travel in a larger loop larger circle during the turning motion speed reduction fig 9b of the boat is found to be the same at the final time for all cases this point shows that heave pitch and roll forces do not lead to any significant surge force during the steady turning but at the early stage of turning the speed reduction is larger for the cases with smaller degrees of freedom see the first 20 s of the simulations the different behavior at the early stage of the turning can be attributed to extra damping forces in heave direction which disappear when turning motion becomes steady tavakoli et al 2018 yaw rate of the vessel fig 9c as well as its drift angle fig 9d are smaller when the vessel is free in all six degrees of freedom for the cases of 4dof and 3dof simulations the vessel travels in the horizontal plane with larger yaw rates which result in larger turning circles this fact shows that when the vessel is free in all degrees of freedom contributions of heave and pitch motions in yaw direction resist against the increase in the yaw moment and thus the vessel has smaller yaw acceleration and yaw rate the effects of degrees of freedom on the turning motion of the vessel are studied at beam froude numbers of 2 63 and 3 13 fig 10 shows the turning radius and steady yaw rate of the vessel studied by katayama for three different cases 6dof 4dof and 3dof at the mentioned froude numbers results presented in this figure show that the turning radius fig 10a and the yaw rate of the vessel fig 10b increases by the decrease in the degrees of freedom at all considered speeds 5 conclusions a mathematical simulation for the turning motion of a planing hull was developed using 2d t theory by coupling all six degrees of motion sectional hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces and moments were found by using water entry of a solid wedge section extending 2d forces and moments over the length of the craft equations for maneuvering forces and moments involving in turning were developed added mass damping steady maneuvering and hydrostatic restoring forces and moments were found firstly the results of the current method were compared against two of previous experiments it was seen that 2d t method predicted the turning radius as well as the trajectory of the vessel with reasonable accuracy also it was seen that time histories of pitch and roll angles were predicted with reasonable accuracy the behavior of the vessel during the turning motion was also investigated it was seen that the turning diameter of the vessel decreases by the increase in thrust angle also speed reduction yaw rate and the drift angle were found to become larger when the thrust angle increases in addition to these it was shown that roll angle is larger when the thrust angle is larger it was seen that the turning radius and maximum roll angle of the craft increase while drift and pitch angles become smaller as speed increases the effects of degrees of freedom on the turning motion were studied it was demonstrated that when the vessel is not allowed to have motions in heave pitch and roll directions turning radius and yaw rate increase it is anticipated that future research may provide mathematical models for active control of planing craft in turning motion moreover authors are seeking for new theoretical solutions for water entry by which they can increase the accuracy of the method especially at high yaw angles acknowledgement st is supported by a melbourne research scholarship mrs awarded by the

22478,the current paper presents simulations for steady turning of a planing craft by developing a new mathematical model to solve the problem it is assumed that the craft is free in six degrees of freedom and all motions are strongly coupled maneuvering forces and moments acting on the vessel are computed using 2d t theory virtual added mass terms of two dimensional 2d sections are integrated over the entire length of the craft the final equation for the motion of the vessel in six degrees of freedom is obtained which is then solved in the time domain final three dimensional 3d forces and moments contain strongly coupled added mass damping steady maneuvering and restoring hydrostatic forces and moments simulations are compared against experimental data and it is shown that the developed method has reasonable accuracy in prediction of turning motion of two planing vessels effects of beam froude number and rudder angle on steady turning motion of a planing hull have also been studied it is found that when the vessel is free in six degrees of freedom the turning radius and yaw rate of the vessel are smaller while the steady surge speed is not affected significantly keywords

craft nonlinear behavior of the vessel as well as coupled heave pitch and roll motions which can generate forces and moments in the horizontal plane tend to complicate the problem see e g tavakoli et al 2017b traditional mathematical models used for maneuvering simulation of ships are not suitable for simulation of maneuvering motion of planing hulls see discussions of morabito et al 2014 and conclusion of morabito 2015 recent advances in mathematical modeling based on the 2d t theory of heeled yawed planing hulls can be further developed for maneuvering simulation of these vessels see e g tavakoli et al 2018a specifically two different mathematical models have developed by authors for mathematical simulations of steady drift test dashtimanesh et al 2019a and planar motion mechanism pmm test of planing hulls tavakoli and dashtimanesh 2018 both mathematical models showed good ability to compute maneuvering forces moments acting on a planing hull note that authors performed a wide range of comparison against experimental data of brown and klosinski 1994a b katayama et al 2006 and tajima et al 1999 in their recent publications at the current stage previous progress in mathematical modelling of planing hulls motion can be followed as we will show to develop a mathematical model for simulation of six degrees of freedom 6dof of planing hulls in turning in the current paper a mathematical model is established using 2d t theory to simulate the turning motion of planing hulls in 6dof early studies in the context of planing hulls maneuvering were performed by smiley 1952 and savitsky 1958 who respectively explored hydrodynamic forces acting on yawed and heeled planing hulls later the majority of the researchers such as sugai 1964 as well as blount and codega 1992 investigated the instabilities of planing hulls in the horizontal plane meanwhile denny 1991 proposed a maneuvering simulation for planing hulls by neglecting the effects of heave pitch and roll motions lewandowski 1994 1995 presented a mathematical model for prediction of the trajectory of a planing hull in the horizontal plane his method was extremely helpful in gaining insight into the turning motion of planing hulls and their stability in the horizontal plane but his method relies on empirical equations and is unable to consider six degrees of freedom for a wide range of planing hulls see discussion in morabito 2015 toxopeus 1996a developed a mathematical model for prediction of the 6dof motion of planing hulls his method was able to simulate the motion of the vessel but for many cases especially for the case of added mass forces traditional equations developed for displacement ships were utilized which are not accurate for the case of planing hulls dashtimanesh et al 2017 furthermore he presented specific equations for the computation of maneuvering forces of a series of planing hulls toxopeus 1996b in addition to the mentioned research katayama et al 2005 conducted steady drift tests on planing hulls commenting that during the turning motion of planing hulls heave and pitch motions vary in time affecting the hydrodynamic maneuvering forces and moments katayama et al 2006 performed experimental tests and mathematical simulations by considering the effects of heave and pitch motion of forces and moments of the turning motion of a prismatic planing hull it was found that when heave and pitch motions are considered i e heave and pitch motions are set to be free the accuracy of mathematical simulations increases to simulate the turning motion of planing hulls more accurately katayama et al 2009 used a large range of steady test data and interpolated hydrodynamic coefficients of the vessel using its instantaneous heave and pitch their method can work well however the availability of steady test data is a prerequisite which cannot be easily accessed i e we need all drift test data of a vessel we want to model to use that mathematical model also morabito et al 2014 as well as bhawsinka 2008 have discussed about the importance of considering heave and pitch motions on forces moments in the maneuvering motion the other option to simulate maneuvering motion of planing hulls is to use the 2d t theory this method utilizes the solution of water entry of a solid wedge section which is similar to the section of a planing craft sun and faltinsen 2007 in recent years this method has shown good ability in hydrodynamic modeling of planing hulls ghadimi et al 2017a tavakoli et al 2017b the key to its success lies in the possibility to provide a pattern for coupling motions in vertical horizontal and transverse planes which in turn allows the simulation of 6dof motion of vessel see the work of xu et al 1999 and judge et al 2004 where they have discussed this idea the other advantage of this method is that rapid simulations can be undertaken see e g zarnick 1978 as well as garme and rosen 2003 recently morabito 2015 as well as tavakoli and dashtimanesh 2017 have shown that this method provides accurate results for the drift test of a planing hull in addition by combining previous asymmetric 2d t models see tavakoli et al 2015 ghadimi et al 2016a dashtimanesh et al 2019a as well as tavakoli and dashtimanesh 2018 presented oblique asymmetric simulations for steady asymmetric drift and pmm tests of planing hulls as mentioned earlier in the first paragraph of the current section in the current paper an attempt has been made to extend 2d t theory for modeling of planing hulls turning maneuver in 6dof to provide understanding about the turning motion of these vessels in the present paper a mathematical model for simulation of the steady turning motion of a planing craft has been developed by using 2d t theory and solution of water entry of a wedge section into water mathematical formulations for the prediction of hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the body are presented in section 2 these formulations are developed by extending 2d vertical forces and angular moments over the wetted length of the vessel 3d forces and moments all have nonlinear nature and effects of vertical motion on horizontal forces moments are implemented the guideline for simulation of the problem has been explained in section 3 the results of the simulation have been presented in section 4 comparative analysis against previous experimental data is presented and it is shown that the current 6dof simulation can predict the turning motion of two different prismatic planing hulls accurately turning motion of a planing vessel in different situations is simulated and it is shown how the changes in froude number and thrust angle can affect the turning motion of a planing boat the effects of the degrees of freedom on the turning motion of the vessel are also investigated concluding remarks and future work have been included in section 5 2 mathematical model 2 1 problem definition a hard chine planing vessel with a beam of b deadirse angle of β is assumed to advance in the planing regime while it turns into port starboard see fig 1 as the craft undergoes unsteady turning all motions are coupled and therefore changes in running attitudes see katayama et al 2005 2006 tavakoli et al 2018 roll motion see bowles and blount 2012 and speed reduction occur it is expected that the craft finally reaches steady state condition see kim and kim 2017 the governing equation on the motion of the vessel is formulated using three right handed coordinate systems see examples of the coordinates systems in the research of subramanian and beck 2015 as shown in fig 2 the first one is an earth fixed coordinate system shown by ox e y e z e the second coordinate system is a hydrodynamic coordinate system denoted with o x h y h z h which moves with the vessel this coordinate system has only transitional and rotational speeds of the vessel and has no vertical motion the final coordinate system considered in the current study is a body fixed coordinate system gxyz which is placed at the center of gravity cg the governing equation on the motion of the vessel can be written as 1 m u m q w v r x t cos δ m v m u r p w y t sin δ m w m p v q u z w i x x p i y y i z z q r k i y y q i z z i x x p r m i z z r i x x i y y p q n x δ t sin δ where m is the mass of the vessel i ii is the mass moment of inertia in direction of i further information about the inertia of planing boats can be found in the work of toxopeus 1996a u v and w are surge sway and heave velocities respectively p q and r are the rotational velocities in roll pitch and yaw directions respectively x y and z respectively show the surge sway and heave forces k m and n denote roll pitch and yaw moments t refers to the thrust force and δ stands for the inclination angle of thrust force x δ is the distance between the thrust force and cg w is the weight force of the vessel 2 2 2d t theory it is assumed that the vessel travels through a transverse plane as displayed in fig 3 further information can be found in tavakoli et al 2018c and niazmand bilandi 2019 the problem is simplified to the water entry of a wedge section with oblique and rotational speeds vertical and oblique velocities of the section are computed by 2 ξ u sin θ w cos θ x θ 3 χ u sin ψ v cos ψ x ψ using the momentum variation see von karman 1929 2d vertical and horizontal forces and the angular moment see fig 4 acting on the section are computed as 4 y 2 d m χ χ χ m χ χ χ m χ ξ ξ m χ ξ ξ m χ ϕ φ m χ ϕ φ 5 z 2 d m ξ χ χ m ξ χ χ m ξ ξ ξ m

2019a and ghadimi et al 2017c added mass terms can be computed see equations in dashtimanesh et al 2019 to compute added mass terms β 1 β φ instantaneous deadrise angle of the starboard and β 2 β φ instantaneous deadrise angle of the port are needed besides c and μ which are half wetted beam and asymmetric parameters see korobkin and malenica 2005 as well as qin et al 2011 should be computed the method for computation of half wetted beam and asymmetric parameter is presented in appendix a the 2d hydrostatic force f b is computed by 8 f b ρ g c 1 d 2 c 2 d 2 where d is water draft at section

moments are computed by extending sectional forces and moments over the entire length of the vessel see martin 1976 3d forces are computed by 10 x l r x z 2 d x d x sin θ l r x y 2 d x d x sin ψ 1 2 ρ

presented in appendices b c d and e respectively 3 guideline for simulation to simulate the problem the craft is initially located at the origin of the earth fixed coordinate system the initial surge speed is set to be equal to the speed of the craft and other velocities are set to be zero at t 0 the initial trim angle and heave of the vessel are set to be equal to running attitudes of the vessel in the calm water condition ghadimi et al 2016c the initial roll and yaw angles of the vessel are set to be zero an unknown variable vector is defined as 31 η u v w p q r forces in the hydrodynamic frame are found at each time step a runge kutta method like the one used in ghadimi et al 2016b is used to numerically solve the problem in the time domain at each time step accelerations the η vector

the simulation and no artificial restoring force or moment for sway and yaw motions is considered 4 results 4 1 comparative analysis to explore the validity of the developed 2d t method the mathematical results of the 2d t method have been compared against the results of previous experimental studies one of these studies was conducted by katayama et al 2006 and the other was performed by kim and kim 2017 principal characteristics of these planing hulls studied by these authors are illustrated in table 1 results computed by the 2d t theory of turning simulation including the rajectory of the vessel and speed reduction of the planing craft studied by katayama et al 2006 are presented in fig 5 simulations are performed for the thrust angle of δ 20 at beam froude number of 2 13 experimental results blue circles with solid line of katayama et al 2006 are also presented in this figure moreover the results of two other simulations both of which were performed by katayama et al 2006 are reported first simulation dashed black was performed using a conventional method by katayama et al 2006 the other dotted green was performed using an interpolation method which uses the instant hydrodynamic coefficient of the vessel by katayama et al 2006 the trajectory curve fig 5a shows that the 2d t theory predicts the turning radius with proper accuracy 2d t method predicts the turning radius to be 6 1 m and the experimentally measured turning radius is 5 8 m conventional method and interpolation method under predict the turning radius of the planing hull 2d t method predicts a smaller advance i e the turning is shifted backward in comparison with experimentally measured turning circle also a larger transit is predicted by the 2d t theory turning circle is shifted toward the right side the possible reason of this error in prediction of the transit and advance of the vessel is the initial conditions of the vessel in the laboratory test we are not sure about but the proper accuracy of the 2d t theory in the prediction of the turning radius shows that this method 2d t provides hydrodynamic forces including added mass damping and steady turning forces with proper accuracy the speed reduction curve time history of u a u shows that 2d t method provides similar results not absolutely to experimental data at the final stage of simulations the experimentally measured value of u a u is found to be 0 72 2d t method predicts the u a u to be 0 79 at the end conventional and interpolation methods respectively over predict and under predict u a u but the accuracy of the interpolation method is better than the conventional method fig 6 presents the comparison of the predicted results by 2d t method against experimental data of kim and kim 2017 who provided time history of pitch and roll angles in addition to the trajectory of the vessel the craft is supposed to turn with a speed of 7 71 m s and δ 15 the comparison of the trajectory curves shows that the current simulation solid red predicts the turning radius with relatively good accuracy note that the error in prediction of the turning radius is 5 8 the trajectory of the vessel is shifted backward 1 2 m which means the advance and transit of the vessel are not predicted with proper accuracy note that we are not sure about the initial conditions of the experimental tests which can highly affect these two values time history of speed reduction fig 6b of both 2d t simulation and experiment show similarities the final speed of the vessel in the steady phase is predicted by an error of 11 2 some fluctuations sudden jumps can be seen in the measurements which cannot be computed by the 2d t method these fluctuations can be attributed to a real craft and real condition of the sea which is not considered in the current model since water is assumed to be perfectly calm the time history of the yaw rate can be seen in fig 6c the steady yaw rate of the 2d t simulation 11 8 per second almost agrees with the mean value 11 17 per second of the measurements measurements show some fluctuations 2d t theory cannot model there are some differences between the results of the 2d t method and experiments at the early stage of the turning for example the measured yaw rate is seen to reach its peak at t 3 2 s but 2d t results show that this peak occurs slightly sooner 1 s note that we are sure about the maximum thrust inclination angle in sea trials but we are not sure about the time history of the thrust inclination angle this angle is initially set to be 15 in simulations one possible reason for this difference between the peak time the time at which the yaw rate reaches its maximum value is the uncertainty about the initial value of the thrust inclination angle in sea trials the time history of the mathematically predicted roll angle is in good agreement with the time history of the experimentally measured roll angle fig 6d predicted roll angle reaches its maximum value at t 4 3 s then its value highly decreases and becomes smaller than 2 some fluctuations can be seen in the experimentally measured time history of the roll motion finally the predicted pitch vs time curves of the simulations and measurements show similarities at the beginning of the turning motion their values decrease and then converge to a constant value for the case of experiments the final value refers to the time average of the pitch after the unsteady motion it should be noted that the experimental data fluctuate for different reasons such as the vibration of the body however the current method cannot model fluctuations 4 2 effects of parameters using the current mathematical model effects of speed and inclination angle of thrust force on the motion of a planing hull in steady turning have been investigated simulations were performed to model the planing hull studied by katayama et al 2006 fig 7 shows the results of simulation at three different thrust angles δ 10 20 and 30 at the beam froude number of 2 13 the turning radius of the vessel is seen to decrease by the increase in δ speed reduction becomes more significant by the increase in δ larger inclination angle leads to larger force in sway direction and smaller force in surge direction causing more reduction in speed the yaw rate of the vessel becomes larger with the increase in δ fig 7c on the other hand the drift angle increases with the increase in δ the roll angle of the vessel increases and reaches a peak and then decreases and finally converges the peak roll highly increases with the increase in δ at the steady state condition when the roll angle converges to a constant value the effects of δ on roll angle vanish for example the maximum roll angle at δ 10 and 30 are 4 4 and 17 2 respectively but the steady roll angles are 1 4 and 3 8 at δ 10 and 30 under the action of yaw and sway speeds larger angular moments izadi et al 2018 as it was seen in formulated equations see equation 29 act on the vessel therefore at a very early stage of turning when instantaneous speeds are larger compare to the steady state condition surge and sway speed lead in a larger exciting moment in the roll direction when the vessel reaches the steady state condition surge and sway speed decrease their influences on roll angle are reduced compared with the early stage of turning finally the pitch angle of the vessel decreases in all cases however this decrease is larger when δ is larger simulations performed by 2d t method of turning motion of the considered planing hull with δ 20 at three different beam froude numbers of 2 13 2 63 and 3 13 are displayed in fig 8 larger speed has a larger turning radius fig 8a speed reduction becomes more significant as the beam froude number increases fig 8b the results of the yaw rate also indicate that an increase in speed increases the yaw rate fig 8c the drift angle of the vessel becomes smaller with the increase in speed fig 8d when the speed of the vessel becomes larger the angle between sway speed and surge speed becomes smaller according to the results presented for the roll angle fig 8d peak roll increases by the increase in speed and the final heel angle of the vessel is larger when speed is larger fig 8e at higher speeds the wetted surface of the craft becomes lesser and the contribution of the hydrostatic force thereby reduces esfandiari et al 2019 moreover the pitch angle is reduced by the increase in speed fig 8f it is obvious that dynamic trim angle of a vessel becomes smaller when speed becomes larger ghadimi et al 2015 4 3 effects of degrees of freedom on the turning simulation the effects of degrees of freedom on steady turning motion of the planing hull are studied simulation of the turning motion of the model studied by katayama et al 2006 is performed for 6dof 4dof surge sway roll and yaw and 3dof surge sway and yaw cases at beam froude number of 2 13 inoculation angle of thrust is set to be 20 results are presented in fig 9 showing that the number of degrees of freedom can affect the results the turning radius of the vessel becomes larger by the decrease in degrees of freedom fig 9a when the degrees of freedom are less the contribution of heave and pitch motions as well as roll motion for the case of 3dof motion becomes less therefore smaller forces act on the bottom of the vessel allowing it to travel in a larger loop larger circle during the turning motion speed reduction fig 9b of the boat is found to be the same at the final time for all cases this point shows that heave pitch and roll forces do not lead to any significant surge force during the steady turning but at the early stage of turning the speed reduction is larger for the cases with smaller degrees of freedom see the first 20 s of the simulations the different behavior at the early stage of the turning can be attributed to extra damping forces in heave direction which disappear when turning motion becomes steady tavakoli et al 2018 yaw rate of the vessel fig 9c as well as its drift angle fig 9d are smaller when the vessel is free in all six degrees of freedom for the cases of 4dof and 3dof simulations the vessel travels in the horizontal plane with larger yaw rates which result in larger turning circles this fact shows that when the vessel is free in all degrees of freedom contributions of heave and pitch motions in yaw direction resist against the increase in the yaw moment and thus the vessel has smaller yaw acceleration and yaw rate the effects of degrees of freedom on the turning motion of the vessel are studied at beam froude numbers of 2 63 and 3 13 fig 10 shows the turning radius and steady yaw rate of the vessel studied by katayama for three different cases 6dof 4dof and 3dof at the mentioned froude numbers results presented in this figure show that the turning radius fig 10a and the yaw rate of the vessel fig 10b increases by the decrease in the degrees of freedom at all considered speeds 5 conclusions a mathematical simulation for the turning motion of a planing hull was developed using 2d t theory by coupling all six degrees of motion sectional hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces and moments were found by using water entry of a solid wedge section extending 2d forces and moments over the length of the craft equations for maneuvering forces and moments involving in turning were developed added mass damping steady maneuvering and hydrostatic restoring forces and moments were found firstly the results of the current method were compared against two of previous experiments it was seen that 2d t method predicted the turning radius as well as the trajectory of the vessel with reasonable accuracy also it was seen that time histories of pitch and roll angles were predicted with reasonable accuracy the behavior of the vessel during the turning motion was also investigated it was seen that the turning diameter of the vessel decreases by the increase in thrust angle also speed reduction yaw rate and the drift angle were found to become larger when the thrust angle increases in addition to these it was shown that roll angle is larger when the thrust angle is larger it was seen that the turning radius and maximum roll angle of the craft increase while drift and pitch angles become smaller as speed increases the effects of degrees of freedom on the turning motion were studied it was demonstrated that when the vessel is not allowed to have motions in heave pitch and roll directions turning radius and yaw rate increase it is anticipated that future research may provide mathematical models for active control of planing craft in turning motion moreover authors are seeking for new theoretical solutions for water entry by which they can increase the accuracy of the method especially at high yaw angles acknowledgement st is supported by a melbourne research scholarship mrs awarded by the

22479,this paper presents a multi scale stochastic dynamic analysis method for offshore structures the uncertainties in the structural material parameters such as mass density and young s modulus are considered they are assumed to be lognormal distributions and represented by using the karhunen loeve kl and polynomial chaos pc expansions since the variance of the output responses is unknown the output vibration response is represented by using pc expansion the multi scale stochastic analysis is conducted with pc expansions of different orders representing responses at different dofs defined as three categories namely important less important and the least important ones iterated order reduced ior model reduction technique is employed to remove the pc coefficients of slave dofs two numerical examples are taken to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method for the multi scale stochastic dynamic response analysis of offshore risers the response statistics such as mean value and variance can be obtained from the proposed method the results are compared with those from monte carlo simulation mcs and stochastic finite element method sfem results demonstrate that the computational demand for uncertainty evaluation is greatly reduced and the accuracy of the results is maintained keywords stochastic dynamic response analysis pc expansion kl expansion model reduction multi scale analysis 1 introduction performance based structural analysis and design are becoming a significant topic in civil engineering community structural performance assessment can more realistically be done in a probabilistic sense since uncertainties inevitably exist in the dimensions geometry material properties loading and the numerical modelling assumptions of structures haukaas and der kiureghian 2004 probabilistic structural analysis is receiving more attention in the last decades stefanou 2009 many approaches been proposed to simulate the random properties due to the uncertainties i e karhunen loeve kl expansion method huang et al 2001 orthogonal series expansions stefanou 2009 and optimal linear estimation method li and der kiureghian 1993 with the realized random input monte carlo simulation mcs is a traditional method to evaluate the probabilistic characterization of the model output other methods i e neumann series expansion yamazaki et al 1988 polynomial chaos pc expansion xiu and karniadakis 2002 and the first order second moment method dolinski 1982 have also been developed to determine the stochastic characteristics of output with random input variables stochastic structural analysis has been widely performed in many engineering areas e g settlement analysis of a foundation sudret and der kiureghian 2000 reliability assessment of structures haldar and mahadevan 2000 and performance based earthquake engineering kiureghian and fujimura 2009 etc with the growing needs for the exploitation of oil and gas in the deeper water marine risers are pipe used in floating operations to convey drilling fluid and to guide tools between the drilling vessel and the wellhead at the ocean floor monitoring the conditions of marine risers is essential for the offshore industry since the failure of the risers may cause significant lost and catastrophic consequence with an increase in drilling operations in harsh environments the requirements and limits of marine risers have become more essential due to uncertainties involved in response prediction and prolonged drilling programs many research works have been done to investigate the dynamic behavior of marine risers i e vortex induced vibrations chen et al 2015 feng et al 2017 tsukada and morooka 2016 wu et al 2016 a detail review on the modelling and analysis techniques of flexible risers can be found in patel and seyed 1995 however most of existing studies are based on deterministic analyses which assumed that the system parameters were specific constant values uncertainty analysis of marine structures gains a significant amount of attention in recent years alibrandi and koh 2017 presented a study on stochastic dynamic analysis of a floating production system with the first order reliability method and secant hyperplane method the vessel model and marine riser were simplified as a 2 dof model the uncertainties of the output responses under random sea wave loading was evaluated he and low 2013 proposed a technique to predict the collision probability of risers the random inputs such as the drag coefficient current vessel motions and riser mass were considered yang and wang 2013 utilized the surrogate model to evaluate the influences of random variables on the stability of pipeline the uncertainties in the soil properties structural modelling and hydrodynamic loads were considered cabrera miranda and paik 2017 evaluated the probabilistic distribution of loads a metamodel was developed to predict the loads such as axial tension waves winds and currents ni et al 2018 performed the stochastic dynamic response analysis of marine risers considering gaussian system uncertainties model reduction was employed to reduce the dimension of the stochastic dynamical system and therefore the computational demand in the stochastic dynamic response analysis using gaussian random fields to simulate the uncertain system parameters has been widely studied in the above literatures however the assumption is not necessarily true and suitable to model all the material properties i e young s modulus and yielding strength etc in the soil structure system analysis the material constitutive parameters were assumed to follow the lognormal distribution barbato et al 2010 to study the uncertainty effect on the natural frequencies of a bridge the young s modulus of the bridge is considered having a lognormal distribution wan et al 2017 other research works on lognormal random inputs can be referred to barbato et al 2013 gupta and arun 2018 saydam and frangopol 2013 realizations of a gaussian random field with a large coefficient of variation may include negative outcomes which are physically meaningless from a practical point of view the lognormal random fields appear attractive in this sense because they are naturally positive valued sudret and der kiureghian 2000 the stochastic young s modulus and mass density are assumed having lognormal distributions represented with kl and pc expansions the statistics of parameters are defined based on the design information and literatures the stochastic output response is represented by using pc expansion the accuracy of uncertainty analysis depends on the order of pc expansion in this study the degrees of freedom dofs of the structure are classified into three categories namely important dofs which will be represented with high order pc expansions less important dofs with low order pc expansions and unimportant dofs being eliminated high order pc expansions will be used for dofs with high significance and interest iterated order reduced ior method xia and lin 2004b is employed to reduce the dimension of the stochastic system and reduce the computational demand those pc expansion coefficients associated with unimportant dofs are to be removed and the computational efficiency is improved numerical studies on a simplified riser model with beam elements and a cylinder riser model with shell elements are conducted the statistics of the responses of riser models obtained with the proposed approach are compared with those calculated from mcs and stochastic finite element method sfem results demonstrate that the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach are good by keeping the pc expansion coefficients associated with the main dofs based on the used ior model reduction technique 2 representation of lognormal random inputs 2 1 pc expansion pc expansion is an efficiency tool to model the stochastic processes the first research work on pc expansion was developed by wiener 1938 who used hermite polynomials and gaussian random variables to represent the stochastic processes xiu and karniadakis 2002 found that the optimal exponential convergence rate cannot be generated when the hermite polynomial is used to represent the non gaussian processes the theory of pc expansion is briefly reviewed in this section and is used to represent the random inputs and outputs later a random process α θ can be treated as a function of the random input variable θ with the following equation 1 α θ a 0 ψ 0 j 1 1 a j 1 ψ 1 ξ j 1 θ j 1 1 j 2 1 i 1 a j 1 j 2 ψ 2 ξ j 1 θ ξ j 2 θ j 1 1 j 2 1 j 1 j 3 1 j 2 a j 1 j 2 j 3 ψ 3 ξ j 1 θ ξ j 2 θ ξ j 3 θ where ψ p p 0 1 2 are the p th terms in the pc expansion and a j1 j2 j3 are deterministic coefficients to reduce the computational demand the expansion in eq 1 is truncated taking a two dimensional case for example the pc approximation can be expressed as 2 α θ a 0 ψ 0 a 1 ψ 1 ξ 1 a 2 ψ 1 ξ 2 a 11 ψ 2 ξ 1 ξ 1 a 21 ψ 2 ξ 1 ξ 2 a 22 ψ 2 ξ 2 ξ 2 a 111 ψ 3 ξ 1 ξ 1 ξ 1 a 211 ψ 3 ξ 2 ξ 1 ξ 1 a 221 ψ 3 ξ 2 ξ 2 ξ 1 a 222 ψ 3 ξ 2 ξ 2 ξ 2 a new polynomial functions ψ k is defined to replace ψ k with one to one correspondence eq 2 can be expressed in a matrix form as 3 α θ k 0 a ˆ k ψ k ξ θ where a ˆ k are the deterministic pc coefficients the two dimensional expansion as shown in eq 2 in this case can be expressed as 4 α θ a ˆ 0 ψ 0 a ˆ 1 ψ 1 a ˆ 2 ψ 2 a ˆ 3 ψ 3 a ˆ 4 ψ 4 a ˆ 5 ψ 5 the polynomials ψ k ξ θ are orthogonal and they satisfy the following relation 5 ψ k ξ θ ψ l ξ θ ψ k 2 ξ θ δ k l where δ kl is the kronecker delta the symbol is the inner product and the value of ψ k 2 can be calculated theoretically ghanem and spanos 2003 2 2 kl expansion of lognormal random fields kl expansion is combined with pc expansion to represent the lognormal random field of uncertainties in the material parameters h χ θ and h χ represent a second order random process and its mathematical expectation respectively c cov χ 1 χ 2 is the covariance matirx of h χ θ the covariance matrix c cov χ 1 χ 2 is bounded symmetric and positive definite which can be decomposed with the eigenvalues λ n and eigenvectors ϕ n χ as 6 c cov χ 1 χ 2 n 0 λ n ϕ n χ 1 ϕ n χ 2 the eigenvectors are orthogonal and satisfy following equation 7 v ϕ q χ ϕ n χ d χ δ q n where δ qn is the kronecker delta function therefore the eigenpairs λ n ϕ n χ can be calculated from the homogeneous fredholm integral equation as 8 v c cov χ 1 χ 2 ϕ n χ 2 d χ 2 λ n ϕ n χ 1 h χ θ can be expressed as 9 h χ θ h χ n 1 λ n ϕ n χ ξ n θ h σ χ θ where h χ is the mean value of h χ θ and ξ n θ is a set of uncorrelated standard gaussian variables moreover an explicit expression for ξ n θ can be obtained by multiplying h σ χ θ with ϕ n χ and integrating through the domain v as follows 10 ξ n θ 1 λ n v h σ χ θ ϕ n χ d χ using the first m th term eigenvalues and eigenvectors the random field h χ θ can be approximated as 11 h ˆ χ θ h χ n 1 m g n χ ξ n θ where g n χ is the deterministic function λ n ϕ n χ gathering the random variables ξ 1 θ ξ 2 θ ξ n θ into a n 1 vector ξ and g 1 χ g 2 χ g n χ into a n 1 vector g χ the lognormal random field can be approximated with h ˆ χ θ as sudret and der kiureghian 2000 12 l χ exp h ˆ χ θ exp h χ g χ t ξ using pc expansion eq 12 can be expressed as 13 l χ n 0 m l n χ ψ n ξ where m is the number of polynomial functions which depends on the number of kl expansion terms and the order of pc expansion p 14 m 1 m p m p and 15 l n χ e exp h ˆ χ θ ψ n e ψ n 2 ξ where e denotes the expectation since the first coefficient corresponds to ψ 0 1 we have 16 l 0 χ exp h χ 1 2 n 1 m g i χ 2 exp h χ 1 2 σ g 2 χ where σ g χ is the standard deviation of h ˆ χ θ the other ones can be expressed as 17 l n χ l 0 χ e ψ n ξ g χ e ψ n 2 ξ the details of closed form solution can be found in sudret and der kiureghian 2000 3 stochastic system with lognormal uncertainties 3 1 equation of motion of a marine riser a marine riser is a long and flexible pipe which connects the sea floor with the offshore platform the dynamic response of the structure can be calculated by using the idealized beam model and the fourth order partial differential equations cabrera miranda and paik 2019 hong and shah 2018 teixeira and morooka 2017 18 e i z t 4 x z t z 4 t z t 2 x z t z 2 m z t 2 x z t t 2 c z t x z t t p z t f z t where e i z t t z t m z t c p z t f z t and z are the bending stiffness the tension force the mass per unit the drag coefficient the nonlinear restoring force the hydrodynamic force and the distance to the sea level respectively as shown in fig 1 the majority of the risers have a telescoping joint at the top which enables the riser to move freely in the vertical direction therefore the tension force t z t is not considered the nonlinear drag force p z t can be represented by the duffing model or polynomial types of nonlinearities li et al 2018 torres et al 2015 since the objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of uncertainties in the stochastic material properties on the lateral vibration response of the riser under the lateral sea wave loads the nonlinear drag force is also neglected when the finite element method is applied to study the dynamic behavior of marine risers spanos and chen 1980 eq 18 can be written as 19 m x t c x t k x t f t where k c and m denote the stiffness damping and mass matrices of the riser respectively x t x t and x t are the displacement velocity and acceleration responses respectively f t is the applied sea wave loading on the riser the rayleigh damping model is used in this study in this study the lognormal uncertainties in the structural parameters are considered in the stochastic response analysis and a multi scale stochastic analysis approach is proposed to improve the computational efficiency and keep the accuracy this is the main innovation of this paper which is extended based on a previous study ni et al 2018 the stochastic wave loading is given by morison equation koh et al 2018 zuo et al 2017 it should be noted that validations of numerical model and sea wave loading are not within the scope of this paper verifications of simulation results are presented by comparing the results from the proposed multi scale analysis method with those from mcs and sfem 3 2 hydrodynamic force the sea wave loading is modelled by the joint north sea wave observation project jonswap spectrum walden et al 1973 with morison equation veritas 2000 first the sea surface elevation is stochastically generated 20 s η η α g 2 2 π 4 f 5 exp 5 4 f m f 4 γ exp f f m 2 2 σ 2 f m 2 where γ and g are the peak enhancement factor and gravitational acceleration respectively the peak enhancement factor γ is usually given as 3 3 and f is the wave frequency in hz the other parameters in eq 20 are obtained as 21 α 0 076 v 10 2 0 22 22 f m 11 π v 10 f g 2 1 3 23 σ 0 07 f f m 0 09 f f m where f is the fetch length and v 10 is the mean wind velocity at 10 m above the sea surface after the sea surface elevation spectrum s ηη is obtained the sea surface elevation can be simulated in the time domain as 24 η t i 1 n 2 δ ω s η η ω i cos ω i t ϕ ω i where ϕ ω i is the random phase angle uniformly distributed over the range of 0 2π the transverse sea wave force per unit length of the riser can be estimated from morison equation veritas 2000 as 25 f t 1 2 ρ w a t e r c d v x v x π 4 ρ w a t e r c m d p 2 a x where c d and c m are the drag and inertia coefficients respectively ρ water is the sea water density and d p is the outer diameter of the riser the velocity v x and acceleration a x of water particles in the horizontal direction can be found in zuo et al 2017 which are not introduced in details for conciseness it is interesting to investigate the riser systems with different boundary conditions the effects of floating vessel motions geometric nonlinearity and more sophisticated riser models these factors play an important role in the uncertainty analysis the details of a riser model without the presence of a floating vessel are described and this model is taken as an example for the stochastic dynamic response analysis it should be noted that the main objective of this paper is to develop a multi scale stochastic dynamic analysis method and evaluate the effect of uncertainties in system parameters with lognormal distributions on the dynamic responses 3 3 representation of the system parameters the combination of kl and pc expansions is used to define the uncertain system parameters with lognormal distributions as discussed in section 2 2 in this study the material parameters such as mass density and young s modulus are represented as lognormal random fields the mass density ρ χ θ and young s modulus e χ θ can be approximated as 26 ρ ˆ χ θ i 1 0 m ρ ρ i 1 χ ψ i 1 ξ 27 e ˆ χ θ i 2 0 m e e i 2 χ ψ i 2 ξ substituting eq 26 into eq 19 the mass matrix of the stochastic system is written as 28 m θ i 1 0 m ρ m i 1 χ ψ i 1 ξ 29 m i 1 i 1 n e m i e i 1 n e n t ρ i 1 χ a n d l where n and a are the shape function and cross sectional area respectively similarly the stiffness matrix can be calculcated with 30 k θ i 2 0 m e k i 2 χ ψ i 2 ξ in this paper the rayleigh damping matrix is used the damping matrix considering the uncertainties is expressed as 31 c α m θ β k θ α i 1 0 m ρ ψ i 1 ξ m i 1 β i 2 0 m e ψ i 2 ξ k i 2 3 4 representation of responses a random dimension vector θ is used to represent the spatial temporal dimension the response vectors of the stochastic system are expressed as xiu and karniadakis 2003 32a x t θ x 1 t θ x 2 t θ x d o f t θ t 32b x t θ x 1 t θ x 2 t θ x d o f t θ t 32c x t θ x 1 t θ x 2 t θ x d o f t θ t where the subscript represents the dof number of the structure because the spatial correlation of nodal acceleration x t θ velocity x t θ and displacement x t θ are unknown the stochastic output responses can be represented by the pc expansions according to eq 3 with truncations xiu and karniadakis 2002 33a x t θ j 0 m t ψ j θ u j t 33b x t θ j 0 m t ψ j θ u j t 33c x t θ j 0 m t ψ j θ u j t where u j t is the vector of pc expansion coefficients of x t θ u j t and u j t are the first and second derivatives of the coefficient vector u j t respectively m t is the dimension of pc expansion which can be calculated as sudret and der kiureghian 2000 34 m t 1 k ρ k e p r k ρ k e p r where p r is the order of the pc expansion of the output responses k ρ and k e are the numbers of kl expansion terms for the mass density and young s modulus respectively substituting eqs 28 30 and 33 into eq 19 without considering the uncertainty in the damping matrix we have 35 i 1 0 m ρ ψ i 1 θ m i 1 j 0 m t ψ j θ u j t c j 0 m t ψ j θ u

borino and muscolino 1986 3 5 multi scale uncertainty quantification with model reduction when only the first several terms of kl expansion and a low order of pc expansion are used to represent the random input and outputs the matrix size in eq 39 will increase significantly it takes a long time to obtain the pc coefficients model reduction technique gains many attentions in recent years and

better model reduction results xia and lin 2004a in this study ior is employed to reduce the dimension of the stochastic dynamic system and therefore the computational demand only the essential pc expansion coefficients are preserved in the calculation multi scale uncertainty quantification can be achieved with model reduction technique as shown in fig 2 the nodes in a structure can be classified into three categories i e i very important ones for these nodes pc expansion with a high order will be used to represent the random output ii less important ones a low order pc expansion will be used and iii the least important ones the statistical responses of these least important nodes are not of interest and the corresponding coefficients of pc expansion can be eliminated these coefficients to be eliminated are defined as the slave dofs and the others with high and low orders are defined as the master dofs to apply model reduction technique in the stochastic response analysis with eq 40 k s and m s can be rewritten in a partitioned form as 41 k s k m m k m s k s m k s s m s m m m m m s m s m m s s where m and s denote the master and slave dofs respectively the computational steps can be summarized as follows step 1 initialization with t 0 t g k s s 1 k m s t t g i t g t k g t g t k t g and m d 0 t g t m t g step 2 obtain the transformation matrix t k i t k

of the reduced system the rayleigh damping is used for the stochastic system with a reduced dimension 46 c r α m r β k r the reduced stochastic system matrices i e m r k r and c r are used for the stochastic dynamic response analysis the pc expansion coefficients namely u r t u r t and u r t of the reduced system are calculated by using the mode superposition method borino and muscolino 1986 after the coefficients of pc expansion are obtained the mean value of nodal displacements mean u can be evaluated as 47 m e a n u u r 0 t the variance of nodal displacements var u is obtained as 48 v a r u j 1 p l u r j t 2 ψ j 2 θ or j 1 p h u r j t 2 ψ j 2 θ where p l and p h are the dimensions of low order and high order pc expansions respectively 4 numerical studies 4 1 beam model in this section numerical simulations on an offshore riser simulated by using euler beam elements will be conducted the details of the two dimensional finite element model are shown in fig 3 the marine riser has a length of 100 m and outer diameter of 0 1524 m the structure is simulated with 20 elements and each element has 2 node and 4 dofs totally there are 40 dofs for the numerical model the riser has a fixed end at the bottom and the free end at the top the vertical deformation caused by the floating vessel motions in waves is not considered in this study due to the large size of the stochastic system matrices and intensive computational requirement only the uncertainties in the structural material properties will be considered the mean values of flexural rigidity and the mass per unit length are 4 1010 nm2 and 15 kg m respectively which are assumed as two independent lognormal random variables in this example the spatial correlation is expressed by an exponential covariance function as 49 c cov z 1 z 2 σ g 2 e z 1 z 2 2 a 2 where σ g is the standard deviation of the gaussian random field the parameter a is the correlation length and the expression z 1 z 2 is the distance between two points of interest respectively when the designed lognormal distribution has a mean value of μ l and standard deviation of σ l the corresponding value for the gaussian distribution μ g and σ g are 50 σ g 2 ln σ l μ l 2 1 51 μ g ln μ l 1 2 σ g 2 the correlation length is in this study 50 m and 20 uncertainties in the flexural rigidity and mass density are considered to simulate the lognormal random field the first six terms of eigenvectors and eigenvalues as described in eq 11 are used and the designed lognormal distribution can be represented with eq 13 different orders of pc expansions is performed to evaluate accuracy of the lognormal random field the first second and third order of pc expansions are studied the probability density function pdf and cumulative distribution function cdf are then obtained fig 4 shows the statistical distribution properties of the flexural rigidity i e pdf and cdf comparing with their analytical values the results with different orders of pc expansions are shown and the comparison indicates that a higher order of pc expansion will obtain a better accuracy to represent the lognormal random input in the following studies the third order pc expansion is selected to simulate the lognormal distributions of uncertain system material properties i e flexural rigidity and mass density the simulated marine riser is subjected to sea wave loading with zero initial condition to simulate the sea wave loading with eq 25 the following parameters are used ρ water 1030 kg m3 c d 1 36 c m 2 v 10 15 m s f 20 000 f m 0 245 hz and d p 0 1524 m fig 5 shows the sea wave loading generated from the jonswap spectrum and morison equation the full current load is applied from z 100 to 70 m and the load reduces linearly from z 70 to the ocean floor z 0 the uncertainty in damping is also considered in this study rayleigh damping model is used and the coefficients are α 0 6263 and β 0 0003 respectively these two coefficients are obtained from the first two natural frequencies without considering the uncertainties in this study the responses under the sea wave loads are analyzed the vertical loading from the floating platform to the top end of the riser is not considered ssfem and mcs method are carried out to verify the accuracy of the proposed approach in the mcs method 50 000 simulations are conducted to obtain the reference statistical properties these calculations for uncertainty analysis take 16 h by using a computer of an i7 3770 cpu and 24 gb ram a convergence study is performed first to check the statistics with different numbers of simulations statistical results of the displacement response at the top in the horizontal direction are evaluated and shown in fig 6 these results verify that the statistics from 50 000 simulation runs is accurate enough and they can be taken as baseline for comparison in the subsequent studies the results from sfem with second and third order pc expansion will be discussed later in multiscale stochastic dynamic analysis the vibration responses are represented by using the third order pc expansion the responses of the rotational dofs are usually not important and of intereste in the response analysis these dofs are defined as no important and their pc coefficients are defined as the slave dofs the horizontal translations from nodes 1 10 are defined as less important dofs and low order pc expansions the 2nd order are used the horizontal translations of nodes 11 20 are defined as important ones and high order pc expansions are used this is shown in fig 7 since these dofs of the top part of the riser usually have larger responses they are therefore considered as the important ones the nodes in the bottom part of the riser are assumed as less important ones for the less important nodes only the pc coefficients in the first and second order terms are selected as the master dofs all the three order terms of pc coefficients of the important nodes are defined as the master dofs the calculated horizontal deformations at the top end of the riser from mcs sfem and the proposed approach are shown in fig 8 the mean values of these methods are almost the same as shown in fig 8 a and the variances are also in a very good agreement as shown in fig 8 b the horizontal deformation at the middle of the riser i e node 10 is represented by using the second order pc expansion the computational results from mcs sfem and the proposed approach are shown in fig 9 the accuarcy of the obtained response variances from the proposed approach is slightly better than that from sfem with the second order approximation it should be noted that in this case the sfem with the second order approximation is employed to have a fair comparsion with the proposed approach one possible reason is that the responses of some dofs with a higher improtance are approximated with the third order pc expansion which may improve the accuracy when the pc coefficients are obtained with the mode superposition method pdf and cdf of the horizontal deformation of the structure at the top and middle can be evaluated and shown in figs 10 and 11 the response statistics at the top of the riser obtained from the proposed approach and sfem with the third order pc expansion match well with those from mcs the predicted response statistics at the middle of the riser are not as good as those at the top of the riser this is because the truncation error associated with a lower order approximation with the second order pc expansion the computational time of sfem mcs and the proposed multiscale method are shown in table 1 respectively the matirx size of the dynamic system are 40 5460 3640 and 18 200 respectively for mcs the proposed multiscale analysis approach sfem with the second order pc expansion and sfem with the third order pc expansion respectively the required computation of time for each case is 12 h 2481s 171s and 4131s respectively these results show the proposed approach takes less computational time than mcs and sfem with third order pc expansion while has a good accuracy in pedicting the response statistics 4 2 hollow cylinder model a three dimensional riser model is selected in this study to investigate the accuracy and performance of the proposed multi scale stochastic analysis method the segment of the riser has a length of 4 m with an outer radius of 0 1 m the thickness of the riser is 5 mm the mean values of the mass density and young s modulus are 7850 kg m3 and 200 gpa respectively the numerical model of the riser is simulated with shell elements in matlab each element has 4 nodes and 24 dofs the mesh size is 0 5 m in the longitudinal direction while the cross section is discreted into 16 elements the finite element model of the riser has totally 128 elements and 864 dofs as shown in fig 12 the spatial correlation is described by a three dimensional exponential covariance kernel as 52 c cov x 1 y 1 z 1 x 2 y 2 z 2 σ 2 e x 1 x 2 2 l x 2 y 1 y 2 2 l y 2 z 1 z 2 2 l z 2 with the correlation lengths l x l y 0 05 m and l z 1 m uncertainties in the young s modulus is considered to understand the stochastic dynamic behavior of the structure 30 uncertainty level is considered in the young s modulus the lognormal random field is respresented by the first four eigenvalues and eigenvectors of kl expansion and the third order pc expansion the riser has a fixed end at the bottom the sea wave loading is applied on the structure with non uniform distribution in the y direction the loading is full applied from z 4 m 3 m and linearly decreases to zero from 3 m to the sea bottom the parameters in the sea wave loading are f 100 000 fetch length v 10 10 m s mean wind velocity at 10 m above the sea surface d p 0 2 m outer diameter of the structure the other parameters are the same as those described in section 4 1 the uncertainties in damping is also considered in this study the rayleigh damping is used with the coefficients of α 3 5969 and β 5 31 10 5 mcs and sfem are performed to obtain the reference values to verify the accuracy of the proposed multiscale analysis method the results from sfem with different orders of pc expansions are shown in fig 13 with those results from mcs the results from sfem with third order pc expansions matches well with those from mcs the results from sfem with first second order pc are slightly difference with those from mcs a higher order pc expansion leads to a better result table 2 shows the computational time of mcs and sfem it takes more than 160 h to obtain the response statistics with 50 000 runs for mcs because of the complexity of the used model it takes a less computational time for a lower order pc expansion in sfem as shown in table 2 however the accuracy in the response statistics are also reduced the proposed approach balances the required computational time due to a higher order pc expansion and maintains the accuracy by defining the master dofs with a high importance and interest the displacements along the y direction are represented with third order pc expansion while the displacements along the z direction are represented with first order pc expansion since the responses along the y direction are of more importance than the vertical dofs the deformation along the x direction is very small because the loads are applied in the y z plane these dofs along the x direction and all the rotational dofs are not of interest and important and therefore the corresponding pc coefficients of these dofs are selected as the slave ones the third order pc expansion is performed to obtain system matrices m s and k s and then ior method is used to eliminate the unwanted slave dofs to obtain m r and k r the stochastic dynamic analysis is then conducted and the response results are shown in figs 14 and 15 comparing with the results from sfem and mcs for the responses along the y direction the random output is represented with third order pc expansion the results of response statistics match well with those results from mcs and sfem with the third order pc expansion as shown in fig 14 the results from the low order pc expansion is shown in fig 15 the mean values of responses from mcs sfem with the first order and the proposed approach are almost the same while the variance is slightly different from those results from mcs but better than sfem with the first order pc expansion only fig 16 compares the obtained pdf of the displacement response with different methods those dofs with higher order expansions have a good accuracy matching well with the results from sfem and mcs for those dofs with lower order expansions there is some minor difference due to the errors associated with the low order pc expansions to represent the responses table 2 shows the matrix size and the computational time the computational time required for mcs is about 160 h however the proposed multi scale analysis method takes about 0 5 h the results show that the computational efficiency is significantly improved with the proposed method and the accuracy is the same as those from mcs 5 conclusions using gaussian random fields to simulate the uncertain system parameters has been studied however this assumption is not necessarily true and suitable to model all the material properties in this paper the uncertainties in the mass density and young s modulus are assumed having lognormal distributions which is different from previous works but more realistically modelled the lognormal random fileds are represented by a combination of kl and pc expansions a multi scale stochastic dyanmic analysis method is developed to evaluate the response statistics of marine risers considering the lognormal uncertainties in the material parameters the random outputs such as stochastic displacement are approximated with different orders of pc expansions high accuracy of uncertainty analysis results can be obtained for those responses approximated with a high order pc expansion responses at those dofs with less and least importances are represented with low order pc expansions to reduce the matix size of the stochastic dynamic system and the computational efforts therefore three categories of dofs are defined namely a important ones with high order pc expansions b less important ones with low order pc expansions and c the least important ones to be eliminated model reduction technique i e ior method is used to eliminate the slave pc coefficients and the multi scale stochastic dynamic response analysis is performed the response statistics are obtained from the pc coefficients directly and compared with those from mcs and sfem numerical studies on marine risers with lognormal uncertainties in material properties are conducted the results from the proposed method match well with those from mcs with significantly less computational time required the computational demand is significantly reduced with the model reduction technique however the accuracy of the stochastic response analysis results keeps the same acknowledgement the presented work was supported by national key r d program of china

mean value and variance can be obtained from the proposed method the results are compared with those from monte carlo simulation mcs and stochastic finite element method sfem results demonstrate that the computational demand for uncertainty evaluation is greatly reduced and the accuracy of the results is maintained keywords stochastic dynamic response analysis pc expansion kl expansion model reduction multi scale analysis 1 introduction performance based structural analysis and design are becoming a significant topic in civil engineering community structural performance assessment can more realistically be done in a probabilistic sense since uncertainties inevitably exist in the dimensions geometry material properties loading and the numerical modelling assumptions of structures haukaas and der kiureghian 2004 probabilistic structural analysis is receiving more attention in the last decades stefanou 2009 many approaches been proposed to simulate the random properties due to the uncertainties i e karhunen loeve kl expansion method huang et al 2001 orthogonal series expansions stefanou 2009 and optimal linear estimation method li and der kiureghian 1993 with the realized

polynomial chaos pc expansion xiu and karniadakis 2002 and the first order second moment method dolinski 1982 have also been developed to determine the stochastic characteristics of output with random input variables stochastic structural analysis has been widely performed in many engineering areas e g settlement analysis of a foundation sudret and der kiureghian 2000 reliability assessment of structures haldar and mahadevan 2000 and performance based earthquake engineering kiureghian and fujimura 2009 etc with the growing needs for the exploitation of oil and gas in the deeper water marine risers are pipe used in floating operations to convey drilling fluid and to guide tools between the drilling vessel and the wellhead at the ocean floor monitoring the conditions of marine risers is essential for the offshore industry since the failure of the risers may cause significant lost and catastrophic consequence with an increase in drilling operations in harsh environments the requirements and limits of marine risers have become more essential due to uncertainties involved in response prediction and prolonged drilling programs many research works have been done to investigate the dynamic behavior of marine risers i e vortex induced vibrations chen et al 2015 feng et al 2017 tsukada and morooka 2016 wu et al 2016 a detail review on the modelling and analysis techniques of flexible risers can be found in patel and seyed 1995 however most of existing studies are based on deterministic analyses which assumed that the system parameters were specific constant values uncertainty analysis of marine structures gains a significant amount of attention in recent years alibrandi and koh 2017 presented a study on stochastic dynamic analysis of a floating production system with the first order reliability method and secant hyperplane method the vessel model and marine riser were simplified as a 2 dof model the uncertainties of the output responses under random sea wave loading was evaluated he and low 2013 proposed a technique to predict the collision probability of risers the random inputs such as the drag coefficient current vessel motions and riser mass were considered yang and wang 2013 utilized the surrogate model to evaluate the influences of random variables on the stability of pipeline the uncertainties in the soil properties structural modelling and hydrodynamic loads were considered cabrera miranda and paik 2017 evaluated the probabilistic distribution of loads a metamodel was developed to predict the loads such as axial tension waves winds and currents ni et al 2018 performed the stochastic dynamic response analysis of marine risers considering gaussian system uncertainties model reduction was employed to reduce the dimension of the stochastic dynamical system and therefore the computational demand in the stochastic dynamic response analysis using gaussian random fields to simulate the uncertain system parameters has been widely studied in the above literatures however the assumption is not necessarily true and suitable to model all the material properties i e young s modulus and yielding strength etc in the soil structure system analysis the material constitutive parameters were assumed to follow the lognormal distribution barbato et al 2010 to study the uncertainty effect on the natural frequencies of a bridge the young s modulus of the bridge is considered having a lognormal distribution wan et al 2017 other research works on lognormal random inputs can be referred to barbato et al 2013 gupta and arun 2018 saydam and frangopol 2013 realizations of a gaussian random field with a large coefficient of variation may include negative outcomes which are physically meaningless from a practical point of view the lognormal random fields appear attractive in this sense because they are naturally positive valued sudret and der kiureghian 2000 the stochastic young s modulus and mass density are assumed having lognormal distributions represented with kl and pc expansions the statistics of parameters are defined based on the design information and literatures the stochastic output response is represented by using pc expansion the accuracy of uncertainty analysis depends on the order of pc expansion in this study the degrees of freedom dofs of the structure are classified into three categories namely important dofs which will be represented with high order pc expansions less important dofs with low order pc expansions and unimportant dofs being eliminated high order pc expansions will be used for dofs with high significance and interest iterated order reduced ior method xia and lin 2004b is employed to reduce the dimension of the stochastic system and reduce the computational demand those pc expansion coefficients associated with unimportant dofs are to be removed and the computational efficiency is improved numerical studies on a simplified riser model with beam elements and a cylinder riser model with shell elements are conducted the statistics of the responses of riser models obtained with the proposed approach are compared with those calculated from mcs and stochastic finite element method sfem results demonstrate that the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach are good by keeping the pc expansion coefficients associated with the main dofs based on the used ior model reduction technique 2 representation of lognormal random inputs 2 1 pc expansion pc expansion is an efficiency tool to model the stochastic processes the first research work on pc expansion was developed by wiener 1938 who used hermite polynomials and gaussian random variables to represent the stochastic processes xiu and karniadakis 2002 found that the optimal exponential convergence rate cannot be generated when the hermite polynomial is used to represent the non gaussian processes the theory of pc expansion is briefly reviewed in this section and is used to represent the random inputs and outputs later a random process α θ can be treated as a function of the random input variable θ with the following equation 1 α θ a 0 ψ 0 j 1 1 a j 1 ψ 1 ξ j 1 θ j 1 1 j 2 1 i 1 a j 1 j 2 ψ 2 ξ j 1 θ ξ j 2 θ j 1 1 j 2 1 j 1 j 3 1 j 2 a j 1 j 2 j 3 ψ 3 ξ j 1 θ ξ j 2 θ ξ j 3 θ where ψ p p 0 1 2 are the p th terms in the pc expansion and a j1 j2 j3 are deterministic coefficients to reduce the computational demand the expansion in eq 1 is truncated taking a two dimensional case for example the pc approximation can be expressed as 2 α θ a 0 ψ 0 a 1 ψ 1 ξ 1 a 2 ψ 1 ξ 2 a 11 ψ 2 ξ 1 ξ 1 a 21 ψ 2 ξ 1 ξ 2 a 22 ψ 2 ξ 2 ξ 2 a 111 ψ 3 ξ 1 ξ 1 ξ 1 a 211 ψ 3 ξ 2 ξ 1 ξ 1 a 221 ψ 3 ξ 2 ξ 2 ξ 1 a 222 ψ 3 ξ 2 ξ 2 ξ 2 a new polynomial functions ψ k is defined to replace ψ k with one to one correspondence eq 2 can be expressed in a matrix form as 3 α θ k 0 a ˆ k ψ k ξ θ where a ˆ k are the deterministic pc coefficients the two dimensional expansion as shown in eq 2 in this case can be expressed as 4 α θ a ˆ 0 ψ 0 a ˆ 1 ψ 1 a ˆ 2 ψ 2 a ˆ 3 ψ 3 a ˆ 4 ψ 4 a ˆ 5 ψ 5 the polynomials ψ k ξ θ are orthogonal and they satisfy the following relation 5 ψ k ξ θ ψ l ξ θ ψ k 2 ξ θ δ k l where δ kl is the kronecker delta the symbol is the inner product and the value of ψ k 2 can be calculated theoretically ghanem and spanos 2003 2 2 kl expansion of lognormal random fields kl expansion is combined with pc expansion to represent the lognormal random field of uncertainties in the material parameters h χ θ and h χ represent a second order random process and its mathematical expectation respectively c cov χ 1 χ 2 is the covariance matirx of h χ θ the covariance matrix c cov χ 1 χ 2 is bounded symmetric and positive definite which can be decomposed with the eigenvalues λ n and eigenvectors ϕ n χ as 6 c cov χ 1 χ 2 n 0 λ n ϕ n χ 1 ϕ n χ 2 the eigenvectors are orthogonal and satisfy following equation 7 v ϕ q χ ϕ n χ d χ δ q n where δ qn is the kronecker delta function therefore the eigenpairs λ n ϕ n χ can be calculated from the homogeneous fredholm integral equation as 8 v c cov χ 1 χ 2 ϕ n χ 2 d χ 2 λ n ϕ n χ 1 h χ θ can be expressed as 9 h χ θ h χ n 1 λ n ϕ n χ ξ n θ h σ χ θ where h χ is the mean value of h χ θ and ξ n θ is a set of uncorrelated standard gaussian variables moreover an explicit expression for ξ n θ can be obtained by multiplying h σ χ θ with ϕ n χ and integrating through the domain v as follows 10 ξ n θ 1 λ n v h σ χ θ ϕ n χ d χ using the first m th term eigenvalues and eigenvectors the random field h χ θ can be approximated as 11 h ˆ χ θ h χ n 1 m g n χ ξ n θ where g n χ is the deterministic function λ n ϕ n χ gathering the random variables ξ 1 θ ξ 2 θ ξ n θ into a n 1 vector ξ and g 1 χ g 2 χ g n χ into a n 1 vector g χ the lognormal random field can be approximated with h ˆ χ θ as sudret and der kiureghian 2000 12 l χ exp h ˆ χ θ exp h χ g χ t ξ using pc expansion eq 12 can be expressed as 13 l χ n 0 m l n χ ψ n ξ where m is the number of polynomial functions which depends on the number of kl expansion terms and the order of pc expansion p 14 m 1 m p m p and 15 l n χ e exp h ˆ χ θ ψ n e ψ n 2 ξ where e denotes the expectation since the first coefficient corresponds to ψ 0 1 we have 16 l 0 χ exp h χ 1 2 n 1 m g i χ 2 exp h χ 1 2 σ g 2 χ where σ g χ is the standard deviation of h ˆ χ θ the other ones can be expressed as 17 l

riser a marine riser is a long and flexible pipe which connects the sea floor with the offshore platform the dynamic response of the structure can be calculated by using the idealized beam model and the fourth order partial differential equations cabrera miranda and paik 2019 hong and shah 2018 teixeira and morooka 2017 18 e i z t 4 x z t z 4 t z t 2 x z t z 2 m z t 2 x z t t 2 c z t x z t t p z t f z t where e i z t t z t m z t c p z t f z t and z are the bending stiffness the tension force the mass per unit the drag coefficient the nonlinear restoring force the hydrodynamic force and the distance to the sea level respectively as shown in fig 1 the majority of the risers have a telescoping joint at the top which enables the riser to move freely in the vertical direction therefore the tension force t z t is not considered the nonlinear drag force p z t can be represented by the duffing model or polynomial types of nonlinearities li et al 2018 torres et al 2015 since the objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of uncertainties in the stochastic material properties on the lateral vibration response of the riser under the lateral sea wave loads the nonlinear drag force is also neglected when the finite element method is applied to study the dynamic behavior of marine risers spanos and chen 1980 eq 18 can be written as 19 m x t c x t k x t f t where k c and m denote the stiffness damping and mass matrices of the riser respectively x t x t and x t are the displacement velocity and acceleration responses respectively f t is the applied sea wave loading on the riser the rayleigh damping model is used in this study in this study the lognormal uncertainties in the structural parameters are considered in the stochastic response analysis and a multi scale stochastic analysis approach is proposed to improve the computational efficiency and keep the accuracy this is the main innovation of this paper which is extended based on a previous study ni et al 2018 the stochastic wave loading is given by morison equation koh et al 2018 zuo et al 2017 it should be noted that validations of numerical model and sea wave loading are not within the scope of this paper verifications of simulation results are presented by comparing the results from the proposed multi scale analysis method with those from mcs and sfem 3 2 hydrodynamic force the sea wave loading is modelled by the joint north sea wave observation project jonswap spectrum walden et al 1973 with morison equation veritas 2000 first the sea surface elevation is stochastically generated 20 s η η α g 2 2 π 4 f 5 exp 5 4 f m f 4 γ exp f f m 2 2 σ 2 f m 2 where γ and g are the peak enhancement factor and gravitational acceleration respectively the peak enhancement factor γ is usually given as 3 3 and f is the wave frequency in hz the other parameters in eq 20 are obtained as 21 α 0 076 v 10 2 0 22 22 f m 11 π v 10 f g 2 1 3 23 σ 0 07 f f m 0 09 f f m where f is the fetch length and v 10 is the mean wind velocity at 10 m above the sea surface after the sea surface elevation spectrum s ηη is obtained the sea surface elevation can be simulated in the time domain as 24 η t i 1 n 2 δ ω s η η ω i cos ω i t ϕ ω i where ϕ ω i is the random phase angle uniformly distributed over the range of 0 2π the transverse sea wave force per unit length of the riser can be estimated from morison equation veritas 2000 as 25 f t 1 2 ρ w a t e r c d v x v x π 4 ρ w a t e r c m d p 2 a x where c d and c m are the drag and inertia coefficients respectively ρ water is the sea water density and d p is the outer diameter of the riser the velocity v x and acceleration a x of water particles in the horizontal direction can be found in zuo et al 2017 which are not introduced in details for conciseness it is interesting to investigate the riser systems with different boundary conditions the effects of floating vessel motions geometric nonlinearity and more sophisticated riser models these factors play an important role in the uncertainty analysis the details of a riser model without the presence of a floating vessel are described and this model is taken as an example for the stochastic dynamic response analysis it should be noted that the main objective of this paper is to develop a multi scale stochastic dynamic analysis method and evaluate the effect of uncertainties in system parameters with lognormal distributions on the dynamic responses 3 3 representation of the system parameters the combination of kl and pc expansions is used to define the uncertain system parameters with lognormal distributions as discussed in section 2 2 in this study the material parameters such as mass density and young s modulus are represented as lognormal random fields the mass density ρ χ θ and young s modulus e χ θ can be approximated as 26 ρ ˆ χ θ i 1 0 m ρ ρ i 1 χ ψ i 1 ξ 27 e ˆ χ θ i 2 0 m e e i 2 χ ψ i 2 ξ substituting eq 26 into eq 19 the mass matrix of the stochastic system is written as 28 m θ i 1 0 m ρ m i 1 χ ψ i 1 ξ 29 m i 1 i 1 n e m i e i 1 n e n t ρ i 1 χ a n d l where n and a are the shape function and cross sectional area respectively similarly the stiffness matrix can be

borino and muscolino 1986 3 5 multi scale uncertainty quantification with model reduction when only the first several terms of kl expansion and a low order of pc expansion are used to represent the random input and outputs the matrix size in eq 39 will increase significantly it takes a long time to obtain the pc coefficients model reduction technique gains many attentions in recent years and many methods such as guyan method guyan 1965 iterated improved reduced system iirs technique friswell et al 1995 and ior method xia and lin 2004b have been developed model reduction methods have been successfully used in the areas of structural condition assessment li and law 2012 and sensitivity analysis weng et al 2017 it has been reported that ior method has a faster convergence ratio and better model reduction results xia and lin 2004a in this study ior is employed to reduce the dimension of the stochastic dynamic system and therefore the computational demand only the essential pc expansion coefficients are preserved in the calculation multi scale uncertainty quantification can be achieved with model reduction technique as shown in fig 2 the nodes in a structure can be classified into three categories i e i very important ones for these nodes pc expansion with a high order will be used to represent the random output ii less important ones a low order pc expansion will be used and iii the least important ones the statistical responses of these least important nodes are not of interest and the corresponding coefficients of pc expansion can be eliminated these coefficients to be eliminated are defined as the slave dofs and the others with high and low orders are defined as the master dofs to apply model reduction technique in the stochastic response analysis with eq 40 k s and m s can be rewritten in a partitioned form as 41 k s k m m k m s k s m k s s m s m m m m m s m s m m s s where m and s denote the master and slave dofs respectively the

of the reduced system the rayleigh damping is used for the stochastic system with a reduced dimension 46 c r α m r β k r the reduced stochastic system matrices i e m r k r and c r are used for the stochastic dynamic response analysis the pc expansion coefficients namely u r t u r t and u r t of the reduced system are calculated by using the mode superposition method borino and muscolino 1986 after the coefficients of pc expansion are obtained the mean value of nodal displacements mean u can be evaluated as 47 m e a n u u r 0 t the variance of nodal displacements var u is obtained as 48 v a r u j 1 p l u r j t 2 ψ j 2 θ or j 1 p h u r j t 2 ψ j 2 θ where p l and p h are the dimensions of low order and high order pc expansions respectively 4 numerical studies 4 1 beam model in this section numerical simulations on an offshore riser simulated by using euler beam elements will be conducted the details of the two dimensional finite element model are shown in fig 3 the marine riser has a length of 100 m and outer diameter of 0 1524 m the structure is simulated with 20 elements and each element has 2 node and 4 dofs totally there are 40 dofs for the numerical model the riser has a fixed end at the bottom and the free end at the top the vertical deformation caused by the floating vessel motions in waves is not considered in this study due to the large size of the stochastic system matrices and intensive computational requirement only the uncertainties in the structural material properties will be considered the mean values of flexural rigidity and the mass per unit length are 4 1010 nm2 and 15 kg m respectively which are assumed as two independent lognormal random variables in this example the spatial correlation is expressed by an exponential covariance function as 49 c cov z 1 z 2 σ g 2 e z 1 z 2 2 a 2 where σ g is the standard deviation of the gaussian random field the parameter a is the correlation length and the expression z 1 z 2 is the distance between two points of interest respectively when the designed lognormal distribution has a mean value of μ l and standard deviation of σ l the corresponding value for the gaussian distribution μ g and σ g are 50 σ g 2 ln σ l μ l 2 1 51 μ g ln μ l 1 2 σ g 2 the correlation length is in this study 50 m and 20 uncertainties in the flexural rigidity and mass density are considered to simulate the lognormal random field the first six terms of eigenvectors and eigenvalues as described in eq 11 are used and the designed lognormal distribution can be represented with eq 13 different orders of pc expansions is performed to evaluate accuracy of the lognormal random field the first second and third order of pc expansions are studied the probability density function pdf and cumulative distribution function cdf are then obtained fig 4 shows the statistical distribution properties of the flexural rigidity i e pdf and cdf comparing with their analytical values the results with different orders of pc expansions are shown and the comparison indicates that a higher order of pc expansion will obtain a better accuracy to represent the lognormal random input in the following studies the third order pc expansion is selected to simulate the lognormal distributions of uncertain system material properties i e flexural rigidity and mass density the simulated marine riser is subjected to sea wave loading with zero initial condition to simulate the sea wave loading with eq 25 the following parameters are used ρ water 1030 kg m3 c d 1 36 c m 2 v 10 15 m s f 20 000 f m 0 245 hz and d p 0 1524 m fig 5 shows the sea wave loading generated from the jonswap spectrum and morison equation the full current load is applied from z 100 to 70 m and the load reduces linearly from z 70 to the ocean floor z 0 the uncertainty in damping is also considered in this study rayleigh damping model is used and the coefficients are α 0 6263 and β 0 0003 respectively these two coefficients are obtained from the first two natural frequencies without considering the uncertainties in this study the responses under the sea wave loads are analyzed the vertical loading from the floating platform to the top end of the riser is not considered ssfem and mcs method are carried out to verify the accuracy of the proposed approach in the mcs method 50 000 simulations are conducted to obtain the reference statistical properties these calculations for uncertainty analysis take 16 h by using a computer of an i7 3770 cpu and 24 gb ram a convergence study is performed first to check the statistics with different numbers of simulations statistical results of the displacement response at the top in the horizontal direction are evaluated and shown in fig 6 these results verify that the statistics from 50 000 simulation runs is accurate enough and they can be taken as baseline for comparison in the subsequent studies the results from sfem with second and third order pc expansion will be discussed later in multiscale stochastic dynamic analysis the vibration responses are represented by using the third order pc expansion the responses of the rotational dofs are usually not important and of intereste in the response analysis these dofs are defined as no important and their pc coefficients are defined as the slave dofs the horizontal translations from nodes 1 10 are defined as less important dofs and low order pc expansions the 2nd order are used the horizontal translations of nodes 11 20 are defined as important ones and high order pc expansions are used this is shown in fig 7 since these dofs of the top part of the riser usually have larger responses they are therefore considered as the important ones the nodes in the bottom part of the riser are assumed as less important ones for the less important nodes only the pc coefficients in the first and second order terms are selected as the master dofs all the three order terms of pc coefficients of the important nodes are defined as the master dofs the calculated horizontal deformations at the top end of the riser from mcs sfem and the proposed approach are shown in fig 8 the mean values of these methods are almost the same as shown in fig 8 a and the variances are also in a very good agreement as shown in fig 8 b the horizontal deformation at the middle of the riser i e node 10 is represented by using the second order pc expansion the computational results from mcs sfem and the proposed approach are shown in fig 9 the accuarcy of the obtained response variances from the proposed approach is slightly better than that from sfem with the second order approximation it should be noted that in this case the sfem with the second order approximation is employed to have a fair comparsion with the proposed approach one possible reason is that the responses of some dofs with a higher improtance are approximated with the third order pc expansion which may improve the accuracy when the pc coefficients are obtained with the mode superposition method pdf and cdf of the horizontal deformation of the structure at the top and middle can be evaluated and shown in figs 10 and 11 the response statistics at the top of the riser obtained from the proposed approach and sfem with the third order pc expansion match well with those from mcs the predicted response statistics at the middle of the riser are not as good as those at the top of the riser this is because the truncation error associated with a lower order approximation with the second order pc expansion the computational time of sfem mcs and the proposed multiscale method are shown in table 1 respectively the matirx size of the dynamic system are 40 5460 3640 and 18 200 respectively for mcs the proposed multiscale analysis approach sfem with the second order pc expansion and sfem with the third order pc expansion respectively the required computation of time for each case is 12 h 2481s 171s and 4131s respectively these results show the proposed approach takes less computational time than mcs and sfem with third order pc expansion while has a good accuracy in pedicting the response statistics 4 2 hollow cylinder model a three dimensional riser model is selected in this study to investigate the accuracy and performance of the proposed multi scale stochastic analysis method the segment of the riser has a length of 4 m with an outer radius of 0 1 m the thickness of the riser is 5 mm the mean values of the mass density and young s modulus are 7850 kg m3 and 200 gpa respectively the numerical model of the riser is simulated with shell elements in matlab each element has 4 nodes and 24 dofs the mesh size is 0 5 m in the longitudinal direction while the cross section is discreted into 16 elements the finite element model of the riser has totally 128 elements and 864 dofs as shown in fig 12 the spatial correlation is described by a three dimensional exponential covariance kernel as 52 c cov x 1 y 1 z 1 x 2 y 2 z 2 σ 2 e x 1 x 2 2 l x 2 y 1 y 2 2 l y 2 z 1 z 2 2 l z 2 with the correlation lengths l x l y 0 05 m and l z 1 m uncertainties in the young s modulus is considered to understand the stochastic dynamic behavior of the structure 30 uncertainty level is considered in the young s modulus the lognormal random field is respresented by the first four eigenvalues and eigenvectors of kl expansion and the third order pc expansion the riser has a fixed end at the bottom the sea wave loading is applied on the structure with non uniform distribution in the y direction the loading is full applied from z 4 m 3 m and linearly decreases to zero from 3 m to the sea bottom the parameters in the sea wave loading are f 100 000 fetch length v 10 10 m s mean wind velocity at 10 m above the sea surface d p 0 2 m outer diameter of the structure the other parameters are the same as those described in section 4 1 the uncertainties in damping is also considered in this study the rayleigh damping is used with the coefficients of α 3 5969 and β 5 31 10 5 mcs and sfem are performed to obtain the reference values to verify the accuracy of the proposed multiscale analysis method the results from sfem with different orders of pc expansions are shown in fig 13 with those results from mcs the results from sfem with third order pc expansions matches well with those from mcs the results from sfem with first second order pc are slightly difference with those from mcs a higher order pc expansion leads to a better result table 2 shows the computational time of mcs and sfem it takes more than 160 h to obtain the response statistics with 50 000 runs for mcs because of the complexity of the used model it takes a less computational time for a lower order pc expansion in sfem as shown in table 2 however the accuracy in the response statistics are also reduced the proposed approach balances the required computational time due to a higher order pc expansion and maintains the accuracy by defining the master dofs with a high importance and interest the displacements along the y direction are represented with third order pc expansion while the displacements along the z direction are represented with first order pc expansion since the responses along the y direction are of more importance than the vertical dofs the deformation along the x direction is very small because the loads are applied in the y z plane these dofs along the x direction and all the rotational dofs are not of interest and important and therefore the corresponding pc coefficients of these dofs are selected as the slave ones the third order pc expansion is performed to obtain system matrices m s and k s and then ior method is used to eliminate the unwanted slave dofs to obtain m r and k r the stochastic dynamic analysis is then conducted and the response results are shown in figs 14 and 15 comparing with the results from sfem and mcs for the responses along the y direction the random output is represented with third order pc expansion the results of response statistics match well with those results from mcs and sfem with the third order pc expansion as shown in fig 14 the results from the low order pc expansion is shown in fig 15 the mean values of responses from mcs sfem with the first order and the proposed approach are almost the same while the variance is slightly different from those results from mcs but better than sfem with the first order pc expansion only fig 16 compares the obtained pdf of the displacement response with different methods those dofs with higher order expansions have a good accuracy matching well with the results from sfem and mcs for those dofs with lower order expansions there is some minor difference due to the errors associated with the low order pc expansions to represent the responses table 2 shows the matrix size and the computational time the computational time required for mcs is about 160 h however the proposed multi scale analysis method takes about 0 5 h the results show that the computational efficiency is significantly improved with the proposed method and the accuracy is the same as those from mcs 5 conclusions using gaussian random fields to simulate the uncertain system parameters has been studied however this assumption is not necessarily true and suitable to model all the material properties in this paper the uncertainties in the mass density and young s modulus are assumed having lognormal distributions which is different from previous works but more realistically modelled the lognormal random fileds are represented by a combination of kl and pc expansions a multi scale stochastic dyanmic analysis method is developed to evaluate the response statistics of marine risers considering the lognormal uncertainties in the material parameters the random outputs such as stochastic displacement are approximated with different orders of pc expansions high accuracy of uncertainty analysis results can be obtained for those responses approximated with a high order pc expansion responses at those dofs with less and least importances are represented with low order pc expansions to reduce the matix size of the stochastic dynamic system and the computational efforts therefore three categories of dofs are defined namely a important ones with high order pc expansions b less important ones with low order pc expansions and c the least important ones to be eliminated model reduction technique i e ior method is used to eliminate the slave pc coefficients and the multi scale stochastic dynamic response analysis is performed the response statistics are obtained from the pc coefficients directly and compared with those from mcs and sfem numerical studies on marine risers with lognormal uncertainties in material properties are conducted the results from the proposed method match well with those from mcs with significantly less computational time required the computational demand is significantly reduced with the model reduction technique however the accuracy of the stochastic response analysis results keeps the same acknowledgement the presented work was supported by national key r d program of china
