11605,the rapid decline of groundwater table is threatening sustainable irrigation agricultural development in the north china plain ncp optimized irrigation scheduling and water saving irrigation technologies need to be developed to reduce irrigation water use and maintain the grain production potential for the region this study was conducted at luancheng experimental station in the ncp during 2012 2015 to evaluate the effects of different irrigation methods basin irrigation bi tube sprinkler irrigation si pillow irrigation pi and drip irrigation di with various irrigation amount frequency on yield economic returns and water use efficiency wue of winter wheat under the same limited irrigation amount 90mm season two irrigation applications 45mm application conducted using di significantly increased the yield and wue as compared with the bi using one single application increasing the seasonal irrigation amount to 160mm the increase in the application frequency by reducing the irrigation amount per application didn t significantly affect the yield using either pi or si results showed that soil water depletion swd contributed 40 60 of the seasonal evapotranspiration et under limited water supply the smaller root length density rld in deep layers of the soil restricted the soil water uptake by the crop therefore increasing irrigation frequency would maintain the top soil layers with higher soil water contents where rld was greater that improved crop water use and yield under limited water supply however when irrigation water was plentiful micro irrigation methods did not increase yields due to the high cost in installation of the three micro irrigation systems their net income was reduced by 30 as compared with the bi method the economic water productivity ratio ewpr was only 3 4 for the three micro irrigation systems much less than the basin irrigation method which had an average value of 16 currently the basin irrigation method is more economic for growing winter wheat in the ncp keywords water use efficiency irrigation frequency basin irrigation tube sprinkler irrigation pillow irrigation drip irrigation 1 introduction winter wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the main crops in the north china plain ncp it accounts for more than half of all winter wheat production in china sun et al 2006 the rainfall during the growing season was about 60 150mm however the consumptive water use by wheat is about 430 470mm in order to obtain higher grain yield supplemental irrigation is essential zhang et al 2003 sun et al 2011 farmers in this region generally irrigate winter wheat three or four times each season zhang et al 2017 consequently the groundwater table are dropping at an average rate of about 1 1 5m year due to over pumping chen et al 2010 which is threatening the sustainable development of irrigation agriculture in this region to cope with the shortage of irrigation water resources suitable irrigation strategies and water saving irrigation technologies need to be produced deficit irrigation defined as the application of water below full crop water requirements fereres and soriano 2007 has been promoted in many countries in an attempt to minimize irrigation water use fereres and soriano 2007 tari 2016 peake et al 2016 reported that deficit irrigation has greater economic water productivity under water limited conditions this irrigation strategies could increase water productivity in the ranges of 10 50 jensen et al 2014 large soil water holding capacity high soil water contents at sowing and deep root system were important factors for the application of deficit irrigation stockle and james 1989 lobell and ortiz monasterio 2006 peake et al 2008 peake et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 reported that a single irrigation at jointing stage could reduce irrigation water use by 120 140mm as compared with full irrigation treatment with yield penalties of 14 for winter wheat in the ncp ali et al 2007 showed that deficit irrigation saved 135mm water but with 16 yield decrease as compared with the full water supply treatment of wheat in bangladesh the yield decrease of spring wheat under reduced irrigation was mainly related to climatic conditions soil properties and timing of irrigation lobell and ortiz monasterio 2006 optimizing the irrigation strategies is another aspect to efficiently utilize the limited irrigation water rodrigues and pereira 2009 some studies indicated that frequent application of water in small quantities can increase water use efficiency wue e g enciso et al 2003 rawlins 1973 suggested that the water holding capacity of the soil become less important with the increase in irrigation frequency other studies have shown that increasing irrigation frequencies with small quantities per application could maintain higher grain yield of maize zea mays l with a reduction in yield observed with decreasing irrigation frequency in loess plateau of northwest china wang et al 2014 bian et al 2016 indicated that 60mm of water applied at jointing and heading stages for winter wheat achieved higher grain yield than a single application of 120mm at jointing stage sezen et al 2006 showed that irrigation intervals of 3 6days 18 22mm obtained higher wue irrigation water use efficiency iwue and grain yield of bell pepper at a arikli silty clay loam soil conditions muhumed et al 2014 reported that above ground biomass and yield components of sweet corn increased with the increase in irrigation frequency unfortunately traditional irrigation methods such as flooding irrigation may not easily control the irrigation amount per application e g sezen et al 2006 and alternate irrigation methods might be required to improve the iwue for field grown crops such as winter wheat micro irrigation can precisely control the irrigation application and are popular in orchards vegetable growing and wide row planted crops e g pereira et al 2012 bhunia et al 2015 gerçek et al 2017 drip irrigation is one of the major micro irrigation methods allowing accurate application of irrigation in small amount directly to the root zone bhunia et al 2015 increasing the frequencies by drip irrigation could maintain a high soil matric potential in the root rhizosphere accelerating crop growth decreasing deep percolation reducing soil evaporation and saving irrigation water qin et al 2016 jensen et al 2014 jensen et al 2014 reported that drip irrigation can reduce the loss of irrigation water in conveyance and saved 30 40 water compared to basin irrigation muhumed et al 2014 indicated that above ground biomass and yield components of sweet corn were increased with the increase in drip irrigation frequency other irrigation methods such as pillow irrigation and tube sprinkler irrigation are also being used in growing crops pillow irrigation which uses plastic tubes with holes on the tubes and the tubes are placed between two rows of the crop can directly deliver water to the crop the diameters of tubes are varied based on plant row spacing and the tube after irrigation can cover the row spacing as mulch material plastic tube was pierced with holes of 1 mm diameter hole spacing varies between 50 and 100cm depending on crop species ek et al 2009a 2017 pillow irrigation has the benefits of plastic mulching and drip irrigation this method can also restrict weed growth and improve grain yield as well as wue of hot pepper under limited water supply gerçek et al 2009b for the application of the micro sprinkler irrigation to the densely planted crops such as winter wheat a modified micro sprinkler irrigation is becoming popular in china this method uses a thin tube placed on the soil surface with holes on it pressurized water will come out from the holes acting as sprinkler liu and kang 2006 reported that the air temperature and vapor pressure deficit of winter wheat in sprinkler irrigated treatment was lower than that under surface irrigation treatment in ncp however due to the higher cost in installation and maintenance those micro irrigation systems are not widely used on the cereal crops in the ncp currently micro irrigations can save water as compared with flood irrigation due to the reduction in water loss from evaporation deep percolation as well as during water delivery namara et al 2007 maisiri et al 2005 with the increase in irrigation water shortage water saving irrigation methods would become more important in future however their wide use in crops is still limited due to the high investment and maintenance cost of the irrigation system and the lower economic returns of the crops paredes et al 2014 hanson et al 1997 suggested that savings from reduced water costs of lettuce were not enough to offset the equipment costs of drip irrigation system dağdelen et al 2009 indicated that drip irrigation method saved 177mm water but lead to 34 0 reduction in the net income of cotton however namara et al 2007 found that micro irrigation technologies can increase economic returns of banana and peanut when compared to flood irrigation in india selection of a suitable irrigation method would depend on the specific conditions of water resources crop types and management requirements therefore the objectives of this research are as follows 1 to assess the performance of basin irrigation tube sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation and pillow irrigation methods on grain yield and wue of winter wheat and 2 to evaluate the economic benefits of different irrigation methods 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and the growing condition of the crop the experiment was conducted during 2012 2013 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 three growing seasons of winter wheat at luancheng experimental station 37 53 n 114 40 n elevation 50m in the north china plain ncp winter wheat grown from october to earlier june and summer maize grown from earlier june to the end of september form the annual double cropping system the mean annual precipitation is 473mm with around 30 of the precipitation falling during the winter wheat season the soil is loam with average field capacity at 36 v v and wilting point at 13 v v for the top 2m of the soil profile the groundwater table was 40m below soil surface and the soil and irrigation water have no salinity problems soil nutrient contents were 18g kg for organic matter 80mg kg for available n 110mg kg for available k and 15mg kg for available p for the top tillage layer detailed soil physical characteristics at the experimental site can be found in zhang et al 2016 winter wheat was sown in october after maize was harvested and the maize straw was chopped and incorporated into the top soil layer the same winter wheat cultivar kn199 was used for the three seasons winter wheat was planted following the local practice with four rows closely together and between two four close rows there was a wide row spacing of 30cm the four close rows had row spacing around 12cm the four rows took 0 6cm width averagely seeding rate was 300 viable seeds m2 and sowing was done with a seeding machine before planting diammonium phosphate dap at 300kg ha urea at 150kg ha and potassium chloride at 150kg ha were broadcast and incorporated into the soil an additional 225kg ha of urea was top dressed at jointing stage in early april either with an irrigation or with an rainfall event the fertilizer amount followed the local practices 2 2 treatments for irrigation methods and irrigation amounts four irrigation methods basin irrigation bi tube sprinkler irrigation si drip irrigation di and pillow irrigation pi were tested bi is the local irrigation method widely used by the local farmers the study for the bi was included in a long term irrigation scheduling study which included six irrigation treatments zhang et al 2008 for this study the irrigation treatments of no irrigation one irrigation application and two irrigations were used each treatment had four plots with area of 4 9m2 plot all the plots were boarded to form a basin for flooding irrigation fig 1 the irrigation was conducted by connecting a plastic tube with the low pressure water transportation pipeline and a flow meter was connected with the outlet from the pipeline to record the water used for each plot another piece of land next to the basin site was divided into three parts for si di and pi study fig 1 the soil conditions of this land were the same as that with the bi each part had an area of 16m in width and 40m in length the drip lines were arranged at 60cm apart and it was placed on the middle of the four close rows the drip irrigation system had a dripping rate of 2l h for each emitter and working pressure of 0 6mpa the pipes for tube sprinkler was set at 1 2m apart in the field and placed on the middle of a wide row the tube had a diameter of 4cm and a working pressure of 1 1kpa s the pillow irrigation was using the plastic pipes with diameter of 20cm and holes on the pipes the pipes were placed on each wide row when the pipes were filled with water the water would directly infiltrate into the soil through the holes on the pipes a plastic tube which had outlets connected with the pipes low pressure water transportation system delivered the water to the pipes and a switch was installed at each outlet to control the water supply to each pipe line after irrigation the pipes could act as plastic mulch to prevent soil evaporation the irrigation water was from underground the di and si were installed with a pressurization system to control the pressure required for individual system for the three seasons the treatments of bi was fixed as the following no irrigation b 0 one irrigation application at jointing stage b 90 total amount of 90mm and two irrigations at jointing and anthesis stages b 160 total amount of 160mm with 90mm at jointing and 70mm at anthesis the other three methods had similar irrigation amount but different irrigation frequency to be compared with the bi on the effects of yield and wue of winter wheat for the three seasons the detailed irrigation arrangement was listed in table 1 di had similar seasonal irrigation amount as with b 90 but with increased irrigation frequency to examine the irrigation amount application and irrigation frequency on the effects of winter wheat in 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 season the pi and si had similar irrigation amount as with b 160 but with increased irrigation efficiency to examine the effects of increased irrigation efficiency on the performance of winter wheat under relative sufficient water supply in 2014 2015 pi and si had the same treatments as with the di to compare the performance of the three irrigation methods the setting up of the irrigation scheduling of the basin irrigation method was following zhang et al 2008 at the same site their results indicated a single irrigation at jointing stage as the optimized irrigation scheduling under limited water supply and two irrigations at jointing and anthesis as the normal irrigation scheduling treatment that produced good yield under moderate water supply condition using bi 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 weather conditions the daily weather conditions including sunshine duration air temperature relative humidity wind speed radiation and rainfall were recorded from a weather station about 50m away from the experimental site daily reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated with the crop water program developed by fao using penman monteith equation which represents the concept of grass reference evapotranspiration albedo 0 23 height 0 12m surface resistance 70s m allen et al 1998 the et0 was used to compare the atmospheric evaporation potential of the three seasons 2 3 2 soil water content soil water contents was monitored in each treatment with four sites using a neutron probe 503 dr cpn international inc usa for each 20cm soil layer down to 2mcm every 10days during the winter wheat growing season soil water contents at the top 20cm layer were monitored by gravity method the neutron probe was calibrated using the data obtained at the same site for different soil layers 2 3 3 root distribution and soil evaporation measuring after winter dormancy in the 2012 2013 season daily soil evaporation rate for di b 90 and b 160 was measured using micro lysimeter as described by liu et al 2002 four micro lysimeters were placed on the wider row spacing for each treatment the micro lysimeters contained small isolated volumes of soil mounted flush with or slightly above the soil surface and were weighed daily to determine water loss using electronic balances with 0 001kg precision the diameter of the micro lysimeter was 12cm with a depth of 20cm in order to keep the soil moisture in micro lysimeters similar to that outside of the cylinder the original soil in the instruments was changed every two or three days by pressing the cylinder into the soil and extracting it the bottom of the cylinder was sealed with water proof tape roots were sampled in the 2013 2014 season for the basin irrigation at maturity of winter wheat under b 0 b 90 and b 160 four sites for each treatment down to 150cm at 10cm increments were sampled the diameter of the corer was at 10cm the cores were washed to obtain the roots and root length was measured based on the line intersect method tennant 1975 the root length density rld at different depths was calculated by dividing the root length by the sampled soil volume cm cm3 2 3 4 grain yield yield components at maturity four sites were randomly selected from each treatment for yield measuring the size of each site was around 10m2 and the plants were all harvested before harvesting spike density was measured and eighty plants from each site were randomly selected cut at the base and air dried to a constant weight to measure the seed numbers per spike and seed weight for deciding yield components and harvest index hi after harvesting all plants were manually threshed with a thresher grains were air dried to a constant moisture and the weightwas recorded to obtain the final grain yield 13 water contents 2 3 5 seasonal crop water use water use efficiency the seasonal water use of winter wheat under different irrigation methods defined as seasonal evapotranspiration et was calculated based on the water balance equation zhang et al 2008 1 et p i swd r d cr where et was seasonal evapotranspiration mm p was precipitation mm i was irrigation mm swd was soil water depletion for 2m soil depth mm r was surface runoff mm d was drainage from the root zone mm and cr was capillary rise to the root zone mm surface runoff drainage and capillary rise to the root zone were taken as zero due to the less rainfall small irrigation amount and the deep groundwater table 40m below soil surface wue was calculated by the following equation 2 wue y et where wue was water use efficiency kg m3 y was grain yield kg ha 2 4 economic analysis economic analysis was conducted by deciding the total cost for different irrigation methods and gross income for grain production the total cost from different irrigation systems included the costs in buying the irrigation equipment labor input and the electricity used during the irrigation the life span of di si and pi was based on the quality of the pipelines used for this study the emitter lines for drip used the renewable ones and renewd each year the life span for the si and pi systems was set at 3 years seed costs and fertilizer input were included in the analysis based on the market price the cost related to different irrigation methods were presented in table 2 gross income was the value of grain production based on the local current market price of winter wheat it was 2 20yuan kg 1 usa dollar 6 8yuan net income for each irrigation method was computed by subtracting the total cost from gross income labor costs in irrigation and installation of the irrigation systems used the price of 100 yuan day economic water productivity ratio ewpr was calculated as grain yield value divided by irrigation farm cost paredes et al 2014 here the irrigation farm cost only included the cost of the irrigation systems and the cost of conducting the irrigation the costs in other management practices were not included for calculating ewpr 2 5 statistical analysis two way anova was used to compare the differences in grain yield wue and economic outcomes and ewprs among the irrigation methods and irrigation frequency under the same season difference between mean values of irrigation treatments were studied using test for least significant difference at a 0 05 significance level 3 results 3 1 weather conditions during 2012 2015 growing seasons fig 2 shows the accumulated et0 sunshine hours temperature 0 c and rainfall for the three seasons as compared with the long term average there was large variation among the weather factors during the three seasons the seasonal et0 during 2012 2015 was 509 552 581mm much higher than the long term average of 495mm the long term average for sunshine hours was 1295 total sunshine hours during 2012 2015 seasons was 1073 1259 1416h compared with the long term average the sunshine conditions in 2014 2015 season was quite good however it was very poor in 2012 2013 season especially during the grainfill stage among the three seasons the accumulated temperature was lower in 2012 2013 the seasonal rainfall during 2012 2015 seasons was 122 48 77mm respectively compared with the long term average rainfall of 122mm 2012 2013 was a relatively normal season while the other two seasons were very dry especially during 2013 2014 the large difference in atmospheric evaporation demand and seasonal rainfall demonstrated the importance of supplemental irrigation to winter wheat 3 2 soil water changes under different irrigation treatments taking the dry season of 2013 2014 under bi as an example due to the low rainfall and the large water requirements for winter wheat in the ncp soil water declined throughout the whole growing season especially for the treatment without irrigation fig 3 from sowing to the end of winter dormancy the water use for winter wheat was small and had only a slight declining trend as crop growth accelerated after dormancy and the increase in atmospheric evaporation potential a rapid decline in soil water content was observed soil water reserves were also depleted even when 90 or 160mm of irrigation was applied water application around anthesis stage for b 160 treatment slightly reduced the declining trend but due to the lower soil water contents at the irrigation the replenishment to the soil water was not apparent fig 3 the results showed that soil water stored before sowing played an important role to supply the water requirements of winter wheat under the growing condition of ncp soil water depletion swd contributed greatly to the seasonal et under limited water supply fig 4 indicates the large change in soil water contents for the 0 2m soil profile at sowing with that at harvesting for three irrigation treatments swd was 215 2 244 9 0 and 223 9mm under b 0 b 90 and b 160 in the dry season of 2013 2014 the soil water uptake was gradually reduced with the increase in soil depth especially down below 150cm where rld was small fig 5 the low rld in the deep soil layers restricted the fully soil water uptake by the crop the results also showed that swd under b 90 was greater than b 0 which was possibly related to the increased growth in root and shoot under b 90 than that b 0 the total root length and above ground biomass of b 90 were 22 7 and 32 2 greater than that of b 0 respectively the increased growth both in roots and shoots increased the water requirements and the ability in utilizing soil water the decreased swd for b 160 as compared with b 90 had been related to the increase in irrigation amount for b 160 treatment the increased irrigation frequency under the three micro irrigation systems improved the soil water conditions at the top soil layer especially during the grainfill stage the soil water storage for the top 1m soil profile was averagely 20mm greater under two irrigation applications using micro irrigation methods than that b 90 around 10days after anthesis therefore the more soil stored in the top 1m soil layer under the increased irrigation frequency would have the benefits to increase the soil water availability to the crop during the later growth stages of the crop 3 3 crop water use yield and wue under different irrigation treatments crop water use et was listed in table 3 for different irrigation treatments across the 2012 2015 seasons water use and the yield of the crop were affected not only by the irrigation management but also by the seasonal weather conditions and stored soil water the lower et0 in 2012 2013 season resulted in the lower et for the irrigated treatments as compared with that in 2013 2014 season although rainfall in 2013 2014 season was small the relative higher soil water contents at sowing contributed greatly to the et due to the dry summer before planting winter wheat in 2014 2015 season the contribution of swd to et was reduced under rainfed condition as compared with other seasons on average swd contributed 60 80 of the seasonal et for the rainfed treatment 40 60 under limited irrigation and 20 50 under increased water supply condition et was increased with the increase in irrigation amount and the contribution of the soil water stored before sowing was reduced grain yield was affected by different irrigation management and the seasonal weather conditions the highest yield was achieved in the 2013 2014 season which was related to the good soil water condition at sowing and favorable growing conditions higher sunshine hours and warm temperatures the reduced yield in 2012 2013 season was probably related to the lower sunshine duration and lower temperature although the rainfall was the largest among the three seasons table 3 indicates the large increase in yield from no irrigation to one irrigation applications yield was increased by 24 7 31 3 and 80 4 from b 0 to b 90 in the three seasons respectively the largest increase from b 0 to b 90 in 2014 2015 season was related to the lower soil water contents at sowing and plentiful rainfall was received in the later growing stages of the crop the rain fed treatment was significantly affected by the water shortage through the whole season thus the grain production was significantly reduced the yield increase was 18 1 16 8 and 18 7 from b 90 to b 160 for the three seasons respectively with the same amount of irrigation at 90mm drip irrigation increased grain yield of by 12 0 12 9 and 11 6 as compared with the basin irrigation method b 90 for the three seasons respectively the increase in wue was 18 1 19 6 and 21 9 respectively for the three seasons the results indicated that increasing the irrigation frequency using drip irrigation under limited water supply significantly improved the crop performance both in yield and wue when total irrigation volume was the same comparing the performance of b 160 and di both having irrigation frequency of twice but differed in total irrigation volume irrigation volume of di being 46 lower than that of b 160 yield of di was only 5 2 3 3 and 6 0 lower than that of b 160 during 2012 2015 seasons respectively with large reduction in irrigation water use yield was less affected by using the drip irrigation method the wue under di was 12 1 15 8 and 22 4 greater than that b 160 for the three seasons respectively further increasing in irrigation frequency under increased irrigation amount didn t significantly increase the yield of winter wheat in 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 seasons table 3 shows there was no significant difference among the yield of b 160 pi and si only with slight increase in wue under pi comparing the three irrigation methods under the same irrigation amount of 90mm in 2014 2015 yield increase was 11 6 10 9 and 6 4 under di pi and si respectively as compared with b 90 the increasing in irrigation frequency from one to two times using the three methods all improved the performance of winter wheat wue was increased by 21 7 10 2 and 3 8 under the three methods respectively as compared with b 90 the increase in wue and yield under di and pi were greater than that under si indicating the water evaporation during the irrigation and immediately after the irrigation might reduce the water availability to crops using the tube sprinkler system 3 4 factors related to the improved yield and wue the results from table 3 indicated that under limited water supply 90mm increasing the irrigation frequency from one to two times using di pi and si improved yield and wue the improvement was greater under di and pi than that under si especially for the wue the increase in yield was associated with the improved seed weight under di no significant difference in kernel numbers existed between di and b 90 during 2012 2015 seasons the increased irrigation frequency improved the soil water contents during the grainfill stage for the top 1m soil profile which favored the seed formation therefore seed weight and harvest index were all increased under di as compared with b 90 for the three seasons fig 6 the average increase in seed weight was 12 9 and 7 4 for hi during the three seasons the higher hi was usually related to a higher wue the results also showed that the seed weight in 2012 2013 season was much lower than that in the other two seasons due to the lower sunshine duration during the grainfill stage in 2012 2013 the reduced seed weight was the major reason of the lower yield in that season the improved yield and wue under di than that of bi and si under limited irrigation supply was associated with reduced soil evaporation the drip lines were placed on crop rows such that inter row spaces were not wetted during the irrigation which reduced the soil evaporation therefore more soil water was conserved and used for the crop growth which benefited the grain production under water deficit condition the measuring of soil evaporation using mico lysimter in 2012 2013 season showed that the accumulated soil evaporation was 47 5mm under b 90 65 1mm under b 160 from recovery to maturity in 2012 2013 season under di the accumulated soil evaporation was 37 2mm during the same period soil evaporation was reduced by 10mm under di as compared with b 90 and 27 9mm as compared with b 160 although b 160 had 70mm more irrigation water applied than that of di the yield increase was smaller due to the higher soil evaporation consumption under b 160 than that of di the wue improvement under si was much smaller than that of di and pi it was related to the larger soil evaporation under si the accumulated soil evaporation was 78 0mm under si for the same period soil evaporation was the highest under si than that under other irrigation methods si has the advantage to increase irrigation frequency under limited irrigation application but the increased soil evaporation somehow reduced this benefit 3 5 economic evaluation table 4 lists the gross income irrigation cost and other costs for growing winter wheat across the 2012 2015 seasons the results showed that basin irrigation produced the highest net income and the increased irrigation amount also improved the farm income table 4 shows that the increase in total irrigation amount from 90 to 160mm increased net income by 28 4 23 3 and 28 1 during the three seasons respectively but the largest increase in net income was from no irrigation to b 90 which was 30 8 40 8 and 197 4 for the three seasons respectively the results indicated the irrigation application significantly increased the net income of growing winter wheat in the ncp but due to the higher costs the three micro irrigation systems all produced lower net income as compared with the basin irrigation method the increase in yield by the micro irrigation systems could not compensate the increased costs in installation of the irrigation systems however as compared with the rain fed treatment the micro irrigation systems produced higher net income indicating even with expensive irrigation cost the increase in yield by any irrigation method could offset the increased costs in irrigation system installation which further indicated the importance of supplemental irrigation to winter wheat production in the ncp due to the relative lower cost in installation of si the net income using si was slightly greater than that of di and pi di outperformed pi in net income ewpr of bi was around four times greater than that the three micro irrigation systems indicating bi being more economic for winter wheat irrigation under the current condition of ncp currently the price of irrigation water use only includes the electricity cost in the ncp for the underground water pumping with the increased water shortage and the control in groundwater use cost in using water might be increased in the future the results showed that when the water price went to 3 5yuan m3 the net income of rain fed wheat would outperform the irrigated winter wheat the water price from the south north water transfer project was 5yuan m3 in the ncp thus the profit from using the transferred water for grown crops would be negative therefore it is important to improve the wue to increase grain production under limited water supply by agronomic breeding and irrigation methods 4 discussion results from this study indicated the importance of supplemental irrigation to the increase in grain production of winter wheat in the ncp with one irrigation application the yield of winter wheat was increased by 24 80 additional irrigation further increased yield by 18 further increase in irrigation application didn t significantly increase crop production using flooding irrigation method zhang et al 2008 2017 many studies indicated that two irrigations for winter wheat was the optimized irrigation scheduling in terms of irrigation water saving and irrigation efficiency in the ncp the results from this study also showed that different irrigation methods combined with different irrigation frequency affected both the grain production and wue under the same seasonal irrigation amount regulated deficit irrigation scheduling has been applied to relieve the irrigation water shortage problems around the world peake et al 2016 jensen et al 2014 under limited irrigation adopting irrigation methods to increase irrigation efficience and crop production are very important some studies indicated that frequent application of water in small quantities can provide appropriate water for crop growth and increase yield and wue enciso et al 2003 qin et al 2016 bian et al 2016 sezen et al 2006 however the small quantities per application may not be easily implemented using flooding irrigation method the micro irrigation systems provided the opportunity to precisely manage the limited irrigation water the results from this study indicated that using drip irrigation to double the irrigation application numbers improved yield by 12 and wue by 20 as compared with the one irrigation application using the flooding irrigation method the improvement in grain yield was related to the increased top soil water contents during the grainfill stage which significantly increased the seed weight and harvest index the increase in wue was related both to the reduced soil evaporation and improved grain yield previous study had shown that frequent irrigation could maintain a higher average water filled pore space in the upper soil layer as compared with the lower frequency scheduling wang et al 2006 abalos et al 2014 the results were more related to limited water supply with the increase in total irrigation amount the increase in irrigation frequency from twice to three times didn t affect the yield the reason may be that when soil water condition was good at sowing the soil water could supply the crop water use till the end of winter dormancy with the increased growth after recovery the irrigation at jointing stage would replenish the soil water consumed and provide adequate water supply for this critical stage of winter wheat with the growing of the crop and the increase in water consumption soil water would become less and the irrigation at anthesis further replenish the soil profile and provide the water needed for grainfill as fig 3 showing the typical soil water dynamics during a growing season of winter wheat the twice irrigation scheduling corresponded well with the water requirement of the crop some studies showed that frequent irrigation probably resulted in the increase in soil evaporation sebastian et al 2016 the results from this study showed that soil evaporation was increased under si as compared with the b 160 with the increased irrigation frequency however due to the partly wetted soil surface under di soil evaporation was slightly reduced under di as compared with that of b 90 although si increased soil evaporation the benefit from the increased irrigation frequency improved the soil water status during the grainfill and then the final crop production under limited water supply condition soil texture influences soil water flow soil water availability and storage capacity pachepsky and rawls 2003 the performance of different irrigation method would also be influenced by soil texture sammis 1980 showed that subsurface irrigation achieved higher wue of potatoes on a glendale clay loam soil when potatoes were grown on a pedrick sandy loam soil drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation got higher wue the addition of drip lines and pillow tubes can act as mulch to reduce soil evaporation and conserve water on a sandy loam soil ben gal et al 2004 cetin and bilgel 2002 indicated that sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation can be used on a wide range of topographic and soil conditions the soil texture for this study site is loam soil which is suitable for a wide range of irrigation methods soil water depletion swd rainfall and irrigation determine the seasonal et zhang et al 2013 suggested that the swd contributed approximately 40 50 of et under rain fed and limited water supply conditions the results from this study demonstrated that the swd contributed up to 80 of the seasonal et for treatment without irrigation in a very dry season the initial soil water content before winter wheat sowing was very important for crop production under limited water supply this finding was consistent with the results of lobell and ortiz monasterio 2006 and peake et al 2016 who pointed out that stored soil water before sowing was important for obtaining higher grain yield under deficit irrigation the north china plain ncp is in a monsoon climate zone about 70 80 of the annual rainfall occurs in summer the rainfall during summer season generally replenishes the soil water before winter wheat sowing this illustrated that the rainfall during summer season can be used for winter wheat and this is important for the annual double cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize in the ncp this observation was similar with the results of zhang et al 2017 and lobell and ortiz monasterio 2006 the small summer rainfall before sowing winter wheat in 2014 2015 season resulted in a very dry soil profile and the yield under rain fed treatment in that season was significantly lower than the other two seasons table 3 the root system of winter wheat can reach to 2m in ncp zhang et al 2013 however the smaller rld in deep soil profile restricted the full extraction of soil water fig 5 even the crop encountered water stress some water was still left in the deep soil without fully used by the crops due to the limited root growth stockle and james 1989 found that deep root system was important for the application of deficit irrigation however the growth of deep root system would also consume photosynthetic products passioura 1983 kashiwagi et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 indicated that most of the root system of winter wheat was in the top soil profile the absorption of water stored in 15 30cm soil layer had greater impacts on crop growth than that of deep root system kashiwagi et al 2015 meanwhile the concentrations of nutrients were also higher in those top soil layers tardieu 2012 therefore irrigation management that could increase the efficiency of soil water to the crops in the upper soil profile would have the potential to increase crop production under limited water supply the results from this study showed that increased irrigation frequency using di benefited the soil water availability to winter wheat during grain fill stag zaman allah et al 2011 also found that the seed yield was positively correlated with the amount of water taken during grain fill stage of winter wheat and water deficit was not favorable for the formation of seed weight tardieu 2012 the results from this study further provded that the improved soil water condition during the grain fill significantly increased seed weight and hi adopting optimized irrigation scheduling and efficient irrigation methods had the advantages to increase wue and save irrigation water but for farmers the economic return is one of the most important issues to be considered table 4 shows that the net income from using the micro irrigation systems was much less than that using the basin irrigation system due to the high cost in installation of the micro irrigation systems the performance of different systems should be also assessed on their economic outcomes paredes et al 2014 bakhsh et al 2015 indicated that the total cost of drip irrigation was higher than surface irrigation even with a higher benefit in water saving rodrigues et al 2013 although drip and pillow irrigation produced higher wue and grain yield as compared with the basin irrigation method under the same irrigation amount the higher investment in the equipments offset the benefit consequently the net income of micro irrigation methods was lower than that of basin irrigation the lower net income would restrict the application of those water saving irrigation methods in practice surface irrigation method with irrigation amount at 160mm produced the highest net income among the different treatments indicating the benefits in reasonable increase in the irrigation water use using the low cost irrigation method the results from this study also showed that the net income was greater even using the expensive irrigation methods than that the rain fed treatments the results indicated the importance of supplemental irrigation to winter wheat in the ncp in places with serious water shortage problem the adopting of the micro irrigation system to improve the crop production might be feasible paredes et al 2014 indicated that ewpr was a useful indicator because it combined grain yield value and the total costs in irrigation in this study basin irrigation lead to higher ewpr than micro irrigation systems the cost of the applied water transportation equipments the response of grain yield to water and the price of the agricultural product decide the economic benefits of irrigation systems playán and mateos 2006 rodrigues et al 2013 in this study the dominant factor resulted in the reduced net income and ewpr of micro irrigation methods was the highest investment in installation of the systems chandran and surendran 2016 indicated that if the farm area becomes lager the initial investment cost will be lower due to the reduction of the components of irrigation system such as the filter pumpset head unit and tank rodrigues et al 2013 indicated that the feasibility of drip irrigation depending on the commodity prices and the irrigation system was far from economic viability due to the low commodity prices higher commodity prices could lead to the positive incomes ørum et al 2010 showed that in order to offset the extra production cost of drip irrigation for potato a 10 20 price increase for the product was needed therefore increasing the grain price of winter wheat and water price were useful methods that could increase the relative net income using micro irrigation systems therefore increasing the willingness of the farmers in adopting water saving methods since the reduction in irrigation water use and at the same time maintaining the grain production capability are the two important issues in the ncp local government might need to increase the subsidy to farmers to use the water saving irrigation methods for the benefit of sustainable irrigation agricultural development in the region 5 conclusion in the ncp approximately 70 80 of the annual rainfall occurs in summer rainfall is small during the winter wheat growing season soil water stored before sowing or supplied by in season irrigation play an important role for crop water use thus the soil water availability to the crop during the growing season significantly affected the performance of winter wheat increasing irrigation frequency by micro irrigation systems could improve grain yield and wue under limited water supply due to the increased top soil water contents during grain fill which improved seed weight and hi under adequate water supply condition more frequent irrigation didn t affect the grain yield the three micro irrigation methods all improved yield and wue under limited water supply however due to the high investment in the irrigation system the net income was significantly reduced as comparing with the basin irrigation method currently basin irrigation method is more economic than that the other three micro irrigation systems but with the intensifying in water scarcity the increasing in farm size and the possible subsidy from government adoption of those water saving irrigation methods might be feasible in future acknowledgements this study was supported by the national key r d program of china 2016yfd0300401 and 2016yfc0401403 and national natural science foundation of china 31371578 
11605,the rapid decline of groundwater table is threatening sustainable irrigation agricultural development in the north china plain ncp optimized irrigation scheduling and water saving irrigation technologies need to be developed to reduce irrigation water use and maintain the grain production potential for the region this study was conducted at luancheng experimental station in the ncp during 2012 2015 to evaluate the effects of different irrigation methods basin irrigation bi tube sprinkler irrigation si pillow irrigation pi and drip irrigation di with various irrigation amount frequency on yield economic returns and water use efficiency wue of winter wheat under the same limited irrigation amount 90mm season two irrigation applications 45mm application conducted using di significantly increased the yield and wue as compared with the bi using one single application increasing the seasonal irrigation amount to 160mm the increase in the application frequency by reducing the irrigation amount per application didn t significantly affect the yield using either pi or si results showed that soil water depletion swd contributed 40 60 of the seasonal evapotranspiration et under limited water supply the smaller root length density rld in deep layers of the soil restricted the soil water uptake by the crop therefore increasing irrigation frequency would maintain the top soil layers with higher soil water contents where rld was greater that improved crop water use and yield under limited water supply however when irrigation water was plentiful micro irrigation methods did not increase yields due to the high cost in installation of the three micro irrigation systems their net income was reduced by 30 as compared with the bi method the economic water productivity ratio ewpr was only 3 4 for the three micro irrigation systems much less than the basin irrigation method which had an average value of 16 currently the basin irrigation method is more economic for growing winter wheat in the ncp keywords water use efficiency irrigation frequency basin irrigation tube sprinkler irrigation pillow irrigation drip irrigation 1 introduction winter wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the main crops in the north china plain ncp it accounts for more than half of all winter wheat production in china sun et al 2006 the rainfall during the growing season was about 60 150mm however the consumptive water use by wheat is about 430 470mm in order to obtain higher grain yield supplemental irrigation is essential zhang et al 2003 sun et al 2011 farmers in this region generally irrigate winter wheat three or four times each season zhang et al 2017 consequently the groundwater table are dropping at an average rate of about 1 1 5m year due to over pumping chen et al 2010 which is threatening the sustainable development of irrigation agriculture in this region to cope with the shortage of irrigation water resources suitable irrigation strategies and water saving irrigation technologies need to be produced deficit irrigation defined as the application of water below full crop water requirements fereres and soriano 2007 has been promoted in many countries in an attempt to minimize irrigation water use fereres and soriano 2007 tari 2016 peake et al 2016 reported that deficit irrigation has greater economic water productivity under water limited conditions this irrigation strategies could increase water productivity in the ranges of 10 50 jensen et al 2014 large soil water holding capacity high soil water contents at sowing and deep root system were important factors for the application of deficit irrigation stockle and james 1989 lobell and ortiz monasterio 2006 peake et al 2008 peake et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 reported that a single irrigation at jointing stage could reduce irrigation water use by 120 140mm as compared with full irrigation treatment with yield penalties of 14 for winter wheat in the ncp ali et al 2007 showed that deficit irrigation saved 135mm water but with 16 yield decrease as compared with the full water supply treatment of wheat in bangladesh the yield decrease of spring wheat under reduced irrigation was mainly related to climatic conditions soil properties and timing of irrigation lobell and ortiz monasterio 2006 optimizing the irrigation strategies is another aspect to efficiently utilize the limited irrigation water rodrigues and pereira 2009 some studies indicated that frequent application of water in small quantities can increase water use efficiency wue e g enciso et al 2003 rawlins 1973 suggested that the water holding capacity of the soil become less important with the increase in irrigation frequency other studies have shown that increasing irrigation frequencies with small quantities per application could maintain higher grain yield of maize zea mays l with a reduction in yield observed with decreasing irrigation frequency in loess plateau of northwest china wang et al 2014 bian et al 2016 indicated that 60mm of water applied at jointing and heading stages for winter wheat achieved higher grain yield than a single application of 120mm at jointing stage sezen et al 2006 showed that irrigation intervals of 3 6days 18 22mm obtained higher wue irrigation water use efficiency iwue and grain yield of bell pepper at a arikli silty clay loam soil conditions muhumed et al 2014 reported that above ground biomass and yield components of sweet corn increased with the increase in irrigation frequency unfortunately traditional irrigation methods such as flooding irrigation may not easily control the irrigation amount per application e g sezen et al 2006 and alternate irrigation methods might be required to improve the iwue for field grown crops such as winter wheat micro irrigation can precisely control the irrigation application and are popular in orchards vegetable growing and wide row planted crops e g pereira et al 2012 bhunia et al 2015 gerçek et al 2017 drip irrigation is one of the major micro irrigation methods allowing accurate application of irrigation in small amount directly to the root zone bhunia et al 2015 increasing the frequencies by drip irrigation could maintain a high soil matric potential in the root rhizosphere accelerating crop growth decreasing deep percolation reducing soil evaporation and saving irrigation water qin et al 2016 jensen et al 2014 jensen et al 2014 reported that drip irrigation can reduce the loss of irrigation water in conveyance and saved 30 40 water compared to basin irrigation muhumed et al 2014 indicated that above ground biomass and yield components of sweet corn were increased with the increase in drip irrigation frequency other irrigation methods such as pillow irrigation and tube sprinkler irrigation are also being used in growing crops pillow irrigation which uses plastic tubes with holes on the tubes and the tubes are placed between two rows of the crop can directly deliver water to the crop the diameters of tubes are varied based on plant row spacing and the tube after irrigation can cover the row spacing as mulch material plastic tube was pierced with holes of 1 mm diameter hole spacing varies between 50 and 100cm depending on crop species ek et al 2009a 2017 pillow irrigation has the benefits of plastic mulching and drip irrigation this method can also restrict weed growth and improve grain yield as well as wue of hot pepper under limited water supply gerçek et al 2009b for the application of the micro sprinkler irrigation to the densely planted crops such as winter wheat a modified micro sprinkler irrigation is becoming popular in china this method uses a thin tube placed on the soil surface with holes on it pressurized water will come out from the holes acting as sprinkler liu and kang 2006 reported that the air temperature and vapor pressure deficit of winter wheat in sprinkler irrigated treatment was lower than that under surface irrigation treatment in ncp however due to the higher cost in installation and maintenance those micro irrigation systems are not widely used on the cereal crops in the ncp currently micro irrigations can save water as compared with flood irrigation due to the reduction in water loss from evaporation deep percolation as well as during water delivery namara et al 2007 maisiri et al 2005 with the increase in irrigation water shortage water saving irrigation methods would become more important in future however their wide use in crops is still limited due to the high investment and maintenance cost of the irrigation system and the lower economic returns of the crops paredes et al 2014 hanson et al 1997 suggested that savings from reduced water costs of lettuce were not enough to offset the equipment costs of drip irrigation system dağdelen et al 2009 indicated that drip irrigation method saved 177mm water but lead to 34 0 reduction in the net income of cotton however namara et al 2007 found that micro irrigation technologies can increase economic returns of banana and peanut when compared to flood irrigation in india selection of a suitable irrigation method would depend on the specific conditions of water resources crop types and management requirements therefore the objectives of this research are as follows 1 to assess the performance of basin irrigation tube sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation and pillow irrigation methods on grain yield and wue of winter wheat and 2 to evaluate the economic benefits of different irrigation methods 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and the growing condition of the crop the experiment was conducted during 2012 2013 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 three growing seasons of winter wheat at luancheng experimental station 37 53 n 114 40 n elevation 50m in the north china plain ncp winter wheat grown from october to earlier june and summer maize grown from earlier june to the end of september form the annual double cropping system the mean annual precipitation is 473mm with around 30 of the precipitation falling during the winter wheat season the soil is loam with average field capacity at 36 v v and wilting point at 13 v v for the top 2m of the soil profile the groundwater table was 40m below soil surface and the soil and irrigation water have no salinity problems soil nutrient contents were 18g kg for organic matter 80mg kg for available n 110mg kg for available k and 15mg kg for available p for the top tillage layer detailed soil physical characteristics at the experimental site can be found in zhang et al 2016 winter wheat was sown in october after maize was harvested and the maize straw was chopped and incorporated into the top soil layer the same winter wheat cultivar kn199 was used for the three seasons winter wheat was planted following the local practice with four rows closely together and between two four close rows there was a wide row spacing of 30cm the four close rows had row spacing around 12cm the four rows took 0 6cm width averagely seeding rate was 300 viable seeds m2 and sowing was done with a seeding machine before planting diammonium phosphate dap at 300kg ha urea at 150kg ha and potassium chloride at 150kg ha were broadcast and incorporated into the soil an additional 225kg ha of urea was top dressed at jointing stage in early april either with an irrigation or with an rainfall event the fertilizer amount followed the local practices 2 2 treatments for irrigation methods and irrigation amounts four irrigation methods basin irrigation bi tube sprinkler irrigation si drip irrigation di and pillow irrigation pi were tested bi is the local irrigation method widely used by the local farmers the study for the bi was included in a long term irrigation scheduling study which included six irrigation treatments zhang et al 2008 for this study the irrigation treatments of no irrigation one irrigation application and two irrigations were used each treatment had four plots with area of 4 9m2 plot all the plots were boarded to form a basin for flooding irrigation fig 1 the irrigation was conducted by connecting a plastic tube with the low pressure water transportation pipeline and a flow meter was connected with the outlet from the pipeline to record the water used for each plot another piece of land next to the basin site was divided into three parts for si di and pi study fig 1 the soil conditions of this land were the same as that with the bi each part had an area of 16m in width and 40m in length the drip lines were arranged at 60cm apart and it was placed on the middle of the four close rows the drip irrigation system had a dripping rate of 2l h for each emitter and working pressure of 0 6mpa the pipes for tube sprinkler was set at 1 2m apart in the field and placed on the middle of a wide row the tube had a diameter of 4cm and a working pressure of 1 1kpa s the pillow irrigation was using the plastic pipes with diameter of 20cm and holes on the pipes the pipes were placed on each wide row when the pipes were filled with water the water would directly infiltrate into the soil through the holes on the pipes a plastic tube which had outlets connected with the pipes low pressure water transportation system delivered the water to the pipes and a switch was installed at each outlet to control the water supply to each pipe line after irrigation the pipes could act as plastic mulch to prevent soil evaporation the irrigation water was from underground the di and si were installed with a pressurization system to control the pressure required for individual system for the three seasons the treatments of bi was fixed as the following no irrigation b 0 one irrigation application at jointing stage b 90 total amount of 90mm and two irrigations at jointing and anthesis stages b 160 total amount of 160mm with 90mm at jointing and 70mm at anthesis the other three methods had similar irrigation amount but different irrigation frequency to be compared with the bi on the effects of yield and wue of winter wheat for the three seasons the detailed irrigation arrangement was listed in table 1 di had similar seasonal irrigation amount as with b 90 but with increased irrigation frequency to examine the irrigation amount application and irrigation frequency on the effects of winter wheat in 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 season the pi and si had similar irrigation amount as with b 160 but with increased irrigation efficiency to examine the effects of increased irrigation efficiency on the performance of winter wheat under relative sufficient water supply in 2014 2015 pi and si had the same treatments as with the di to compare the performance of the three irrigation methods the setting up of the irrigation scheduling of the basin irrigation method was following zhang et al 2008 at the same site their results indicated a single irrigation at jointing stage as the optimized irrigation scheduling under limited water supply and two irrigations at jointing and anthesis as the normal irrigation scheduling treatment that produced good yield under moderate water supply condition using bi 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 weather conditions the daily weather conditions including sunshine duration air temperature relative humidity wind speed radiation and rainfall were recorded from a weather station about 50m away from the experimental site daily reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated with the crop water program developed by fao using penman monteith equation which represents the concept of grass reference evapotranspiration albedo 0 23 height 0 12m surface resistance 70s m allen et al 1998 the et0 was used to compare the atmospheric evaporation potential of the three seasons 2 3 2 soil water content soil water contents was monitored in each treatment with four sites using a neutron probe 503 dr cpn international inc usa for each 20cm soil layer down to 2mcm every 10days during the winter wheat growing season soil water contents at the top 20cm layer were monitored by gravity method the neutron probe was calibrated using the data obtained at the same site for different soil layers 2 3 3 root distribution and soil evaporation measuring after winter dormancy in the 2012 2013 season daily soil evaporation rate for di b 90 and b 160 was measured using micro lysimeter as described by liu et al 2002 four micro lysimeters were placed on the wider row spacing for each treatment the micro lysimeters contained small isolated volumes of soil mounted flush with or slightly above the soil surface and were weighed daily to determine water loss using electronic balances with 0 001kg precision the diameter of the micro lysimeter was 12cm with a depth of 20cm in order to keep the soil moisture in micro lysimeters similar to that outside of the cylinder the original soil in the instruments was changed every two or three days by pressing the cylinder into the soil and extracting it the bottom of the cylinder was sealed with water proof tape roots were sampled in the 2013 2014 season for the basin irrigation at maturity of winter wheat under b 0 b 90 and b 160 four sites for each treatment down to 150cm at 10cm increments were sampled the diameter of the corer was at 10cm the cores were washed to obtain the roots and root length was measured based on the line intersect method tennant 1975 the root length density rld at different depths was calculated by dividing the root length by the sampled soil volume cm cm3 2 3 4 grain yield yield components at maturity four sites were randomly selected from each treatment for yield measuring the size of each site was around 10m2 and the plants were all harvested before harvesting spike density was measured and eighty plants from each site were randomly selected cut at the base and air dried to a constant weight to measure the seed numbers per spike and seed weight for deciding yield components and harvest index hi after harvesting all plants were manually threshed with a thresher grains were air dried to a constant moisture and the weightwas recorded to obtain the final grain yield 13 water contents 2 3 5 seasonal crop water use water use efficiency the seasonal water use of winter wheat under different irrigation methods defined as seasonal evapotranspiration et was calculated based on the water balance equation zhang et al 2008 1 et p i swd r d cr where et was seasonal evapotranspiration mm p was precipitation mm i was irrigation mm swd was soil water depletion for 2m soil depth mm r was surface runoff mm d was drainage from the root zone mm and cr was capillary rise to the root zone mm surface runoff drainage and capillary rise to the root zone were taken as zero due to the less rainfall small irrigation amount and the deep groundwater table 40m below soil surface wue was calculated by the following equation 2 wue y et where wue was water use efficiency kg m3 y was grain yield kg ha 2 4 economic analysis economic analysis was conducted by deciding the total cost for different irrigation methods and gross income for grain production the total cost from different irrigation systems included the costs in buying the irrigation equipment labor input and the electricity used during the irrigation the life span of di si and pi was based on the quality of the pipelines used for this study the emitter lines for drip used the renewable ones and renewd each year the life span for the si and pi systems was set at 3 years seed costs and fertilizer input were included in the analysis based on the market price the cost related to different irrigation methods were presented in table 2 gross income was the value of grain production based on the local current market price of winter wheat it was 2 20yuan kg 1 usa dollar 6 8yuan net income for each irrigation method was computed by subtracting the total cost from gross income labor costs in irrigation and installation of the irrigation systems used the price of 100 yuan day economic water productivity ratio ewpr was calculated as grain yield value divided by irrigation farm cost paredes et al 2014 here the irrigation farm cost only included the cost of the irrigation systems and the cost of conducting the irrigation the costs in other management practices were not included for calculating ewpr 2 5 statistical analysis two way anova was used to compare the differences in grain yield wue and economic outcomes and ewprs among the irrigation methods and irrigation frequency under the same season difference between mean values of irrigation treatments were studied using test for least significant difference at a 0 05 significance level 3 results 3 1 weather conditions during 2012 2015 growing seasons fig 2 shows the accumulated et0 sunshine hours temperature 0 c and rainfall for the three seasons as compared with the long term average there was large variation among the weather factors during the three seasons the seasonal et0 during 2012 2015 was 509 552 581mm much higher than the long term average of 495mm the long term average for sunshine hours was 1295 total sunshine hours during 2012 2015 seasons was 1073 1259 1416h compared with the long term average the sunshine conditions in 2014 2015 season was quite good however it was very poor in 2012 2013 season especially during the grainfill stage among the three seasons the accumulated temperature was lower in 2012 2013 the seasonal rainfall during 2012 2015 seasons was 122 48 77mm respectively compared with the long term average rainfall of 122mm 2012 2013 was a relatively normal season while the other two seasons were very dry especially during 2013 2014 the large difference in atmospheric evaporation demand and seasonal rainfall demonstrated the importance of supplemental irrigation to winter wheat 3 2 soil water changes under different irrigation treatments taking the dry season of 2013 2014 under bi as an example due to the low rainfall and the large water requirements for winter wheat in the ncp soil water declined throughout the whole growing season especially for the treatment without irrigation fig 3 from sowing to the end of winter dormancy the water use for winter wheat was small and had only a slight declining trend as crop growth accelerated after dormancy and the increase in atmospheric evaporation potential a rapid decline in soil water content was observed soil water reserves were also depleted even when 90 or 160mm of irrigation was applied water application around anthesis stage for b 160 treatment slightly reduced the declining trend but due to the lower soil water contents at the irrigation the replenishment to the soil water was not apparent fig 3 the results showed that soil water stored before sowing played an important role to supply the water requirements of winter wheat under the growing condition of ncp soil water depletion swd contributed greatly to the seasonal et under limited water supply fig 4 indicates the large change in soil water contents for the 0 2m soil profile at sowing with that at harvesting for three irrigation treatments swd was 215 2 244 9 0 and 223 9mm under b 0 b 90 and b 160 in the dry season of 2013 2014 the soil water uptake was gradually reduced with the increase in soil depth especially down below 150cm where rld was small fig 5 the low rld in the deep soil layers restricted the fully soil water uptake by the crop the results also showed that swd under b 90 was greater than b 0 which was possibly related to the increased growth in root and shoot under b 90 than that b 0 the total root length and above ground biomass of b 90 were 22 7 and 32 2 greater than that of b 0 respectively the increased growth both in roots and shoots increased the water requirements and the ability in utilizing soil water the decreased swd for b 160 as compared with b 90 had been related to the increase in irrigation amount for b 160 treatment the increased irrigation frequency under the three micro irrigation systems improved the soil water conditions at the top soil layer especially during the grainfill stage the soil water storage for the top 1m soil profile was averagely 20mm greater under two irrigation applications using micro irrigation methods than that b 90 around 10days after anthesis therefore the more soil stored in the top 1m soil layer under the increased irrigation frequency would have the benefits to increase the soil water availability to the crop during the later growth stages of the crop 3 3 crop water use yield and wue under different irrigation treatments crop water use et was listed in table 3 for different irrigation treatments across the 2012 2015 seasons water use and the yield of the crop were affected not only by the irrigation management but also by the seasonal weather conditions and stored soil water the lower et0 in 2012 2013 season resulted in the lower et for the irrigated treatments as compared with that in 2013 2014 season although rainfall in 2013 2014 season was small the relative higher soil water contents at sowing contributed greatly to the et due to the dry summer before planting winter wheat in 2014 2015 season the contribution of swd to et was reduced under rainfed condition as compared with other seasons on average swd contributed 60 80 of the seasonal et for the rainfed treatment 40 60 under limited irrigation and 20 50 under increased water supply condition et was increased with the increase in irrigation amount and the contribution of the soil water stored before sowing was reduced grain yield was affected by different irrigation management and the seasonal weather conditions the highest yield was achieved in the 2013 2014 season which was related to the good soil water condition at sowing and favorable growing conditions higher sunshine hours and warm temperatures the reduced yield in 2012 2013 season was probably related to the lower sunshine duration and lower temperature although the rainfall was the largest among the three seasons table 3 indicates the large increase in yield from no irrigation to one irrigation applications yield was increased by 24 7 31 3 and 80 4 from b 0 to b 90 in the three seasons respectively the largest increase from b 0 to b 90 in 2014 2015 season was related to the lower soil water contents at sowing and plentiful rainfall was received in the later growing stages of the crop the rain fed treatment was significantly affected by the water shortage through the whole season thus the grain production was significantly reduced the yield increase was 18 1 16 8 and 18 7 from b 90 to b 160 for the three seasons respectively with the same amount of irrigation at 90mm drip irrigation increased grain yield of by 12 0 12 9 and 11 6 as compared with the basin irrigation method b 90 for the three seasons respectively the increase in wue was 18 1 19 6 and 21 9 respectively for the three seasons the results indicated that increasing the irrigation frequency using drip irrigation under limited water supply significantly improved the crop performance both in yield and wue when total irrigation volume was the same comparing the performance of b 160 and di both having irrigation frequency of twice but differed in total irrigation volume irrigation volume of di being 46 lower than that of b 160 yield of di was only 5 2 3 3 and 6 0 lower than that of b 160 during 2012 2015 seasons respectively with large reduction in irrigation water use yield was less affected by using the drip irrigation method the wue under di was 12 1 15 8 and 22 4 greater than that b 160 for the three seasons respectively further increasing in irrigation frequency under increased irrigation amount didn t significantly increase the yield of winter wheat in 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 seasons table 3 shows there was no significant difference among the yield of b 160 pi and si only with slight increase in wue under pi comparing the three irrigation methods under the same irrigation amount of 90mm in 2014 2015 yield increase was 11 6 10 9 and 6 4 under di pi and si respectively as compared with b 90 the increasing in irrigation frequency from one to two times using the three methods all improved the performance of winter wheat wue was increased by 21 7 10 2 and 3 8 under the three methods respectively as compared with b 90 the increase in wue and yield under di and pi were greater than that under si indicating the water evaporation during the irrigation and immediately after the irrigation might reduce the water availability to crops using the tube sprinkler system 3 4 factors related to the improved yield and wue the results from table 3 indicated that under limited water supply 90mm increasing the irrigation frequency from one to two times using di pi and si improved yield and wue the improvement was greater under di and pi than that under si especially for the wue the increase in yield was associated with the improved seed weight under di no significant difference in kernel numbers existed between di and b 90 during 2012 2015 seasons the increased irrigation frequency improved the soil water contents during the grainfill stage for the top 1m soil profile which favored the seed formation therefore seed weight and harvest index were all increased under di as compared with b 90 for the three seasons fig 6 the average increase in seed weight was 12 9 and 7 4 for hi during the three seasons the higher hi was usually related to a higher wue the results also showed that the seed weight in 2012 2013 season was much lower than that in the other two seasons due to the lower sunshine duration during the grainfill stage in 2012 2013 the reduced seed weight was the major reason of the lower yield in that season the improved yield and wue under di than that of bi and si under limited irrigation supply was associated with reduced soil evaporation the drip lines were placed on crop rows such that inter row spaces were not wetted during the irrigation which reduced the soil evaporation therefore more soil water was conserved and used for the crop growth which benefited the grain production under water deficit condition the measuring of soil evaporation using mico lysimter in 2012 2013 season showed that the accumulated soil evaporation was 47 5mm under b 90 65 1mm under b 160 from recovery to maturity in 2012 2013 season under di the accumulated soil evaporation was 37 2mm during the same period soil evaporation was reduced by 10mm under di as compared with b 90 and 27 9mm as compared with b 160 although b 160 had 70mm more irrigation water applied than that of di the yield increase was smaller due to the higher soil evaporation consumption under b 160 than that of di the wue improvement under si was much smaller than that of di and pi it was related to the larger soil evaporation under si the accumulated soil evaporation was 78 0mm under si for the same period soil evaporation was the highest under si than that under other irrigation methods si has the advantage to increase irrigation frequency under limited irrigation application but the increased soil evaporation somehow reduced this benefit 3 5 economic evaluation table 4 lists the gross income irrigation cost and other costs for growing winter wheat across the 2012 2015 seasons the results showed that basin irrigation produced the highest net income and the increased irrigation amount also improved the farm income table 4 shows that the increase in total irrigation amount from 90 to 160mm increased net income by 28 4 23 3 and 28 1 during the three seasons respectively but the largest increase in net income was from no irrigation to b 90 which was 30 8 40 8 and 197 4 for the three seasons respectively the results indicated the irrigation application significantly increased the net income of growing winter wheat in the ncp but due to the higher costs the three micro irrigation systems all produced lower net income as compared with the basin irrigation method the increase in yield by the micro irrigation systems could not compensate the increased costs in installation of the irrigation systems however as compared with the rain fed treatment the micro irrigation systems produced higher net income indicating even with expensive irrigation cost the increase in yield by any irrigation method could offset the increased costs in irrigation system installation which further indicated the importance of supplemental irrigation to winter wheat production in the ncp due to the relative lower cost in installation of si the net income using si was slightly greater than that of di and pi di outperformed pi in net income ewpr of bi was around four times greater than that the three micro irrigation systems indicating bi being more economic for winter wheat irrigation under the current condition of ncp currently the price of irrigation water use only includes the electricity cost in the ncp for the underground water pumping with the increased water shortage and the control in groundwater use cost in using water might be increased in the future the results showed that when the water price went to 3 5yuan m3 the net income of rain fed wheat would outperform the irrigated winter wheat the water price from the south north water transfer project was 5yuan m3 in the ncp thus the profit from using the transferred water for grown crops would be negative therefore it is important to improve the wue to increase grain production under limited water supply by agronomic breeding and irrigation methods 4 discussion results from this study indicated the importance of supplemental irrigation to the increase in grain production of winter wheat in the ncp with one irrigation application the yield of winter wheat was increased by 24 80 additional irrigation further increased yield by 18 further increase in irrigation application didn t significantly increase crop production using flooding irrigation method zhang et al 2008 2017 many studies indicated that two irrigations for winter wheat was the optimized irrigation scheduling in terms of irrigation water saving and irrigation efficiency in the ncp the results from this study also showed that different irrigation methods combined with different irrigation frequency affected both the grain production and wue under the same seasonal irrigation amount regulated deficit irrigation scheduling has been applied to relieve the irrigation water shortage problems around the world peake et al 2016 jensen et al 2014 under limited irrigation adopting irrigation methods to increase irrigation efficience and crop production are very important some studies indicated that frequent application of water in small quantities can provide appropriate water for crop growth and increase yield and wue enciso et al 2003 qin et al 2016 bian et al 2016 sezen et al 2006 however the small quantities per application may not be easily implemented using flooding irrigation method the micro irrigation systems provided the opportunity to precisely manage the limited irrigation water the results from this study indicated that using drip irrigation to double the irrigation application numbers improved yield by 12 and wue by 20 as compared with the one irrigation application using the flooding irrigation method the improvement in grain yield was related to the increased top soil water contents during the grainfill stage which significantly increased the seed weight and harvest index the increase in wue was related both to the reduced soil evaporation and improved grain yield previous study had shown that frequent irrigation could maintain a higher average water filled pore space in the upper soil layer as compared with the lower frequency scheduling wang et al 2006 abalos et al 2014 the results were more related to limited water supply with the increase in total irrigation amount the increase in irrigation frequency from twice to three times didn t affect the yield the reason may be that when soil water condition was good at sowing the soil water could supply the crop water use till the end of winter dormancy with the increased growth after recovery the irrigation at jointing stage would replenish the soil water consumed and provide adequate water supply for this critical stage of winter wheat with the growing of the crop and the increase in water consumption soil water would become less and the irrigation at anthesis further replenish the soil profile and provide the water needed for grainfill as fig 3 showing the typical soil water dynamics during a growing season of winter wheat the twice irrigation scheduling corresponded well with the water requirement of the crop some studies showed that frequent irrigation probably resulted in the increase in soil evaporation sebastian et al 2016 the results from this study showed that soil evaporation was increased under si as compared with the b 160 with the increased irrigation frequency however due to the partly wetted soil surface under di soil evaporation was slightly reduced under di as compared with that of b 90 although si increased soil evaporation the benefit from the increased irrigation frequency improved the soil water status during the grainfill and then the final crop production under limited water supply condition soil texture influences soil water flow soil water availability and storage capacity pachepsky and rawls 2003 the performance of different irrigation method would also be influenced by soil texture sammis 1980 showed that subsurface irrigation achieved higher wue of potatoes on a glendale clay loam soil when potatoes were grown on a pedrick sandy loam soil drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation got higher wue the addition of drip lines and pillow tubes can act as mulch to reduce soil evaporation and conserve water on a sandy loam soil ben gal et al 2004 cetin and bilgel 2002 indicated that sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation can be used on a wide range of topographic and soil conditions the soil texture for this study site is loam soil which is suitable for a wide range of irrigation methods soil water depletion swd rainfall and irrigation determine the seasonal et zhang et al 2013 suggested that the swd contributed approximately 40 50 of et under rain fed and limited water supply conditions the results from this study demonstrated that the swd contributed up to 80 of the seasonal et for treatment without irrigation in a very dry season the initial soil water content before winter wheat sowing was very important for crop production under limited water supply this finding was consistent with the results of lobell and ortiz monasterio 2006 and peake et al 2016 who pointed out that stored soil water before sowing was important for obtaining higher grain yield under deficit irrigation the north china plain ncp is in a monsoon climate zone about 70 80 of the annual rainfall occurs in summer the rainfall during summer season generally replenishes the soil water before winter wheat sowing this illustrated that the rainfall during summer season can be used for winter wheat and this is important for the annual double cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize in the ncp this observation was similar with the results of zhang et al 2017 and lobell and ortiz monasterio 2006 the small summer rainfall before sowing winter wheat in 2014 2015 season resulted in a very dry soil profile and the yield under rain fed treatment in that season was significantly lower than the other two seasons table 3 the root system of winter wheat can reach to 2m in ncp zhang et al 2013 however the smaller rld in deep soil profile restricted the full extraction of soil water fig 5 even the crop encountered water stress some water was still left in the deep soil without fully used by the crops due to the limited root growth stockle and james 1989 found that deep root system was important for the application of deficit irrigation however the growth of deep root system would also consume photosynthetic products passioura 1983 kashiwagi et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 indicated that most of the root system of winter wheat was in the top soil profile the absorption of water stored in 15 30cm soil layer had greater impacts on crop growth than that of deep root system kashiwagi et al 2015 meanwhile the concentrations of nutrients were also higher in those top soil layers tardieu 2012 therefore irrigation management that could increase the efficiency of soil water to the crops in the upper soil profile would have the potential to increase crop production under limited water supply the results from this study showed that increased irrigation frequency using di benefited the soil water availability to winter wheat during grain fill stag zaman allah et al 2011 also found that the seed yield was positively correlated with the amount of water taken during grain fill stage of winter wheat and water deficit was not favorable for the formation of seed weight tardieu 2012 the results from this study further provded that the improved soil water condition during the grain fill significantly increased seed weight and hi adopting optimized irrigation scheduling and efficient irrigation methods had the advantages to increase wue and save irrigation water but for farmers the economic return is one of the most important issues to be considered table 4 shows that the net income from using the micro irrigation systems was much less than that using the basin irrigation system due to the high cost in installation of the micro irrigation systems the performance of different systems should be also assessed on their economic outcomes paredes et al 2014 bakhsh et al 2015 indicated that the total cost of drip irrigation was higher than surface irrigation even with a higher benefit in water saving rodrigues et al 2013 although drip and pillow irrigation produced higher wue and grain yield as compared with the basin irrigation method under the same irrigation amount the higher investment in the equipments offset the benefit consequently the net income of micro irrigation methods was lower than that of basin irrigation the lower net income would restrict the application of those water saving irrigation methods in practice surface irrigation method with irrigation amount at 160mm produced the highest net income among the different treatments indicating the benefits in reasonable increase in the irrigation water use using the low cost irrigation method the results from this study also showed that the net income was greater even using the expensive irrigation methods than that the rain fed treatments the results indicated the importance of supplemental irrigation to winter wheat in the ncp in places with serious water shortage problem the adopting of the micro irrigation system to improve the crop production might be feasible paredes et al 2014 indicated that ewpr was a useful indicator because it combined grain yield value and the total costs in irrigation in this study basin irrigation lead to higher ewpr than micro irrigation systems the cost of the applied water transportation equipments the response of grain yield to water and the price of the agricultural product decide the economic benefits of irrigation systems playán and mateos 2006 rodrigues et al 2013 in this study the dominant factor resulted in the reduced net income and ewpr of micro irrigation methods was the highest investment in installation of the systems chandran and surendran 2016 indicated that if the farm area becomes lager the initial investment cost will be lower due to the reduction of the components of irrigation system such as the filter pumpset head unit and tank rodrigues et al 2013 indicated that the feasibility of drip irrigation depending on the commodity prices and the irrigation system was far from economic viability due to the low commodity prices higher commodity prices could lead to the positive incomes ørum et al 2010 showed that in order to offset the extra production cost of drip irrigation for potato a 10 20 price increase for the product was needed therefore increasing the grain price of winter wheat and water price were useful methods that could increase the relative net income using micro irrigation systems therefore increasing the willingness of the farmers in adopting water saving methods since the reduction in irrigation water use and at the same time maintaining the grain production capability are the two important issues in the ncp local government might need to increase the subsidy to farmers to use the water saving irrigation methods for the benefit of sustainable irrigation agricultural development in the region 5 conclusion in the ncp approximately 70 80 of the annual rainfall occurs in summer rainfall is small during the winter wheat growing season soil water stored before sowing or supplied by in season irrigation play an important role for crop water use thus the soil water availability to the crop during the growing season significantly affected the performance of winter wheat increasing irrigation frequency by micro irrigation systems could improve grain yield and wue under limited water supply due to the increased top soil water contents during grain fill which improved seed weight and hi under adequate water supply condition more frequent irrigation didn t affect the grain yield the three micro irrigation methods all improved yield and wue under limited water supply however due to the high investment in the irrigation system the net income was significantly reduced as comparing with the basin irrigation method currently basin irrigation method is more economic than that the other three micro irrigation systems but with the intensifying in water scarcity the increasing in farm size and the possible subsidy from government adoption of those water saving irrigation methods might be feasible in future acknowledgements this study was supported by the national key r d program of

11606,improvement of nitrogen use efficiency nue is a challenging task because of its several losses through ammonia volatilization surface runoff leaching and nitrification denitrification fertilizer deep placement fdp has been proven effective in increasing grain yields and nue under continuous standing water csw condition however the impacts of fdp have not been investigated under alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation field experiments were conducted in the dry seasons during 2014 2016 to determine the interaction effect of fertilizer x water regime on n losses as floodwater ammonium and ammonia volatilization grain yields and nue broadcast prilled urea pu deep placement of urea briquettes ub and nitrogen phosphorus potassium fertilizer briquettes hereafter npk at varied n rates and zero n were tested under awd and csw conditions the deep placement of ub and npk irrespective of n rates and water regimes reduced floodwater ammonium and ammonia volatilization significantly compared to broadcast pu deep placement of either ub n78 or npk n104 increased grain yields under both awd 21 26 and csw 13 20 conditions compared to broadcast pun104 the magnitude of increase was larger under awd because awd significantly reduced grain yields 8 compared to csw at pu n104 however yields of deep placed ub were similar between awd and csw deep placement of ub and npk increased n recovery up to 57 66 from 36 of pun104 these results suggest that ubn78 and npk n104 can be utilized under awd not only for increased grain yield and nue but also to reduce additional pumping cost for irrigation water moreover combined approach of awd and fdp might be a good option for improving water and fertilizer use efficiencies in rice cultivation keywords fertilizer deep placement nitrogen management water saving irrigation ammonia volatilization flux nitrogen use efficiency lowland rice 1 introduction rice occupies about 11 4 million ha of land with the production of 51 64 million tons bbs 2015 boro or dry season rice grown from january february to april may makes up the majority of total production in bangladesh covering about 4 8 million ha while aus from may june to august september and aman from july august to november december are wet seasons in which rice coverage is 1 05 and 5 6 million ha respectively bbs 2015 with the increasing population growth rate it is estimated that the demand for rice will be 56 higher by 2050 than in 2001 36 1million tons mukherjee et al 2011 kabir et al 2015 therefore rice productivity should be increased to meet the food demand of a growing population taking into account the dwindling amount of land area available for farming this requires judicious use of agricultural inputs including quality seeds and fertilizers and irrigation water management among other good agricultural practices fertilizer application and water management are the most important practices in rice production though nitrogen n fertilizer plays a major role in rice production all fertilizers should be applied in a balanced way for increasing crop productivity and improving soil fertility however most farmers in developing countries such as bangladesh are not familiar with balanced fertilization practices they often use excessive n and insufficient phosphorus p and potassium k fertilizers quamruzzaman 2006 with little or no secondary and micronutrient fertilizers moreover farmers apply fertilizers using the conventional broadcast method which leads to lower nutrient use efficiency the nitrogen use efficiency nue in lowland rice is only 30 40 particularly when prilled urea pu is applied via broadcast method resulting in financial losses and harm to the environment ladha et al 2005 savant and stangel 1990 raun et al 2002 the low nue is caused by n losses through ammonia nh3 volatilization surface runoff nitrification and denitrification and leaching savant and stangel 1990 peng et al 2006 hayashi et al 2008 watanabe et al 2009 dong et al 2012 these losses increase when urea is applied via broadcast method one of the major loss mechanisms is nh3 volatilization which reaches up to 50 of applied n sommer et al 2004 in lowland rice fields placement of n in the root zone i e urea deep placement udp reduces n losses and increases nue and crop productivity savant and stangel 1990 rochette et al 2013 huda et al 2016 when urea is deep placed in continuously flooded rice soils losses of n as floodwater ammonium nh4 n nh3 volatilization and nitrous oxide emissions are negligible kapoor et al 2008 rochette et al 2013 gaihre et al 2015 huda et al 2016 with the reduction of these losses udp increases nue up to 80 compared to 30 45 with broadcast application thus udp in rice cultivation reduces n fertilizer required by 30 35 and increases grain yields by up to 15 20 compared to broadcast pu in addition to increased farm profitability udp reduces government subsidy payments in countries where n fertilizer subsidies exist moreover deep placement of compound fertilizer npk briquettes was recently introduced in bangladesh supplying all three major nutrients in a compound briquette miah et al 2016 since many farmers do not practice balanced fertilization quamruzzaman 2006 deep placement of compound fertilizer briquettes offers the potential for higher yields and improves fertilizer use efficiency because of balanced use of nutrients and reduced nutrient losses in most studies related to fertilizer deep placement including deep placement of both urea briquettes ub and npk briquettes fertilizers were tested under continuous standing water csw irrigation regime under csw irrigation regime deep placed n remains in the root zone as nh4 n ensuring continuous supply to plants throughout the growing season depending on soil type in contrast when the irrigation regime is changed from csw to alternate wetting and drying awd the fate of n in the soil particularly dynamics of soil c and n may be changed affecting soil fertility generally awd makes soil c and n unstable increasing their mineralization rates ponnamperuma 1972 and these in turn have important consequences on c and n losses several studies were conducted in different rice growing countries on awd regime and its effects on grain yields and farm profitability however the effects of awd irrigation on rice yields are not consistent and are still inconclusive bouman et al 2005 chapagain and yamaji 2010 liu et al 2013 chu et al 2015 wang et al 2016 on the other hand there are still few studies on the effect of awd irrigation regime on nue particularly under different rates and placement methods of n fertilizers therefore the main objective of this study was to determine the interaction effect of n fertilizer rates and placement methods x water management on rice yields and nue in lowland rice during the dry season the specific objectives of this study were to compare n losses in terms of floodwater nh4 and nh3 volatilization between broadcast pu and deep placed ub and npk at different n rates to determine yields n uptake and nue of boro rice for broadcast pu ub and npk under csw and awd to determine optimum n rates for boro rice cultivation as broadcast pu and deep placement of ub and npk 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and weather conditions the field experiments were conducted in

february to april may in the boro season air temperature is generally 15 30 c and rainfall is received in later growth stages of the crop daily rainfall and mean temperature during the experiment period are shown in fig 1 the physicochemical properties of the soils before the start and after completion of the experiments are presented in table 1 2 2 experimental design and treatments eight fertilizer treatments with different sources and n rates table 2 were arranged in a split plot design with three replications the awd and csw regimes were the main plots while fertilizer treatments were sub plot treatments fertilizer treatments were combinations of sources and n rates sources of n fertilizer were pu ub and npk n rates were 0 78 104 and 156kgha 1 for ub and npk n rates were 78 and 104 while for pu 78 104 and 156kgha 1 the lowest n rate excluding control treatment started with existing recommended rates i e 78kgnha 1 for deep placement and 104kgnha 1 for broadcast application miah et al 2016 huda et al 2016 the size and number of briquettes per placement site were determined based on n rates deep placement of one 2 7g ub at 40 40cm spacing 62 500 placement

maintained 2 3 crop management phosphorus triple superphosphate tsp and potassium muriate of potash mop fertilizers were applied during final land preparation as basal treatments in all plots except the plots receiving npk at 25kg p and 85kgkha 1 in npk treatments p and k were included in the briquettes pu was applied as broadcast in three equal splits at seven to ten days after transplanting dat at maximum tillering and at panicle initiation stages while ub and npk were deep placed at 7 10cm depth at the center of four rice hills as a single application in addition sulfur s and zinc zn were applied to all plots as basal treatments at 15kg s as gypsum and 3kg zn ha 1 as zinc sulfate two to three rice seedlings per hill of variety brri dhan28 were transplanted with a spacing of 20 20cm table 3 shows the major crop management practices all the plots under csw conditions were maintained continuously flooded until two weeks before harvesting while plots under awd conditions were irrigated following awd principles plots were irrigated when water depth in awd pipers was 12 15cm below soil surface awd irrigation was adopted one week after first topdressing of pu or udp and continued until two weeks before harvesting however plots under awd conditions were maintained continuously flooded for a week after topdressing td of pu and during flowering stage as under csw plots to monitor floodwater depth in awd plots a 25cm long 10cm diameter pvc pipe perforated up to 15cm was inserted 15cm into the soil perforated side down leaving 10cm above the ground soils inside the pipe were removed to make a hole up to the 15cm water depth inside the pvc pipes was monitored every day after transplanting and plots were irrigated when water depth in awd pipes were 12 15cm below

zhong cheng et al 2012 a plastic bucket was used as a chamber a vacuum pump was used to suck air samples from a chamber nitrogen present in air samples was trapped by a boric acid solution 2 in a volumetric flask plastic buckets 13l were placed between rice rows after each n application for seven consecutive days the nh3 content in the volumetric flask was collected until the color changed from violet to green then trapped nh3 was determined by titration with standard acid volatilization measurements were done only under csw irrigation regime in 2015 and 2016 2 5 rice yield and nue

probability 3 results 3 1 dynamics of floodwater nh4 n and nh3 volatilization deep placement of either ub or npk irrespective of n rates reduced floodwater nh4 n compared to broadcast pu fig 3 these results were consistent across water regimes and years the broadcast pu resulted in a significant amount of nh4 n in floodwater which varied over time the peaks in nh4 n were observed after two to three days of fertilizer application and then sharply declined moreover the amount of nh4 n increased with larger n rates of pu in contrast increasing n rates in ub and npk treatments had no significant effect on floodwater nh4 n on the other hand effects of water regimes were not apparent both csw and awd plots showed similar pattern and magnitudes under each fertilizer treatment as with floodwater nh4 n the magnitude of nh3 volatilization in pu treatment was higher while it was negligible from udp treatments fig 4 deep placement of ub significantly reduced nh3 volatilization compared to broadcast pu in all measurements since ub was deep placed once at 7 10cm below the soil surface during the first td of pu the magnitude of nh3 volatilization in ub treatments was comparatively higher during the first td compared to the second and third td periods over the years the pattern of nh3 volatilization in pu treatments was similar in all measurement periods the n loss as nh3 volatilization in pu treatments was about 4 of the applied n while in ub treatments it was only about 1 3 2 grain yield and aboveground biomass fertilizer treatments had significant interaction effects with water regime and year on the number of panicles grain yields and aboveground tdm table 4 nitrogen fertilizer irrespective of rates and methods of application significantly increased the number of panicles per unit area grain yields and tdm under both irrigation regimes compared to the control treatment awd irrigation significantly reduced grain yields and tdm compared to csw irrigation when n fertilizer was applied as broadcast method therefore under awd irrigation increasing the n rate from 104kg to 156kg broadcast significantly increased grain yields and tdm but the effects were not significant under csw regime on the other hand for ub increasing n rates from 78kg to 156kg had no significant effect on grain yields under both water regimes grain yields showed a declining trend beyond 104kg in contrast to ub deep placement of npk increased grain yields when the n rate was increased from 78kg to 104 under the awd regime although it was not significant under the csw irrigation regime in general deep placed treatments increased grain yields compared to pu broadcast treatments deep placement of either ub n78 or npk n104 significantly increased grain yields compared to broadcast pu at 104kgnha 1 under both irrigation regimes the magnitude of increase was higher under awd 21 26 compared to csw 13 20 the awd regime significantly reduced grain yields particularly at lower n rates as pu n104 and npk n78 and in higher n rate as ub n156 though the deep placement of npk fertilizer significantly increased grain yields and tdm over pu n104 it did not have a significant effect over ub similar effects were observed for tdm grain yields were significantly higher in 2014 compared to 2015 2016 except at ub n104 table 4 the ub at n104 consistently increased grain yields compared to pu n104 in 2014 and pu n104 and n156 in 2015 2016 grain yields were not significantly different between ub n78 and n104 3 3 nitrogen uptake and agronomic efficiency increasing n rates either as broadcast or deep placement increased n uptake significantly up to n156 over control there were significant water regime x year and fertilizer treatment x year interactions on total n uptake table 5 awd and csw had similar n uptake in 2014 and 2016 but awd had reduced uptake in 2015 table 5 generally in all fertilizer treatments except the control n uptake was significantly higher in 2014 compared to 2015 and 2016 there were significant fertilizer x water regime and fertilizer x year interactions on aen under the csw regime increasing the n rate in either deep placed or broadcast treatments decreased aen but under awd aen decreased significantly with n rate only in ub treatments the highest n uptake and aen was observed in ub n78 under both water regimes which was significantly larger compared to broadcast treatments both ub and npk treatments showed a similar trend under csw however under awd npk reduced aen compared to ub particularly at n78 awd irrigation significantly reduced aen compared to csw except at pu n156 table 5 ub n78 had significantly higher aen compared to pu broadcast and npk except in 2016 table 5 in 2016 both ub and npk at n78 had similar aen 3 4 recovery efficiency of n water regime had no interaction effects with fertilizer treatment and year on n recovery at any growth stages n recovery was increased consistently throughout the rice growth stage in all fertilizer treatments among the fertilizer treatments ub at n78 had the highest recovery at each growth stage table 6 the n recovery at ub n78 was similar to that of ub n104 npk n78 had reduced n recovery compared to ub n78 except at the heading stage at maturity stage there was significant fertilizer x year interaction table 6 generally in all fertilizer treatments the highest n recovery was observed in 2014 compared to 2015 and 2016 in each of the years n recoveries were significantly higher in deep placed than broadcast pu treatments 4 discussion 4 1 dynamics of floodwater nh4 n and nh3 volatilization dynamics of floodwater nh4 n patterns and magnitudes in all fertilizer treatments were similar between awd and csw conditions as both plots were continuously flooded during the measurement period the negligible n losses as floodwater nh4 n and nh3 volatilization from deep placed fertilizer treatments that were observed agree closely with those from previous studies rochette et al 2013 mohanty et al 1999 huda et al 2016 generally the amounts of floodwater nh4 n in deep placed treatments were similar to the control treatment n0 irrespective of n rate this is because the movement of nh4 from the deep soil layer to the surface soil or floodwater is very slow resulting in a significant reduction of nh3 volatilization rochette et al 2013 moreover there might be less soil urease activity in the deeper soil layer leading to less nh4 n in soils and floodwater from hydrolyzed n fertilizers drury et al 2006 liu et al 2006 2015 in contrast the amount of floodwater nh4 n and nh3 volatilization was consistently higher in broadcast pu treatment which increased with n rate these results were in close agreement with previous studies hayashi et al 2006 rochette et al 2013 however in this study cumulative losses of n as nh3 volatilization were relatively low i e 5kgnha 1 or about 4 of applied n the highest nh3 volatilization loss occurred after first topdressing at 6 of applied n when the rice crop was relatively weak sink for n uptake lower n loss as nh3 volatilization was also reported by tian et al 2001 1 6 of applied n at 60 180kgnha 1 and by wang et al 2011 4 16 of applied n at 159 8kgnha 1 in contrast to our results liu et al 2015 reported a larger loss 18 33 of applied n as nh3 volatilization the discrepancy between our findings and their results may be due to variations in soils environmental conditions and measurement techniques our experiment was conducted in clay loam soil while theirs was conducted in sandy loam soil clay soils promote nh4 fixation in soil scherer and ahrens 1996 thus reducing nh3 volatilization in contrast sandy soils help to promote nh4 released from soils into the floodwater nieder et al 2011 thus increased nh3 volatilization the daily air temperature 20 25 c during topdressing was also comparatively low in this study fig 1 compared to liu et al 2015 30 35 c furthermore we observed high nh4 n 10ppm in drain water indicating more lateral seepage loss of n 4 2 grain yields and aboveground biomass fertilizer placement methods affected grain yields differently with irrigation regimes generally udp increased grain yields consistently compared to broadcast pu under both irrigation regimes however the magnitude of yield increase varied with irrigation regime udp with 25 less urea than broadcast pu n78 vs n104 increased grain yields by 24 and 13 under awd and csw irrigation regimes respectively the larger yield increment under awd was due to lower yield of broadcast pu table 4 in broadcast pu treatment particularly at n104 awd irrigation significantly reduced grain yields compared to csw it is likely that awd irrigation increased n loss in broadcast pu treatment causing a limited supply of n to the plants particularly at a lower n rate n104 that resulted in lower yields these results suggest that an n rate of 104kgha 1 for broadcast pu under awd irrigation is not sufficient to produce optimum grain yields and should be increased to 156kgha 1 on the other hand for udp 78kgnha 1 was confirmed to be an optimum n rate for both irrigation regimes since increasing the n rate beyond 78kgha 1 had no significant effect on grain yields grain yields showed a declining trend beyond n104 our results particularly with csw irrigation are consistent with previous studies conducted across different agro ecological zones of bangladesh huda et al 2016 miah et al 2016 the benefits of udp including increased grain yield by 15 20 and urea savings of 25 30 compared with broadcast pu in lowland rice fields are well documented savant and stangel 1990 mohanty et al 1999 bulbule et al 2005 kapoor et al 2008 bandaogo et al 2015 increased grain yields with udp is mainly associated with an increased number of panicles table 3 on the other hand deep placement of npk briquettes albeit at lower n rates produced yields similar to broadcast pu reducing grain yields significantly compared to udp under both irrigation regimes in contrast to our results previous studies reported larger grain yields with npk than with udp miah et al 2016 kapoor et al 2008 the decrease in grain yields in this study is probably associated with a limited supply of p and k particularly at early stages of plant growth because of less p and k in the soils table 1 similar results reported by kapoor et al 2008 in which soils with low level of p and k showed poor crop growth at early stages and consequently decrease rice yield since p and k are not mobile in the soils rice plants may not have been able to take the required p and k from deep placed treatments until the rice root is established and reaches the placement site thus deep placement of p and k should be site specific and is generally not recommended for soils with low p and k as for broadcast pu awd irrigation further reduced grain yields at npk n78 however increasing the n rate from 78kg to 104kg in npk briquettes produced similar yields with udp n78 under both awd and csw irrigation regimes our results confirmed that npk deep placement should be increased to 104kgha 1 further research is needed to study availability of deep placed p and k under awd irrigation nevertheless the deep placement of npk has additional benefits of supplying all primary nutrients at one time ensuring balanced fertilization this is important in countries like bangladesh where farmers often use an excessive amount of n fertilizers with insufficient p and k and where one time application of npk results in labor savings previous studies have suggested that the effects of awd irrigation on grain yields are not consistent and still inconclusive liu et al 2013 chu et al 2015 wang et al 2016 chapagain and yamaji 2010 dong et al 2012 bouman and tuong 2001 bouman et al 2005 sun et al 2012 in a recent literature review lampayan et al 2015 reported that awd irrigation saves water by up to 38 without any significant effects on grain yields however in this study we observed significant interaction of awd x fertilizer treatment and awd x year the effects of awd on grain yields may depend on soil types intensity of soil drying timing of irrigation climatic conditions during the rice growing season n fertilizer management and rice cultivars bouman and tuong 2001 belder et al 2004 zhang et al 2008 2009 liu et al 2013 severe yield reductions may occur in heavy soils due to root damage which affects plant growth sanchez 1973a 1973b the larger reduction in grain yields in 2015 could be due to a longer dry period fig 2 leading to increased n loss as nitrification denitrification liu et al 2010 dong et al 2012 however deep placement of urea briquettes ensured larger grain yields under both irrigation regimes which confirms that adoption of ub n78 with awd irrigation saves both n fertilizers and irrigation water for boro rice cultivation in the areas with climate soils and management practices similar to this experimental site 4 3 nitrogen uptake and nitrogen use efficiency udp significantly increased nitrogen uptake and nitrogen recovery compared to broadcast pu tables 5 and 6 our results were in accord with previous studies kapoor et al 2008 bandaogo et al 2015 liu et al 2015 huda et al 2016 islam et al 2016 the larger n uptake and recovery were observed in deep placed treatment probably because of continuous availability of applied n for plant growth and consequently low n loss through nh3 volatilization and other losses figs 3 and 4 deep placement ensures a continuous supply of n to the plants because n in reduced soil layer retains as nh4 n for a longer time ensuring prolonged n availability for the rice crop kapoor et al 2008 a continuous supply of n in deep placed treatments is evident from n recovery at different growth stages which increased consistently from pi to maturity stages table 6 at maturity the largest n recovery was observed at ub n78 which was almost double 66 that of pu n104 36 moreover ub n78 significantly increased n recovery compared to npk n78 in contrast previous studies reported similar n recovery between udp n78 and npk n78 huda et al 2016 islam et al 2016 though there was a significant fertilizer x water regime interaction effect on grain yields no interaction effect was noted on total n uptake and n recovery these findings are in agreement with the previous findings shad and de datta 1988 belder et al 2004 dong et al 2012 huda et al 2016 islam et al 2016 that water regimes insignificantly influenced tnu and ren our results suggest that though awd irrigation has a direct effect on grain yields it may not affect n uptake and n recovery at least in the short term since there was significant fertilizer x year interaction on nitrogen uptake and grain yields more studies are needed to investigate whether awd irrigation affects nue and soil fertility along with grain yields in the long term the long term studies should focus on different n rates and sources particularly npk briquettes across different rice growing seasons and sites 5 conclusions awd irrigation produced grain yields similar with csw irrigation when n fertilizer was applied as deep placement but it reduced grain yields significantly under conventional n fertilizer management broadcast application particularly at current recommended rate 104kgnha 1 these results suggest that under awd irrigation n rate for broadcast urea should be increased from 104kgha 1 to 156kgha 1 to achieve similar yield with udp 78kgnha 1 fertilizer deep placement reduced floodwater ammonium and ammonia volatilization compared to broadcast pu ub n78 produced significantly higher yields compared to broadcast pu and npk treatments under both awd and csw irrigation regimes n recovery efficiency in deep placed treatments ub and npk 57 66 particularly at n78 was almost double than that of broadcast pu 36 our results confirm that the optimum n rate as deep placement of ub for boro rice cultivation is 78kgha 1 irrespective of irrigation regime on the other hand deep placement of npk briquette had no yield advantage compared with udp at n78 therefore it can be concluded that combination awd irrigation and udp could be used to increase both fertilizer and water use efficiencies for dry season rice boro cultivation

11606,improvement of nitrogen use efficiency nue is a challenging task because of its several losses through ammonia volatilization surface runoff leaching and nitrification denitrification fertilizer deep placement fdp has been proven effective in increasing grain yields and nue under continuous standing water csw condition however the impacts of fdp have not been investigated under alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation field experiments were conducted in the dry seasons during 2014 2016 to determine the interaction effect of fertilizer x water regime on n losses as floodwater ammonium and ammonia volatilization grain yields and nue broadcast prilled urea pu deep placement of urea briquettes ub and nitrogen phosphorus potassium fertilizer briquettes hereafter npk at varied n rates and zero n were tested under awd and csw conditions the deep placement of ub and npk irrespective of n rates and water regimes reduced floodwater ammonium and ammonia volatilization significantly compared to broadcast pu deep placement of either ub n78 or npk n104 increased grain yields under both awd 21 26 and csw 13 20 conditions compared to broadcast pun104 the magnitude of increase was larger under awd because awd significantly reduced grain yields 8 compared to csw at pu n104 however yields of deep placed ub were similar between awd and csw deep placement of ub and npk increased n recovery up to 57 66 from 36 of pun104 these results suggest that ubn78 and npk n104 can be utilized under awd not only for increased grain yield and nue but also to reduce additional pumping cost for irrigation water moreover combined approach of awd and fdp might be a good option for improving water and fertilizer use efficiencies in rice cultivation keywords fertilizer deep placement nitrogen management water saving irrigation ammonia volatilization flux nitrogen use efficiency lowland rice 1 introduction rice occupies about 11 4 million ha of land with the production of 51 64 million tons bbs 2015 boro or dry season rice grown from january february to april may makes up the majority of total production in bangladesh covering about 4 8 million ha while aus from may june to august september and aman from july august to november december are wet seasons in which rice coverage is 1 05 and 5 6 million ha respectively bbs 2015 with the increasing population growth rate it is estimated that the demand for rice will be 56 higher by 2050 than in 2001 36 1million tons mukherjee et al 2011 kabir et al 2015 therefore rice productivity should be increased to meet the food demand of a growing population taking into account the dwindling amount of land area available for farming this requires judicious use of agricultural inputs including quality seeds and fertilizers and irrigation water management among other good agricultural practices fertilizer application and water management are the most important practices in rice production though nitrogen n fertilizer plays a major role in rice production all fertilizers should be applied in a balanced way for increasing crop productivity and improving soil fertility however most farmers in developing countries such as bangladesh are not familiar with balanced fertilization practices they often use excessive n and insufficient phosphorus p and potassium k fertilizers quamruzzaman 2006 with little or no secondary and micronutrient fertilizers moreover farmers apply fertilizers using the conventional broadcast method which leads to lower nutrient use efficiency the nitrogen use efficiency nue in lowland rice is only 30 40 particularly when prilled urea pu is applied via broadcast method resulting in financial losses and harm to the environment ladha et al 2005 savant and stangel 1990 raun et al 2002 the low nue is caused by n losses through ammonia nh3 volatilization surface runoff nitrification and denitrification and leaching savant and stangel 1990 peng et al 2006 hayashi et al 2008 watanabe et al 2009 dong et al 2012 these losses increase when urea is applied via broadcast method one of the major loss mechanisms is nh3 volatilization which reaches up to 50 of applied n sommer et al 2004 in lowland rice fields placement of n in the root zone i e urea deep placement udp reduces n losses and increases nue and crop productivity savant and stangel 1990 rochette et al 2013 huda et al 2016 when urea is deep placed in continuously flooded rice soils losses of n as floodwater ammonium nh4 n nh3 volatilization and nitrous oxide emissions are negligible kapoor et al 2008 rochette et al 2013 gaihre et al 2015 huda et al 2016 with the reduction of these losses udp increases nue up to 80 compared to 30 45 with broadcast application thus udp in rice cultivation reduces n fertilizer required by 30 35 and increases grain yields by up to 15 20 compared to broadcast pu in addition to increased farm profitability udp reduces government subsidy payments in countries where n fertilizer subsidies exist moreover deep placement of compound fertilizer npk briquettes was recently introduced in bangladesh supplying all three major nutrients in a compound briquette miah et al 2016 since many farmers do not practice balanced fertilization quamruzzaman 2006 deep placement of compound fertilizer briquettes offers the potential for higher yields and improves fertilizer use efficiency because of balanced use of nutrients and reduced nutrient losses in most studies related to fertilizer deep placement including deep placement of both urea briquettes ub and npk briquettes fertilizers were tested under continuous standing water csw irrigation regime under csw irrigation regime deep placed n remains in the root zone as nh4 n ensuring continuous supply to plants throughout the growing season depending on soil type in contrast when the irrigation regime is changed from csw to alternate wetting and drying awd the fate of n in the soil particularly dynamics of soil c and n may be changed affecting soil fertility generally awd makes soil c and n unstable increasing their mineralization rates ponnamperuma 1972 and these in turn have important consequences on c and n losses several studies were conducted in different rice growing countries on awd regime and its effects on grain yields and farm profitability however the effects of awd irrigation on rice yields are not consistent and are still inconclusive bouman et al 2005 chapagain and yamaji 2010 liu et al 2013 chu et al 2015 wang et al 2016 on the other hand there are still few studies on the effect of awd irrigation regime on nue particularly under different rates and placement methods of n fertilizers therefore the main objective of this study was to determine the interaction effect of n fertilizer rates and placement methods x water management on rice yields and nue in lowland rice during the dry season the specific objectives of this study were to compare n losses in terms of floodwater nh4 and nh3 volatilization between broadcast pu and deep placed ub and npk at different n rates to determine yields n uptake and nue of boro rice for broadcast pu ub and npk under csw and awd to determine optimum n rates for boro rice cultivation as broadcast pu and deep placement of ub and npk 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and weather conditions the field experiments were conducted in

period are shown in fig 1 the physicochemical properties of the soils before the start and after completion of the experiments are presented in table 1 2 2 experimental design and treatments eight fertilizer treatments with different sources and n rates table 2 were arranged in a split plot design with three replications the awd and csw regimes were the main plots while fertilizer treatments were sub plot treatments fertilizer treatments were combinations of sources and n rates sources of n fertilizer were pu ub and npk n rates were 0 78 104 and 156kgha 1 for ub and npk n rates were 78 and 104 while for pu 78 104 and 156kgha 1 the lowest n rate excluding control treatment started with existing recommended rates i e 78kgnha 1 for deep placement and 104kgnha 1 for broadcast application miah et al 2016 huda et al 2016 the size and number of briquettes per placement site were determined based on n rates deep placement of one 2 7g ub at 40 40cm spacing 62 500 placement

maintained 2 3 crop management phosphorus triple superphosphate tsp and potassium muriate of potash mop fertilizers were applied during final land preparation as basal treatments in all plots except the plots receiving npk at 25kg p and 85kgkha 1 in npk treatments p and k were included in the briquettes pu was applied as broadcast in three equal splits at seven to ten days after transplanting dat at maximum tillering and at panicle initiation stages while ub and npk were deep placed at 7 10cm depth at the center of four rice hills as a single application in addition sulfur s and zinc zn were applied to all plots as basal treatments at 15kg s as gypsum and 3kg zn ha 1 as zinc sulfate two to three rice seedlings per hill of variety brri dhan28 were transplanted with a spacing of 20 20cm table 3 shows the major crop management practices all the plots under csw conditions were maintained continuously flooded until two weeks before harvesting while plots under awd conditions were irrigated following awd principles plots were irrigated when water depth in awd pipers was 12 15cm below soil surface awd irrigation was adopted one week after first topdressing of pu or udp and continued until two weeks before harvesting however plots under awd conditions were maintained continuously flooded for a week after topdressing td of pu and during flowering stage as under csw plots to monitor floodwater depth in awd plots a 25cm long 10cm diameter pvc pipe perforated up to 15cm was inserted 15cm into the soil perforated side down leaving 10cm above the ground soils inside the pipe were removed to make a hole up to the 15cm water depth inside the pvc pipes was monitored every day after transplanting and plots were irrigated when water depth in awd pipes were 12 15cm below the soil surface fig 2 2 4 floodwater nh4 n and nh3 volatilization floodwater samples were collected for seven consecutive days after each fertilizer application i e basal fertilization deep placement of fertilizers and topdressing floodwater samples 5ml floodwater plus 0 5ml nessler s reagent were analyzed for nh4 n using a spectrophotometer at 420nm wave length bear 1967 the concentration of nh4

zhong cheng et al 2012 a plastic bucket was used as a chamber a vacuum pump was used to suck air samples from a chamber nitrogen present in air samples was trapped by a boric acid solution 2 in a volumetric flask plastic buckets 13l were placed between rice rows after each n application for seven consecutive days the nh3 content in the volumetric flask was collected until the color changed from violet to green then trapped nh3 was determined by titration with standard acid volatilization measurements were done only under csw irrigation regime in 2015 and 2016 2 5 rice yield and nue

probability 3 results 3 1 dynamics of floodwater nh4 n and nh3 volatilization deep placement of either ub or npk irrespective of n rates reduced floodwater nh4 n compared to broadcast pu fig 3 these results were consistent across water regimes and years the broadcast pu resulted in a significant amount of nh4 n in floodwater which varied over time the peaks in nh4 n were observed after two to three days of fertilizer application and then sharply declined moreover the amount of nh4 n increased with larger n rates of pu in contrast increasing n rates in ub and npk treatments had no significant effect on floodwater nh4 n on the other hand effects of water regimes were not apparent both csw and awd plots showed similar pattern and magnitudes under each fertilizer treatment as with floodwater nh4 n the magnitude of nh3 volatilization in pu treatment was higher while it was negligible from udp treatments fig 4 deep placement of ub significantly reduced nh3 volatilization compared to broadcast pu in all measurements since ub was deep placed once at 7 10cm below the soil surface during the first td of pu the magnitude of nh3 volatilization in ub treatments was comparatively higher during the first td compared to the second and third td periods over the years the pattern of nh3 volatilization in pu treatments was similar in all measurement periods the n loss as nh3 volatilization in pu treatments was about 4 of the applied n while in ub treatments it was only about 1 3 2 grain yield and aboveground biomass fertilizer treatments had significant interaction effects with water regime and year on the number of panicles grain yields and aboveground tdm table 4 nitrogen fertilizer irrespective of rates and methods of application significantly increased the number of panicles per unit area grain yields and tdm under both irrigation regimes compared to the control treatment awd irrigation significantly reduced grain yields and tdm compared to csw irrigation when n fertilizer was applied as broadcast method therefore under awd irrigation increasing the n rate from 104kg to 156kg broadcast significantly increased grain yields and tdm but the effects were not significant under csw regime on the other hand for ub increasing n rates from 78kg to 156kg had no significant effect on grain yields under both water regimes grain yields showed a declining trend beyond 104kg in contrast to ub deep placement of npk increased grain yields when the n rate was increased from 78kg to 104 under the awd regime although it was not significant under the csw irrigation regime in general deep placed treatments increased grain yields compared to pu broadcast treatments deep placement of either ub n78 or npk n104 significantly increased grain yields compared to broadcast pu at 104kgnha 1 under both irrigation regimes the magnitude of increase was higher under awd 21 26 compared to csw 13 20 the awd regime significantly reduced grain yields particularly at lower n rates as pu n104 and npk n78 and in higher n rate as ub n156 though the deep placement of npk fertilizer significantly increased grain yields and tdm over pu n104 it did not have a significant effect over ub similar effects were observed for tdm grain yields were significantly higher in 2014 compared to 2015 2016 except at ub n104 table 4 the ub at n104 consistently increased grain yields compared to pu n104 in 2014 and pu n104 and n156 in 2015 2016 grain yields were not significantly different between ub n78 and n104 3 3 nitrogen uptake and agronomic efficiency increasing n rates either as broadcast or deep placement increased n uptake significantly up to n156 over control there were significant water regime x year and fertilizer treatment x year interactions on total n uptake table 5 awd and csw had similar n uptake in 2014 and 2016 but awd had reduced uptake in 2015 table 5 generally in all fertilizer treatments except the control n uptake was significantly higher in 2014 compared to 2015 and 2016 there were significant fertilizer x water regime and fertilizer x year interactions on aen under the csw regime increasing the n rate in either deep placed or broadcast treatments decreased aen but under awd aen decreased significantly with n rate only in ub treatments the highest n uptake and aen was observed in ub n78 under both water regimes which was significantly larger compared to broadcast treatments both ub and npk treatments showed a similar trend under csw however under awd npk reduced aen compared to ub particularly at n78 awd irrigation significantly reduced aen compared to csw except at pu n156 table 5 ub n78 had significantly higher aen compared to pu broadcast and npk except in 2016 table 5 in 2016 both ub and npk at n78 had similar aen 3 4 recovery efficiency of n water regime had no interaction effects with fertilizer treatment and year on n recovery at any growth stages n recovery was increased consistently throughout the rice growth stage in all fertilizer treatments among the fertilizer treatments ub at n78 had the highest recovery at each growth stage table 6 the n recovery at ub n78 was similar to that of ub n104 npk n78 had reduced n recovery compared to ub n78 except at the heading stage at maturity stage there was significant fertilizer x year interaction table 6 generally in all fertilizer treatments the highest n recovery was observed in 2014 compared to 2015 and 2016 in each of the years n recoveries were significantly higher in deep placed than broadcast pu treatments 4 discussion 4 1 dynamics of floodwater nh4 n and nh3 volatilization dynamics of floodwater nh4 n patterns and magnitudes in all fertilizer treatments were similar between awd and csw conditions as both plots were continuously flooded during the measurement period the negligible n losses as floodwater nh4 n and nh3 volatilization from deep placed fertilizer treatments that were observed agree closely with those from previous studies rochette et al 2013 mohanty et al 1999 huda et al 2016 generally the amounts of floodwater nh4 n in deep placed treatments were similar to the control treatment n0 irrespective of n rate this is because the movement of nh4 from the deep soil layer to the surface soil or floodwater is very slow resulting in a significant reduction of nh3 volatilization rochette et al 2013 moreover there might be less soil urease activity in the deeper soil layer leading to less nh4 n in soils and floodwater from hydrolyzed n fertilizers drury et al 2006 liu et al 2006 2015 in contrast the amount of floodwater nh4 n and nh3 volatilization was consistently higher in broadcast pu treatment which increased with n rate these results were in close agreement with previous studies hayashi et al 2006 rochette et al 2013 however in this study cumulative losses of n as nh3 volatilization were relatively low i e 5kgnha 1 or about 4 of applied n the highest nh3 volatilization loss occurred after first topdressing at 6 of applied n when the rice crop was relatively weak sink for n uptake lower n loss as nh3 volatilization was also reported by tian et al 2001 1 6 of applied n at 60 180kgnha 1 and by wang et al 2011 4 16 of applied n at 159 8kgnha 1 in contrast to our results liu et al 2015 reported a larger loss 18 33 of applied n as nh3 volatilization the discrepancy between our findings and their results may be due to variations in soils environmental conditions and measurement techniques our experiment was conducted in clay loam soil while theirs was conducted in sandy loam soil clay soils promote nh4 fixation in soil scherer and ahrens 1996 thus reducing nh3 volatilization in contrast sandy soils help to promote nh4 released from soils into the floodwater nieder et al 2011 thus increased nh3 volatilization the daily air temperature 20 25 c during topdressing was also comparatively low in this study fig 1 compared to liu et al 2015 30 35 c furthermore we observed high nh4 n 10ppm in drain water indicating more lateral seepage loss of n 4 2 grain yields and aboveground biomass fertilizer placement methods affected grain yields differently with irrigation regimes generally udp increased grain yields consistently compared to broadcast pu under both irrigation regimes however the magnitude of yield increase varied with irrigation regime udp with 25 less urea than broadcast pu n78 vs n104 increased grain yields by 24 and 13 under awd and csw irrigation regimes respectively the larger yield increment under awd was due to lower yield of broadcast pu table 4 in broadcast pu treatment particularly at n104 awd irrigation significantly reduced grain yields compared to csw it is likely that awd irrigation increased n loss in broadcast pu treatment causing a limited supply of n to the plants particularly at a lower n rate n104 that resulted in lower yields these results suggest that an n rate of 104kgha 1 for broadcast pu under awd irrigation is not sufficient to produce optimum grain yields and should be increased to 156kgha 1 on the other hand for udp 78kgnha 1 was confirmed to be an optimum n rate for both irrigation regimes since increasing the n rate beyond 78kgha 1 had no significant effect on grain yields grain yields showed a declining trend beyond n104 our results particularly with csw irrigation are consistent with previous studies conducted across different agro ecological zones of bangladesh huda et al 2016 miah et al 2016 the benefits of udp including increased grain yield by 15 20 and urea savings of 25 30 compared with broadcast pu in lowland rice fields are well documented savant and stangel 1990 mohanty et al 1999 bulbule et al 2005 kapoor et al 2008 bandaogo et al 2015 increased grain yields with udp is mainly associated with an increased number of panicles table 3 on the other hand deep placement of npk briquettes albeit at lower n rates produced yields similar to broadcast pu reducing grain yields significantly compared to udp under both irrigation regimes in contrast to our results previous studies reported larger grain yields with npk than with udp miah et al 2016 kapoor et al 2008 the decrease in grain yields in this study is probably associated with a limited supply of p and k particularly at early stages of plant growth because of less p and k in the soils table 1 similar results reported by kapoor et al 2008 in which soils with low level of p and k showed poor crop growth at early stages and consequently decrease rice yield since p and k are not mobile in the soils rice plants may not have been able to take the required p and k from deep placed treatments until the rice root is established and reaches the placement site thus deep placement of p and k should be site specific and is generally not recommended for soils with low p and k as for broadcast pu awd irrigation further reduced grain yields at npk n78 however increasing the n rate from 78kg to 104kg in npk briquettes produced similar yields with udp n78 under both awd and csw irrigation regimes our results confirmed that npk deep placement should be increased to 104kgha 1 further research is needed to study availability of deep placed p and k under awd irrigation nevertheless the deep placement of npk has additional benefits of supplying all primary nutrients at one time ensuring balanced fertilization this is important in countries like bangladesh where farmers often use an excessive amount of n fertilizers with insufficient p and k and where one time application of npk results in labor savings previous studies have suggested that the effects of awd irrigation on grain yields are not consistent and still inconclusive liu et al 2013 chu et al 2015 wang et al 2016 chapagain and yamaji 2010 dong et al 2012 bouman and tuong 2001 bouman et al 2005 sun et al 2012 in a recent literature review lampayan et al 2015 reported that awd irrigation saves water by up to 38 without any significant effects on grain yields however in this study we observed significant interaction of awd x fertilizer treatment and awd x year the effects of awd on grain yields may depend on soil types intensity of soil drying timing of irrigation climatic conditions during the rice growing season n fertilizer management and rice cultivars bouman and tuong 2001 belder et al 2004 zhang et al 2008 2009 liu et al 2013 severe yield reductions may occur in heavy soils due to root damage which affects plant growth sanchez 1973a 1973b the larger reduction in grain yields in 2015 could be due to a longer dry period fig 2 leading to increased n loss as nitrification denitrification liu et al 2010 dong et al 2012 however deep placement of urea briquettes ensured larger grain yields under both irrigation regimes which confirms that adoption of ub n78 with awd irrigation saves both n fertilizers and irrigation water for boro rice cultivation in the areas with climate soils and management practices similar to this experimental site 4 3 nitrogen uptake and nitrogen use efficiency udp significantly increased nitrogen uptake and nitrogen recovery compared to broadcast pu tables 5 and 6 our results were in accord with previous studies kapoor et al 2008 bandaogo et al 2015 liu et al 2015 huda et al 2016 islam et al 2016 the larger n uptake and recovery were observed in deep placed treatment probably because of continuous availability of applied n for plant growth and consequently low n loss through nh3 volatilization and other losses figs 3 and 4 deep placement ensures a continuous supply of n to the plants because n in reduced soil layer retains as nh4 n for a longer time ensuring prolonged n availability for the rice crop kapoor et al 2008 a continuous supply of n in deep placed treatments is evident from n recovery at different growth stages which increased consistently from pi to maturity stages table 6 at maturity the largest n recovery was observed at ub n78 which was almost double 66 that of pu n104 36 moreover ub n78 significantly increased n recovery compared to npk n78 in contrast previous studies reported similar n recovery between udp n78 and npk n78 huda et al 2016 islam et al 2016 though there was a significant fertilizer x water regime interaction effect on grain yields no interaction effect was noted on total n uptake and n recovery these findings are in agreement with the previous findings shad and de datta 1988 belder et al 2004 dong et al 2012 huda et al 2016 islam et al 2016 that water regimes insignificantly influenced tnu and ren our results suggest that though awd irrigation has a direct effect on grain yields it may not affect n uptake and n recovery at least in the short term since there was significant fertilizer x year interaction on nitrogen uptake and grain yields more studies are needed to investigate whether awd irrigation affects nue and soil fertility along with grain yields in the long term the long term studies should focus on different n rates and sources particularly npk briquettes across different rice growing seasons and sites 5 conclusions awd irrigation produced grain yields similar with csw irrigation when n fertilizer was applied as deep placement but it reduced grain yields significantly under conventional n fertilizer management broadcast application particularly at current recommended rate 104kgnha 1 these results suggest that under awd irrigation n rate for broadcast urea should be increased from 104kgha 1 to 156kgha 1 to achieve similar yield with udp 78kgnha 1 fertilizer deep placement reduced floodwater ammonium and ammonia volatilization compared to broadcast pu ub n78 produced significantly higher yields compared to broadcast pu and npk treatments under both awd and csw irrigation regimes n recovery efficiency in deep placed treatments ub and npk 57 66 particularly at n78 was almost double than that of broadcast pu 36 our results confirm that the optimum n rate as deep placement of ub for boro rice cultivation is 78kgha 1 irrespective of irrigation regime on the other hand deep placement of npk briquette had no yield advantage compared with udp at n78 therefore it can be concluded that combination awd irrigation and udp could be used to increase both fertilizer and water use efficiencies for dry season rice boro cultivation

transport in drip irrigated lysimeters with the same boundary conditions as those simulated in this study vertical root distribution was defined according to the model of vrugt et al 2001 with maximum rooting depth of 50cm depth of maximum intensity of 10cm and the shape parameter pz set as 2 horizontal root distribution was homogeneous sigmoidal response functions were used in order to simulate both water and osmotic stresses van genuchten 1987 when both stresses were included in the simulation their effect was assumed to be multiplicative van genuchten 1987 the parameters defining the sigmoidal shaped functions are defined in table 3 as calculated in groenveld 2010 for similar conditions compensated root water uptake was considered by setting the critical stress index to 0 8 šimůnek and hopmans 2009 all simulations were considered to have potential root water uptake reduction due to water stress five cases for the 0 5m2 lysimeter table 1 were considered to have additional solute stress according to the parameters in table 3 initial condition for water flow in all simulations was defined as hydrostatic equilibrium with a pressure head of 30cm at the bottom of the soil profile initial soil solution concentration was defined as 1 3mgcm 3 a value close to the steady state drainage concentration irrigation was applied in four or two circular areas for the 1m2 and 0 5m2 lysimeters respectively representing drippers each with a radius of 2 5cm defined as variable flux boundary conditions fig 1 1m2 domain two circular drainage exits each with a radius of 2 5cm were delineated at the lower boundary of the lysimeter this boundary was specified as a seepage face with a pressure head of 30cm such that outflow occurs when the pressure head at the bottom boundary reaches 30cm the rest of the boundaries of the domain were designated as no flow solute transport at both the upper and lower boundaries was assigned as a cauchy boundary condition although this study focuses on numerical work soil hydraulic and transport parameters et leaching fraction and irrigation quality were obtained from a field experiment performed with lysimeters similar in their design as

an average discharge rate of 1 6lh 1 uniram rc netafim israel for each simulation every dripper in the model represented as a variable flux area received a different discharge rate according to the cv level and normal distribution 2 and 4 values for the 0 5m2 and 1m2 respectively 2 4 modeled soil variability knowledge of soil hydraulic properties is crucial for a proper evaluation of physical and chemical processes within the vadose zone involved in variably saturated water flow and transport of water dissolved salts lazarovitch et al 2007 the van genuchten mualem mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 soil hydraulic model was used to relate the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and volumetric water content to the pressure head parameters in table 2 average saturated hydraulic conductivity for loamy sand soil was taken from raij et al 2016 as 145cmday 1 the coefficient of variation of the saturated hydraulic conductivity eq 1 was set to three levels 0 5 expected variability warrick 2003 0 25 low and 1 high 1 σ c v k s where σ is standard deviation and k s is average saturated hydraulic conductivity the randomly distributed saturated hydraulic conductivity k sn was represented by a log normal distribution lazarovitch et al 2006b and therefore log transformed 2 ksn lnksn where k sn is the log transformed randomly distributed saturated hydraulic conductivity the log transformed hydraulic conductivity k s together with its log transformed standard deviation σ was defined by warrick 2003 eqs 3 and 4 as 3 k s exp k s 0 5 σ 2 4 σ 2 exp 2 k s σ 2 exp σ 2 1 the corresponding k sn is 5 k s n k s σ z where z is a random number from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of unity from eqs 2 and 5 k sn was calculated as 6 k s n exp k s σ z a gaussian sequential simulation was used in order to generate a random field for z in three dimensions sgems software a random sample was generated using an exponential model 7 γ h c 0 1 exp h a where γ is the sample variogram a is the practical range 30cm used in this case h is the lag distance l and c 0 is the sill value 1 finally k sn values were divided by the average k s and the values were imported as scaling factors αk in eq 8 in the three dimensional mesh in hydrus 2d 3d these scaling factors were used by the model according to eq 8 for the simulation of the heterogeneous unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k h a visualization of the scaling factors of one representative simulation for each cv value is presented in fig 3 8 k h α k k h 2 5 combined heterogeneities a set of simulations was performed for the 0 5m2 lysimeters with combined heterogeneity of irrigation rate and heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity scenario 13 in table 1 this combination was performed by using the previously generated files of the 100 simulations in which soil and irrigation heterogeneities were evaluated individually the files describing the time dependent atmospheric boundary conditions atmosph in and the graphic domain information domain dat including irrigation and soil heterogeneity information respectively were included in each simulation 2 6 sensitivity analysis leaching fraction a sensitivity analysis was performed in order to study the effect of lf on the variability of each drainage amount and concentration two lfs 0 20 and 0 33 were simulated in addition to the previously simulated lf of 0 43 scenarios 14 17 2 and 8 in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil and irrigation heterogeneities as expected the higher the imposed irrigation or soil heterogeneity the higher the variability of either the measured drainage amount or concentration while increasing heterogeneity of the soil hydraulic conductivity brought about higher variability regarding the drainage cl concentration heterogeneity in irrigation rate produced higher variability in the drainage amounts figs 4 7 drainage flux is a result of the balance between the irrigation amount and precipitation et and water storage in the soil profile in this study there was no precipitation and a fixed high irrigation regime supplying excess water to insure salt leaching was maintained so that there was no et reduction due to water stress these conditions drove the system to a quasi steady state with minimal changes in soil water storage tripler et al 2012 therefore drainage flux was directly affected by the irrigation amount controlled in this case by the irrigation heterogeneity variability in the quantity of drainage reached even larger values than the imposed cv of the irrigation rates fig 7 a water content and velocities in the profile were affected by the heterogeneity of k h but did not affect water uptake or alter the water balance therefore variability of the drainage amount when soil heterogeneity was applied remained low fig 5 a despite the consideration of a 4 day average for the calculation of drainage amount cv a high variability of the cv values was observed fig 5 a due to the strong variability in drainage amount fig 2 the fixed irrigation to et ratio insured equilibrium of the drainage water chloride concentration so that heterogeneity in irrigation quantity caused only a small variability in the drainage concentration conversely heterogeneity of k h caused higher variability of the drainage concentration due to increased or reduced solute dispersion and spreading as pore water velocity was varied mousavi nezhad et al 2011 russo 1998 weihermüller et al 2006 variability in drainage flux or concentration decreased when lysimeter surface area increased the larger the lysimeter the smaller the resulting cv figs 5 and 7 this was found for concentration of cl in drainage when either heterogeneity of irrigation rate or k h were applied figs 5 and 7 b variability of drainage volume was found to increase with increased surface area only when heterogeneity of irrigation rate was applied fig 7 a and was not consistently affected by heterogeneity of k h fig 5 a there was a gradual decrease in the ratio of the variability between the lysimeters with different surface areas as the imposed irrigation heterogeneity increased for both drainage amount 1 49 1 40 and 1 36 for irrigation rate cvs of 0 02 0 044 and 0 09 respectively fig 7 a and for chloride concentration 1 08 1 05 and 1 01 for cvs of 0 02 0 044 and 0 09 respectively fig 7 b these data show that as heterogeneity in irrigation rate increased the relative gained benefit from increasing the lysimeter size decreased no such effect was observed regarding heterogeneity of soil hydraulic conductivity 3 2 combined heterogeneities a set of 100 simulations for each of the 1 and 0 5m2 lysimeters was performed for cases of simultaneous dripper discharge rate and k h heterogeneities the variability of drainage volume that resulted from the combined heterogeneities for both lysimeter dimensions was very similar to that obtained when only irrigation heterogeneity was simulated fig 8 a in a similar manner the variability in drainage cl concentration of the combined heterogeneities was very similar to that obtained when only k h heterogeneity was simulated fig 8 b the fact that the cv of the results approximated the highest cv value obtained when considering each source of heterogeneity separately indicates that simultaneous heterogeneities did not cause a synergistic effect and did not add variation fig 8 a and b warrick and gardner 1983 similarly found that soil and irrigation variability were not additive in their effects on yield these results can be useful if there is knowledge of the factors causing heterogeneity in the field allowing investment of energy to reduce only the factor which most influences heterogeneity and according to the type of data that wants to be collected from the lysimeter 3 3 sensitivity analysis of the leaching fraction variabilities in drainage amount and cl concentration were tested for three lfs in the 0 5m2 lysimeter there was no root water uptake reduction due to matric stress such that average actual lfs were constant along the season small changes in actual lf from day to day data not shown were related to the response time between irrigation and drainage and the daily et variability fig 2 an increase in lf decreased the effect of soil and irrigation heterogeneity on drainage cl concentration variability fig 9 b for the variability of drainage amount a change in lf had influence only when heterogeneity of the irrigation rate was considered fig 9 a the variability of the drainage amount as a function of heterogeneity in irrigation rate was higher for the smaller lf however the standard deviation of the drainage amount was lower for the smaller lf this was due to the large differences in average drainage amount as a consequence of the different lfs these results support the classic approach of increasing irrigation amount in order to overcome the negative effects of low irrigation uniformity on yield letey et al 1984 when irrigating with brackish water there is a basic need to irrigate in excess in order to prevent salt accumulation such practice could therefore eliminate any effect of irrigation uniformity on yield as in the study presented by zhao et al 2012 where different irrigation uniformity levels did not affected drip irrigated cabbage growth yield or quality in addition variability in soil water content may be lower than irrigation imposed variability due to water movement and redistribution in sprinkler irrigation li 1998 causing consequential lower variability of water availability sensed by plants for the hypothetical crop in the present work and under the specified conditions no root water uptake reduction was simulated and therefore no yield reduction was predicted different levels and types of heterogeneity did not produce any variability or uncertainty in the hypothetical yield a function of et however the focus of this numerical exercise was to understand the uncertainty from lysimeter data regarding water and solute balances and not to evaluate yield or its variability 3 4 osmotic stress five cases were chosen in order to understand the behavior of variability for a salt sensitive crop under conditions leading to reduced root water uptake in the smaller lysimeters the five cases included low and high lfs with soil or irrigation heterogeneity and low lf with combined soil and irrigation heterogeneity table 1 overall cvs were lower for simulations where root water uptake was reduced due to relatively high drainage amounts and higher drainage cl concentrations fig 10 a and b the same trends observed in the simulations with no osmotic stress were repeated in these simulations fig 10 1 heterogeneity in soil hydraulic conductivity yielded higher variability in drainage concentration while heterogeneity in irrigation rate caused higher variability in drainage amount 2 when considering both sources of heterogeneity simultaneously no synergistic effect was observed cvs of both drainage volume and concentration were very similar to those produced by either heterogeneity of irrigation rate or soil k h alone 3 higher irrigation levels produced lower variabilities in both drainage amount and concentration actual lfs increased along the season due to root water uptake reduction final lf values were 0 38 and 0 37 for simulations with target lf of 0 20 soil k h and irrigation rate respectively and 0 51 for all the simulations with target lf of 0 43 variability cv values of actual root water uptake after reduction due to solute stress was generally low with maximum values at day 200 of 0 02 for heterogeneity due to soil k h and 0 01 for heterogeneity due to irrigation rate for both irrigation levels data not shown 4 conclusions when relying on lysimeter data for irrigation management with low quality water either drainage amount or concentration can be used the drainage amount allows estimation of et while the drainage solute concentration or ec electrical conductivity provides capability to calculate actual lf the results from the numerical experiments performed in this study can add confidence to decision making using either drainage amount or concentration according to the variability found for each variability was found to depend on the level of heterogeneity imposed by the system soil hydraulic conductivity or irrigation discharge rate in this case leaching fraction and or lysimeter size when heterogeneity of irrigation supply rate was high the drainage cl concentration had a lower variability leading to the conclusion that it can be more reliable for management decisions than the highly uncertain drainage amount contrarily in a case of low heterogeneity or uncertainty of irrigation application rate the et calculated with the water balance of the lysimeter will represent a more accurate measurement than the lf calculated using drainage cl concentration combining heterogeneities of soil hydraulic conductivity and irrigation discharge rate did not cause a synergistic effect the measured variability in the results was very similar to the highest value caused by either of the imposed heterogeneities when applied alone higher irrigation levels increased lfs decreased the variability of the drainage concentration for both sources of heterogeneity and also decreased the variability of drainage amount under heterogeneity due to irrigation discharge rate increasing the irrigation amount did not decrease variability in drainage amount when heterogeneity was due to soil hydraulic conductivity the results of these numerical experiments are also applicable to cases of irrigation with water high in salts and conditions causing reduced water uptake acknowledgments this research was partially supported by the israel ministry of agriculture and rural development eugene kandel knowledge centers as part of the root of the matter

tetrahedral elements the soil hydraulic and transport properties were as defined in raij et al 2016 for a loamy sand soil table 2 raij et al 2016 calibrated the hydrus 2d 3d model with major ion transport in drip irrigated lysimeters with the same boundary conditions as those simulated in this study vertical root distribution was defined according to the model of vrugt et al 2001 with maximum rooting depth of 50cm depth of maximum intensity of 10cm and the shape parameter pz set as 2 horizontal root distribution was homogeneous sigmoidal response functions were used in order to simulate both water and osmotic stresses van genuchten 1987 when both stresses were included in the simulation their effect was assumed to be multiplicative van genuchten 1987 the parameters defining the sigmoidal shaped functions are defined in table 3 as calculated in groenveld 2010 for similar conditions compensated root water uptake was considered by setting the critical stress index to 0 8 šimůnek and hopmans 2009 all simulations were considered to have potential root water uptake reduction due to water stress five cases for the 0 5m2 lysimeter table 1 were considered to have additional solute stress according to the parameters in table 3 initial condition for water flow in all simulations was defined as hydrostatic equilibrium with a pressure head of 30cm at the bottom of the soil profile initial soil solution concentration was defined as 1 3mgcm 3 a value close to the steady state drainage concentration irrigation was applied in four or two circular areas for the 1m2 and 0 5m2 lysimeters respectively representing drippers each with a radius of 2 5cm defined as variable flux boundary conditions fig 1 1m2 domain two circular drainage exits each with a radius of 2 5cm were delineated at the lower boundary of the lysimeter this boundary was specified as a seepage face with a pressure head of 30cm such that outflow occurs when the pressure head at the bottom boundary reaches 30cm the rest of the boundaries of the domain were designated as no flow solute transport at both the upper and lower boundaries was assigned as a cauchy boundary condition although this study focuses on numerical work soil hydraulic and transport parameters et leaching fraction and irrigation quality were obtained from a field experiment performed with lysimeters similar in their design as the ones simulated in the preliminary field experiment bell pepper plants were grown in five 1m2 weighing lysimeters filled with loamy sand soil and daily evapotranspiration et was measured irrigation

volume of irrigation water in the model et was considered only as root water uptake without separation between evaporation and transpiration the measured et values were set as the potential transpiration or root water uptake chloride concentration in the irrigation water was 0 8mgcm 3 2 3 modeled irrigation variability average dripper discharge rate was 1 6lh 1 with a predefined variability a normal distribution was assumed for each of three coefficient of variation cv levels 0 02 0 044 and 0 09 the middle value 0 044 was measured under field conditions for 108 drippers with an average discharge rate of 1 6lh 1 uniram rc netafim israel for each simulation every dripper in the model represented as a variable flux area received a different discharge rate according to the cv level and normal distribution 2 and 4 values for the 0 5m2 and 1m2 respectively 2 4 modeled soil variability knowledge of soil hydraulic properties is crucial for a proper evaluation of physical and chemical processes within the vadose zone involved in variably saturated water flow and transport of water dissolved salts lazarovitch et al 2007 the van genuchten mualem mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 soil hydraulic model was used to relate the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and volumetric water content to the pressure head parameters in table 2 average saturated hydraulic conductivity for loamy sand soil was taken from raij et al 2016 as 145cmday 1 the coefficient of variation of the saturated hydraulic conductivity eq 1 was set to three levels 0 5 expected variability warrick 2003 0 25 low and 1 high 1 σ c v k s where σ is standard deviation and k s is average saturated hydraulic conductivity the randomly distributed saturated hydraulic conductivity k sn was represented by a log normal distribution lazarovitch et al 2006b and therefore log transformed 2 ksn lnksn where k sn is the log transformed randomly distributed saturated hydraulic conductivity the log transformed hydraulic conductivity k s together with its log transformed standard deviation σ was defined by warrick 2003 eqs 3 and 4 as 3 k s exp k s 0 5 σ 2 4 σ 2 exp 2 k s σ 2 exp σ 2 1 the corresponding k sn is 5 k s n k s σ z where z is a random number from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of unity from eqs 2 and 5 k sn was calculated as 6 k s n exp k s σ z a gaussian sequential simulation was used in order to generate a random field for z in three dimensions sgems software a random sample was generated using an exponential model 7 γ h c 0 1 exp h a where γ is the sample variogram a is the practical range 30cm used in this case h is the lag distance l and c 0 is the sill value 1 finally k sn values were divided by the average k s and the values were imported as scaling factors αk in eq 8 in the three dimensional mesh in hydrus 2d 3d these scaling factors were used by the model according to eq 8 for the simulation of the heterogeneous unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k h a visualization of the scaling factors of one representative simulation for each cv value is presented in fig 3 8 k h α k k h 2 5 combined heterogeneities a set of simulations was performed for the 0 5m2 lysimeters with combined heterogeneity of irrigation rate and heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity scenario 13 in table 1 this combination was performed by using the previously generated files of the 100 simulations in which soil and irrigation heterogeneities were evaluated individually the files describing the time dependent atmospheric boundary conditions atmosph in and the graphic domain information domain dat including irrigation and soil heterogeneity information respectively were included in each simulation 2 6 sensitivity analysis leaching fraction a sensitivity analysis was performed in order to study the effect of lf on the variability of each drainage amount and concentration two lfs 0 20 and 0 33 were simulated in addition to the previously simulated lf of 0 43 scenarios 14 17 2 and 8 in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil and irrigation heterogeneities as expected the higher the imposed irrigation or soil heterogeneity the higher the variability of either the measured drainage amount or concentration while increasing heterogeneity of the soil hydraulic conductivity brought about higher variability regarding the drainage cl concentration heterogeneity in irrigation rate produced higher variability in the drainage amounts figs 4 7 drainage flux is a result of the balance between the irrigation amount and precipitation et and water storage in the soil profile in this study there was no precipitation and a fixed high irrigation regime supplying excess water to insure salt leaching was maintained so that there was no et reduction due to water stress these conditions drove the system to a quasi steady state with minimal changes in soil water storage tripler et al 2012 therefore drainage flux was directly affected by the irrigation amount controlled in this case by the irrigation heterogeneity variability in the quantity of drainage reached even larger values than the imposed cv of the irrigation rates fig 7 a water content and velocities in the profile were affected by the heterogeneity of k h but did not affect water uptake or alter the water balance therefore variability of the drainage amount when soil heterogeneity was applied remained low fig 5 a despite the consideration of a 4 day average for the calculation of drainage amount cv a high variability of the cv values was observed fig 5 a due to the strong variability in drainage amount fig 2 the fixed irrigation to et ratio insured equilibrium of the drainage water chloride concentration so that heterogeneity in irrigation quantity caused only a small variability in the drainage concentration conversely heterogeneity of k h caused higher variability of the drainage concentration due to increased or reduced solute dispersion and spreading as pore water velocity was varied mousavi nezhad et al 2011 russo 1998 weihermüller et al 2006 variability in drainage flux or concentration decreased when lysimeter surface area increased the larger the lysimeter the smaller the resulting cv figs 5 and 7 this was found for concentration of cl in drainage when either heterogeneity of irrigation rate or k h were applied figs 5 and 7 b variability of drainage volume was found to increase with increased surface area only when heterogeneity of irrigation rate was applied fig 7 a and was not consistently affected by heterogeneity of k h fig 5 a there was a gradual decrease in the ratio of the variability between the lysimeters with different surface areas as the imposed irrigation heterogeneity increased for both drainage amount 1 49 1 40 and 1 36 for irrigation rate cvs of 0 02 0 044 and 0 09 respectively fig 7 a and for chloride concentration 1 08 1 05 and 1 01 for cvs of 0 02 0 044 and 0 09 respectively fig 7 b these data show that as heterogeneity in irrigation rate increased the relative gained benefit from increasing the lysimeter size decreased no such effect was observed regarding heterogeneity of soil hydraulic conductivity 3 2 combined heterogeneities a set of 100 simulations for each of the 1 and 0 5m2 lysimeters was performed for cases of simultaneous dripper discharge rate and k h heterogeneities the variability of drainage volume that resulted from the combined heterogeneities for both lysimeter dimensions was very similar to that obtained when only irrigation heterogeneity was simulated fig 8 a in a similar manner the variability in drainage cl concentration of the combined heterogeneities was very similar to that obtained when only k h heterogeneity was simulated fig 8 b the fact that the cv of the results approximated the highest cv value obtained when considering each source of heterogeneity separately indicates that simultaneous heterogeneities did not cause a synergistic effect and did not add variation fig 8 a and b warrick and gardner 1983 similarly found that soil and irrigation variability were not additive in their effects on yield these results can be useful if there is knowledge of the factors causing heterogeneity in the field allowing investment of energy to reduce only the factor which most influences heterogeneity and according to the type of data that wants to be collected from the lysimeter 3 3 sensitivity analysis of the leaching fraction variabilities in drainage amount and cl concentration were tested for three lfs in the 0 5m2 lysimeter there was no root water uptake reduction due to matric stress such that average actual lfs were constant along the season small changes in actual lf from day to day data not shown were related to the response time between irrigation and drainage and the daily et variability fig 2 an increase in lf decreased the effect of soil and irrigation heterogeneity on drainage cl concentration variability fig 9 b for the variability of drainage amount a change in lf had influence only when heterogeneity of the irrigation rate was considered fig 9 a the variability of the drainage amount as a function of heterogeneity in irrigation rate was higher for the smaller lf however the standard deviation of the drainage amount was lower for the smaller lf this was due to the large differences in average drainage amount as a consequence of the different lfs these results support the classic approach of increasing irrigation amount in order to overcome the negative effects of low irrigation uniformity on yield letey et al 1984 when irrigating with brackish water there is a basic need to irrigate in excess in order to prevent salt accumulation such practice could therefore eliminate any effect of irrigation uniformity on yield as in the study presented by zhao et al 2012 where different irrigation uniformity levels did not affected drip irrigated cabbage growth yield or quality in addition variability in soil water content may be lower than irrigation imposed variability due to water movement and redistribution in sprinkler irrigation li 1998 causing consequential lower variability of water availability sensed by plants for the hypothetical crop in the present work and under the specified conditions no root water uptake reduction was simulated and therefore no yield reduction was predicted different levels and types of heterogeneity did not produce any variability or uncertainty in the hypothetical yield a function of et however the focus of this numerical exercise was to understand the uncertainty from lysimeter data regarding water and solute balances and not to evaluate yield or its variability 3 4 osmotic stress five cases were chosen in order to understand the behavior of variability for a salt sensitive crop under conditions leading to reduced root water uptake in the smaller lysimeters the five cases included low and high lfs with soil or irrigation heterogeneity and low lf with combined soil and irrigation heterogeneity table 1 overall cvs were lower for simulations where root water uptake was reduced due to relatively high drainage amounts and higher drainage cl concentrations fig 10 a and b the same trends observed in the simulations with no osmotic stress were repeated in these simulations fig 10 1 heterogeneity in soil hydraulic conductivity yielded higher variability in drainage concentration while heterogeneity in irrigation rate caused higher variability in drainage amount 2 when considering both sources of heterogeneity simultaneously no synergistic effect was observed cvs of both drainage volume and concentration were very similar to those produced by either heterogeneity of irrigation rate or soil k h alone 3 higher irrigation levels produced lower variabilities in both drainage amount and concentration actual lfs increased along the season due to root water uptake reduction final lf values were 0 38 and 0 37 for simulations with target lf of 0 20 soil k h and irrigation rate respectively and 0 51 for all the simulations with target lf of 0 43 variability cv values of actual root water uptake after reduction due to solute stress was generally low with maximum values at day 200 of 0 02 for heterogeneity due to soil k h and 0 01 for heterogeneity due to irrigation rate for both irrigation levels data not shown 4 conclusions when relying on lysimeter data for irrigation management with low quality water either drainage amount or concentration can be used the drainage amount allows estimation of et while the drainage solute concentration or ec electrical conductivity provides capability to calculate actual lf the results from the numerical experiments performed in this study can add confidence to decision making using either drainage amount or concentration according to the variability found for each variability was found to depend on the level of heterogeneity imposed by the system soil hydraulic conductivity or irrigation discharge rate in this case leaching fraction and or lysimeter size when heterogeneity of irrigation supply rate was high the drainage cl concentration had a lower variability leading to the conclusion that it can be more reliable for management decisions than the highly uncertain drainage amount contrarily in a case of low heterogeneity or uncertainty of irrigation application rate the et calculated with the water balance of the lysimeter will represent a more accurate measurement than the lf calculated using drainage cl concentration combining heterogeneities of soil hydraulic conductivity and irrigation discharge rate did not cause a synergistic effect the measured variability in the results was very similar to the highest value caused by either of the imposed heterogeneities when applied alone higher irrigation levels increased lfs decreased the variability of the drainage concentration for both sources of heterogeneity and also decreased the variability of drainage amount under heterogeneity due to irrigation discharge rate increasing the irrigation amount did not decrease variability in drainage amount when heterogeneity was due to soil hydraulic conductivity the results of these numerical experiments are also applicable to cases of irrigation with water high in salts and conditions causing

mediterranean area about 1 million ha are cultivated with potato cantore et al 2014 potatoes have a relatively shallow rooting system yamaguchi and tanaka 1990 ahmadi et al 2011 quiroz et al 2012 thus requiring frequent wetting by rain or irrigation particularly in areas with high climatic evaporative demand and when cropped in soils with low water holding capacities ojala et al 1990 ahmadi et al 2010 potato is considered to be very sensitive to water stress during the tuber initiation and tuber bulking stages doorenbos and kassam 1979 shock et al 1998 ierna and mauromicale 2006 2012 pavlista 2015 in contrast some studies report that water stress imposed during tuber initiation had limited effect on yield martin et al 1990 carli et al 2014 karam et al 2014 however numerous studies analyzing the impacts of deficit irrigation on potato yields mainly assess the impacts of decreased water applied regardless of crop growth stages i e without properly considering the most sensitive water stress stages e g onder et al 2005 jensen et al 2010 carli et al 2014 other studies have focused on the interactive effects of water and fertilization generally showing a marked impact on tuber yield of nitrogen associated with water availability ojala et al 1990 ferreira and gonçalves 2007 studies on impacts of irrigation on yields often refer to the appropriateness of adopting water saving irrigation strategies e g ierna and mauromicale 2012 camargo et al 2015 while others express doubts because high yield losses may occur jensen et al 2010 quiroz et al 2012 differently some studies clearly suggest to reduce irrigation only after tuberization or during the late season when impacts on yields are less jensen et al 2010 carli et al 2014 karam et al 2014 pavlista 2015 however decisions on water saving require appropriate economic assessment of irrigation impacts on yields shock et al 1998 zairi et al 2003 woli et al 2016 several studies include water productivity assessments using various conceptual approaches that are generally insufficiently discussed some studies justify water saving in relation to the increase of water productivity ahmadi et al 2010 2014 but without economic considerations in the mediterranean area potato is often cropped during the winter spring period when most of precipitation occurs ierna and mauromicale 2012 on the one hand early planting results in shorter day lengths and lower temperature which may delay emergence expand crop cycle and decrease tuber yield ierna and mauromicale 2006 levy and veilleux 2007 quiroz et al 2012 levy et al 2013 on the other hand late planting exposes the crop to higher risks of heat and water stress namely during the most sensitive stages levy and veilleux 2007 quiroz et al 2012 wang et al 2015 consequently early planting may be considered as a climate change adaptation provided that an increase in temperature is predicted if water and nutrients supply remains satisfactory higher temperatures and higher co2 likely increase potato yields daccache et al 2011 haverkort and struik 2015 however irrigation water requirements may increase by 30 daccache et al 2011 and lead to a decrease of water productivity xiao et al 2013 haverkort and struik 2015 many potato growth and yield models exist in their review raymundo et al 2014 identified more than 30 models but some of them are not specific for potato e g the fao aquacrop model as used by linker et al 2016 models have a very different structure adopt diverse approaches and focus on different processes the components of the soil water balance vary across models and diverse approaches are used for evapotranspiration et or for representing soil water dynamics raymundo et al 2014 which makes it difficult to analyze the resulting water yield relations and water productivity assessments moreover it is often unclear how the partition of et into crop transpiration and soil evaporation is performed which adds to the difficulties in analyzing water yield and water productivity in addition models are often calibrated validated for only one or few processes and sometimes their use is reported without referring to calibration apparently only one model was calibrated for water simpotato hodges et al 1992 while most models are calibrated for yields raymundo et al 2014 it could also be observed that with few exceptions papers on potato crop models do not follow the criteria proposed by sinclair and seligman 2000 nevertheless despite the referred insufficiencies models are often used to assess impacts of water management on yields e g the successful use of the dssat csm potato model substor woli et al 2016 contrarily to crop growth and yield models few water balance and flux models are referred as applied to irrigation of potato e g isareg sousa and pereira 1999 slatni et al 2011 mopeco domínguez et al 2011 and hydrus 1d satchithanantham et al 2014 and no studies report the use of models aimed at a detailed assessment and partitioning of et with these hydrologic models impacts of water on yields are generally studied through the simple stewart s water yield model stewart et al 1977 doorenbos and kassam 1979 whose application to root and tuber crops is often reported kiziloglu et al 2006 ferreira and gonçalves 2007 shrestha et al 2010 domínguez et al 2011 slatni et al 2011 topak et al 2011 in this line the stewart s model has been modified to estimate yield from transpiration paredes et al 2014 when associating it to the simdualkc water balance model rosa et al 2012 that daily partitions et and therefore estimates transpiration using the fao dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 2005 the combination simdualkc stewart s model has been successfully used for cereals pereira et al 2015b giménez et al 2016 and grain legumes wei et al 2015 paredes et al 2017 giménez et al 2017 and may be used to estimate potato yields the present study aims to give additional insight into the aforementioned issues and to overcome the existing knowledge gaps hence the main objectives include i calibration and validation of the simdualkc model for potato crop with derivation of the basal crop coefficients kcb and depletion fractions for no stress p ii assessing the simple combination of simdualkc with the modified stewart s water yield for predicting potato yields for various water treatments iii evaluation of water saving irrigation scheduling scenarios for various planting dates aimed at adaptation to climate change considering limited water deficits

2014 2 2 modelling approach calibration and validation procedures the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012 performs the soil water balance at the field plot scale using a daily time step and computes crop evapotranspiration etc mm adopting the fao dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 allen and pereira 2009 thus partitioning etc into crop transpiration tc mm and soil evaporation es mm tc and es are computed through applying the basal crop coefficient and the evaporation coefficient kcb and ke dimensionless respectively to the reference evapotranspiration eto mm thus 1a t c k cb et o and 1b e s k e et o the kcb values are inputs to the model which internally corrects the kcbmid and kcbend values to local climatic conditions when rhmin differs from 45 and or where the average u2 is different from 2ms 1 allen et al 1998 however when the model is applied to a new crop and or to a new environment the kcb values have to be calibrated as it is the case for the present study evaporation from the soil is limited by the amount of energy available at the soil surface in conjunction with the energy consumed by transpiration i e the sum of ke and kcb is limited to 1 2 with the product 1 2 eto representing the maximum possible daily et allen et al 1998 ke is computed through a daily soil water balance of the evaporative soil layer which is characterized by its depth ze m the total evaporable water tew mm and the readily evaporable water rew mm tew is the maximum depth of water that can be stored and evaporated from the soil evaporation layer when it is fully wetted and rew is the depth of water that can be evaporated without water availability restrictions the estimation procedures for the parameters ze tew and rew are given by allen et al 1998 2005 and are preferably calibrated when different soils are used as in the current study the actual crop et and t etcact tcact mm are computed as a function of the available soil water asw mm in the root zone using a water stress coefficient ks 0 1 ks is expressed as a linear function of the depletion in the effective root zone dr thus 2a k s taw d r taw raw taw d r 1 p taw f o r d r r a w 2b k s 1 f o r d r r a w where taw and raw are respectively the total and the readily available soil water mm relative to the rooting depth zr and p is the soil water depletion fraction for no stress dimensionless then resulting in raw p taw the p value is also calibrated when the model is first used for a crop or a given environment thus assuming 3 e t c a c t k s k c b k e e t o it results etcact etc when ks

no runoff was observed during both seasons dp is calculated with the parametric equation described by liu et al 2006 further descriptions of the soil water balance and auxiliary equations as well as irrigation scheduling options are provided by rosa et al 2012 to assess the impacts of water deficits on yields the simdualkc model was combined with the stewarts model stewart et al 1977 modified by paredes et al 2014 the modified version which has been successfully applied to several crops pereira et al 2015a b wei et al 2015 giménez et al 2016 assumes that the relative yield losses vary

ecological zoning aez method fao 1996 using the set of observed yield data and performing a linear regression as per eq 5 the value ky 1 02 was derived there is little information available about ky for potatoes ferreira and gonçalves 2007 and ünlü et al 2006 reported small and larger ky values while doorenbos and kassam 1979 proposed ky 1 10 which is the most common used value simdualkc model calibration consisted in the process of adjusting significant model parameters to minimize differences between observed and simulated soil water content swc values using data collected in the fi treatment in 2010 1 the crop parameters kcb and p the initial values of which were those tabulated by allen et al 1998 2 the soil evaporation parameters ze tew and rew also initialized from

computations performed using the calibrated parameter values with the independent data sets relative to fi in 2009 the ri and ni treatments in 2010 parameters were adjusted using a trial and error procedure as described by pereira et al 2015a b it was initiated by focusing on the crop parameters kcb and p until estimation errors were small and varied little from one iteration to the next subsequently the procedure was applied to the soil evaporation and deep percolation parameters and again to kcb and p until errors would remain small and stable from one iteration to the next various statistical indicators were used to assess the simdualkc model performance they are detailed in pereira et al 2015a b and consist of the regression coefficient b0 of the linear regression forced to the origin between measured and simulated swc values and the determination coefficient r2 of the ordinary least squares regression between the same swc data the percent bias pbias which measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than their corresponding measurements indicators for estimation errors the root mean square error rmse the normalized rmse in relation to the mean value of observations nrmse the average absolute error aae and the average relative error are and the nash and sutcliffe 1970 modelling efficiency ef which measures the magnitude of the mean square error mse rmse2 relative to the observed data variance legates and mccabe 1999 2 3 water productivity indicators the experimental results and the irrigation scheduling scenarios described below

or estimated and iwu mm is the total irrigation water use iwu was computed as the ratio between the seasonal net irrigation depth nid observed or estimated by the model and the beneficial water use fraction bwuf i e the fraction of irrigation water that was added to the root zone soil water storage pereira et al 2012 the seasonal bwuf was estimated as equal to the observed du 0 90 which is an acceptable value for a well designed and managed drip irrigation system b consumptive use water productivity wpet kgm 3 8 wp et y a et c act where etcact mm is the estimated actual crop

the difference between the final and the initial swc estimated with simdualkc 2 4 impacts of planting dates and evaporative demand conditions considering the need for adaptation to climate change with an expected increase of eto and a decrease of rainfall lionello et al 2014 saadi et al 2015 impacts of different planting dates and diverse irrigation regimes on potato yields and water productivity were evaluated the proposed approach consists in using weather data of both experimental years 2009 and 2010 and running the model for various planting dates which cover the period commonly used by farmers in the region 16 february 3 march 17 march and 1 april following the approach by paredes et al 2017 irrigation scheduling scenarios were designed to avoid heavy water stress during the most sensitive crop stages from initiation of tubers and tuber filling until physiological maturity starts which correspond to the late crop development and mid season stages rain fed cropping was not considered because observed impacts of water stress on potato yield were enormous and are likely not economically acceptable for farming for each date using a fixed net irrigation depth of 20mm per event which is appropriate and common for sprinkler set systems micro sprinkler and drip irrigation systems the following irrigation scenarios were considered 1 full full satisfaction of crop water requirements 2 mild mild water stress adopting management allowed depletion mad of the soil water 10 larger than the p depletion fraction for no stress mad 1 10 p during the initial and late season stages not allowing any water stress mad p during the referred sensitive stages 3 mod moderate stress consisting of mad 1 20 p during the initial and late season stages and mad 1 10p during the crop development and mid season stages the simulations were performed by cutting irrigation applications 10days before harvesting to allow vine killing the cgdd observed table 1 were adopted to define the crop growth stages these simulations made it possible to assess water use and productivity in relation to planting dates actual yields ya were estimated with the modified stewart s approach in combination with simdualkc potential yields ym were estimated for each planting date using the aez methodology fao 1996 resulting in the following ym values 2009 ym was 48 72 45 95 43 69 and 42 90tha 1 for planting by 16 february 3 march 17 march and 1 april respectively 2010 ym was 47 53 49 24 44 93 43 96tha 1 for the same planting dates 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation the current application of the simdualkc model is the first one for potato and for apulia region hence requires proper calibration and validation these were performed by simulating the soil water dynamics and comparing simulated vs observed swc as described before simulation examples are presented in fig 2 that depicts very different conditions without water stress in fig 2a treatment fi used for calibration and with continued water stress during the mid and late season in fig 2b the rain fed ni treatment used for validation very diverse soil water conditions for calibration and validation are quite important to assume the ability of the model to simulate the swc dynamics of a potato crop in apulia region this assumption is well confirmed by the goodness of fit indicators in table 3 b0 is very close to 1 0 with r2 0 93 nrmse does not exceed 3 67 pbias is within the small interval 1 0 to 1 0 while ef 0 87 means that the mse is much smaller than the variance of observations the calibrated model parameters are presented in table 4 together with the values used to initialize the calibration the potential kcbmid 1 10 is equal to the one proposed in fao56 allen et al 1998 but the value for end season 0 35 is smaller because vine killing intended to favour final maturity of potatoes required the crop to be dry no other results for kcb are available in the literature and kc results are also rare since most authors just use the values tabulated in fao56 however few results are available for kcmid which is 0 05 higher than kcbmid allen et al 1998 trebejo and midmore 1990 reported kcmid close to 1 15 sousa and pereira 1999 found kcmid 1 10 equal to the one proposed in fao24 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 and slatni et al 2011 reported kcmid 1 12 thus close to the calibrated kcbmid the calibrated p values are slightly larger than those proposed in fao56 which may relate to the variety used which is considered moderately sensitive to drought soil evaporation and deep percolation parameters are within their expected range of variation 3 2 evapotranspiration partition basal crop coefficients and transpiration dynamics the partition of etcact into tcact and es was performed through estimating the coefficients kcbact and ke as described in section 2 2 the partition of kcmax 1 20 into kcbact and ke is presented in fig 3 for all three treatments and both years for the non stressed fi treatment fig 3a and b shows that actual and potential kcb are coincident except for a few days in 2009 due to delayed irrigation events ke is high only during the initial stage and the first part of the crop development stage when the fraction fc of soil covered by vegetation is small dryness during the late season of 2010 caused ke to be much smaller in 2010 relative to 2009 relative to the ri treatment fig 3c and d there is evidence of water stress starting by the end of the crop development stage until the end season with kcbact kcb with the kcbact curve showing a sequence of peaks due to irrigation the latter mitigated that stress but quite insufficiently because it occurred during the period when potato is more sensitive to water stress during the initial and first part of crop development stages ke was about the same as for the fi treatment but was slightly larger in 2009 during the late season the ni treatment fig 3e and f shows a quite large period when kcbact kcb hence a long period of water stress that highly affected tuber initiation and tuberization thus highly affecting yields ke does not differ from that obtained for the fi and ri treatments during the first crop stages when rain wetting occurred but was highly reduced during the mid and late season in both years because the soil was kept dry except for short periods when small rains wetted the soil surface following the application of the kcbact and ke coefficients described above the resulting values for potential and actual transpiration tc and tcact and soil evaporation es were computed for all treatments and both years fig 4 however since there are no publications on et partition it is not possible to compare our results with others results for the fi treatment fig 4a and b show that tc and tcact curves are coincident and that tc becomes larger than es soon after the crop development stage starts es remains much smaller than tc until a date close to harvesting in 2009 and by the end season in 2010 differences relate to the occurrence of wetting during the late season of 2009 while that period was very dry in 2010 results for the ri treatment show that by the mid of the crop development stage when tuber initiation starts tcact becomes smaller than tc and remains so until harvesting despite several however insufficient irrigation events which is clearly shown by the peaks of the tcact curves fig 4c and d the es curves are similar to those of the fi treatment because all wetting events occurred on the same occasions for both fi and ri however by the end of the late season of 2010 es relative to the ri treatment became larger than that of fi because the crop was stressed and lost leaves thus increasing the energy available at soil surface for supporting es though at very small rates results for the ni treatment fig 4e and f show that tcact tc by the mid of the crop development stage and steadily decreased thereafter to values close to zero until some rains occurred in the late season to wet the soil thus providing for very small transpiration rates es is similar to that of ri and fi treatments until stress conditions start from then on es steadily decreased until late season due to the lack of soil wetting events nevertheless it increased again by the late season when some rain wetted the soil surface the results discussed above show that rain fed potatoes are likely not feasible since tcact remains much smaller than tc during the period of tuber initiation and bulking 3 3 water balance and water use the water use components as computed by simdualkc table 5 show that during the potato crop season rainfall was smaller than etcact for the fi and ri treatments in both years which means that potato cropping requires irrigation as already analysed relative to the transpiration dynamics because the ni treatments were harvested earlier seasonal p was smaller relative to p for fi and ri treatments the total water use twu was larger in the wet year due to higher precipitation and gross irrigation the latter due to the poor distribution of precipitation as depicted in fig 1 twu of the fi treatment doubled that of the rain fed ni which clearly justifies the very heavy water stress identified in figs 3 e and f and 4 e and f due to the uneven distribution of precipitation only a part of it is consumed by the crop while the excess rainfall results in deep percolation dp the smaller dp corresponds to the ni treatments and the larger one to the fi ones because without irrigation the soil is drier and retains more infiltrated water than under irrigation dp was relatively large representing from 30 of p in the case of ni and ri in the drier year of 2010 and up to 45 of p for the fi treatment in 2009 the used soil water reserve δsw was negligible for the fi treatments due to frequent wetting by irrigation and was naturally larger for the ni treatments the maximum δsw was 28 of twu in the case of ni in 2010 results for both dp and δsw indicate that water saving may be achieved when adopting irrigation schedules that maximize the use of both rainfall and stored soil water 3 4 yield and water productivity actual yields ya relate well with etcact as per table 5 however the best operational relation is found with the modified stewart s model eq 5 and 6 i e relating the relative yield loss with the relative et deficit when using a properly selected ky value fig 5 shows that by adopting ky 1 09 derived from experimental data there is a good prediction of ya though with an under estimation trend related goodness of fit indicators are shown in table 6 comparing the currently derived ky 1 09 with the commonly used ky 1 10 proposed by doorenbos and kassam 1979 it is important to note that with ky 1 09 an acceptable rmse 2 17tha 1 was obtained corresponding to nrmse of 7 6 pbias 1 8 and high ef of 0 96 comparing with results from other studies larger rmse and nrmse were reported by daccache et al 2011 and raymundo et al 2017 using dssat csm substor potato carli et al 2014 using the model solanum and singh et al 2005 using the infocrop potato smaller rmse were reported by woli et al 2016 using the model dssat csm substor potato from this comparative analysis and from the goodness of fit indicators it may be concluded that it is appropriate to estimate actual yields using the simdualkc stewart s approach and that good results achieved are due to a proper derivation of the ky factor and an accurate estimation of actual transpiration the observed ya values table 5 were used to compute various water productivity indicators fig 6 when the denominator is the seasonal irrigation amount highest wpirrig values were found for the ri treatment in both years because the increase in yield resulting from irrigation is larger with ri than with the fi treatment it can also be observed fig 6b that wpirrig ranging from 11 66 to 21 65kgm 3 is the indicator showing larger variability because it varies with the evaporative demand of the considered year and with the adopted irrigation regime large ranges of variation for wpirrig were also reported by trebejo and midmore 1990 onder et al 2005 and slatni et al 2011 and ahmadi et al 2014 thus supporting the assumption that the usefulness of wpirrig for comparative analysis among diverse studies is limited that variability decreases when referring to the total water use with highest wpwu 9 18kgm 3 for the fi treatment and the smallest 3 85kgm 3 for ni fig 6b this was expected since twu relates well with etcact and with tcact table 5 fig 6a when referring to the consumptive water use it was observed that wpet varied with climate and irrigation treatments however less than wpirrig ranging from 5 69 to 10 99kgm 3 the highest values of wpet are also found for the treatment fi and the smallest ones for ni which could be expected since etcact is directly related to yield formation higher values are found for 2010 drier than 2009 because less water was used naturally resulting in smaller yields similarly wpt ranging from 10 55kgm 3 up to 15 13kgm 3 was also higher in 2010 but contrarily to the other indicators did not vary much among treatments and years with the highest values in both years observed for the ni treatment both wpt and wpet increase with water stress since the denominators actual t and et respectively are then smaller similar results were reported by slatni et al 2011 and by carli et al 2014 overall results agree with studies by pereira et al 2012 and by paredes et al 2014 2017 showing that improving wp does not necessarily lead to reducing water use or to higher farm income thus to decide about deficit irrigation in addition to wp it is necessary to consider the economic impacts of the irrigation schedules since farmers main objective is to achieve the best income and profitability 3 5 adaptation to climate change assessing impacts of planting dates as discussed by levy and veilleux 2007 and quiroz et al 2012 one commonly studied adaptation to climate change is anticipating the planting date in such a way that more rainfall becomes available during the crop season and hot stresses are avoided therefore for the climate of both studied years four planting dates were compared 16 february 3 march 17 march and 1 april where the first date refers to earlier planting and the last corresponds to delayed planting for all dates improved irrigation schedules were aimed at maximizing the use of available soil water and minimizing deep percolation the water balance terms are presented in fig 7 for all scenarios and both years complete results are presented in appendix 1 table a1 in supplementary material results show higher rainfall available for the earliest planting date and less rainfall for the last date in both years 328 vs 175mm in 2009 and 196 vs 129mm in 2010 as well as more abundant precipitation in 2009 consequently since the used soil water reserve is relatively small averaging 43mm in the first year and 47mm in the second one when rainfall is less the season irrigation depth is increased to keep actual transpiration nearly uniform as a result there is a quite small variation of tcact 255 up to 288mm in 2009 and 253 to 282mm in 2010 the variability of etcact is also small ranging from 358 to 383mm in 2009 and from 341 to 378mm in the second year the variability of es is also small in both years because the soil is wetted by irrigation with similar frequency and considering that etcact varies little among simulated scenarios there is no room to cause noticeable changes in vegetation development thus in the soil fraction shadowed by the crop and in the energy available for es when rainfall is high as in the three first dates of 2009 or in the two first dates of 2010 deep percolation is high 105 153mm and 46 60mm respectively differently dp is low for the last date of 2009 38mm and for the two last dates of 2010 8 13mm the results above show that the improved schedules contribute to better use of rainfall and of the stored soil water on the one hand comparing with data in table 5 it is evident that dp is smaller for most of the simulated scenarios and on the other hand δsw is generally higher in both years results would be improved if applied irrigation depths were 10mm instead of 20mm because using a small depth provides a better adjustment to soil water variations however the assumed option is acceptable if intending to assess scenarios in conditions under sprinkler and trickle irrigation the appropriateness of the simulated scenarios is also noticeable by observing that the variability of tcact and etcact is quite small across scenarios planting dates and years moreover that appropriateness is also apparent in terms of water saving due to adopting optimized irrigation schedules water saving of 39 was estimated when comparing the water use computed for the full irrigation scheduling scenario with the water use observed for the fi treatment relative to the planting date of 17 march in 2009 higher water saving could be achieved for the planting dates of 16 february and 3 march 52 and 45 of the observed nid respectively for the same year delaying planting to 1st april would reduce water saving to 27 of nid relative to 2010 using the improved full irrigation schedule for the observed planting date 3 march could lead to water saving of 24 of the observed nid anticipating or delaying the planting date would result in less water saving predicted actual yields are depicted in fig 8 for the previously defined four planting dates and full mild and mod scheduling scenarios section 2 4 for the weather conditions of 2009 and 2010 those results show that yields vary a lot with the planting date particularly in 2009 with higher yields for the first two dates i e planting during the second half of february that variability follows the variability of tcact but also depends on other factors including radiation air temperature and soil temperature highest yields are predicted for the full irrigation scenario and the lowest ones for the mod scenario with the mild scenario predictions often close to full anyway the full scenario leads to higher yields than the observed ya observed for the fi treatments which may indicate that improved irrigation schedules provide for higher yields these results combined with those in fig 7 suggest to perform planting during the second half of february and to adopt irrigation schedules similar to mild or mod the latter when water availability is reduced overall the results discussed above demonstrate that optimized irrigation schedules may lead to good irrigation practices provided that a properly calibrated model such as simdualkc is used to search for the best performing solution as expected from the discussion on the observed data in section 3 4 and fig 7 wpirrig varies much fig 9 with the considered irrigation scenarios the planting dates and the year because yields vary fig 8 and irrigation requirements change with the evaporative demand as for the wpirrig computed from observations this indicator tends to be lower for the full scenario and higher for deficit irrigation i e it responds primarily to the season irrigation depth than to yields thus it is difficult to use wpirrig as comparator and its results are contradictory with the farmers perspective of increasing yields and consequent economic returns differently small variations were observed for wpet and wpt as it could be expected from the small variation of etcact and tcact as discussed before fig 7 thus both indicators may be used as comparators with their variability indicating that uncommon changes occurred in yields or in water consumptive use wpwu also show little differences among all scenarios because both ya and water used also show small differences and season water used relates well with etcact and tcact it may be concluded that wpirrig has limited usefulness as comparator and contrarily that wpet wpt and wpwu may be quite useful as water productivity comparators 4 conclusions field experimental observations performed in two years 2009 and 2010 provided for successful calibration and validation of the simdualkc model for potato crop this is the first application of the dual crop coefficient approach to potato and moreover the first one providing for an analysis of the partition of et into crop transpiration and soil evaporation the model calibration also supported the determination of basal crop coefficients kcbini kcbmid and kcbend of 0 15 1 15 and 0 35 and depletion fractions for no stress for the various crop growth stages with all p values equal to 0 40 which are the first to be reported in the literature the referred et partitioning also contributed to improve the performance of water yield modelling based upon actual transpiration since tcact is the et component effectively related with actual yield field observations of yield relative to various water stress conditions and the corresponding tcact simulated by simdualkc model were used for deriving the stewart s yield response factor ky 1 09 results of this simplified approach for yield prediction show high accuracy with no tendency for under or over estimation and low errors of estimation in comparison with predictions by other models namely the dssat csm substor potato irrigation scheduling scenarios were built and simulated for diverse planting dates anticipated and delayed relative to the observed ones simulations were performed for full irrigation and mild and moderate deficits but avoiding more than mild water stress during the most sensitive crop stages from tuber initiation to tuber bulking results of these simulations lead to conclude that 1 water saving may be achieved not only by adopting a limited water stress but scheduling irrigation to better using rainfall thus minimizing deep percolation and better using the stored soil water 2 anticipating the planting to the second half of february provides for cropping when rainfall is more abundant and avoids heat stresses in the late season therefore decreasing the need to irrigate 3 improved irrigation schedules and anticipated planting contribute to higher yield provided that n fertilizing is adequate 4 wp indicators are generally improved for the anticipated planting dates the observed irrigation schedules and those relative to the simulated scenarios were analysed using water productivity indicators relative to irrigation wpirrig actual crop evapotranspiration wpet actual transpiration wpt and season water used wpwu results for wpirrig show high variability because they depend much on irrigation management options with higher values when irrigation was less and lower values when full irrigation was adopted although highest yields were then obtained differently wpet and wpt had highest values for full irrigation in both years when etcact and tcact were highest but yield was also highest wpwu behaved similarly to wpet and wpt because the seasonal water used varies proportionally to etcact and tcact the current results support the adoption of

mediterranean area about 1 million ha are cultivated with potato cantore et al 2014 potatoes have a relatively shallow rooting system yamaguchi and tanaka 1990 ahmadi et al 2011 quiroz et al 2012 thus requiring frequent wetting by rain or irrigation particularly in areas with high climatic evaporative demand and when cropped in soils with low water holding capacities ojala et al 1990 ahmadi et al 2010 potato is considered to be very sensitive to water stress during the tuber initiation and tuber bulking stages doorenbos and kassam 1979 shock et al 1998 ierna and mauromicale 2006 2012 pavlista 2015 in contrast some studies report that water stress imposed during tuber initiation had limited effect on yield martin et al 1990 carli et al 2014 karam et al 2014 however numerous studies analyzing the impacts of deficit irrigation on potato yields mainly assess the impacts of decreased water applied regardless of crop growth stages i e without properly considering the most sensitive water stress stages e g onder et al 2005 jensen et al 2010 carli et al 2014 other studies have focused on the interactive effects of water and fertilization generally showing a marked impact on tuber yield of nitrogen associated with water availability ojala et al 1990 ferreira and gonçalves 2007 studies on impacts of irrigation on yields often refer to the appropriateness of adopting water saving irrigation strategies e g ierna and mauromicale 2012 camargo et al 2015 while others express doubts because high yield losses may occur jensen et al 2010 quiroz et al 2012 differently some studies clearly suggest to reduce irrigation only after tuberization or during the late season when impacts on yields are less jensen et al 2010 carli et al 2014 karam et al 2014 pavlista 2015 however decisions on water saving require appropriate economic assessment of irrigation impacts on yields shock et al 1998 zairi et al 2003 woli et al 2016 several studies include water productivity assessments using various conceptual approaches that are generally insufficiently discussed some studies justify water saving in relation to the increase of water productivity ahmadi et al 2010 2014 but without economic considerations in the mediterranean area potato is often cropped during the winter spring period when most of precipitation occurs ierna and mauromicale 2012 on the one hand early planting results in shorter day lengths and lower temperature which may delay emergence expand crop cycle and decrease tuber yield ierna and mauromicale 2006 levy and veilleux 2007 quiroz et al 2012 levy et al 2013 on the other hand late planting exposes the crop to higher risks of heat and water stress namely during the most sensitive stages levy and veilleux 2007 quiroz et al 2012 wang et al 2015 consequently early planting may be considered as a climate change adaptation provided that an increase in temperature is predicted if water and nutrients supply remains satisfactory higher temperatures and higher co2 likely increase potato yields daccache et al 2011 haverkort and struik 2015 however irrigation water requirements may increase by 30 daccache et al 2011 and lead to a decrease of water productivity xiao et al 2013 haverkort and struik 2015 many potato growth and yield models exist in their review raymundo et al 2014 identified more than 30 models but some of them are not specific for potato e g the fao aquacrop model as used by linker et al 2016 models have a very different structure adopt diverse approaches and focus on different processes the components of the soil water balance vary across models and diverse approaches are used for evapotranspiration et or for representing soil water dynamics raymundo et al 2014 which makes it difficult to analyze the resulting water yield relations and water productivity assessments moreover it is often unclear how the partition of et into crop transpiration and soil evaporation is performed which adds to the difficulties in analyzing water yield and water productivity in addition models are often calibrated validated for only one or few processes and sometimes their use is reported without referring to calibration apparently only one model was calibrated for water simpotato hodges et al 1992 while most models are calibrated for yields raymundo et al 2014 it could also be observed that with few exceptions papers on potato crop models do not follow the criteria proposed by sinclair and seligman 2000 nevertheless despite the referred insufficiencies models are often used to assess impacts of water management on yields e g the successful use of the dssat csm potato model substor woli et al 2016 contrarily to crop growth and yield models few water balance and flux models are referred as applied to irrigation of potato e g isareg sousa and pereira 1999 slatni et al 2011 mopeco domínguez et al 2011 and hydrus 1d satchithanantham et al 2014 and no studies report the use of models aimed at a detailed assessment and partitioning of et with these hydrologic models impacts of water on yields are generally studied through the simple stewart s water yield model stewart et al 1977 doorenbos and kassam 1979 whose application to root and tuber crops is often reported kiziloglu et al 2006 ferreira and gonçalves 2007 shrestha et al 2010 domínguez et al 2011 slatni et al 2011 topak et al 2011 in this line the stewart s model has been modified to estimate yield from transpiration paredes et al 2014 when associating it to the simdualkc water balance model rosa et al 2012 that daily partitions et and therefore estimates transpiration using the fao dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 2005 the combination simdualkc stewart s model has been successfully used for cereals pereira et al 2015b giménez et al 2016 and grain legumes wei et al 2015 paredes et al 2017 giménez et al 2017 and may be used to estimate potato yields the present study aims to give additional insight into the aforementioned issues and to overcome the existing knowledge gaps hence the main objectives include i calibration and validation of the simdualkc model for potato crop with derivation of the basal crop coefficients kcb and depletion fractions for no stress p ii assessing the simple combination of simdualkc with the modified stewart s water yield for predicting potato yields for various water treatments iii evaluation of water saving irrigation scheduling scenarios for various planting dates aimed at adaptation to climate change considering limited water deficits

solanum tuberosum cv spunta was planted with a density of 5plantsm 2 this cultivar is a medium early potato characterized by good germination potential high yield potential moderate resistance to

having a discharge rate of 1 5lh 1 drip lines were placed between 0 80m spaced pairs of crop rows the fraction of soil wetted by irrigation averaged 0 40 evaluations of the distribution uniformity du averaged 90 the irrigation threshold adopted for the full irrigation treatment was 40 depletion of taw in the effective root zone depth 0 50m which was estimated through daily soil water balance three irrigation treatments each with three replications were used completely random blocks were adopted each plot was 7m 7m a flow meter and switch valve were placed at the upstream end of each plot to control water applications the irrigation treatments were the following fi full irrigation aimed at full satisfaction of the crop water requirements the adopted schedule is given in table 1 ri reduced irrigation consisting in applying 50 of fi irrigation depths at the same dates table 1 the term deficit irrigation is not used because the adopted schedule was not aimed at achieving an economic reduced yield but just reducing water application as discussed by pereira et al 2009 ni no irrigation rain fed field observations and measurements followed recommendations for accuracy by allen et al 2011 and included i the dates of each crop growth stage which were assumed when 80 of plants attained that stage and the corresponding cumulative growing degree days cgdd table 2 cgdd show that the duration of initial crop development and mid season stages is not very different the duration of late season is much shorter likely because climate favored quick physiological maturity harvesting in 2009 was too much delayed and should have taken place for cgdd of 1540 c cgdd were computed assuming a base temperature of 2 c manrique and hodges 1989 quiroz et al 2012 and a maximum temperature of

manually harvesting 18 plants per plot and discarding deformed and diseased tubers as well as those that weighted less than 20g further information on the field trials was provided by cantore et al 2014 2 2 modelling approach calibration and validation procedures the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012 performs the soil water balance at the field plot scale using a daily time step and computes crop evapotranspiration etc mm adopting the fao dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 allen and pereira 2009 thus partitioning etc into crop transpiration tc mm and soil evaporation es mm tc and es are computed through applying the basal crop coefficient and the evaporation coefficient kcb and ke dimensionless respectively to the reference evapotranspiration eto mm thus 1a t c k cb et o and 1b e s k e et o the kcb values are inputs to the model which internally corrects the kcbmid and kcbend values to local climatic conditions when rhmin differs from 45 and or where the average u2 is different from 2ms 1 allen et al 1998 however when the model is applied to a new crop and or to a new environment the kcb values have to be calibrated as it is the case for the present study evaporation from the soil is limited by the amount of energy available at the soil surface in conjunction with the energy consumed by transpiration i e the sum of ke and kcb is limited to 1 2 with the product 1 2 eto representing the maximum possible daily et allen et al 1998 ke is computed through a daily soil water balance of the evaporative soil layer which is characterized by its depth ze m the total evaporable water tew mm and the readily evaporable water rew mm tew is the maximum depth of water that can be stored and evaporated from the soil evaporation layer when it is fully wetted and rew is the depth of water that can be evaporated without water availability restrictions the estimation procedures for the parameters ze tew and rew are given by allen et al 1998 2005 and are preferably calibrated when different soils are used as in the current study the actual crop et and t etcact tcact mm are computed as a function of the available soil water asw mm in the root zone using a water stress coefficient ks 0 1 ks is expressed as a linear function of the depletion in the effective root zone dr thus 2a k s taw d r taw raw taw d r 1 p taw f o r d r r a w 2b k s 1 f o r d r r a w where taw and raw are respectively the total and the readily available soil water mm relative to the rooting depth zr and p is the soil water depletion fraction for no stress dimensionless then resulting in raw p taw the p value is also calibrated when the model is first used for a crop or a given environment thus assuming 3 e t c a c t k s k c b k e e t o it results etcact etc when ks 1 otherwise etcact etc when ks 1 the potential kcb value is replaced by the actual kcbact ks kcb the model computes the soil water balance in the root zone following allen et al 1998 thus computing depletion at the end of every day 4 d r i d r i 1 p r o i i i c r i e t c a c t i d p i where dr i and dr i 1 are the root zone depletion at the end of day i and day i 1 respectively pi is precipitation roi is runoff ii is the net irrigation depth that infiltrates the soil cri is the capillary rise from the groundwater table etcact i is the actual crop et and dpi is deep percolation beyond the root zone with all terms expressed in mm and relative to day i in the present study cr was not considered since the water table was very deep and ro was zero because the land was flat and no runoff was observed during both seasons dp is calculated with the parametric equation described by liu et al 2006 further descriptions of the soil water balance and auxiliary equations as well as irrigation scheduling options are provided by rosa et al 2012 to assess the impacts of water deficits on yields the simdualkc model was combined with the stewarts model stewart et al 1977 modified by paredes et al 2014 the modified version which has been successfully applied to several crops pereira et al 2015a b wei et al 2015 giménez et al 2016 assumes that the relative yield losses vary linearly with the relative transpiration deficits according to a crop specific yield response factor ky thus 5 1 y a y m k y 1 t a c t t c the actual yield ya is then estimated as 6 y a y m y m k y t d t c where td tc tcact with tcact kcbact eto ya is the actual marketable yield and ym is the potential yield tc and tcact were computed with simdualkc and ym values were estimated using the agro ecological zoning aez method fao 1996 using the set of observed yield data and performing a linear regression as per eq 5 the value ky 1 02 was derived there is little information available about ky for potatoes ferreira and gonçalves 2007 and ünlü et al 2006 reported small and larger ky values while doorenbos and kassam 1979 proposed ky 1 10 which is the most common used value simdualkc model calibration consisted in the process of adjusting significant model parameters to minimize differences between observed and simulated soil water content swc values using data collected in the fi treatment in 2010 1 the crop parameters kcb and p the initial values of which were those tabulated by allen et al 1998 2 the soil evaporation parameters ze tew and rew also initialized from estimations proposed by allen et al 1998 2005 3 the deep percolation parameters ad and bd with the initial values proposed by liu et al 2006 for silty loam soils the initial soil water conditions consisted in assuming that the soil was fully wetted at both the evaporable layer and the root zone i e initial depletion was zero validation consisted in evaluating the accuracy of the model for swc computations performed using the calibrated parameter values with the independent data sets relative to fi in 2009 the ri and ni treatments in 2010 parameters were adjusted using a trial and error procedure as described by pereira et al 2015a b it was initiated by focusing on the crop parameters kcb and p until estimation errors were small and varied little from one iteration to the next subsequently the procedure was applied to the soil evaporation and deep percolation parameters and again to kcb and p until errors would remain small and stable from one iteration to the next various statistical indicators were used to assess the simdualkc model performance they are detailed in pereira et al 2015a b and consist of the regression coefficient b0 of the linear regression forced to the origin between measured and simulated swc values and the determination coefficient r2 of the ordinary least squares regression between the same swc data the percent bias pbias which measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than their corresponding measurements indicators for estimation errors the root mean square error rmse the normalized rmse in relation to the mean value of observations nrmse the average absolute error aae and the average relative error are and the nash and sutcliffe 1970 modelling efficiency ef which measures the magnitude of the mean square error mse rmse2 relative to the observed data variance legates and mccabe 1999 2 3 water productivity indicators the experimental results and the irrigation scheduling scenarios described below were assessed using the water productivity indicators defined by pereira et al 2009 2012 a irrigation water productivity wpirrig kgm 3 7 wp irrig y a iwu where ya is the actual yield kgha 1 observed or estimated and iwu mm is the total irrigation water use iwu was computed as the ratio between the seasonal net irrigation depth nid observed or estimated by the model and the beneficial water use fraction bwuf i e the fraction of irrigation water that was added to the root zone soil water storage pereira et al 2012 the seasonal bwuf was estimated as equal to the observed du 0 90 which is an acceptable value for a well designed and managed drip irrigation system b consumptive use water productivity wpet kgm 3 8 wp et y a et c act where etcact mm is the estimated actual crop

the estimated actual crop transpiration d water productivity of water used wpwu kgm 3 10 wp wu y a p e cr δ sw iwu where the denominator consists of the total water use and is thus the sum of effective precipitation pe mm capillary rise cr mm seasonal use of the soil water δsw mm and iwu as previously stated cr was zero pe was assumed equal to p since ro was zero and δsw was computed as the difference between the final and the initial swc estimated with simdualkc 2 4 impacts of planting dates and evaporative demand conditions considering the need for adaptation to climate change with an expected increase of eto and a decrease of rainfall lionello et al 2014 saadi et al 2015 impacts of different planting dates and diverse irrigation regimes on potato yields and water productivity were evaluated the proposed approach consists in using weather data of both experimental years 2009 and 2010 and running the model for various planting dates which cover the period commonly used by farmers in the region 16 february 3 march 17 march and 1 april following the approach by paredes et al 2017 irrigation scheduling scenarios were designed to avoid heavy water stress during the most sensitive crop stages from initiation of tubers and tuber filling until physiological maturity starts which correspond to the late crop development and mid season stages rain fed cropping was not considered because observed impacts of water stress on potato yield were enormous and are likely not economically acceptable for farming for each date using a fixed net irrigation depth of 20mm per event which is appropriate and common for sprinkler set systems micro sprinkler and drip irrigation systems the following irrigation scenarios were considered 1 full full satisfaction of crop water requirements 2 mild mild water stress adopting management allowed depletion mad of the soil water 10 larger than the p depletion fraction for no stress mad 1 10 p during the initial and late season stages not allowing any water stress mad p during the referred sensitive stages 3 mod moderate stress consisting of mad 1 20 p during the initial and late season stages and mad 1 10p during the crop development and mid season stages the simulations were performed by cutting irrigation applications 10days before harvesting to allow vine killing the cgdd observed table 1 were adopted to define the crop growth stages these simulations made it possible to assess water use and productivity in relation to planting dates actual yields ya were estimated with the modified stewart s approach in combination with simdualkc potential yields ym were estimated for each planting date using the aez methodology fao 1996 resulting in the following ym values 2009 ym was 48 72 45 95 43 69 and 42 90tha 1 for planting by 16 february 3 march 17 march and 1 april respectively 2010 ym was 47 53 49 24 44 93 43 96tha 1 for the same planting dates 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation the current application of the simdualkc model is the first one for potato and for apulia region hence requires proper calibration and validation these were performed by simulating the soil water dynamics and comparing simulated vs observed swc as described before simulation examples are presented in fig 2 that depicts very different conditions without water stress in fig 2a treatment fi used for calibration and with continued water stress during the mid and late season in fig 2b the rain fed ni treatment used for validation very diverse soil water conditions for calibration and validation are quite important to assume the ability of the model to simulate the swc dynamics of a potato crop in apulia region this assumption is well confirmed by the goodness of fit indicators in table 3 b0 is very close to 1 0 with r2 0 93 nrmse does not exceed 3 67 pbias is within the small interval 1 0 to 1 0 while ef 0 87 means that the mse is much smaller than the variance of observations the calibrated model parameters are presented in table 4 together with the values used to initialize the calibration the potential kcbmid 1 10 is equal to the one proposed in fao56 allen et al 1998 but the value for end season 0 35 is smaller because vine killing intended to favour final maturity of potatoes required the crop to be dry no other results for kcb are available in the literature and kc results are also rare since most authors just use the values tabulated in fao56 however few results are available for kcmid which is 0 05 higher than kcbmid allen et al 1998 trebejo and midmore 1990 reported kcmid close to 1 15 sousa and pereira 1999 found kcmid 1 10 equal to the one proposed in fao24 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 and slatni et al 2011 reported kcmid 1 12 thus close to the calibrated kcbmid the calibrated p values are slightly larger than those proposed in fao56 which may relate to the variety used which is considered moderately sensitive to drought soil evaporation and deep percolation parameters are within their expected range of variation 3 2 evapotranspiration partition basal crop coefficients and transpiration dynamics the partition of etcact into tcact and es was performed through estimating the coefficients kcbact and ke as described in section 2 2 the partition of kcmax 1 20 into kcbact and ke is presented in fig 3 for all three treatments and both years for the non stressed fi treatment fig 3a and b shows that actual and potential kcb are coincident except for a few days in 2009 due to delayed irrigation events ke is high only during the initial stage and the first part of the crop development stage when the fraction fc of soil covered by vegetation is small dryness during the late season of 2010 caused ke to be much smaller in 2010 relative to 2009 relative to the ri treatment fig 3c and d there is evidence of water stress starting by the end of the crop development stage until the end season with kcbact kcb with the kcbact curve showing a sequence of peaks due to irrigation the latter mitigated that stress but quite insufficiently because it occurred during the period when potato is more sensitive to water stress during the initial and first part of crop development stages ke was about the same as for the fi treatment but was slightly larger in 2009 during the late season the ni treatment fig 3e and f shows a quite large period when kcbact kcb hence a long period of water stress that highly affected tuber initiation and tuberization thus highly affecting yields ke does not differ from that obtained for the fi and ri treatments during the first crop stages when rain wetting occurred but was highly reduced during the mid and late season in both years because the soil was kept dry except for short periods when small rains wetted the soil surface following the application of the kcbact and ke coefficients described above the resulting values for potential and actual transpiration tc and tcact and soil evaporation es were computed for all treatments and both years fig 4 however since there are no publications on et partition it is not possible to compare our results with others results for the fi treatment fig 4a and b show that tc and tcact curves are coincident and that tc becomes larger than es soon after the crop development stage starts es remains much smaller than tc until a date close to harvesting in 2009 and by the end season in 2010 differences relate to the occurrence of wetting during the late season of 2009 while that period was very dry in 2010 results for the ri treatment show that by the mid of the crop development stage when tuber initiation starts tcact becomes smaller than tc and remains so until harvesting despite several however insufficient irrigation events which is clearly shown by the peaks of the tcact curves fig 4c and d the es curves are similar to those of the fi treatment because all wetting events occurred on the same occasions for both fi and ri however by the end of the late season of 2010 es relative to the ri treatment became larger than that of fi because the crop was stressed and lost leaves thus increasing the energy available at soil surface for supporting es though at very small rates results for the ni treatment fig 4e and f show that tcact tc by the mid of the crop development stage and steadily decreased thereafter to values close to zero until some rains occurred in the late season to wet the soil thus providing for very small transpiration rates es is similar to that of ri and fi treatments until stress conditions start from then on es steadily decreased until late season due to the lack of soil wetting events nevertheless it increased again by the late season when some rain wetted the soil surface the results discussed above show that rain fed potatoes are likely not feasible since tcact remains much smaller than tc during the period of tuber initiation and bulking 3 3 water balance and water use the water use components as computed by simdualkc table 5 show that during the potato crop season rainfall was smaller than etcact for the fi and ri treatments in both years which means that potato cropping requires irrigation as already analysed relative to the transpiration dynamics because the ni treatments were harvested earlier seasonal p was smaller relative to p for fi and ri treatments the total water use twu was larger in the wet year due to higher precipitation and gross irrigation the latter due to the poor distribution of precipitation as depicted in fig 1 twu of the fi treatment doubled that of the rain fed ni which clearly justifies the very heavy water stress identified in figs 3 e and f and 4 e and f due to the uneven distribution of precipitation only a part of it is consumed by the crop while the excess rainfall results in deep percolation dp the smaller dp corresponds to the ni treatments and the larger one to the fi ones because without irrigation the soil is drier and retains more infiltrated water than under irrigation dp was relatively large representing from 30 of p in the case of ni and ri in the drier year of 2010 and up to 45 of p for the fi treatment in 2009 the used soil water reserve δsw was negligible for the fi treatments due to frequent wetting by irrigation and was naturally larger for the ni treatments the maximum δsw was 28 of twu in the case of ni in 2010 results for both dp and δsw indicate that water saving may be achieved when adopting irrigation schedules that maximize the use of both rainfall and stored soil water 3 4 yield and water productivity actual yields ya relate well with etcact as per table 5 however the best operational relation is found with the modified stewart s model eq 5 and 6 i e relating the relative yield loss with the relative et deficit when using a properly selected ky value fig 5 shows that by adopting ky 1 09 derived from experimental data there is a good prediction of ya though with an under estimation trend related goodness of fit indicators are shown in table 6 comparing the currently derived ky 1 09 with the commonly used ky 1 10 proposed by doorenbos and kassam 1979 it is important to note that with ky 1 09 an acceptable rmse 2 17tha 1 was obtained corresponding to nrmse of 7 6 pbias 1 8 and high ef of 0 96 comparing with results from other studies larger rmse and nrmse were reported by daccache et al 2011 and raymundo et al 2017 using dssat csm substor potato carli et al 2014 using the model solanum and singh et al 2005 using the infocrop potato smaller rmse were reported by woli et al 2016 using the model dssat csm substor potato from this comparative analysis and from the goodness of fit indicators it may be concluded that it is appropriate to estimate actual yields using the simdualkc stewart s approach and that good results achieved are due to a proper derivation of the ky factor and an accurate estimation of actual transpiration the observed ya values table 5 were used to compute various water productivity indicators fig 6 when the denominator is the seasonal irrigation amount highest wpirrig values were found for the ri treatment in both years because the increase in yield resulting from irrigation is larger with ri than with the fi treatment it can also be observed fig 6b that wpirrig ranging from 11 66 to 21 65kgm 3 is the indicator showing larger variability because it varies with the evaporative demand of the considered year and with the adopted irrigation regime large ranges of variation for wpirrig were also reported by trebejo and midmore 1990 onder et al 2005 and slatni et al 2011 and ahmadi et al 2014 thus supporting the assumption that the usefulness of wpirrig for comparative analysis among diverse studies is limited that variability decreases when referring to the total water use with highest wpwu 9 18kgm 3 for the fi treatment and the smallest 3 85kgm 3 for ni fig 6b this was expected since twu relates well with etcact and with tcact table 5 fig 6a when referring to the consumptive water use it was observed that wpet varied with climate and irrigation treatments however less than wpirrig ranging from 5 69 to 10 99kgm 3 the highest values of wpet are also found for the treatment fi and the smallest ones for ni which could be expected since etcact is directly related to yield formation higher values are found for 2010 drier than 2009 because less water was used naturally resulting in smaller yields similarly wpt ranging from 10 55kgm 3 up to 15 13kgm 3 was also higher in 2010 but contrarily to the other indicators did not vary much among treatments and years with the highest values in both years observed for the ni treatment both wpt and wpet increase with water stress since the denominators actual t and et respectively are then smaller similar results were reported by slatni et al 2011 and by carli et al 2014 overall results agree with studies by pereira et al 2012 and by paredes et al 2014 2017 showing that improving wp does not necessarily lead to reducing water use or to higher farm income thus to decide about deficit irrigation in addition to wp it is necessary to consider the economic impacts of the irrigation schedules since farmers main objective is to achieve the best income and profitability 3 5 adaptation to climate change assessing impacts of planting dates as discussed by levy and veilleux 2007 and quiroz et al 2012 one commonly studied adaptation to climate change is anticipating the planting date in such a way that more rainfall becomes available during the crop season and hot stresses are avoided therefore for the climate of both studied years four planting dates were compared 16 february 3 march 17 march and 1 april where the first date refers to earlier planting and the last corresponds to delayed planting for all dates improved irrigation schedules were aimed at maximizing the use of available soil water and minimizing deep percolation the water balance terms are presented in fig 7 for all scenarios and both years complete results are presented in appendix 1 table a1 in supplementary material results show higher rainfall available for the earliest planting date and less rainfall for the last date in both years 328 vs 175mm in 2009 and 196 vs 129mm in 2010 as well as more abundant precipitation in 2009 consequently since the used soil water reserve is relatively small averaging 43mm in the first year and 47mm in the second one when rainfall is less the season irrigation depth is increased to keep actual transpiration nearly uniform as a result there is a quite small variation of tcact 255 up to 288mm in 2009 and 253 to 282mm in 2010 the variability of etcact is also small ranging from 358 to 383mm in 2009 and from 341 to 378mm in the second year the variability of es is also small in both years because the soil is wetted by irrigation with similar frequency and considering that etcact varies little among simulated scenarios there is no room to cause noticeable changes in vegetation development thus in the soil fraction shadowed by the crop and in the energy available for es when rainfall is high as in the three first dates of 2009 or in the two first dates of 2010 deep percolation is high 105 153mm and 46 60mm respectively differently dp is low for the last date of 2009 38mm and for the two last dates of 2010 8 13mm the results above show that the improved schedules contribute to better use of rainfall and of the stored soil water on the one hand comparing with data in table 5 it is evident that dp is smaller for most of the simulated scenarios and on the other hand δsw is generally higher in both years results would be improved if applied irrigation depths were 10mm instead of 20mm because using a small depth provides a better adjustment to soil water variations however the assumed option is acceptable if intending to assess scenarios in conditions under sprinkler and trickle irrigation the appropriateness of the simulated scenarios is also noticeable by observing that the variability of tcact and etcact is quite small across scenarios planting dates and years moreover that appropriateness is also apparent in terms of water saving due to adopting optimized irrigation schedules water saving of 39 was estimated when comparing the water use computed for the full irrigation scheduling scenario with the water use observed for the fi treatment relative to the planting date of 17 march in 2009 higher water saving could be achieved for the planting dates of 16 february and 3 march 52 and 45 of the observed nid respectively for the same year delaying planting to 1st april would reduce water saving to 27 of nid relative to 2010 using the improved full irrigation schedule for the observed planting date 3 march could lead to water saving of 24 of the observed nid anticipating or delaying the planting date would result in less water saving predicted actual yields are depicted in fig 8 for the previously defined four planting dates and full mild and mod scheduling scenarios section 2 4 for the weather conditions of 2009 and 2010 those results show that yields vary a lot with the planting date particularly in 2009 with higher yields for the first two dates i e planting during the second half of february that variability follows the variability of tcact but also depends on other factors including radiation air temperature and soil temperature highest yields are predicted for the full irrigation scenario and the lowest ones for the mod scenario with the mild scenario predictions often close to full anyway the full scenario leads to higher yields than the observed ya observed for the fi treatments which may indicate that improved irrigation schedules provide for higher yields these results combined with those in fig 7 suggest to perform planting during the second half of february and to adopt irrigation schedules similar to mild or mod the latter when water availability is reduced overall the results discussed above demonstrate that optimized irrigation schedules may lead to good irrigation practices provided that a properly calibrated model such as simdualkc is used to search for the best performing solution as expected from the discussion on the observed data in section 3 4 and fig 7 wpirrig varies much fig 9 with the considered irrigation scenarios the planting dates and the year because yields vary fig 8 and irrigation requirements change with the evaporative demand as for the wpirrig computed from observations this indicator tends to be lower for the full scenario and higher for deficit irrigation i e it responds primarily to the season irrigation depth than to yields thus it is difficult to use wpirrig as comparator and its results are contradictory with the farmers perspective of increasing yields and consequent economic returns differently small variations were observed for wpet and wpt as it could be expected from the small variation of etcact and tcact as discussed before fig 7 thus both indicators may be used as comparators with their variability indicating that uncommon changes occurred in yields or in water consumptive use wpwu also show little differences among all scenarios because both ya and water used also show small differences and season water used relates well with etcact and tcact it may be concluded that wpirrig has limited usefulness as comparator and contrarily that wpet wpt and wpwu may be quite useful as water productivity comparators 4 conclusions field experimental observations performed in two years 2009 and 2010 provided for successful calibration and validation of the simdualkc model for potato crop this is the first application of the dual crop coefficient approach to potato and moreover the first one providing for an analysis of the partition of et into crop transpiration and soil evaporation the model calibration also supported the determination of basal crop coefficients kcbini kcbmid and kcbend of 0 15 1 15 and 0 35 and depletion fractions for no stress for the various crop growth stages with all p values equal to 0 40 which are the first to be reported in the literature the referred et partitioning also contributed to improve the performance of water yield modelling based upon actual transpiration since tcact is the et component effectively related with actual yield field observations of yield relative to various water stress conditions and the corresponding tcact simulated by simdualkc model were used for deriving the stewart s yield response factor ky 1 09 results of this simplified approach for yield prediction show high accuracy with no tendency for under or over estimation and low errors of estimation in comparison with predictions by other models namely the dssat csm substor potato irrigation scheduling scenarios were built and simulated for diverse planting dates anticipated and delayed relative to the observed ones simulations were performed for full irrigation and mild and moderate deficits but avoiding more than mild water stress during the most sensitive crop stages from tuber initiation to tuber bulking results of these simulations lead to conclude that 1 water saving may be achieved not only by adopting a limited water stress but scheduling irrigation to better using rainfall thus minimizing deep percolation and better using the stored soil water 2 anticipating the planting to the second half of february provides for cropping when rainfall is more abundant and avoids heat stresses in the late season therefore decreasing the need to irrigate 3 improved irrigation schedules and anticipated planting contribute to higher yield provided that n fertilizing is adequate 4 wp indicators are generally improved for the anticipated planting dates the observed irrigation schedules and those relative to the simulated scenarios were analysed using water productivity indicators relative to irrigation wpirrig actual crop evapotranspiration wpet actual transpiration wpt and season water used wpwu results for wpirrig show high variability because they depend much on irrigation management options with higher values when irrigation was less and lower values when full irrigation was adopted although highest yields were then obtained differently wpet and wpt had highest values for full irrigation in both years when etcact and tcact were highest but yield was also highest wpwu behaved similarly to wpet and wpt because the seasonal water used varies proportionally to etcact and tcact the current results support the adoption of

11609,rainfall or sprinkler irrigation water partitioning by the crop canopy is an important way of affecting the effective use of water by maize to investigate the rainfall partitioning by maize canopy at different growth stages as well as its influencing factors on the water limited loess plateau of china the gross rainfall throughfall and stemflow were measured during the growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 the effects of rainfall characteristics gross rainfall and rainfall intensity and canopy structure leaf area index on rainfall partitioning were further evaluated based on which multiple regression models were developed to predict the partitioned rainfall components results showed that the measured throughfall stemflow and derived interception loss accounted for 65 2 22 3 and 12 5 of cumulative gross rainfall during the whole growing season of maize respectively specifically the relative throughfall declined from 83 2 at the seedling stage to 52 2 at the tasseling stage and then increased to 58 6 at the maturity stage the relative stemflow and interception loss increased from 13 6 and 3 1 at the seedling stage to 30 6 and 17 3 at the tasseling stage and then declined to 25 0 and 16 5 at the maturity stage respectively smaller rainfall events contributed to a lower percentage of throughfall and stemflow but higher percentage of canopy interception loss the percentages of stemflow and throughfall showed an increased tendency with increasing gross rainfall and rainfall intensity while the increasing leaf area index resulted in a decrease in the relative throughfall but an increase in relative stemflow and interception loss generally the amount of throughfall stemflow and canopy interception loss can be predicted reasonably well using the developed multiple linear regression models but the proportions of partitioned rainfall components generally had a relatively lower accuracy using the developed nonlinear models especially for relative stemflow this study can help to determine more precise irrigation schedule by the water balance method and give implications for the operation of sprinkler irrigation systems for higher irrigation water use efficiency keywords rainfall amount rainfall intensity leaf area index multiple regression irrigation schedule 1 introduction rainfall or sprinkler irrigation water above the crop canopy is partitioned into three components as it moves towards the ground i e throughfall stemflow and canopy interception loss throughfall reaches the ground directly through the canopy gaps without canopy interception or drips from the leaves after temporal storage in the canopy dunkerley 2000 fan et al 2015 stemflow is the portion of rainfall that flows down the plant stem and concentrates in the root zone around the stem base lamm and manges 2000 liu et al 2015 these rainfall partitioning processes affect the volume and also the spatial distribution of effective rainfall reaching the soil surface representing the sum of throughfall and stemflow which is often the major or even the sole source of soil water replenishment and can be of significance to the crop s survival in arid and semi arid areas li et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 canopy interception loss refers to the part of rainfall that is intercepted reserved and eventually evaporated back into the atmosphere during and after rainfall or sprinkler irrigation jackson 2000 fan et al 2014 which reduces the availability of total water input to the field and can be a significant water loss in agricultural ecosystems field and laboratory investigations have exhibited considerable variability in the partitioning of rainfall or sprinkler irrigation by crops especially for maize plants steiner et al 1983 measured the throughfall stemflow and incident amount of water and calculated the interception loss by maize canopy through a water budget method when the leaf area index exceeded 3 0m2 m 2 they found that throughfall and stemflow ranged from 31 to 55 and 35 to 64 respectively and canopy interception loss was about 10 zheng et al 2012 found the average of throughfall stemflow and interception loss occupied 65 68 26 79 and 7 53 during the whole growth period of maize by using a rainfall simulator while the relative throughfall stemflow and interception loss were 53 4 33 3 and 13 3 under natural rainfall conditions han et al 2014 according to a literature reviewed by paltineanu and starr 2000 the throughfall generally ranged from 35 to 84 and the stemflow varied between 12 and 57 under sprinkler irrigation conditions these studies indicate that there still exist large differences in the results of water partitioning by maize canopy causing these results cannot be directly applied to other regions moreover there are few studies focusing on the rainfall partitioning at different growth stages of maize compared with the present studies mostly developed in matured maize the semi arid loess plateau of china is an important region for food production in china where maize zea mays l is one of most popular grain crops this region experiences approximately 200mm to 750mm of annual rainfall with approximately 70 of which falling between june and september ren et al 2008 droughts occur frequently and water scarcity is becoming a major problem during the maize growing season the key to increase agricultural productivity lies in how to maximize the utilization of limited and erratic rainwater resources and how to plan precise irrigation schedule during the whole growing season of maize in high evaporative potential regions such as the loess plateau rainfall of less than 5mm per event was mostly considered to be ineffective or unproductive rainfall wu et al 2016 with the rest as effective rainfall the effective rainfall was also estimated by using a simple utilization coefficient rajak et al 2006 zheng et al 2013 however the interception loss caused by the crop canopy during larger rainfall or sprinkler irrigation events has always been overlooked when planning the irrigation schedule by the water balance method which is expected to underestimate the actual amount of irrigation water required by the crop and thus causes the reduction in grain yield thus throughfall stemflow and canopy interception loss at different growth stages of maize were systematically measured in this study the main influencing factors on rainfall partitioning were further explored based on which multiple regression models were developed to predict the partitioned rainfall components this study was expected to provide a simple model for canopy interception loss prediction which was further used to determine more precise irrigation schedule by water balance method the study also tended to have implications for the operation of sprinkler irrigation systems at different growth stages of maize to improve the irrigation water use efficiency 2 materials methods 2 1 site description field experiments were carried out in 2015 and 2016 at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering in arid and semiarid area sponsored by ministry of education 34 18 n 108 24 e 521 0m above sea level at northwest a f university in yangling shaanxi province of china this area classified as a semi arid zone has a warm temperate and monsoon climate dong et al 2013 mean annual precipitation is 560mm 1995 2014 with 65 of rain falling between june and september with a coefficient of variation of 29 7 the annual mean air temperature at the site is 12 9 c and the annual mean pan evaporation is 1500mm gu et al 2016 the total annual sunshine hour is 2196h and the frost free period is 220 d 2 2 experimental design the plastic film mulched ridge and the bare furrow planting system was adopted in this experiment as a common agronomic practice on the loess plateau to improve the rainwater use efficiency ren et al 2008 liu et al 2016 each experimental plot was 10m long and 6m wide with three replications which were separated by a 1 5m wide zone surrounding each plot to minimize the mutual effects of adjacent plots the maize hybrid of zhengdan 958 was used in this study as it is a high yielding maize variety and widely grown by local farmers the maize was sown with a row and plant spacing of 60cm 25cm on 15 june 2015 and 12 june 2016 which is a typical planting pattern for maize before the maize was sown all plots received a basal fertilizer of 180kgha 1 n 120kgha 1 p2o5 and 60kgha 1 k2o there was no irrigation and fertilization during the maize growing season in both years according to the maize growth characteristics in the two years the entire growing season was roughly divided into four growth stages i e seedling from 20 june to 10 july jointing from 11 july to 31 july tasseling from 1 august to 31 august and maturity from 1 september to 1 october 2 3 collection of gross rainfall and other meteorological variables the gross rainfall p mm was recorded by a standard ticking bucket rain gauge with an accuracy of 0 1mm and a mini logger recording 60 min rainfall amount from an automatic weather station hobo event logger usa located in a nearby clearing at a distance of 25m four collecting containers 10cm in diameter and 15cm in height were also placed around the experimental plot to obtain average gross rainfall the rainfall volume from collecting containers was measured right after each rainfall event a rainfall event was defined as a rainfall period from preceding and succeeding rainfall being separated by at least 6h without rainfall the average rainfall intensity ri mm h during each rainfall event was estimated by the weighted mean hourly rainfall intensity 1 r i i 1 n r i g r i i where n is the number of hours recorded by the rain gauge during a rainfall event ri is the rainfall amount mm at the ith hour and g is the gross rainfall during a rainfall event air temperature and relative humidity were measured every an hour and 10 min averages of wind speed at 10m were also recorded by the weather station to comprehensively reflect the synergistic effect of air temperature and relative humidity we adopted the index of vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa which was calculated as 2 v p d 0 611 e 17 502 t a t a 240 97 1 r h where ta is the air temperature c and rh is the relative humidity 2 4 collection of throughfall and stemflow the throughfall t mm was collected by 15 containers located beneath four adjacent maize plants at each experimental plot fig 1 their sites were randomly chosen and ensured that these containers covered a ground area representative of the row and plant spacings throughfall volume was measured manually right after the cessation of individual rainfall and converted to an average equivalent depth by dividing the horizontal cross sectional area of the container tanaka et al 2015 each throughfall measurement had three replicates the relative throughfall tr was defined as the ratio between throughfall and gross rainfall for each rainfall event six maize plants were selected for stemflow measurements the stemflow was collected using collars constructed from plastic plates that were fitted around the entire circumference of the maize stem and a slot with a transfer hose was designed to drain the stemflow water from the stemflow collars to the collecting containers that held accumulated stemflow fig 2 the stemflow volume was measured using a graduated cylinder after each rainfall event the equivalent stemflow depth was derived using the following equation 3 s v s a where s is the stemflow depth mm vs is the stemflow volume l and a is the average ground area occupied by a maize plant 60cm 25cm the relative stemflow sr was defined as the ratio of stemflow to gross rainfall 2 5 derivation of canopy interception loss interception loss by maize canopy i mm for each rainfall event was further derived by the water balance method zhang et al 2015 fan et al 2015 4 i g t s the relative interception loss ir was defined as the ratio of interception loss to gross rainfall 2 6 leaf area index measurement and calculation three plants per experimental plot during the growing seasons with three replicates were randomly selected to measure leaf area every 5 10 days the total la cm2 of a single maize plant can be calculated using the following equation qi et al 2012 5 l a j 1 n k l j w j where n is the number of leaves on a maize plant k is a correction coefficient with the value of 0 75 li is the length of the ith leaf cm and wi is the maximum width of the ith leaf cm the leaf area index lai m2 m 2 was calculated as the green la per unit ground area in broadleaf canopies 6 l a i 0 0001 l a n where n is the number of maize plants per square meter of ground 2 7 statistical analysis we used one way anova analysis significant at the p 0 05 level to test the statistical differences of leaf area index between different growing stages the correlations between rainfall partitioning and influencing factors i e rainfall characteristics leaf area index and other meteorological variables were analyzed using pearson correlation additionally we developed multiple linear or nonlinear regressions using the data acquired from the experiment conducted in 2015 to determine the relationships between the amount and proportions of partitioned rainfall components and the rainfall characteristics as well as leaf area index data acquired in 2016 were used for the validation of the developed regression models the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse between the predicted and observed values were used to test the goodness of fit of the regression models dokoohaki et al 2016 the higher values of r2 and lower values of rmse and nrmse represented the higher accuracy of the model for predicting the partitioned rainfall components all the descriptive statistics and regressions were performed using the spss 16 0 statistical software spss inc chicago usa and sigmaplot 10 0 systat software san jose ca was used for the illustrations 3 results discussion 3 1 characteristics of meteorological variables a total of 23 rainfall events were identified during the two growing seasons of 2015 12 events and 2016 11 events resulting in a cumulative rainfall of 269 9mm in 2015 and 261 1mm in 2016 fig 3 both of which were lower than the long term mean seasonal rainfall of 332 9mm average event rainfall amount to the study area was 23 1mm and ranged from 1 9mm to 87 8mm on the basis of the rainfall amount the gross rainfall was divided into five classes 5 5 15 15 30 30 50 and 50mm as per the rainfall classification system of the china meteorological administration gong et al 2004 fig 4 rainfall events 30mm were much less frequent accounting for only 30 4 of the total number of rainfall events but representing 70 0 of the total rainfall most rainfall events were less than 30mm 69 6 of total events small rainfall events 5mm occurred frequently 30 4 of total events but their contribution to the seasonal rainfall was less than 4 5 although only three heavy rainfall events 50mm were recorded they accounted for 37 8 of the seasonal rainfall the frequency distributions of rainfall intensity were highly positively skewed for both number of rainfall event and rainfall amount fig 4b indicating low intensity rainfall to be much more frequent than high intensity rainfall the average weighted rainfall intensity during each rainfall event varied from 0 4 to 48 1mmh 1 with an average of 11 8mmh 1 there were 16 and 6 rainfall events with intensity 5mmh 1 and between 5 and 30mmh 1 respectively the sum of individual events with intensity 5mmh 1 occupied 30 4 of events and 56 2 of the rainfall amount fig 3 also showed the wind speed fig 3c g and vpd fig 3d h distributions within the 23 rainfall events during our experimental periods the wind speed during each rainfall ranged 0 99 7 42ms 1 with an average of 2 54ms 1 while vpd varied between 0 088kpa and 0 99kpa with an average of 0 26kpa 3 2 rainfall partitioning at during different growth stages of maize a cumulative rainfall of 531mm during the two growing seasons of maize in 2015 and 2016 were recorded where the throughfall accounted for 32 5 to 87 0 of the individual gross rainfall averaging 65 2 during the two growing seasons and the stemflow occupied 0 33 5 of the gross rainfall on average 22 3 table 1 canopy interception loss ranged from 1 7 to 63 4 of the gross rainfall averaging 12 5 during the two growing seasons specifically the relative throughfall decreased initially and then increased as the maize grew while the changes of the relative stemflow and interception loss were opposite with maximum value appearing at the tasseling stage this reflected the strongest influence of maize plants on rainfall partitioning occurred at this stage the relative throughfall declined from 83 2 at the seedling stage to 68 9 at the jointing stage and following to 52 2 at the tasseling stage and then increased to 58 6 at the maturity stage the corresponding relative stemflow values were 13 6 19 5 30 6 and 25 0 during the four stages and the relative interception loss was 3 1 11 7 17 3 and 16 5 during the corresponding periods respectively the relative throughfall stemflow and canopy interception loss reached the maximum or minimum at the tasseling stage which was generally in accordance with previous studies zheng et al 2012 as maize grew leaf area index and canopy coverage increased thereby resulting in large differences in the rainfall partitioning the observed average relative stemflow in the present study was lower but the relative throughfall and interception loss values were higher than those in previous rainfall partitioning studies on maize quinn and laflen 1983 liu et al 2015 ma et al 2016 rainfall intensity in our study average 11 8mmh 1 was generally smaller than that in other studies e g the designed rainfall intensity ranged from 19 8mmh 1 to 79 8mmh 1 in ma et al 2016 from 60mmh 1 to 120mmh 1 in zheng et al 2012 and from 34 8mmh 1 to 90 6mmh 1 in lin et al 2011 under artificial rainfall conditions the lower rainfall intensity made large amount of rainfall intercepted and evaporated during rainfall events and not diverted to stemflow and throughfall norman and campbell 1983 pointed out that atmospheric evaporation plays an indispensible role in influencing the canopy interception loss low intensity rainfall generally lasted for a longer time and increased the canopy interception loss during the rainfall events lamm and manges 2000 measured throughfall and stemflow of fully tasseled maize under sprinkler irrigation conditions they found that throughfall percentage of a 25mm irrigation amount increased from 43 4 at 20cm plant spacing to 50 at the 41cm plant spacing which was also identified by quinn and laflen 1983 due to a decrease in leaf area index by narrowing the plant spacing however the effects of wind speed on rainfall partitioning by maize canopy can be also important han et al 2014 saffigna et al 1976 found that the stemflow rates of maize declined from 46 during a 13mm irrigation to 23 during an 11cm rainfall which was largely attributed to the strong winds this may explain the lower stemflow of 22 3 in our natural rainfall experiments resulting from relatively high wind speed on average 2 54ms 1 compared to higher values in other maize studies e g 35 4 under artificial rainfall without winds zheng et al 2012 and about 50 under sprinkler irrigation with weak winds lamm and manges 2000 3 3 correlations between rainfall partitioning and meteorological variables the amount and proportions of partitioned rainfall components at different growth stages of maize generally had statistically significant correlations with rainfall amount and rainfall intensity but no significant correlations with wind speed and vapor pressure deficit were detected table 2 these results were similar to the finding by zhang et al 2015 who found that meteorological variables such as air temperature relative humidity and wind speed had no significant correlations with rainfall partitioning but rainfall characteristics rainfall amount intensity and duration exerted a dominant effect thus the relations between rainfall partitioning and rainfall amount and intensity were further analyzed 3 4 rainfall partitioning in relation to rainfall characteristics 3 4 1 rainfall partitioning in relation to gross rainfall the throughfall increased with increasing gross rainfall amount and was significantly linearly correlated with gross rainfall during different growth stages of maize r2 0 99 p 0 01 fig 5 a which was in good agreement with the relationships found by other researchers for snowgum dunkerley 2010 natural and planted pine forests ghimire et al 2012 fan et al 2015 one way anova analysis on the slope values of regression lines indicated that there was a significant difference p 0 05 in the regression models of relative throughfall among different growth stages thus the four models could not be replaced by each other the relative throughfall first increased dramatically and then tended to be stable after a threshold value of 20mm following a power function the stemflow was also linearly related to the gross rainfall during different growth stages r2 0 91 p 0 05 indicating that a significant correlation between stemflow and gross rainfall this linear relationship was also established in previous literature on maize stemflow paltineanu and starr 2000 ma et al 2014 liu et al 2015 and was similar to results for soybean ma et al 2014 and forest trees zhang et al 2015 the relative stemflow increased with gross rainfall amount and became nearly constant for larger rainfall events fig 5e following a power function at the seedling stage the interception loss had a weak relation with gross rainfall amount at other growth stages it had positive linear relationships with gross rainfall amount especially during the maturity stage r2 0 95 p 0 01 fig 5c the relative interception loss first sharply decreased with increasing rainfall amount and then tended to be stable after a threshold value of 20mm following a power function fig 5f confirming that the largest interception loss occurs during small rainfall events price and carlyle moses 2003 zhang et al 2015 this may also reflect that a large proportion of rainwater during the initial phase was intercepted or absorbed by maize leaves or stems to wet the canopy and ultimately converted into interception loss resulting in lower values of relative throughfall and stemflow subsequently with increasing rainfall amount maize canopy was gradually saturated and reached its maximum value of canopy interception loss during rainfall resulting in a decrease in the percentage of canopy interception loss to gross rainfall ignoring the amount of intercepted rainfall loss by maize canopies or lumping it with evapotranspiration can lead to large errors in the estimation of the other components of the water budget savenije 2004 3 4 2 rainfall partitioning in relation to rainfall intensity the amount of throughfall stemflow and canopy interception loss generally increased with increasing rainfall intensity the percentages of throughfall and stemflow increased with increasing rainfall intensity fig 6 b e these similar positive relationships were also established by zhang et al 2015 2016 for shrubs on the contrary the relative interception loss showed a decreasing tendency with increasing rainfall intensity fig 6f rainfall intensity not only represents how much water falls within a unit time but it also describes the dynamic energy that falls on the leaf surface thus the rainfall kinetic energy imposed on leaf surface is correspondingly increased with increasing rainfall intensity increasing the possibility of rainfall to pass through canopy gaps and intensifying the sway of plant leaves this forces the interception loss to divert into the throughfall and changes the proportion of canopy adsorption causing the decrease in relative interception loss with increasing rainfall intensity calder 1996 murakami 2006 nanko et al 2011 meanwhile higher intensity rainfall is more effective in saturating canopy and can influence the collection and transfer of rainwater than lower intensity rainfall which helps to the generation of stemflow at the seedling stage the tr sr and ir changed dramatically with the increase in rainfall intensity especially for the highest intensity of 5 39mmh 1 this may be due to that maize plants were soft and weak at this stage which was vulnerable to the influence of rainfall drops as maize grew the ability of anti attack was enhanced so the change trend were slowed down at other growth stages ma et al 2015 the relationships between relative stemflow and rainfall intensity in the literature were quite controversial our results supported the findings of zhang et al 2015 for two xerophytic shrubs however relative stemflow rate decreased with increasing rainfall intensity studied by ma et al 2008 for maize and crockford and richardson 2000 for eucalyptus more research thus needs to be undertaken to better understand the relationship between relative stemflow and rainfall intensity 3 5 rainfall partitioning in relation to leaf area index incident rainfall first reaches the leaf surface then a portion of rainfall is intercepted and evaporated from surface area a portion of rainfall is collected and flows along the leaf to the stem and another portion of rainfall penetrates the leaf gap into the ground surface thus the leaf area is an important factor influencing the rainfall partitioning liu et al 2015 lai were significantly different among the four phenophases table 1 at the seedling stage the ground area vertically shaded by maize canopy was limited and the average leaf area index was only 0 10m2 m 2 with weaker capability of stemflow production and canopy interception loss thus the higher throughfall percentage was largely attributed to the much lower leaf area index at this stage park and cameron 2008 zhang et al 2015 lai gradually increased with leaf budding and expansion increasing to 1 56m2 m 2 during the jointing stage which resulted in a higher relative stemflow and interception loss compared with the seedling stage lai reached the maximum of 4 22m2 m 2 at the tasseling stage when more rainwater was collected and diverted to the stem base or stored in the leaf surface and finally evaporated back to the atmosphere afterwards lai decreased gradually due to the drying of maize leaves leading to a decrease in the efficient interception leaf area therefore the relative throughfall showed an increasing tendency at the end of growing season whereas the relative stemflow and canopy interception loss declined table 1 during the whole growing seasons the average of throughfall stemflow and canopy interception loss accounted for 42 4 11 3 and 46 3 of gross rainfall for rainfall events less than 5mm respectively the low relative throughfall and stemflow but higher interception loss for small rainfall events was mainly due to the fact that the majority of rainfall was partitioned as canopy storage and eventually interception loss price and carlyle moses 2003 nanko et al 2011 fathizadeh et al 2014 to better explore the relationships between the relative throughfall stemflow canopy interception loss and leaf area index regression models were developed using two years data to express the relationship of these three components and leaf area index at different rainfall classes 5mm 5 15mm 15 30mm and 30mm fig 4 it was shown that the relative throughfall was correlated with lai as a power function r2 0 71 the relative throughfall decreased from 83 2 to 52 2 as lai increased from 0 01 to 4 22m2 m 2 for all rainfall events the negative relationship between the relative throughfall and lai for maize has been confirmed in previous studies ma et al 2014 2015 further the negative relationships between relative throughfall and lai has been found for soybean winter wheat ma et al 2014 and forest trees molina and del campo 2012 also positive power correlations were found between the relative stemflow r2 0 60 canopy interception r2 0 74 and lai the study of effects of plants on the water redistribution by ma et al 2014 2015 revealed similar positive relationships rainfall is mainly partitioned by top layer blades rather than by low layer blades liu et al 2015 studied the maize stemflow and its influencing factors who proposed that canopy with lai of 2 0m2 m 2 may be enough for intercepting most rainfall amount and the increase in lai for lai 2 0m2 m 2 by leaves in the low layer had little effect on canopy interception loss and stemflow rate therefore leaf overlapping slowed the increasing tendency of canopy coverage and the change rates of these three portions with increase of lai further study is thus needed on the determination of canopy coverage to better reflect the process of rainfall partitioning fig 7 3 6 multiple regression analysis concerning the interactions of multiple factors the effects of the influencing factors on rainfall partitioning may be better interpreted based on the results of the multiple regressions than of the single regressions zheng et al 2012 ma et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 thus we derived equations using rainfall data collected during the growing season of 2015 using multiple linear nonlinear regression analysis relating rainfall partitioning to rainfall characteristics and lai for a better prediction of petitioned rainfall components table 3 we found that the coefficients of determination of the regression equations were greater than 0 81 for rainfall amount and greater than 0 82 for relative values except for relative stemflow r2 0 61 to test and verify the applicability of the developed models we further compared the simulated rainfall data from regression models and the measured rainfall data for the growing season of 2016 fig 8 showed that the slopes of linear regressions between the predicted and measured rainfall values were close to 1 0 indicating generally satisfactory performance of the developed models however the relatively lower r2 values and higher nrmse between the observed and predicted values for relative stemflow r2 0 48 nrmse 24 37 showed a less prominent agreement between these three variables and sr the prediction of relative stemflow may be improved by precise measurements of actual rainwater collection area of leaf for stemflow such as leaf inclination angle and the ratio of leaf area of drooping leaves account to the total la besides incorporating other meteorological variables such as wind speed and vpd may also improve the prediction accuracy although they were not significantly correlated with the rainfall partitioning in the present study generally the amount of throughfall stemflow and canopy interception loss can be predicted with a relatively high accuracy based on the data of rainfall characteristics and leaf area index r2 0 85 nrmse 10 34 but the proportions of partitioned rainfall components generally had a relatively lower accuracy especially for relative stemflow 3 7 implications for agricultural water management the results confirmed that the interception loss by maize canopy can lead to a significant reduction in total water input to the field rainfall or sprinkler irrigation water which should not be ignored when determining the irrigation schedule by the water balance method prior to planning the irrigation schedule the interception of rainfall or sprinkler irrigation water during the whole growing season of maize is recommended to be estimated using the developed models from rainfall amount intensity and leaf area index based on which the effective rainfall can be obtained and subsequently used to determine the actual water required by maize plants as the difference between the calculated crop water requirement and the effective rainfall moreover similar to natural rainfall sprinkler irrigation water can also be intercepted and partitioned by maize canopy in a sprinkler system the spray losses and interception of water by the plant canopy need to be reduced in order to improve the irrigation efficiency statistical analyses indicated that the water amount sprinkler intensity and leaf area index can be major factors influencing the water partitioning process figs 5 7 thus regulating the irrigation amount and sprinkler intensity above the maize canopy at different growth stages of maize is of high importance for the improvement in sprinkler irrigation efficiency for instance under the same amount of irrigation water a higher sprinkler intensity is preferred especially at the later growth stages of maize when the canopy coverage is large so as to significantly reduce the canopy interception loss and improve the irritation water use efficiency 4 conclusions as presented in this work seasonal gross rainfall was partitioned by maize canopy as follows 65 2 throughfall 22 3 stemflow and 12 5 canopy interception loss as the maize grew the throughfall rate decreased initially and then increased while the changes of stemflow rate and interception rate were opposite throughfall and stemflow depth as well as canopy interception loss increased with gross rainfall and were significantly linearly correlated with gross rainfall amount at different growth stages the rainfall intensity also influenced the redistribution of throughfall stemflow and canopy interception and their proportions the throughfall stemflow and canopy interception all increased with the increase in rainfall intensity the relative throughfall generally increased with increasing rainfall intensity while the relative stemflow and canopy interception decreased with increasing rainfall intensity with gross rainfall rainfall intensity and leaf area index the amount and proportions of partitioned rainfall components during the whole growing season of maize can be predicted relatively accurately using the developed regression models except for relative stemflow acknowledgements this study was jointly supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 51509208 the national key research and development program of china no 2016yfc0400201

11609,rainfall or sprinkler irrigation water partitioning by the crop canopy is an important way of affecting the effective use of water by maize to investigate the rainfall partitioning by maize canopy at different growth stages as well as its influencing factors on the water limited loess plateau of china the gross rainfall throughfall and stemflow were measured during the growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 the effects of rainfall characteristics gross rainfall and rainfall intensity and canopy structure leaf area index on rainfall partitioning were further evaluated based on which multiple regression models were developed to predict the partitioned rainfall components results showed that the measured throughfall stemflow and derived interception loss accounted for 65 2 22 3 and 12 5 of cumulative gross rainfall during the whole growing season of maize respectively specifically the relative throughfall declined from 83 2 at the seedling stage to 52 2 at the tasseling stage and then increased to 58 6 at the maturity stage the relative stemflow and interception loss increased from 13 6 and 3 1 at the seedling stage to 30 6 and 17 3 at the tasseling stage and then declined to 25 0 and 16 5 at the maturity stage respectively smaller rainfall events contributed to a lower percentage of throughfall and stemflow but higher percentage of canopy interception loss the percentages of stemflow and throughfall showed an increased tendency with increasing gross rainfall and rainfall intensity while the increasing leaf area index resulted in a decrease in the relative throughfall but an increase in relative stemflow and interception loss generally the amount of throughfall stemflow and canopy interception loss can be predicted reasonably well using the developed multiple linear regression models but the proportions of partitioned rainfall components generally had a relatively lower accuracy using the developed nonlinear models especially for relative stemflow this study can help to determine more precise irrigation schedule by the water balance method and give implications for the operation of sprinkler irrigation systems for higher irrigation water use efficiency keywords rainfall amount rainfall intensity leaf area index multiple regression irrigation schedule 1 introduction rainfall or sprinkler irrigation water above the crop canopy is partitioned into three components as it moves towards the ground i e throughfall stemflow and canopy interception loss throughfall reaches the ground directly through the canopy gaps without canopy interception or drips from the leaves after temporal storage in the canopy dunkerley 2000 fan et al 2015 stemflow is the portion of rainfall that flows down the plant stem and concentrates in the root zone around the stem base lamm and manges 2000 liu et al 2015 these rainfall partitioning processes affect the volume and also the spatial distribution of effective rainfall reaching the soil surface representing the sum of throughfall and stemflow which is often the major or even the sole source of soil water replenishment and can be of significance to the crop s survival in arid and semi arid areas li et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 canopy interception loss refers to the part of rainfall that is intercepted reserved and eventually evaporated back into the atmosphere during and after rainfall or sprinkler irrigation jackson 2000 fan et al 2014 which reduces the availability of total water input to the field and can be a significant water loss in agricultural ecosystems field and laboratory investigations have exhibited considerable variability in the partitioning of rainfall or sprinkler irrigation by crops especially for maize plants steiner et al 1983 measured the throughfall stemflow and incident amount of water and calculated the interception loss by maize canopy through a water budget method when the leaf area index exceeded 3 0m2 m 2 they found that throughfall and stemflow ranged from 31 to 55 and 35 to 64 respectively and canopy interception loss was about 10 zheng et al 2012 found the average of throughfall stemflow and interception loss occupied 65 68 26 79 and 7 53 during the whole growth period of maize by using a rainfall simulator while the relative throughfall stemflow and interception loss were 53 4 33 3 and 13 3 under natural rainfall conditions han et al 2014 according to a literature reviewed by paltineanu and starr 2000 the throughfall generally ranged from 35 to 84 and the stemflow varied between 12 and 57 under sprinkler irrigation conditions these studies indicate that there still exist large differences in the results of water partitioning by maize canopy causing these results cannot be directly applied to other regions moreover there are few studies focusing on the rainfall partitioning at different growth stages of maize compared with the present studies mostly developed in matured maize the semi arid loess plateau of china is an important region for food production in china where maize zea mays l is one of most popular grain crops this region experiences approximately 200mm to 750mm of annual rainfall with approximately 70 of which falling between june and september ren et al 2008 droughts occur frequently and water scarcity is becoming a major problem during the maize growing season the key to increase agricultural productivity lies in how to maximize the utilization of limited and erratic rainwater resources and how to plan precise irrigation schedule during the whole growing season of maize in high evaporative potential regions such as the loess plateau rainfall of less than 5mm per event was mostly considered to be ineffective or unproductive rainfall wu et al 2016 with the rest as effective rainfall the effective rainfall was also estimated by using a simple utilization coefficient rajak et al 2006 zheng et al 2013 however the interception loss caused by the crop canopy during larger rainfall or sprinkler irrigation events has always been overlooked when planning the irrigation schedule by the water balance method which is expected to underestimate the actual amount of irrigation water required by the crop and thus causes the reduction in grain yield thus throughfall stemflow and canopy interception loss at different growth stages of maize were systematically measured in this study the main influencing factors on rainfall partitioning were further explored based on which multiple regression models were developed to predict the partitioned rainfall components this study was expected to provide a simple model for canopy interception loss prediction which was further used to determine more precise irrigation schedule by water balance method the study also tended to have implications for the operation of sprinkler irrigation systems at different growth stages of maize to improve the irrigation water use efficiency 2 materials methods 2 1 site description field experiments were carried out in 2015 and 2016 at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering in arid and semiarid area sponsored by ministry of education 34 18 n 108 24 e 521 0m above sea level at northwest a f university in yangling shaanxi province of china this area classified as a semi arid zone has a warm temperate and monsoon climate dong et al 2013 mean annual

pan evaporation is 1500mm gu et al 2016 the total annual sunshine hour is 2196h and the frost free period is 220 d 2 2 experimental design the plastic film mulched ridge and the bare furrow planting system was adopted in this experiment as a common agronomic practice on the loess plateau to improve the rainwater use efficiency ren et al 2008 liu et al 2016 each experimental plot was 10m long and 6m wide with three replications which were separated by a 1 5m wide zone surrounding each plot to minimize the mutual effects of adjacent plots the maize hybrid of zhengdan 958 was used in this study as it is a high yielding maize variety and widely grown by local farmers the maize was sown with a row and plant spacing of 60cm 25cm on 15 june 2015 and 12 june 2016 which is a typical planting pattern for maize before the maize was sown all plots received a basal fertilizer of 180kgha 1 n 120kgha 1 p2o5 and 60kgha 1 k2o there was no irrigation and fertilization during the maize growing season in both years according to the maize growth characteristics in the two years the entire growing season was roughly divided into four growth stages i e seedling from 20 june to 10 july jointing from 11 july to 31 july tasseling from 1 august to 31 august and maturity from 1 september to 1 october 2 3 collection of gross rainfall and other meteorological variables the gross rainfall p mm was recorded by a standard ticking bucket rain gauge with an accuracy of 0 1mm and a mini logger recording 60 min rainfall amount from an automatic weather station hobo event logger usa located in a nearby clearing at a distance of 25m four collecting containers 10cm in diameter and 15cm in height were also placed around the experimental plot to obtain average gross rainfall the rainfall volume from collecting containers was measured right after each rainfall event a rainfall event was defined as a rainfall period from preceding and succeeding rainfall being separated by at least 6h without rainfall the average rainfall intensity ri mm h during each rainfall event was estimated by the weighted mean hourly rainfall intensity 1 r i i 1 n r i g r i i where n is the number of hours recorded by the rain gauge during a rainfall event ri is the rainfall amount mm at the ith hour and g is the gross rainfall during a rainfall event air temperature and relative humidity were measured every an hour and 10 min averages of wind speed at 10m were also recorded by the weather station to comprehensively reflect the synergistic effect of air temperature and relative humidity we adopted the index of vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa which was calculated as 2 v p d 0 611 e 17 502 t a t a 240 97 1 r h where ta is the air temperature c and rh is the relative humidity 2 4 collection of throughfall and stemflow the throughfall t mm was collected by 15 containers located beneath four adjacent maize plants at each experimental plot fig 1 their sites were randomly chosen and ensured that these containers covered a ground area representative of the row and plant spacings throughfall volume was measured manually right after the cessation of individual rainfall and converted to an average equivalent depth by dividing the horizontal cross sectional area of the container tanaka et al 2015 each throughfall measurement had three replicates the relative throughfall tr was defined as the ratio between throughfall and gross rainfall for each rainfall event six maize plants were selected for stemflow measurements the stemflow was collected using collars constructed from plastic plates that were fitted around the entire circumference of the maize stem and a slot with a transfer hose was designed to drain the stemflow water from the stemflow collars to the collecting containers that held accumulated stemflow fig 2 the stemflow volume was measured using a graduated cylinder after each rainfall event the equivalent stemflow depth was derived using the following equation 3 s v s a where s is the stemflow depth mm vs is the stemflow volume l and a is the average ground area occupied by a maize plant 60cm 25cm the relative stemflow sr was defined as the ratio of stemflow to gross rainfall 2 5 derivation of canopy interception loss interception loss by maize canopy i mm for each rainfall event was further derived by the water balance method zhang et al 2015 fan et al 2015 4 i g t s the relative interception loss ir was defined as the ratio of interception loss to gross rainfall 2 6 leaf area index measurement and calculation three plants per experimental plot during the growing seasons with three replicates were randomly selected to measure leaf area every 5 10 days the total la cm2 of a single maize plant can be calculated using the following equation qi et al 2012 5 l a j 1 n k l j w j where n is the number of leaves on a maize plant k is a correction coefficient with the value of 0 75 li is the length of the ith leaf cm and wi is the maximum width of the ith leaf cm the leaf area index lai m2 m 2 was calculated as the green la per unit ground area in broadleaf canopies 6 l a i 0 0001 l a n where n is the number of maize plants per square meter of ground 2 7 statistical analysis we used one way anova analysis significant at the p 0 05 level to test the statistical differences of leaf area index between different growing stages the correlations between rainfall partitioning and influencing factors i e rainfall characteristics leaf area index and other meteorological variables were analyzed using pearson correlation additionally we developed multiple linear or nonlinear regressions using the data acquired from the experiment conducted in 2015 to determine the relationships between the amount and proportions of partitioned rainfall components and the rainfall characteristics as well as leaf area index data acquired in 2016 were used for the validation of the developed regression models the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse between the predicted and observed values were used to test the goodness of fit of the regression models dokoohaki et al 2016 the higher values of r2 and lower values of rmse and nrmse represented the higher accuracy of the model for predicting the partitioned rainfall components all the descriptive statistics and regressions were performed using the spss 16 0 statistical software spss inc chicago usa and sigmaplot 10 0 systat software san jose ca was used for the illustrations 3 results discussion 3 1 characteristics of meteorological variables a total of 23 rainfall events were identified during the two growing seasons of 2015 12 events and 2016 11 events resulting in a cumulative rainfall of 269 9mm in 2015 and 261 1mm in 2016 fig 3 both of which were lower than the long term mean seasonal rainfall of 332 9mm average event rainfall amount to the study area was 23 1mm and ranged from 1 9mm to 87 8mm on the basis of the rainfall amount the gross rainfall was divided into five classes 5 5 15 15 30 30 50 and 50mm as per the rainfall classification system of the china meteorological administration gong et al 2004 fig 4 rainfall events 30mm were much less frequent accounting for only 30 4 of the total number of rainfall events but representing 70 0 of the total rainfall most rainfall events were less than 30mm 69 6 of total events small rainfall events 5mm occurred frequently 30 4 of total events but their contribution to the seasonal rainfall was less than 4 5 although only three heavy rainfall events 50mm were recorded they accounted for 37 8 of the seasonal rainfall the frequency distributions of rainfall intensity were highly positively skewed for both number of rainfall event and rainfall amount fig 4b indicating low intensity rainfall to be much more frequent than high intensity rainfall the average weighted rainfall intensity during each rainfall event varied from 0 4 to 48 1mmh 1 with an average of 11 8mmh 1 there were 16 and 6 rainfall events with intensity 5mmh 1 and between 5 and 30mmh 1 respectively the sum of individual events with intensity 5mmh 1 occupied 30 4 of events and 56 2 of the rainfall amount fig 3 also showed the wind speed fig 3c g and vpd fig 3d h distributions within the 23 rainfall events during our experimental periods the wind speed during each rainfall ranged 0 99 7 42ms 1 with an average of 2 54ms 1 while vpd varied between 0 088kpa and 0 99kpa with an average of 0 26kpa 3 2 rainfall partitioning at during different growth stages of maize a cumulative rainfall of 531mm during the two growing seasons of maize in 2015 and 2016 were recorded where the throughfall accounted for 32 5 to 87 0 of the individual gross rainfall averaging 65 2 during the two growing seasons and the stemflow occupied 0 33 5 of the gross rainfall on average 22 3 table 1 canopy interception loss ranged from 1 7 to 63 4 of the gross rainfall averaging 12 5 during the two growing seasons specifically the relative throughfall decreased initially and then increased as the maize grew while the changes of the relative stemflow and interception loss were opposite with maximum value appearing at the tasseling stage this reflected the strongest influence of maize plants on rainfall partitioning occurred at this stage the relative throughfall declined from 83 2 at the seedling stage to 68 9 at the jointing stage and following to 52 2 at the tasseling stage and then increased to 58 6 at the maturity stage the corresponding relative stemflow values were 13 6 19 5 30 6 and 25 0 during the four stages and the relative interception loss was 3 1 11 7 17 3 and 16 5 during the corresponding periods respectively the relative throughfall stemflow and canopy interception loss reached the maximum or minimum at the tasseling stage which was generally in accordance with previous studies zheng et al 2012 as maize grew leaf area index and canopy coverage increased thereby resulting in large differences in the rainfall partitioning the observed average relative stemflow in the present study was lower but the relative throughfall and interception loss values were higher than those in previous rainfall partitioning studies on maize quinn and laflen 1983 liu et al 2015 ma et al 2016 rainfall intensity in our study average 11 8mmh 1 was generally smaller than that in other studies e g the designed rainfall intensity ranged from 19 8mmh 1 to 79 8mmh 1 in ma et al 2016 from 60mmh 1 to 120mmh 1 in zheng et al 2012 and from 34 8mmh 1 to 90 6mmh 1 in lin et al 2011 under artificial rainfall conditions the lower rainfall intensity made large amount of rainfall intercepted and evaporated during rainfall events and not diverted to stemflow and throughfall norman and campbell 1983 pointed out that atmospheric evaporation plays an indispensible role in influencing the canopy interception loss low intensity rainfall generally lasted for a longer time and increased the canopy interception loss during the rainfall events lamm and manges 2000 measured throughfall and stemflow of fully tasseled maize under sprinkler irrigation conditions they found that throughfall percentage of a 25mm irrigation amount increased from 43 4 at 20cm plant spacing to 50 at the 41cm plant spacing which was also identified by quinn and laflen 1983 due to a decrease in leaf area index by narrowing the plant spacing however the effects of wind speed on rainfall partitioning by maize canopy can be also important han et al 2014 saffigna et al 1976 found that the stemflow rates of maize declined from 46 during a 13mm irrigation to 23 during an 11cm rainfall which was largely attributed to the strong winds this may explain the lower stemflow of 22 3 in our natural rainfall experiments resulting from relatively high wind speed on average 2 54ms 1 compared to higher values in other maize studies e g 35 4 under artificial rainfall without winds zheng et al 2012 and about 50 under sprinkler irrigation with weak winds lamm and manges 2000 3 3 correlations between rainfall partitioning and meteorological variables the amount and proportions of partitioned rainfall components at different growth stages of maize generally had statistically significant correlations with rainfall amount and rainfall intensity but no significant correlations with wind speed and vapor pressure deficit were detected table 2 these results were similar to the finding by zhang et al 2015 who found that meteorological variables such as air temperature relative humidity and wind speed had no significant correlations with rainfall partitioning but rainfall characteristics rainfall amount intensity and duration exerted a dominant effect thus the relations between rainfall partitioning and rainfall amount and intensity were further analyzed 3 4 rainfall partitioning in relation to rainfall characteristics 3 4 1 rainfall partitioning in relation to gross rainfall the throughfall increased with increasing gross rainfall amount and was significantly linearly correlated with gross rainfall during different growth stages of maize r2 0 99 p 0 01 fig 5 a which was in good agreement with the relationships found by other researchers for snowgum dunkerley 2010 natural and planted pine forests ghimire et al 2012 fan et al 2015 one way anova analysis on the slope values of regression lines indicated that there was a significant difference p 0 05 in the regression models of relative throughfall among different growth stages thus the four models could not be replaced by each other the relative throughfall first increased dramatically and then tended to be stable after a threshold value of 20mm following a power function the stemflow was also linearly related to the gross rainfall during different growth stages r2 0 91 p 0 05 indicating that a significant correlation between stemflow and gross rainfall this linear relationship was also established in previous literature on maize stemflow paltineanu and starr 2000 ma et al 2014 liu et al 2015 and was similar to results for soybean ma et al 2014 and forest trees zhang et al 2015 the relative stemflow increased with gross rainfall amount and became nearly constant for larger rainfall events fig 5e following a power function at the seedling stage the interception loss had a weak relation with gross rainfall amount at other growth stages it had positive linear relationships with gross rainfall amount especially during the maturity stage r2 0 95 p 0 01 fig 5c the relative interception loss first sharply decreased with increasing rainfall amount and then tended to be stable after a threshold value of 20mm following a power function fig 5f confirming that the largest interception loss occurs during small rainfall events price and carlyle moses 2003 zhang et al 2015 this may also reflect that a large proportion of rainwater during the initial phase was intercepted or absorbed by maize leaves or stems to wet the canopy and ultimately converted into interception loss resulting in lower values of relative throughfall and stemflow subsequently with increasing rainfall amount maize canopy was gradually saturated and reached its maximum value of canopy interception loss during rainfall resulting in a decrease in the percentage of canopy interception loss to gross rainfall ignoring the amount of intercepted rainfall loss by maize canopies or lumping it with evapotranspiration can lead to large errors in the estimation of the other components of the water budget savenije 2004 3 4 2 rainfall partitioning in relation to rainfall intensity the amount of throughfall stemflow and canopy interception loss generally increased with increasing rainfall intensity the percentages of throughfall and stemflow increased with increasing rainfall intensity fig 6 b e these similar positive relationships were also established by zhang et al 2015 2016 for shrubs on the contrary the relative interception loss showed a decreasing tendency with increasing rainfall intensity fig 6f rainfall intensity not only represents how much water falls within a unit time but it also describes the dynamic energy that falls on the leaf surface thus the rainfall kinetic energy imposed on leaf surface is correspondingly increased with increasing rainfall intensity increasing the possibility of rainfall to pass through canopy gaps and intensifying the sway of plant leaves this forces the interception loss to divert into the throughfall and changes the proportion of canopy adsorption causing the decrease in relative interception loss with increasing rainfall intensity calder 1996 murakami 2006 nanko et al 2011 meanwhile higher intensity rainfall is more effective in saturating canopy and can influence the collection and transfer of rainwater than lower intensity rainfall which helps to the generation of stemflow at the seedling stage the tr sr and ir changed dramatically with the increase in rainfall intensity especially for the highest intensity of 5 39mmh 1 this may be due to that maize plants were soft and weak at this stage which was vulnerable to the influence of rainfall drops as maize grew the ability of anti attack was enhanced so the change trend were slowed down at other growth stages ma et al 2015 the relationships between relative stemflow and rainfall intensity in the literature were quite controversial our results supported the findings of zhang et al 2015 for two xerophytic shrubs however relative stemflow rate decreased with increasing rainfall intensity studied by ma et al 2008 for maize and crockford and richardson 2000 for eucalyptus more research thus needs to be undertaken to better understand the relationship between relative stemflow and rainfall intensity 3 5 rainfall partitioning in relation to leaf area index incident rainfall first reaches the leaf surface then a portion of rainfall is intercepted and evaporated from surface area a portion of rainfall is collected and flows along the leaf to the stem and another portion of rainfall penetrates the leaf gap into the ground surface thus the leaf area is an important factor influencing the rainfall partitioning liu et al 2015 lai were significantly different among the four phenophases table 1 at the seedling stage the ground area vertically shaded by maize canopy was limited and the average leaf area index was only 0 10m2 m 2 with weaker capability of stemflow production and canopy interception loss thus the higher throughfall percentage was largely attributed to the much lower leaf area index at this stage park and cameron 2008 zhang et al 2015 lai gradually increased with leaf budding and expansion increasing to 1 56m2 m 2 during the jointing stage which resulted in a higher relative stemflow and interception loss compared with the seedling stage lai reached the maximum of 4 22m2 m 2 at the tasseling stage when more rainwater was collected and diverted to the stem base or stored in the leaf surface and finally evaporated back to the atmosphere afterwards lai decreased gradually due to the drying of maize leaves leading to a decrease in the efficient interception leaf area therefore the relative throughfall showed an increasing tendency at the end of growing season whereas the relative stemflow and canopy interception loss declined table 1 during the whole growing seasons the average of throughfall stemflow and canopy interception loss accounted for 42 4 11 3 and 46 3 of gross rainfall for rainfall events less than 5mm respectively the low relative throughfall and stemflow but higher interception loss for small rainfall events was mainly due to the fact that the majority of rainfall was partitioned as canopy storage and eventually interception loss price and carlyle moses 2003 nanko et al 2011 fathizadeh et al 2014 to better explore the relationships between the relative throughfall stemflow canopy interception loss and leaf area index regression models were developed using two years data to express the relationship of these three components and leaf area index at different rainfall classes 5mm 5 15mm 15 30mm and 30mm fig 4 it was shown that the relative throughfall was correlated with lai as a power function r2 0 71 the relative throughfall decreased from 83 2 to 52 2 as lai increased from 0 01 to 4 22m2 m 2 for all rainfall events the negative relationship between the relative throughfall and lai for maize has been confirmed in previous studies ma et al 2014 2015 further the negative relationships between relative throughfall and lai has been found for soybean winter wheat ma et al 2014 and forest trees molina and del campo 2012 also positive power correlations were found between the relative stemflow r2 0 60 canopy interception r2 0 74 and lai the study of effects of plants on the water redistribution by ma et al 2014 2015 revealed similar positive relationships rainfall is mainly partitioned by top layer blades rather than by low layer blades liu et al 2015 studied the maize stemflow and its influencing factors who proposed that canopy with lai of 2 0m2 m 2 may be enough for intercepting most rainfall amount and the increase in lai for lai 2 0m2 m 2 by leaves in the low layer had little effect on canopy interception loss and stemflow rate therefore leaf overlapping slowed the increasing tendency of canopy coverage and the change rates of these three portions with increase of lai further study is thus needed on the determination of canopy coverage to better reflect the process of rainfall partitioning fig 7 3 6 multiple regression analysis concerning the interactions of multiple factors the effects of the influencing factors on rainfall partitioning may be better interpreted based on the results of the multiple regressions than of the single regressions zheng et al 2012 ma et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 thus we derived equations using rainfall data collected during the growing season of 2015 using multiple linear nonlinear regression analysis relating rainfall partitioning to rainfall characteristics and lai for a better prediction of petitioned rainfall components table 3 we found that the coefficients of determination of the regression equations were greater than 0 81 for rainfall amount and greater than 0 82 for relative values except for relative stemflow r2 0 61 to test and verify the applicability of the developed models we further compared the simulated rainfall data from regression models and the measured rainfall data for the growing season of 2016 fig 8 showed that the slopes of linear regressions between the predicted and measured rainfall values were close to 1 0 indicating generally satisfactory performance of the developed models however the relatively lower r2 values and higher nrmse between the observed and predicted values for relative stemflow r2 0 48 nrmse 24 37 showed a less prominent agreement between these three variables and sr the prediction of relative stemflow may be improved by precise measurements of actual rainwater collection area of leaf for stemflow such as leaf inclination angle and the ratio of leaf area of drooping leaves account to the total la besides incorporating other meteorological variables such as wind speed and vpd may also improve the prediction accuracy although they were not significantly correlated with the rainfall partitioning in the present study generally the amount of throughfall stemflow and canopy interception loss can be predicted with a relatively high accuracy based on the data of rainfall characteristics and leaf area index r2 0 85 nrmse 10 34 but the proportions of partitioned rainfall components generally had a relatively lower accuracy especially for relative stemflow 3 7 implications for agricultural water management the results confirmed that the interception loss by maize canopy can lead to a significant reduction in total water input to the field rainfall or sprinkler irrigation water which should not be ignored when determining the irrigation schedule by the water balance method prior to planning the irrigation schedule the interception of rainfall or sprinkler irrigation water during the whole growing season of maize is recommended to be estimated using the developed models from rainfall amount intensity and leaf area index based on which the effective rainfall can be obtained and subsequently used to determine the actual water required by maize plants as the difference between the calculated crop water requirement and the effective rainfall moreover similar to natural rainfall sprinkler irrigation water can also be intercepted and partitioned by maize canopy in a sprinkler system the spray losses and interception of water by the plant canopy need to be reduced in order to improve the irrigation efficiency statistical analyses indicated that the water amount sprinkler intensity and leaf area index can be major factors influencing the water partitioning process figs 5 7 thus regulating the irrigation amount and sprinkler intensity above the maize canopy at different growth stages of maize is of high importance for the improvement in sprinkler irrigation efficiency for instance under the same amount of irrigation water a higher sprinkler intensity is preferred especially at the later growth stages of maize when the canopy coverage is large so as to significantly reduce the canopy interception loss and improve the irritation water use efficiency 4 conclusions as presented in this work seasonal gross rainfall was partitioned by maize canopy as follows 65 2 throughfall 22 3 stemflow and 12 5 canopy interception loss as the maize grew the throughfall rate decreased initially and then increased while the changes of stemflow rate and interception rate were opposite throughfall and stemflow depth as well as canopy interception loss increased with gross rainfall and were significantly linearly correlated with gross rainfall amount at different growth stages the rainfall intensity also influenced the redistribution of throughfall stemflow and canopy interception and their proportions the throughfall stemflow and canopy interception all increased with the increase in rainfall intensity the relative throughfall generally increased with increasing rainfall intensity while the relative stemflow and canopy interception decreased with increasing rainfall intensity with gross rainfall rainfall intensity and leaf area index
