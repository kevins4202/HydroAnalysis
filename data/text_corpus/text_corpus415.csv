2075,karst peak cluster depressions are ecologically fragile and slope runoff is a cause of severe soil erosions however the runoff sediment pattern and influencing factors of typical lithologies slope erosion are still unclear this study investigated the soil aggregate stability of limestone and dolomite and their effects on interrill erosion using rainfall tests the dolomite soil aggregates were smooth with fine tightly arranged particles the limestone soil aggregates were rough with regularly shaped flocculent granular bodies soil aggregates of limestone had a higher microporosity than that of dolomite the contents of macroaggregate with a particle size 0 25 mm wsa0 25 were significantly higher in limestone soils than in dolomite soils p 0 05 the mean weight diameter mwd trend was consistent with the wsa0 25 value the mwd value for forest soil of limestone was the highest among all soil types 5 65 mm with the le bissonais lb method the mwd values followed the order of limestone dolomite soils the organic matter ca and mg contents were highly significantly correlated with the aggregate stability p 0 01 during rainfall the trend for soil runoff rates mainly indicated three stages 0 10 min rapidly increasing 10 30 min fluctuating and 30 60 min essentially stable the stable runoff rates of limestone soils were lower than that of dolomite soils at a slope of 10 the soil loss rate of dolomite forest was 0 16 g min m2 higher than that of limestone the sediment concentrations of dolomite soils were higher than those of limestone soils the sediment aggregates were dominated by macroaggregates the content of macroaggregates in dolomite soils ranged from 49 54 to 64 84 at 30 min of runoff and ranged from 51 60 to 69 88 in limestone soils in general limestone soils experienced less erosion than dolomite soils because of the difference in soil aggregate stability the results of this study could provide a theoretical reference for karst rocky desertification management and ecological restoration keywords karst peak cluster depressions limestone dolomite aggregate stability soil erosion data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the karst area of southwest china is the largest area of continuously exposed carbonate rock which exhibits the most notable karst development and hosts the most fragile ecological environment liu et al 2019 yang and zhang 2010 zhou et al 2008 karst areas provide complex habitats nonuniformity in rocks exposed at the surface and diversity in subsurface rock fracture structures li et al 2014 sheng et al 2018 these areas indicate high degrees of heterogeneity in terms of the soil spatial distribution and pose high risks in regard to soil erosion and rocky desertification under rainfall conditions peng and wang 2012 wang et al 2019 the soil erosion process exhibits distinct specificity and complexity dai et al 2017 peak cluster depressions constitute the largest type of karst landform and the most typical rock types include limestone and dolomite wei et al 2023 feng et al 2016 li et al 2020 continuous limestone and dolomite areas account for approximately 47 and 15 respectively of the total carbonate rock types limestone and dolomite desertification was an essential component of karst soil erosion surface lithology as an important environmental factor significantly impacts the soil properties and the aggregate stability hartmann and moosdorf 2013 duan et al 2021 li et al 2013 zhang and horn 2001 during soil formation limestone and dolomite attain different weathering rates the redistribution of soil particles on the surface and in karst spaces and the soil accumulation pattern greatly vary as a result limestone and dolomite significantly differ in terms of the soil aggregate stability which can profoundly affect the rocky desertification degree erosion intensity and vegetation pattern wang et al 2018 tong et al 2018 soil aggregates the basic structural unit of soil comprise the most fundamental unit providing soil resistance to external erosion forces bronick and lal 2005 six et al 2000 wallace et al 2016 soil aggregate fragmentation greatly affects soil surface structural change water transport and erosion processes ma et al 2014 wang et al 2022 zhao and hu 2022 rainfall in peak cluster depressions is intensive and heavy the scattered surface runoff is gradually concentrated by slope topography and scours the surface forming fine gullies and erosion ditches in areas with serious erosion thus providing a basis for slope erosion interrill erosion encompasses a process of soil dispersion and transport driven by the thin layer of water flow generated in the area between fine gullies upon interrill erosion occurrence on the lower parts of slopes assouline and ben hur 2006 kinnell 2005 watson et al 1986 under rainfall conditions raindrop splash erosion and overland runoff abrasion are significant subprocesses of interrill erosion xiao et al 2017 the erosion resistance of topsoil aggregates is a valuable indicator for slope runoff and interrill erosion evaluation the mechanism of surface soil aggregate fragmentation mainly includes the dissipative effect of raindrop strikes mechanical fragmentation under water scouring and uneven swelling during wetting of clay minerals le bissonnais 1996 the aggregate fragmentation degree influences the development of crusts and erosion particle size sorting leguédois and le bissonnais 2004 the erosion mass is smaller on slopes with stable soil aggregates than on slopes with unstable soil aggregates and sediment particles are coarser than those on slopes with unstable soil aggregates xiao et al 2017 wu 2017 most recent studies on soil erosion in karst areas have focused on runoff and soil losses considering a single lithology in karst areas the process of interrill erosion consist of two main aspects slopes with erosion experience rainfall events and soil splash erosion occurs with the increase in rainfall duration soil oversaturation weakens the soil shear strength and runoff carrying sediment transport occurs feng et al 2014 peng and wang 2012 wu et al 2018 runoff soil loss and surface sediment rates are significantly correlated with rainfall factors gutiérrez et al 2014 surface erosion occurs on steep slopes or under moderate rainfall conditions at higher rainfall intensities surface runoff and surface soil loss dominate the total runoff and soil loss respectively dai et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 existing studies have provided little information on the development of the interrill erosion process under different lithological conditions in typical karst areas from the perspective of soil aggregates the analysis of the differences in the stability of soil aggregates in typical karst peak cluster depressions with different lithologies the runoff sediment process and the major influencing factors are important scientific problems that must be solved to guide rocky desertification management thus in this study soils of different lithologies in peak cluster depressions within karst areas were selected as the research objects through the wet sieving method le bissonais lb method and simulated rainfall test the goals of this study were to i assess differences in the soil aggregate stability ii analyze slope runoff sediment characteristics and iii explore sediment particle size distribution characteristics this study can provide a theoretical basis for the study of soil erosion mechanisms

06 1 32 times higher than those of dolomite soils p 0 05 the forest soils of limestone yielded the highest mwdwet values and the most stable soil structure while the cropland soils of dolomite exhibited the lowest mwdwet values the mwdwet values of all the forest soils were significantly higher than those of the cropland soils p 0 05 overall the soil aggregates of limestone were more stable than those of dolomite the soil aggregates of forest were more stable than those of orchard and cropland an appropriate reduction in tillage could increase the soil erosion resistance in karst peak cluster depressions 3 2 2 the main breakdown pattern of soil aggregates in the fw and ws treatments the 2 mm aggregates essentially demonstrated the patterns of forest orchard cropland and limestone dolomite soils figure s7 in the sw treatment the content of the 2 mm soil aggregates in the forest of limestone was significantly higher than that in the forest of dolomite p 0 05 the macroaggregate contents exceeded 90 73 and was the highest among the three treatments with the highest content of 98 67 found in the forest soils of limestone the mwd values indicated the following patterns

mechanical disturbance and they were least damaged by the uneven expansion of clay particles the rsi values ranged from 0 03 0 15 with the highest rsi values observed for the dolomite and limestone cropland soils whereas the lowest rsi value was observed for the dolomite forest soil table 2 3 2 3 soil aggregate stability in relation to the basic properties the mwdwet value of the aggregates

redundancy analysis rda results indicated the aggregate stability was highly significantly correlated with the total ca and total mg contents p 0 002 figure s8 in general the soil porosity water repellency total ca and total mg contents were the key factors influencing the aggregate stability and the organic matter content was the dominant factor affecting the aggregate stability 3 3 runoff process on slopes the runoff rates increased with increasing slope and they rapidly increased from 15 20 fig 3 the stable runoff rate of the limestone forest soils reached 0 23 mm min on the 10 slope increased by 21 74 156 52 and 208 70 on the 15 25 slopes and these increases were significantly greater than those of the dolomite forest soils with increasing rainfall time the trend of the soil runoff rates indicated main three stages 1 0 10 min rapidly increasing 2 10 30 min fluctuating and 3 30 60 min essentially stable the runoff rate reached a stable state in the dolomite soils faster than that in the limestone soils the initial and stable runoff rates of the limestone and dolomite soils significantly differed following the pattern of dolomite limestone soils the initial runoff rates of the dolomite soils ranged from 0 19 to 0 60 mm min while those of the limestone soils ranged from 0 10 to 0 51 mm min under a slopes of 15 20 the stable runoff rates of dolomite forest soils were 1 14 1 3 times higher than that of limestone forest soils p 0 05 under a slope of 25 the stable runoff rates were maximized ranging from 0 71 0 90 mm min which were slightly higher than that under a slope of 20 the runoff rates differed for different land use soils following the pattern of forest orchard cropland soils the highest stable runoff rate was observed for the dolomite cropland soil 0 62 mm min under the 10 slope which was 2 06 times higher than that of the forest soil the stable runoff rate of the limestone cropland soil reached 0 59 mm min which was 2 52 times higher than that of the limestone forest soil 3 4 soil loss process on slopes 3 4 1 soil loss process the soil loss exhibited a trend of first decreasing and then stabilizing in the rainfall process figure s9 the initial soil loss rate of the dolomite soils was higher than that of the limestone soils and the stable soil loss rate was slightly higher than that of the limestone soils when the slope was changed from 10 to 15 the initial soil loss rates of the dolomite soils increased by 23 40 to 49 50 however when the slope was changed from 15 to 20 the initial soil loss rates of the limestone soils increased by 44 37 to 100 the slope of limestone was more stable than that of dolomite under a slopes of 10 15 the initial soil loss rates of cropland soils were significantly higher than those of forest soils p 0 05 with increasing rainfall time the sediment concentration indicated three main stages fig 4 1 0 5 min rapidly decreasing 2 6 30 min slowly decreasing and 3 30 60 min essentially stable in the first stage the sediment concentrations decline in dolomite forest orchard and cropland soils ranged from 73 02 86 91 71 96 83 96 and 65 24 76 44 respectively the sediment concentrations decline in limestone forest orchard and cropland soils ranged from 70 11 86 09 55 24 85 45 and 68 33 83 07 respectively in general the initial sediment concentration mostly agreed with the pattern of dolomite limestone soils the sediment concentration of the forest soils was lower than that of the orchard and cropland soils 3 4 2 sediment particle composition the distribution of each particle size range was relatively uniform fig 5 at the initial stage of rainfall the microaggregate contents gradually increased the sediment aggregates were dominated by macroaggregates the contents of macroaggregates in dolomite soil ranged from 49 54 to 64 84 at 30 min of runoff while the contents ranged from 51 60 to 69 88 in limestone soil influenced by the slope and rainfall time the sediment particle size composition exhibited fluctuating changes which could be divided into three general types 1 the macroaggregates revealed a distinct bimodal trend with the runoff time under a slope of 10 the macroaggregate contents mostly peaked from 0 4 min and 18 24 min after runoff production 2 the number of macroaggregates decreased at a uniform rate under slopes ranging from 15 25 the macroaggregate contents in the limestone forest soils decreased by 29 56 17 09 and 27 24 respectively 3 the macroaggregates were essentially in a stable state most of the changes in the large aggregates occurred under a slope of 25 the macroaggregate contents were higher in the forest soils than in the orchard and cropland soils under slopes of 20 and 25 most of the sediment mwd values first showed a trend of decreasing or decreasing after fluctuating with increasing time and reached stability after 35 45 min of runoff production fig 6 most mwd values of limestone sediment were higher than those of dolomite sediment in the stable state at a slope of 10 the mwd values of limestone sediment reached a stable state earlier than those of dolomite sediment at a slope of 15 the limestone forest had the highest initial mwd value of 0 87 mm the limestone soil declined significantly and the dolomite forest soil was in a stable state the mwd values of forest sediment were higher than those of orchard and cropland sediments 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of the difference in aggregate stability between limestone soils and dolomite soils both the wet sieving and the lb methods demonstrated that the soil aggregates of limestone were more stable than those of the dolomite under the different fragmentation mechanisms table 2 this result is consistent with the findings of xu and long 2005 regarding the differences in geomechanical properties in sloping land with different lithological development in karst areas this result can be attributed to the difference in lithological development levels between limestone and dolomite resulting in distinct soil properties the soil porosity water repellency organic matter content total ca and total mg contents were the key influencing factors of aggregate stability fig 2 and the results were consistent with those of several other studies li et al 2010 lin et al 2020 wang et al 2022 tong et al 2018 li et al 2021 the main component of limestone is caco3 while the main component of dolomite is camg co3 2 limestone and dolomite microaggregates comprise fine grained material bound by organic matter and cementing substances such as ca mg fe and al microaggregates can be further combined to form macroaggregates limestone soil aggregates contained more cementing material than dolomite soil aggregates figure s3 the physicochemical properties of the limestone derived soils were more favorable than those of the dolomite derived soils in terms of the bulk density total porosity capillary porosity saturated water content and organic matter content figure s1 soil repellency significantly affected aggregate stability when water is repelled from the surface soil this process greatly hinders water infiltration ritsema et al 1994 classified soils into five classes according to water repulsion soils in the study area are nonrepellent wdpt 5 s to slightly repellent 5 60 s soils and provided a low resistance to water infiltration it has been reported that repelled water significantly affects the stability of soil aggregates which further influences the spattering process of soil under rainfall conditions feng et al 2022 doerr et al 2000 ferreira et al 2005 in general appropriately increasing forest areas and reducing tillage can make the soil form a good pore structure increase the accumulation of cementing materials and stabilize the slopes 4 2 influence of the soil aggregate stability on the runoff production process on slope surfaces stable soils require a longer time for runoff to start and a lower runoff rate than unstable soils under a rainfall intensity of 30 mm h only subsurface runoff was produced during the first 30 min whereas surface runoff did not occur wang et al 2021 when the rainfall intensity increased to 50 mm h the precipitation rate exceeded the infiltration rate and surface runoff was initiated in this study a 60 mm h rainfall intensity was used therefore most of the runoff production times were shorter than 30 min the production runoff trend was similar to that observed by wu et al 2017 the hydrological processes were consistent with those observed by wang et al 2021 in terms of the runoff production patterns on slopes in karst stony desertification areas compared to those of other soil types e g red loam the stable runoff production times were longer in this study which might have occurred because the karst soils remained more stable achieved lower water losses under rainfall conditions and more quickly reached a stable state ma 2015 soil slope hydrological processes depend mainly on the interaction between the lithology and slope and the structural conditions of the topsoil such as the aggregate stability crust state porosity and water repellency wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 the main fragmentation mechanism of soil aggregates involves the dissipative effect of initial rainfall li et al 2022 chen et al 2022 different wetting rates particle sizes and prewetting conditions could affect the aggregate stability and runoff and soil loss process on slopes zhao et al 2022 the preconditions of this experiment essentially remained the same and the main factor influencing the erosion process on karst soil slopes was the aggregate stability air dried aggregates can be fragmented by dissipative action as the main fragmentation mechanism at the beginning of rainfall yang et al 2012 xiao et al 2018 after rainfall initiation the prewetted aggregates were rapidly broken due to the dissipative effect of fast wetting the broken and decomposed fine aggregates were gradually transported downward and the topsoil structure became increasingly compact with increasing rainfall time the aggregate degradation mechanism gradually changed from fragmentation due to dissipative action to mechanical fragmentation compared to those of the limestone soils the dolomite soils attained smaller mwd values and higher rsi and rmi values table 2 the dolomite soil aggregates were more susceptible to the dissipative effects of fast wetting and mechanical fragmentation due to raindrop impact the limestone soils had higher infiltration capacities because more pores occurred in the limestone topsoil layer therefore the times before runoff initiation were longer for the limestone soils than for the dolomite soils runoff began to occur when the topsoil precipitation rate exceeded the subsoil infiltration rate weakly stable soils e g the dolomite cropland soils were compacted under the impact of raindrops yan et al 2018 surface crusts were gradually formed which led to a decrease in the soil infiltration rate and a gradual increase in the runoff intensity zhu et al 2022 shi et al 2012 yang et al 2012 since the organic matter content in the limestone soils was higher than that in the dolomite soils and the limestone soils contained abundant fe al oxides which is not conducive to the formation of soil crusts the soil infiltration rate of the limestone soils was higher than that of the dolomite soils regarding soils with low aggregate stability it is necessary to inhibit soil crust formation and intercept runoff by adding vegetation or mulch which can reduce runoff generation han et al 2021 4 3 influence of soil aggregate stability on the soil loss processes on slope surfaces the limestone soil aggregates were more resistant to raindrop impact and to runoff scouring than the dolomite soils and were less prone to crust formation and denudation resulting in lower soil loss rates and sediment concentrations greater soil mwdfw and wsa0 25 values could reduce the soil loss rate and sediment concentration at the beginning of the rainfall events the runoff sediment transport capacity was the highest under the effects of dissipation and runoff scouring however with increasing runoff intensity the primary factor became the denudation capacity of the aggregates wang et al 2022 at the early stages of runoff production the aggregates were mostly rapidly rolled and became increasingly rounded from their original irregular shapes due to their large mass and shape and they continuously released fine materials wang et al 2022 wang et al 2012 at the middle and late runoff stages the contact time between the rounded soil aggregates and the slope surface decreased and the aggregates were transported by leaping and suspension type movements the loose surface layer protected the soil aggregates underneath from denudation by raindrops and runoff kinnell 2005 2012 the decreases in the sediment concentration and soil loss rate were mainly due to the increase in the shear strength of the topsoil due to the formation of surface crusts and the decrease in erodible material chaplot and le bissonnais 2003 lado and ben hur 2003 aggregate fragmentation tended to occur at the early stages of the rainfall events fig 5 the distribution characteristics within the various sediment particle size ranges especially bimodal distribution features were caused by two mechanisms the movement of coarse particles and the suspension leaping of fine particles chaplot and le bissonnais 2003 wei et al 2009 wang et al 2022 during erosion differences in the transport rate between particles of the different particle classes also affected the dynamics of the sediment particle size composition usually the transport rate of suspended fine particles matches the runoff rate because fine particles are easily and rapidly transported with runoff in contrast coarse particles which are mainly transported by leaping and rolling are relatively difficult to transport and the corresponding transport rates are low wang et al 2022 therefore at the early stages of runoff production the sediment particle size composition mainly comprised fine particles as rainfall continued the content of coarse particles gradually increased in addition the smaller the sediment particle size is and the lower the soil particle density is the farther the particles can migrate with runoff asadi et al 2007 kinnell 2012 the observed change in the soil loss rate was consistent with the conclusions obtained by ma 2015 however wang et al 2021 demonstrated that surface soil loss increased with the rainfall time exhibiting a trend of first increasing then decreasing and finally stabilizing this result might be due to the setting of different subsurface porosities set by wang et al 2021 and the rainfall intensity in their study was higher than that in this study the sediment particles produced by the dissipation effect at the early rainfall stages were mostly subsurface sand particles the sediment aggregate particle size distribution exhibited three trends a bimodal trend a uniformly decreasing trend and an essentially stable trend fig 5 these results were consistent with the findings of wu et al 2017 and ma 2015 regarding the interrill erosion processes of zonal soils and red soil aggregates in the runoff stable state the sediment was mainly composed of macroaggregates the soil loss conclusions for other soil types differed from this study peng et al 2022 because the limestone and dolomite soil aggregates contained more organic matter and total ca contents the mwd values in this study were greater than those of other soil types in regard to the runoff sediment transport capacity and soil denudation rate lower values are key to lower soil erosion rates wischmeier 1969 slope runoff sediment processes under rainfall conditions were investigated in this study interrill erosion includes two main parts raindrop splash erosion and overland runoff abrasion in future studies the interrill erosion processes of karst soils controlled by detachment limited or transport limited can be further distinguished wu et al 2020 5 conclusion the limestone soil aggregates were more stable than the dolomite soil aggregates under the same land use the soil aggregates were significantly broken under rainfall conditions due to the air pressure the om ca and mg contents of soil were significant factors influencing the aggregate stability under rainfall conditions the initial and stable runoff rates showed patterns of limestone dolomite and forest orchard cropland soils and the runoff rates increased with increasing slope gradient the soil runoff rates indicated three main stages 0 10 min rapidly increasing 10 30 min fluctuating and 30 60 min essentially stable the initial soil loss rates of the dolomite were higher than those of the limestone soil the sediment concentration exhibited a trend of first decreasing and then being stable during in the rainfall process the sediment mwd values of limestone were higher than those of dolomite in the stable state the stability of soil aggregates was an important factor determining runoff sediment progress credit authorship contribution statement jinyue wang conceptualization methodology investigation

2075,karst peak cluster depressions are ecologically fragile and slope runoff is a cause of severe soil erosions however the runoff sediment pattern and influencing factors of typical lithologies slope erosion are still unclear this study investigated the soil aggregate stability of limestone and dolomite and their effects on interrill erosion using rainfall tests the dolomite soil aggregates were smooth with fine tightly arranged particles the limestone soil aggregates were rough with regularly shaped flocculent granular bodies soil aggregates of limestone had a higher microporosity than that of dolomite the contents of macroaggregate with a particle size 0 25 mm wsa0 25 were significantly higher in limestone soils than in dolomite soils p 0 05 the mean weight diameter mwd trend was consistent with the wsa0 25 value the mwd value for forest soil of limestone was the highest among all soil types 5 65 mm with the le bissonais lb method the mwd values followed the order of limestone dolomite soils the organic matter ca and mg contents were highly significantly correlated with the aggregate stability p 0 01 during rainfall the trend for soil runoff rates mainly indicated three stages 0 10 min rapidly increasing 10 30 min fluctuating and 30 60 min essentially stable the stable runoff rates of limestone soils were lower than that of dolomite soils at a slope of 10 the soil loss rate of dolomite forest was 0 16 g min m2 higher than that of limestone the sediment concentrations of dolomite soils were higher than those of limestone soils the sediment aggregates were dominated by macroaggregates the content of macroaggregates in dolomite soils ranged from 49 54 to 64 84 at 30 min of runoff and ranged from 51 60 to 69 88 in limestone soils in general limestone soils experienced less erosion than dolomite soils because of the difference in soil aggregate stability the results of this study could provide a theoretical reference for karst rocky desertification management and ecological restoration keywords karst peak cluster depressions limestone dolomite aggregate stability soil erosion data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the karst area of southwest china is the largest area of continuously exposed carbonate rock which exhibits the most notable karst development and hosts the most fragile ecological environment liu et al 2019 yang and zhang 2010 zhou et al 2008 karst areas provide complex habitats nonuniformity in rocks exposed at the surface and diversity in subsurface rock fracture structures li et al 2014 sheng et al 2018 these areas indicate high degrees of heterogeneity in terms of the soil spatial distribution and pose high risks in regard to soil erosion and rocky desertification under rainfall conditions peng and wang 2012 wang et al 2019 the soil erosion process exhibits distinct specificity and complexity dai et al 2017 peak cluster depressions constitute the largest type of karst landform and the most typical rock types include limestone and dolomite wei et al 2023 feng et al 2016 li et al 2020 continuous limestone and dolomite areas account for approximately 47 and 15 respectively of the total carbonate rock types limestone and dolomite desertification was an essential component of karst soil erosion surface lithology as an important environmental factor significantly impacts the soil properties and the aggregate stability hartmann and moosdorf 2013 duan et al 2021 li et al 2013 zhang and horn 2001 during soil formation limestone and dolomite attain different weathering rates the redistribution of soil particles on the surface and in karst spaces and the soil accumulation pattern greatly vary as a result limestone and dolomite significantly differ in terms of the soil aggregate stability which can profoundly affect the rocky desertification degree erosion intensity and vegetation pattern wang et al 2018 tong et al 2018 soil aggregates the basic structural unit of soil comprise the most fundamental unit providing soil resistance to external erosion forces bronick and lal 2005 six et al 2000 wallace et al 2016 soil aggregate fragmentation greatly affects soil surface structural change water transport and erosion processes ma et al 2014 wang et al 2022 zhao and hu 2022 rainfall in peak cluster depressions is intensive and heavy the scattered surface runoff is gradually concentrated by slope topography and scours the surface forming fine gullies and erosion ditches in areas with serious erosion thus providing a basis for slope erosion interrill erosion encompasses a process of soil dispersion and transport driven by the thin layer of water flow generated in the area between fine gullies upon interrill erosion occurrence on the lower parts of slopes assouline and ben hur 2006 kinnell 2005 watson et al 1986 under rainfall conditions raindrop splash erosion and overland runoff abrasion are significant subprocesses of interrill erosion xiao et al 2017 the erosion resistance of topsoil aggregates is a valuable indicator for slope runoff and interrill erosion evaluation the mechanism of surface soil aggregate fragmentation mainly includes the dissipative effect of raindrop strikes mechanical fragmentation under water scouring and uneven swelling during wetting of clay minerals le bissonnais 1996 the aggregate fragmentation degree influences the development of crusts and erosion particle size sorting leguédois and le bissonnais 2004 the erosion mass is smaller on slopes with stable soil aggregates than on slopes with unstable soil aggregates and sediment particles are coarser than those on slopes with unstable soil aggregates xiao et al 2017 wu 2017 most recent studies on soil erosion in karst areas have focused on runoff and soil losses considering a single lithology in karst areas the process of interrill erosion consist of two main aspects slopes with erosion experience rainfall events and soil splash erosion occurs with the increase in rainfall duration soil oversaturation weakens the soil shear strength and runoff carrying sediment transport occurs feng et al 2014 peng and wang 2012 wu et al 2018 runoff soil loss and surface sediment rates are significantly correlated with rainfall factors gutiérrez et al 2014 surface erosion occurs on steep slopes or under moderate rainfall conditions at higher rainfall intensities surface runoff and surface soil loss dominate the total runoff and soil loss respectively dai et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 existing studies have provided little information on the development of the interrill erosion process under different lithological conditions in typical karst areas from the perspective of soil aggregates the analysis of the differences in the stability of soil aggregates in typical karst peak cluster depressions with different lithologies the runoff sediment process and the major influencing factors are important scientific problems that must be solved to guide rocky desertification management thus in this study soils of different lithologies in peak cluster depressions within karst areas were selected as the research objects through the wet sieving method le bissonais lb method and simulated rainfall test the goals of this study were to i assess differences in the soil aggregate stability ii analyze slope runoff sediment characteristics and iii explore sediment particle size distribution characteristics this study can provide a theoretical basis for the study of soil erosion mechanisms

dolomite soils the trend in the mwdwet values was the same as that in the wsa0 25 values ranging from 3 66 to 5 65 mm figure s6 except for the orchard soils the mwdwet values of limestone soils were 1 06 1 32 times higher than those of dolomite soils p 0 05 the forest soils of limestone yielded the highest mwdwet values and the most stable soil structure while the cropland soils of dolomite exhibited the lowest mwdwet values the mwdwet values of all the forest soils were significantly higher than those of the cropland soils p 0 05 overall the soil aggregates of limestone were more stable than those of dolomite the soil aggregates of forest were more stable than those of orchard and cropland an appropriate reduction in tillage could increase the soil erosion resistance in karst peak cluster depressions 3 2 2 the main breakdown pattern of soil aggregates in the fw and ws treatments the 2 mm aggregates essentially demonstrated the patterns of forest orchard cropland and limestone dolomite soils figure s7 in the sw treatment the content of the 2 mm soil aggregates in the forest of limestone was significantly higher than that in the forest of dolomite p 0 05 the macroaggregate

repellency total ca and total mg contents were the key factors influencing the aggregate stability and the organic matter content was the dominant factor affecting the aggregate stability 3 3 runoff process on slopes the runoff rates increased with increasing slope and they rapidly increased from 15 20 fig 3 the stable runoff rate of the limestone forest soils reached 0 23 mm min on the 10 slope increased by 21 74 156 52 and 208 70 on the 15 25 slopes and these increases were significantly greater than those of the dolomite forest soils with increasing rainfall time the trend of the soil runoff rates indicated main three stages 1 0 10 min rapidly increasing 2 10 30 min fluctuating and 3 30 60 min essentially stable the runoff rate reached a stable state in the dolomite soils faster than that in the limestone soils the initial and stable runoff rates of the limestone and dolomite soils significantly differed following the pattern of dolomite limestone soils the initial runoff rates of the dolomite soils ranged from 0 19 to 0 60 mm min while those of the limestone soils ranged from 0 10 to 0 51 mm min under a slopes of 15 20 the stable runoff rates of dolomite forest soils were 1 14 1 3 times higher than that of limestone forest soils p 0 05 under a slope of 25 the stable runoff rates were maximized ranging from 0 71 0 90 mm min which were slightly higher than that under a slope of 20 the runoff rates differed for different land use soils following the pattern of forest orchard cropland soils the highest stable runoff rate was observed for the dolomite cropland soil 0 62 mm min under the 10 slope which was 2 06 times higher than that of the forest soil the stable runoff rate of the limestone cropland soil reached 0 59 mm min which was 2 52 times higher than that of the limestone forest soil 3 4 soil loss process on slopes 3 4 1 soil loss process the soil loss exhibited a trend of first decreasing and then stabilizing in the rainfall process figure s9 the initial soil loss rate of the dolomite soils was higher than that of the limestone soils and the stable soil loss rate was slightly higher than that of the limestone soils when the slope was changed from 10 to 15 the initial soil loss rates of the dolomite soils increased by 23 40 to 49 50 however when the slope was changed from 15 to 20 the initial soil loss rates of the limestone soils increased by 44 37 to 100 the slope of limestone was more stable than that of dolomite under a slopes of 10 15 the initial soil loss rates of cropland soils were significantly higher than those of forest soils p 0 05 with increasing rainfall time the sediment concentration indicated three main stages fig 4 1 0 5 min rapidly decreasing 2 6 30 min slowly decreasing and 3 30 60 min essentially stable in the first stage the sediment concentrations decline in dolomite forest orchard and cropland soils ranged from 73 02 86 91 71 96 83 96 and 65 24 76 44 respectively the sediment concentrations decline in limestone forest orchard and cropland soils ranged from 70 11 86 09 55 24 85 45 and 68 33 83 07 respectively in general the initial sediment concentration mostly agreed with the pattern of dolomite limestone soils the sediment concentration of the forest soils was lower than that of the orchard and cropland soils 3 4 2 sediment particle composition the distribution of each particle size range was relatively uniform fig 5 at the initial stage of rainfall the microaggregate contents gradually increased the sediment aggregates were dominated by macroaggregates the contents of macroaggregates in dolomite soil ranged from 49 54 to 64 84 at 30 min of runoff while the contents ranged from 51 60 to 69 88 in limestone soil influenced by the slope and rainfall time the sediment particle size composition exhibited fluctuating changes which could be divided into three general types 1 the macroaggregates revealed a distinct bimodal trend with the runoff time under a slope of 10 the macroaggregate contents mostly peaked from 0 4 min and 18 24 min after runoff production 2 the number of macroaggregates decreased at a uniform rate under slopes ranging from 15 25 the macroaggregate contents in the limestone forest soils decreased by 29 56 17 09 and 27 24 respectively 3 the macroaggregates were essentially in a stable state most of the changes in the large aggregates occurred under a slope of 25 the macroaggregate contents were higher in the forest soils than in the orchard and cropland soils under slopes of 20 and 25 most of the sediment mwd values first showed a trend of decreasing or decreasing after fluctuating with increasing time and reached stability after 35 45 min of runoff production fig 6 most mwd values of limestone sediment were higher than those of dolomite sediment in the stable state at a slope of 10 the mwd values of limestone sediment reached a stable state earlier than those of dolomite sediment at a slope of 15 the limestone forest had the highest initial mwd value of 0 87 mm the limestone soil declined significantly and the dolomite forest soil was in a stable state the mwd values of forest sediment were higher than those of orchard and cropland sediments 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of the difference in aggregate stability between limestone soils and dolomite soils both the wet sieving and the lb methods demonstrated that the soil aggregates of limestone were more stable than those of the dolomite under the different fragmentation mechanisms table 2 this result is consistent with the findings of xu and long 2005 regarding the differences in geomechanical properties in sloping land with different lithological development in karst areas this result can be attributed to the difference in lithological development levels between limestone and dolomite resulting in distinct soil properties the soil porosity water repellency organic matter content total ca and total mg contents were the key influencing factors of aggregate stability fig 2 and the results were consistent with those of several other studies li et al 2010 lin et al 2020 wang et al 2022 tong et al 2018 li et al 2021 the main component of limestone is caco3 while the main component of dolomite is camg co3 2 limestone and dolomite microaggregates comprise fine grained material bound by organic matter and cementing substances such as ca mg fe and al microaggregates can be further combined to form macroaggregates limestone soil aggregates contained more cementing material than dolomite soil aggregates figure s3 the physicochemical properties of the limestone derived soils were more favorable than those of the dolomite derived soils in terms of the bulk density total porosity capillary porosity saturated water content and organic matter content figure s1 soil repellency significantly affected aggregate stability when water is repelled from the surface soil this process greatly hinders water infiltration ritsema et al 1994 classified soils into five classes according to water repulsion soils in the study area are nonrepellent wdpt 5 s to slightly repellent 5 60 s soils and provided a low resistance to water infiltration it has been reported that repelled water significantly affects the stability of soil aggregates which further influences the spattering process of soil under rainfall conditions feng et al 2022 doerr et al 2000 ferreira et al 2005 in general appropriately increasing forest areas and reducing tillage can make the soil form a good pore structure increase the accumulation of cementing materials and stabilize the slopes 4 2 influence of the soil aggregate stability on the runoff production process on slope surfaces stable soils require a longer time for runoff to start and a lower runoff rate than unstable soils under a rainfall intensity of 30 mm h only subsurface runoff was produced during the first 30 min whereas surface runoff did not occur wang et al 2021 when the rainfall intensity increased to 50 mm h the precipitation rate exceeded the infiltration rate and surface runoff was initiated in this study a 60 mm h rainfall intensity was used therefore most of the runoff production times were shorter than 30 min the production runoff trend was similar to that observed by wu et al 2017 the hydrological processes were consistent with those observed by wang et al 2021 in terms of the runoff production patterns on slopes in karst stony desertification areas compared to those of other soil types e g red loam the stable runoff production times were longer in this study which might have occurred because the karst soils remained more stable achieved lower water losses under rainfall conditions and more quickly reached a stable state ma 2015 soil slope hydrological processes depend mainly on the interaction between the lithology and slope and the structural conditions of the topsoil such as the aggregate stability crust state porosity and water repellency wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 the main fragmentation mechanism of soil aggregates involves the dissipative effect of initial rainfall li et al 2022 chen et al 2022 different wetting rates particle sizes and prewetting conditions could affect the aggregate stability and runoff and soil loss process on slopes zhao et al 2022 the preconditions of this experiment essentially remained the same and the main factor influencing the erosion process on karst soil slopes was the aggregate stability air dried aggregates can be fragmented by dissipative action as the main fragmentation mechanism at the beginning of rainfall yang et al 2012 xiao et al 2018 after rainfall initiation the prewetted aggregates were rapidly broken due to the dissipative effect of fast wetting the broken and decomposed fine aggregates were gradually transported downward and the topsoil structure became increasingly compact with increasing rainfall time the aggregate degradation mechanism gradually changed from fragmentation due to dissipative action to mechanical fragmentation compared to those of the limestone soils the dolomite soils attained smaller mwd values and higher rsi and rmi values table 2 the dolomite soil aggregates were more susceptible to the dissipative effects of fast wetting and mechanical fragmentation due to raindrop impact the limestone soils had higher infiltration capacities because more pores occurred in the limestone topsoil layer therefore the times before runoff initiation were longer for the limestone soils than for the dolomite soils runoff began to occur when the topsoil precipitation rate exceeded the subsoil infiltration rate weakly stable soils e g the dolomite cropland soils were compacted under the impact of raindrops yan et al 2018 surface crusts were gradually formed which led to a decrease in the soil infiltration rate and a gradual increase in the runoff intensity zhu et al 2022 shi et al 2012 yang et al 2012 since the organic matter content in the limestone soils was higher than that in the dolomite soils and the limestone soils contained abundant fe al oxides which is not conducive to the formation of soil crusts the soil infiltration rate of the limestone soils was higher than that of the dolomite soils regarding soils with low aggregate stability it is necessary to inhibit soil crust formation and intercept runoff by adding vegetation or mulch which can reduce runoff generation han et al 2021 4 3 influence of soil aggregate stability on the soil loss processes on slope surfaces the limestone soil aggregates were more resistant to raindrop impact and to runoff scouring than the dolomite soils and were less prone to crust formation and denudation resulting in lower soil loss rates and sediment concentrations greater soil mwdfw and wsa0 25 values could reduce the soil loss rate and sediment concentration at the beginning of the rainfall events the runoff sediment transport capacity was the highest under the effects of dissipation and runoff scouring however with increasing runoff intensity the primary factor became the denudation capacity of the aggregates wang et al 2022 at the early stages of runoff production the aggregates were mostly rapidly rolled and became increasingly rounded from their original irregular shapes due to their large mass and shape and they continuously released fine materials wang et al 2022 wang et al 2012 at the middle and late runoff stages the contact time between the rounded soil aggregates and the slope surface decreased and the aggregates were transported by leaping and suspension type movements the loose surface layer protected the soil aggregates underneath from denudation by raindrops and runoff kinnell 2005 2012 the decreases in the sediment concentration and soil loss rate were mainly due to the increase in the shear strength of the topsoil due to the formation of surface crusts and the decrease in erodible material chaplot and le bissonnais 2003 lado and ben hur 2003 aggregate fragmentation tended to occur at the early stages of the rainfall events fig 5 the distribution characteristics within the various sediment particle size ranges especially bimodal distribution features were caused by two mechanisms the movement of coarse particles and the suspension leaping of fine particles chaplot and le bissonnais 2003 wei et al 2009 wang et al 2022 during erosion differences in the transport rate between particles of the different particle classes also affected the dynamics of the sediment particle size composition usually the transport rate of suspended fine particles matches the runoff rate because fine particles are easily and rapidly transported with runoff in contrast coarse particles which are mainly transported by leaping and rolling are relatively difficult to transport and the corresponding transport rates are low wang et al 2022 therefore at the early stages of runoff production the sediment particle size composition mainly comprised fine particles as rainfall continued the content of coarse particles gradually increased in addition the smaller the sediment particle size is and the lower the soil particle density is the farther the particles can migrate with runoff asadi et al 2007 kinnell 2012 the observed change in the soil loss rate was consistent with the conclusions obtained by ma 2015 however wang et al 2021 demonstrated that surface soil loss increased with the rainfall time exhibiting a trend of first increasing then decreasing and finally stabilizing this result might be due to the setting of different subsurface porosities set by wang et al 2021 and the rainfall intensity in their study was higher than that in this study the sediment particles produced by the dissipation effect at the early rainfall stages were mostly subsurface sand particles the sediment aggregate particle size distribution exhibited three trends a bimodal trend a uniformly decreasing trend and an essentially stable trend fig 5 these results were consistent with the findings of wu et al 2017 and ma 2015 regarding the interrill erosion processes of zonal soils and red soil aggregates in the runoff stable state the sediment was mainly composed of macroaggregates the soil loss conclusions for other soil types differed from this study peng et al 2022 because the limestone and dolomite soil aggregates contained more organic matter and total ca contents the mwd values in this study were greater than those of other soil types in regard to the runoff sediment transport capacity and soil denudation rate lower values are key to lower soil erosion rates wischmeier 1969 slope runoff sediment processes under rainfall conditions were investigated in this study interrill erosion includes two main parts raindrop splash erosion and overland runoff abrasion in future studies the interrill erosion processes of karst soils controlled by detachment limited or transport limited can be further distinguished wu et al 2020 5 conclusion the limestone soil aggregates were more stable than the dolomite soil aggregates under the same land use the soil aggregates were significantly broken under rainfall conditions due to the air pressure the om ca and mg contents of soil were significant factors influencing the aggregate stability under rainfall conditions the initial and stable runoff rates showed patterns of limestone dolomite and forest orchard cropland soils and the runoff rates increased with increasing slope gradient the soil runoff rates indicated three main stages 0 10 min rapidly increasing 10 30 min fluctuating and 30 60 min essentially stable the initial soil loss rates of the dolomite were higher than those of the limestone soil the sediment concentration exhibited a trend of first decreasing and then being stable during in the rainfall process the sediment mwd values of limestone were higher than those of dolomite in the stable state the stability of soil aggregates was an important factor determining runoff sediment progress credit authorship contribution statement jinyue wang conceptualization methodology investigation

2076,this study is geared towards evaluating the hydrological information that can be extracted from spring water temperature variations in shallow and thin aquifers of headwater catchments a series of temperature variations from 2013 to 2017 in four spring water sources at the strengbach critical zone observatory czo was analyzed and interpreted by relying upon a coupled two dimensional unsaturated saturated flow and heat transfer model specifically designed for the study temperature variations of spring waters at the strengbach catchment obey a seasonal non phased and attenuated cyclicity compared with temperature inputs from the air or very shallow waters in soils simulation results show that within the shallow subsurface horizons heat transfer is mainly controlled by thermal conduction and not by fluid flow the results also emphasize that the depth and temperature value of the thermal invariance zone are key parameters to surface temperature attenuation patterns in the first meters beneath the surface the average maximum porosity or saturated water content is another important parameter impacting heat transfers in the shallow subsurface stronger attenuations and delays of the thermal signal occur as the porosity increases these different results indicate that temperature variations in the spring waters especially the attenuation and phase shift of the signals compared with incoming air surface water temperatures do not bring information on hydrological transfers in very shallow systems characteristics such as flow velocities and water residence times cannot be inferred from temperature variations nevertheless this study suggests that spring water temperature variations could become a way of identifying the usually poorly known saturated water content and its spatial variability at the catchment scale data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface water temperature is often considered as a proxy for climate change and or anthropogenic activities such as forest management or flow alteration at the scale of a water catchment caissie 2006 applied to hydrology temperature variation measurements are used as tracers to characterize flow in the hyporheic zones soils or groundwater even if its applicability requires estimates of heat fluxes exchanged between the porous material and water engelhardt et al 2011 one of the most efficient applications is the understanding and quantification of water exchanges between rivers and groundwater kalbus et al 2006 anibas et al 2011 irvine et al 2017 rivière et al 2020 shanafield et al 2011 for groundwater temperature measurements in boreholes are used to estimate water velocity drury 1984 more recently and as a consequence of the improvements in measurement techniques such as fiber optics shanafield et al 2018 temperature measurements have been used to estimate groundwater velocity in soils tabbagh et al 2017 or in association with other geophysical exploration techniques to describe the geometry and or the connectivity of aquifers chatelier et al 2011 folch 2020 temperature variations in springs have been investigated mainly in karst formations and deep aquifer systems these studies have been carried out to determine the surface of drainage areas lismonde 2010 examine the influence of the heat exchange mechanisms covington et al 2011 or identify the flow patterns and geometrical properties of the aquifer birk et al 2006 tamburini and menichetti 2019 research on heat transfer in shallow alluvial aquifers is less developed whether via modeling heat transfer in synthetic test cases bundschuh 1993 or temperature measurements analysis szczucińska and wasielewski 2013 zajíček et al 2011 these studies try to derive qualitative information on water flow in the subsurface especially in determining the origin of water feeding springs or water travel times the purpose of this work is to evaluate the hydrogeological information that can be extracted from spring temperature variations in a small catchment here the strengbach catchment located in eastern france and part of the french critical zone observatories network ozcar https www ozcar ri org for this purpose we have developed a coupled two dimensional unsaturated flow and heat transfer model simulating the seasonal temperature variability of four springs outcropping at the strengbach catchment 2 the strengbach water catchment the strengbach catchment is a small granitic entity located in the vosges mountains france referred to as the strengbach critical zone observatory czo also named observatoire hydrogéochimique de l environnement ohge https ohge unistra fr the catchment is one of the elementary sites of the french critical zone observatories network ozcar observatoire de la zone critique application et recherche critical zone observatories applications and research https www ozcar ri org it has been intensively investigated since the 1980 s meteorological hydrological and geochemical data have been recorded since 1986 for additional details see pierret et al 2014 2018 viville et al 2012 2017 the catchment covers an area of 0 8 km2 with an altitude between 880 and 1150 m above sea level slopes are approximately 15 of the north facing part and 9 of the south facing area the climate is mountainous oceanic with an annual mean temperature of 6 7 c and a mean rainfall of 1400 mm year with 15 to 20 falling as snow during 2 to 4 months per year the estimated mean evapotranspiration is approximately 600 mm year the mean infiltration is 800 mm beaulieu et al 2016 viville et al 2012 and no significant runoff occurs forest covers 90 of the geographical area of the catchment mainly populated by 80 spruces picea abies l and 20 beeches fagus sylvatica several small springs outcrop within the catchment fig 1 its geochemical and isotopic water compositions have been studied over several years e g cenki tok et al 2009 cividini et al 2010 lemarchand et al 2010 pierret et al 2014 prunier 2008 ranchoux et al 2021 schmitt et al 2003 and its concentration variations have been modeled via reactive transport simulations ackerer et al 2020 ackerer et al 2018 this site is equipped with a meteorological station located at an altitude of 1101 m it has continuously registered temperature humidity wind direction wind speed solar radiation and precipitation since 1986 the bedrock is a base poor hercynian granite fractured and hydrothermally overprinted el ghmari 1995 fichter et al 1998 with a small outcrop of gneiss in the summit of the northern part of the catchment a better knowledge of the structure and architecture of the bedrock has been obtained over the last few years from data issued from nine wells drilled at the site three of them cored and ranging over 10 to 100 m whole depth ackerer et al 2021 chabaux et al 2017 ranchoux 2020 ranchoux et al 2021 the granite is mainly composed of quartz 35 albite 31 k feldspar 22 and biotite 6 it also contains small amounts of muscovite 3 anorthite 2 apatite 0 5 and clay minerals 0 5 in ackerer et al 2022 ackerer et al 2016 the bedrock has been affected by meteoric weathering processes during the quaternary ackerer et al 2016 and the catchment is currently covered by a 0 5 to 1 0 m thick acidic and coarse in texture soil hyperdystrict cambisol wrb 2014 more details available in fichter et al 1998 prunier et al 2015 chabaux et al 2019 on the north facing slope the saprolite developed into the bedrock constitutes an aquifer ranging from 1 to 2 m depth on the catchment crests to more than 9 m in a saturated area near the strengbach stream ackerer et al 2020 weill et al 2019 the current study is focused on the four cs springs cs1 to 4 located in the southwestern part of the strengbach catchment fig 1 where the saprolite thickness increases along the hillslope from 1 to 2 m in the upper part to 9 10 m downstream ranchoux 2020 interpretation of magnetic resonance sounding mrs signals in the strengbach catchment boucher et al 2015 led to the subdivision of the catchment into 5 different hydrogeological units with contrasting water volume values these range from less than 0 25 m3 m2 for the area where the cs springs are located to 0 75 m3 m2 for the more downstream area formed by colluvium these contrasts in water retention capacity were confirmed by more recent gravimetric measurements chaffaut et al 2022 furthermore field observations based on the study of weathering profiles e g ackerer et al 2016 ackerer et al 2022 as well as boreholes performed on site e g ranchoux 2020 ranchoux et al 2021 led to propose that the subsurface aquifer on these slopes is composed of two layers with different porosities lesparre et al 2020 confirmed this scheme by validating a two layer hydrological model for the aquifer with mrs measurements in such a model the aquifer on the slope where the cs springs are located is about 4 m thick it is divided into an upper horizon soil 0 5 m thick with a porosity of 0 1 and a lower level saprolite 3 5 m thick with a porosity of 0 02 the more downstream colluvium zone can be up to 14 m thick with a 1 m thick soil layer with a porosity of 0 5 and a 13 m thick saprolite with a porosity of 0 03 for springs cs1 to cs4 water is collected by drains at the bottom of small excavated ditches then refilled and connected to independent pipelines the latter conduct water downstream into a single tank cr used for drinking water supply to the nearby village of aubure the drain in cs1 is the only one passing through the rock in situ at approximately 3 m depth capturing the water flowing between the fissures and fractures through a natural drainage the other three drains are placed in the soil compartment mainly composed of scree the drains collecting cs2 and cs4 are located at 4 m depth with a length of 17 m for cs2 and 3 m for cs4 the drain collecting cs3 is at 2 5 m depth with a length of 10 m drains are assumed to be mainly parallel to the soil surface water temperatures and flow rates are measured at each cs spring before discharge in the collector tank the spring water temperature was analyzed regularly approximately every 15 days from 2013 to 2017 while spring discharges have been measured with a similar frequency since 1988 3 first order analysis of the measured spring temperature for the strengbach catchment the only soil temperature measurements available were collected along a single soil profile at 5 cm 16 cm 42 cm and 71 cm depth in belfort et al 2018 the monitoring was carried out in the experimental spruce parcel located on the opposite slope of the cs springs fig 1 the measurements at 5 cm depth in the soil the daily air temperatures measured at the meteorological station and the spring water temperatures between september 2013 and january 2017 are reported in fig 2 air temperatures at the meteorological station follow seasonality with the warmest months e g temperatures over 20 c occurring in july and august and the coldest months corresponding to january and february where temperatures can reach values below 10 c soil temperatures display a seasonality similar to air temperatures but with lower amplitude when the air temperature reaches values below zero the difference between soil and air temperatures increases this may be due to the litter or snow covering the soil surface and or frozen soil which limit heat fluxes from air to soil spring water temperatures are also marked by seasonal variations but with an amplitude significantly smaller and a shift in time compared to air or soil temperatures specific to each spring fig 2 these shifts are of several weeks or months depending on the spring to estimate the phase shifts between the different temperature sets each data series was fitted to a sinusoidal function defined by an average temperature t0 an amplitude aω a frequency more precisely an angular velocity ω 2 π f with f the frequency and a phase shift φ as an angle equivalent to days of delay relative to the air temperature variations 1 t t t 0 a ω cos ω t φ where φ 0 for the air temperature an analysis by fourier series was applied to the temperature records in order to obtain the parameters explaining the amplitude shift and frequency of the harmonic representing the annual variations significant lower phase shifts have been estimated for the cs1 and cs3 springs 45 and 30 days respectively compared with cs2 110 days and cs4 80 days table 1 the cs1 and cs3 springs are also marked by a larger amplitude of temperature variations 1 1 c and 1 7 c respectively than cs2 0 4 c and cs4 0 8 c based on these data a positive trend between the temperature phase shifts and spring discharges can be assumed this trend might suggest a relationship between thermal and hydrologic transfers in the watershed even if the discharge intensity of the cs springs might have origins other than the sole hydrologic transfer intensity in the bedrock indeed flows measured at the outlet of the drains are also largely controlled by water collection facilities this includes the drain length which increases the drainage capacity see table 1 the drain depth especially close to the surface with drains probably collecting water from partly unsaturated areas this might explain the small flow extracted from cs3 despite the drain length see table 1 the permeability of the soil the aquifer housing cs1 fractured rock differs from the three other springs scree which might also explain the difference in flow rates 4 unsaturated flow and heat transfer modeling a deeper analysis of the information brought by temperature variations on soil transfer properties and or soil heterogeneity was carried out by relying upon a fully coupled physically based model simulating flow and heat transfer for the current study we use a model handling saturated and unsaturated flow conditions transient boundary conditions for both flow and heat transfer and accounting for soil heterogeneity we assume that the subsurface is a heterogeneous porous material the local effects of the vegetation are neglected for flow and heat transfer this is probably acceptable except for summer periods when root water uptake may locally modify flow and heat transfer conditions nevertheless the overall amount of water extracted by the vegetation is taken into account through evapotranspiration the water freezing is not handled by the model the water density and viscosity remain constant in view of the amplitude of temperature variations 10 c 4 1 unsaturated flow model flow in unsaturated porous materials such as non deformable soils is usually modeled using the richards equation richards 1931 given by 2 θ t s w s 0 ψ t q f q k r ψ k ψ z where θ is the volumetric water content l3 l3 sw is the water saturation s0 is the specific storage capacity accounting for both fluid and porous skeleton compressibility l 1 ψ is the pressure head l q is the water flux based on darcy s law l t t is the time t z is the vertical coordinate counted positive upward l f is the source sink term t 1 k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity tensor l t and k r ψ is the relative hydraulic conductivity the model includes initial and boundary conditions of the prescribed pressure head dirichlet or prescribed flux neumann type we use the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 for the pressure head versus water content relationship defined by 3 s w ψ θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ η m ψ 0 1 ψ 0 where m 1 1 η s w is the effective water saturation θ r and θ s are the residual and saturated volumetric water content respectively and α l 1 and η are experimentally estimated coefficients the relation between the relative permeability and the water saturation of the aqueous phase is represented by the mualem model mualem 1976 4 k r s w s w 1 2 1 1 s w 1 m m 2 ψ 0 1 0 ψ 0 4 2 heat transfer mathematical model if an instantaneous thermal equilibrium between the fluid and soil is assumed and the variations in density and viscosity due to temperature variations are neglected the equation describing the heat transfer by conduction and convection through a porous media can be expressed as stallman 1960 5 ρ b c b t t λ b t q t 0 where ρ b is the density ml 3 c b l2t 2k 1 is the specific heat capacity of the porous plus fluid material t is the temperature k t is time t λ b is the thermal conductivity tensor of the porous medium mlt 3k 1 and q is the darcy flux lt 1 at the domain boundary it is possible to prescribe either the temperature dirichlet type boundary or the heat flux neumann type boundary initial temperature has to be defined over the whole domain the specific heat capacity of the porous plus fluid material is defined by campbell 1985 6 ρ b c b 1 θ s ρ s c s θ ρ w c w θ s θ ρ a c a where θ s is the saturated water content θ is the water content ρ φ is the density ml 3 and c φ l2t 2k 1 is the specific heat capacity of the phase φ with φ s standing for the solid φ w for water and φ a for air the contribution of air is neglected in the model due to its low density compared with water and solid phases the thermal conductivity is assumed to be the addition of mechanical dispersion and heat conduction hecht méndez et al 2010 7 λ b λ disp λ diff θ ρ w c w i where i is the identity matrix λ disp is the mechanical dispersion tensor l2t 1 and λ diff is the effective thermal conductivity coefficient mlt 3k 1 the mechanical dispersion λ disp is the consequence of velocity fluctuations around the mean water velocity u it is characterized by the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities λ l l and λ t l and defined by 8 λ disp i j λ t q δ ij λ l λ t q i q j q where q i q j are the components of the darcy flux lt 1 along the i and j directions q is the darcy flux magnitude and δ ij is the kronecker delta equal to zero if i j and one if i j the effective thermal conductivity λ diff is usually calculated as the arithmetic mean of the thermal conductivities of the different constituents solid material and water in saturated soils hoffmann et al 2019 klepikova et al 2016 sarris et al 2018 vandenbohede and lebbe 2010 wildemeersch et al 2014 for unsaturated flow conditions with air also filling the pores the above formulation overestimates the value of the effective thermal conductivity cho and kwon 2010 go et al 2016 stauffer et al 2013 therefore different models were proposed to evaluate the effective thermal conductivity in unsaturated soils those depend on two key parameters the water saturation and the thermal conductivity of solids e g reviews in go et al 2016 he et al 2020 różański and stefaniuk 2016 zhang and wang 2017 after having compared measurements and estimations of thermal conductivity from 15 different models zhang and wang 2017 proposed to keep as the most accurate models those developed by chen 2008 or by côté and konrad 2005 and modified by zhang et al 2017 likewise he et al 2020 on the basis of 16 previously published models recommended the use of the model by côté and konrad 2005 when the soil thermal conductivity in saturated conditions is known they also showed that the model of johansen 1977 could render satisfactory results if the quartz content in soil is known compared to the models of chen 2008 or zhang et al 2017 the model by côté and konrad 2005 has the advantage of being calibrated over a wider panel of geological materials a wider range of rock saturations and a larger range of temperatures for this reason the expression of côté and konrad 2005 is employed to estimate the thermal conductivity in soils as 9 λ diff λ w θ s λ s 1 θ s 10 η θ s x κ s 1 κ 1 s 10 η θ s x where s is saturation and θ s is the water content at saturation l3 l3 the empirical coefficient κ is equal to 4 6 for unfrozen gravel and coarse sand 6 55 for median and fine sand and 1 69 for silt and clay for crushed rocks and gravel x and η correspond to 1 70 and 1 80 respectively and for natural mineral soils 0 75 and 1 2 respectively in côté and konrad 2005 mixed finite elements are used to solve the flow equation and the diffusive part of the heat transfer equation while discontinuous finite elements solve the convective part of the heat transfer equation to avoid excessive numerical diffusion these numerical methods ensure mass and energy conservation in addition to handling complex diffusion and sharp convective fronts these numerical techniques are implemented in the code traces hoteit and ackerer 2004 used in this study 5 model site conception 5 1 model geometry and boundary conditions an optimal representation of the system should lead to a 3 d model at least at the scale of each spring sub catchment this option would require important computation capacities and data handling probably partly useless because the 3 d extension of each spring sub catchment is poorly known this feature inclined us to build 2 d models through the catchment as diverse representative cross sections the subsurface flow is assumed to follow the soil surface topography within cross sections located along the main streamline of the sub catchment area for each source fig 3 a these lines start at the strengbach catchment boundary and are extended downstream from the springs to avoid the eventual effects of inaccurate downstream boundary conditions fig 3b a representative cross section has been delineated as relevant for mimicking the 2 d flow collected by the four sources fig 3 the upper boundary is given by the soil surface the thickness of the section increases from upstream 2 m to downstream 9 m and the lateral boundaries are considered vertical fig 4 the boundary conditions for flow are of the impervious type null flux neumann boundaries at the upstream limit and the bottom of the aquifer a constant head value of 1 m of saturated thickness is prescribed for the vertical section downstream to assure the flow in the aquifer and as told earlier minimize the influence on flow and heat transfer at the spring s location a uniform flux is prescribed at the upper boundary soil surface of the domain this flux varies over time fig 5 a as the difference between precipitation measured at the meteorologic station and evapotranspiration it is worth noting that these fluxes at the surface defined at a daily time step were successfully used in the simulation of water transfer in soils by belfort et al 2018 where they estimated the evapotranspiration with a method based on the penman monteith model and using the software biljou https appgeodb nancy inra fr biljou granier et al 1999 as an initial condition a one meter saturated thickness is set up along the whole profile for heat transfer the upstream vertical boundary is set to a null flux boundary no heat input output for both convective and conductive dispersive fluxes the conductive flux is neglected at the downstream vertical boundary the daily time varying temperature fig 5b is prescribed at the soil surface and is assumed to be uniform over the whole boundary depending on the performed simulations we used as prescribed value either the temperature at equilibrium with the air temperature measured at the meteorological station or the soil temperature measured at the spruce plot at 5 cm depth fig 5b by belfort et al 2018 the bottom of the vertical section is located beneath the lower limit of the so called thermally active zone caissie et al 2014 the latter being the soils and rock surface horizons where the temperature profile over depth is influenced by atmospheric variations in these horizons the amplitude of temperature variations decreases with depth until reaching a level of constant temperature over time taniguchi 1993 both types of boundary conditions prescribed temperature or flux could be applied at the bottom of the cross section both numerical values are unknown but can be estimated a prescribed temperature can be estimated by analyzing the sink water temperature as a first estimation a prescribed flux could also be evaluated considering a geothermal heat gradient estimated at 0 043 c m in the vosges mountains danis and royer 1985 this geothermal gradient has been estimated at a global scale and may significantly vary locally therefore a prescribed temperature seems a better option with estimates as the available local measurements as the initial thermal condition a uniform temperature of 8 c is imposed on the soil profile 5 2 model parameters numerous parameters are involved in the flow and heat transfer models to account for the unsaturated flow conditions over part of the vertical sections however it is possible to define a realistic range for almost every required parameter thanks to the numerous field and modeling works carried out over the catchment for the flow model based on the hydrological study of the strengbach catchment by weill et al 2019 the saturated water content varies between 0 1 and 0 5 for the saturated hydraulic conductivity a mean value of 8 0 10 5 m s has been used for the strengbach aquifer at the catchment scale pierret et al 2018 the spatial distribution of this parameter was proposed by beaulieu et al 2016 by calibrating the hydrological data of a two layer aquifer model a permeable surface layer and a less permeable deeper layer for the sub catchment drained by the cs springs the calibration renders a saturated hydraulic conductivity extending from 1 0 10 5 m s to 6 5 10 5 m s for the upper layer of the aquifer and from 0 10 10 5 m s to 1 0 10 5 m s for the deeper layer greater than 10 m other studies over the same catchment estimated that hydraulic conductivities were in the range 0 1 10 5 m s to 10 0 10 5 m s either assuming a saturated hydraulic conductivity uniform over the catchment lesparre et al 2020 or heterogeneous values within multilayer configurations weill et al 2017 for the current study the tested saturated hydraulic conductivities were taken between 10 7 m s and 10 4 m s the parameters of the van genuchten model are fixed for all the cases and do not play an important role in the modeling of subsurface flow at the strengbach catchment lesparre et al 2020 table 2 summarizes the parameter set for the heat transfer model the values of the thermal dispersivity are assumed to be that of solute dispersivity with values close to or up to 0 1 m at this scale e g hatch et al 2006 stonestrom and constantz 2003 vandenbohede et al 2011 some authors considered that thermal dispersion is negligible compared with the conduction or the convection in heat transfer hopmans et al 2002 irvine et al 2017 for rau et al 2012 mechanical dispersion can be neglected for highly conduction dominated heat fluxes by the thermal dispersivity based on the darcy flow velocity preliminary simulations also showed that mechanical dispersion could be neglected in our context therefore the thermal longitudinal dispersivity λ l is set a priori to 0 10 m the transverse 10 times smaller the thermal conductivity value of the solid phase can be calculated from the thermal conductivity of the individual minerals constituting the host rock for that the mineralogical composition of the str13 samples collected along a weathered profile at the summit of the catchment was used data in ackerer et al 2016 these samples are marked by a high quartz content between 32 and 48 followed by k feldspar plagioclase biotite and muscovite using the thermal conductivity of the individual minerals horai and simmons 1969 the proportion of the minerals and an arithmetic average różański and stefaniuk 2016 the thermal conductivity of the solid in the soil profile ranged from 3 5 to 4 3 w m k with an average value of 3 8 w m k therefore a range of solid thermal conductivity from 3 5 to 4 5 w m k is kept here for the modeling exercises likewise the volumetric heat capacity of the solid was determined through the specific heat and density of the minerals composing the soil stauffer et al 2013 and through a volume weighted sum of heat capacities of the minerals stonestrom and constantz 2003 the resulting volumetric heat capacity of the solid shows a very weak variation from 1 9 106 j m3 k to 2 0 106 j m3 k for the same soil profile a variation range between 1 9 106 j m3 k and 2 5 106 j m3 k has been retained for taking into account the high content of organic matter of some soil layers as organic matter is characterized by higher volumetric heat capacity 2 5 106 j m3 k stonestrom and constantz 2003 the thermal parameters in the subsurface are summarized in table 2 6 modeling results and discussion given the relatively high number of parameters involved in the modeling we conducted a local sensitivity analysis as a first test to better define the variables of interest for the simulation of measured temperature in the spring waters of the strengbach catchment then a simulation of observed temperatures is carried out for the springs cs fig 6 6 1 sensitivity analysis results for the sensitivity analysis the modeled aquifer is considered homogeneous petrological and hydrological characteristics have been given in previous modeling studies ackerer et al 2016 lesparre et al 2020 ranchoux et al 2021 weill et al 2019 the hydrological parameters are given in table 2 column reference value the volumetric heat capacity and the thermal conductivity were set to 1 9x106 j m3 k and 3 5 w m k respectively the boundary conditions for flow at the top of the sections correspond to the precipitation measured at the meteorological station a constant temperature of 7 c is applied at the bottom of the section fig 7 displays the results of temperature simulations from june 2015 to april 2016 the main temperature variations occur in the first two meters of soil with temperatures ranging from 4 c to 24 c the isotherms are parallel to the upper surface of the aquifer such temperature variations are expected when heat transfer occurs mainly in a direction perpendicular to the surface rather than in the flow direction this suggests a preponderance of vertical conduction over lateral convective heat transfer in the system this is also the case with the depth variation of temperature over a hydrological cycle fig 8 the observed dampening and retardation of the input forcing term the temperature at the soil surface is also that of a purely diffusive process the minor contribution of the convection in heat transfer is confirmed by an additional set of simulations where the water flux at the inflow top of the section has been increased from 1100 mm year the measured precipitation on the site to 2200 mm year for both simulations temperature variations show very little differences fig 9 the minor contribution of convection due to water flow also explains the almost uniform temperatures simulated along the drains collecting the springs the most important difference obtained for a drain of 10 m cs3 between the two ends is less than 1 c for the different simulations performed fig 10 altogether the above observations especially the lack of any significant differences between simulated temperature for large variations in water recharge as well as the constancy of temperature along a water flow path imply that the main heat transfer process is related to conduction heat transfer simulation does not require precise knowledge of the infiltration rates at the soil surface heat transfer is not sensitive to water velocity that is to the hydraulic conductivity in the domain the temperature in the vicinity of the spring drains is constant therefore the water temperature inside one drain is constant these simulations also show a clear attenuation of temperature variations with depth in the aquifer with temperatures which tend to vary around the prescribed temperature at the bottom of the section 7 c effects of thermal boundary conditions in the above simulations the surface temperature is calculated from the atmospheric temperature measured at the meteorological station of the catchment this choice neglects the thermal protection effect induced by the snow or ice cover in winter or the litter and its biological activity the comparison of atmospheric temperatures with soil temperatures shows a systematic bias especially in winter with soil temperatures systematically higher and above zero c to evaluate the possible impact of these differences on the simulated temperature along the vertical sections a simulation was run using the soil temperature measured at 5 cm depth by belfort et al 2018 as the surface temperature fig 11 the results show a significant difference compared with calculations relying upon the atmospheric temperature at the surface especially for low temperature values with differences becoming more pronounced in the subsurface the closer the locations are to the soil surface therefore the temperatures measured in the soils are assumed to be the appropriate boundary condition at the surface to simulate spring water temperatures even if these soil temperatures were measured in another subarea of the catchment than that of springs with different climatic characteristics such as radiation soil type or vegetation cover however we consider these to be of secondary importance compared to neglecting the thermal protection effects due to snow cover and litter effects of the temperature value at the bottom boundary the effect of the temperature prescribed at the bottom of the section on the simulation results is evaluated by performing a simulation with a temperature of 6 c instead of 7 c the modification in the prescribed temperature generates a vertical translation of the temperature values which increases with depth fig 12 in general a bottom temperature of 6 c results in lower temperatures in soils than 7 c while a few features such as the amplitude of the thermal variations or the delay in pics propagation remain unchanged hence the temperature at the bottom of the section determines the temperature around which the thermal response varies especially in deeper layers additional simulations were performed by changing the thickness of the aquifer they highlight the damping effects associated with the bottom boundary if the aquifer thickness is small the amplitude of temperature variations is very limited at a given depth on the opposite for the same depth the amplitude increases with the thickness of the cross section effects of saturated water content the impact of the different model parameters on the thermal response of the aquifer is evaluated by performing simulations where the different parameters are modified independently from one another in the variation range defined in 5 2 simulation results show that parameters such as hydraulic conductivity dispersivity and thermal conductivity of solids have no significant impact on the simulated temperatures fig 13 heat capacity and conductivity of the soil depend on effective and saturated water content thermal variations and retardation of heat fluctuations associated with boundary conditions at the surface impact the temperature of the subsurface increasing the saturated water content renders an overall solid plus fluid lower thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity results from the sensitivity analysis will be used in simulating the temperature measured in the different springs these results are heat transfer is mainly associated with conduction not fluid convection therefore the boundary for flow groundwater recharge does not require an accurate estimation as is the case for hydraulic conductivity the saturated water content is a sensitive parameter because it affects the soil solid plus water heat capacity through retardation of the forcing and the soil heat diffusivity the temperature at the soil surface should account for the sheltering effects of snow ice and or litter the temperature measured at 5 cm depth in the soil is better suited to temperature simulations in spring waters the temperature profile in the soil is conditioned by the soil thickness and the temperature prescribed at the bottom of the section more precisely the soil thickness affects the temperature variations over time at a local given depth whereas the prescribed value at the bottom affects the average temperature at a given depth finally the length of the drains collecting spring waters does not significantly modify the temperature at the drain outlets 6 2 spring temperature simulations and hydrogeological implications 6 2 1 adaptation of the modeling scheme and parameters the sensitivity analysis was conducted with conditions of simulations very close to that prevailing in the field however the structure of the modeled aquifer domain was assumed homogeneous throughout its thickness actually the aquifer structure at the strengbach catchment might be more complex because the regolith is subdivided into at least two superimposed layers an upper porous layer formed by a granitic arena on which the soil is developed and a deeper layer of compact granitic saprolite corresponding to a more or less fractured bedrock level marked by a lower porosity ackerer et al 2020 chabaux et al 2017 el ghmari 1995 fichter et al 1998 lesparre et al 2020 ranchoux 2020 weill et al 2019 accounting for this vertical heterogeneity should at least separate the aquifer into two superimposed horizons however an additional complexity must also be considered the cs springs are collected before their emergence at the surface as mentioned in section 2 only the cs1 spring is collected from a saprolite in place with little disturbance the other three springs are collected by drains placed in a trench covered by scree and then secondarily vegetated the lithological nature of the scree is not well known and might be a mix of granitic blocks and loose materials from granitic soils and sands for these springs the aquifer at the level of spring water collection should be better represented by a single layer medium rather than by a two layered system to account for these specific anthropogenic setups the temperature variations were modeled along two designs corresponding to a single layer model and a two layer model in the two layer model the upper part represents the sand saprolite horizon while the lower horizon corresponds to the compact saprolite level the sensitivity analysis showed that the variations of density specific heat capacity and volumetric heat capacity for the solid particles were of little impact on the simulations for variations of less than 15 of clay minerals mixed with a granitic material maximum proportion in the soil levels of the strengbach catchment for the two layers we chose parameter values corresponding to a granitic material namely a density of 2650 kg m3 a specific heat capacity of 731 5 j kg k and a thermal conductivity of 3 5 w m k the two layers are thus considered to be composed of the same type of material but with different saturated water content which is a parameter to be calibrated this was done by varying its value from 0 1 to 0 5 in addition considering the uncertainty related to the boundary between these two layers several scenarios varying each layer thickness as well as the depth of the thermal boundary were assessed for each spring collector the simulations were performed considering upper layers thicknesses of 0 20 50 80 and 100 of the cross section thickness the one layer model was then easily built from the two layer system by using the parameters of the granitic material and testing a uniform saturated water content between 0 1 and 0 5 for the whole cross section the soil organic carbon has not been taken into account in the sensitivity analysis carried out in section 6 1 yet it may affect the heat transfer in the soil by decreasing the effective thermal conductivity chen et al 2012 dai et al 2019 he et al 2021 zhao and si 2019 the soil and saprolite horizons at the strengbach catchment contain between 5 and 20 organic carbon in the first 20 cm below the surface e g aubert 2001 gangloff et al 2014 the influence of the organic carbon content on the spring temperature simulations has been tested for both the single and two layer models by modifying the density specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity in the layers those parameters were recalculated assuming that their values varied proportionally to the organic carbon content of the layer see table 2 for the values used for organic matter in the two layer model only the surface horizon was considered to contain organic matter the proportions of organic matter tested are 10 20 50 and the extreme case of 100 for each source several simulations have been performed in different configurations single vs two layer models with or without organic matter the most relevant results are summarized below the complete set of simulations can be found in the supplementary data in addition for all simulations a warm up period of two years is applied to avoid the potential effects of flawed initial conditions only the results from 2015 and 2016 are discussed and interpreted the sensitivity analysis also shows that a modification of the prescribed temperature at the bottom of the aquifer resulted in a constant shift in temperature values over the whole period of simulation to avoid misinterpretations associated with diverse bottom boundary conditions the temperatures have been recast as their relative value that is the ratio of the effective temperature to the mean temperatures over a period of two years considering the relatively small amount of data one temperature record every 8 to 15 days the quality of the simulations was checked graphically figs 14 17 and supplementary data analyzing i the amplitude of the thermal variations maximum and minimum temperatures ii the phase shift between measurements and simulations correspondence of the peaks and lows in the temperature versus arrival time and iii the trends of the temperature variations similar slopes for increasing decreasing temperature the qualitive evaluation has been preferred to quantitative performance based on metrics such as quadrature differences between measured and computed values because for relatively small data sets usual metrics give too much importance to outliers moreover some discrepancies between simulations and measurements are difficult to detect with usual metrics such as time shift or trends 6 2 2 cs1 and cs3 spring simulations the cs1 and cs3 springs are collected at depths of 3 m and 2 5 m respectively this is close to the limit between the granitic arena and fractured bedrock estimated in this area at approximately 2 2 5 m depth ackerer 2017 ackerer et al 2016 ranchoux 2020 the observed temperature variations are quite easily modeled for the two sources with both the two layer and the one layer models the optimal simulations with the one layer model are obtained by locating the basal thermal boundary between 3 5 and 4 1 m depth for both sources however the simulations impose high values of saturated water content θs 0 3 0 5 lower values of saturated water content render simulations a few days ahead compared to measurements the introduction of 10 or 20 of organic carbon into the layers generates a slight attenuation of the simulated temperatures slightly delayed curves and a better fit of measurements while keeping high water content θs 0 5 high porosity values saturated water content are conceivable in the shallow horizons of the strengbach regolith but keeping those at nearly 4 m depth beneath the surface can be questioned in view of field data ackerer et al 2016 ackerer 2017 simulations with lower and probably more realistic porosity values are obtained in the two layer model fig 14 the key parameters for correctly fitting the data are the maximum porosity of the two layers and the depth of thermal invariance organic carbon content in the upper layer is secondary and must be considered an adjustment factor for the quality of the simulations for the cs1 and cs3 springs very good simulations are obtained with θs 0 3 in the upper horizon and 0 1 in the lower one for a basal thermal invariance at 4 m depth with or without a maximum organic carbon concentration of 10 20 in the upper layer the simulation quality does not really depend on the relative thickness of the upper layer compared to the lower one some simulations of similar quality are obtained either with an upper layer as 80 of the whole aquifer thickness or only 20 fig 15 however if the geometrical configuration of the system is a single layer with a porosity of 0 1 the simulations cannot correctly fit the data this feature highlights how the type of horizon exposed to the surface boundary conditions impacts the system by delaying the thermal signal propagated in the subsurface regardless of this point and irrespective of the aquifer model used one vs two layer models the temperature variations in the strengbach springs are controlled by a thermal diffusion process and not by advection an important consequence is that the observed attenuations and phase shifts between spring and atmospheric or litter temperature variations do not inform hydrological characteristics such as mean water velocity or water residence time the second consequence for this type of hydrological system is that the zone of air temperature influence in the subsurface is decoupled from the water circulation zone this could lead to defining a thermal critical zone separated from the active hydrological zone temperature simulations in cs1 and cs3 also confirm that their variations only depend on a few hydrological parameters two sensitive parameters are the depth of the thermal invariance zone and its temperature value at 4 m depth and 7 c for cs1 and cs3 another key parameter impacting the simulation is the average maximum porosity value saturated water content of the aquifer layers for its part the organic carbon content in the soil layers is of secondary importance for simulating the cs1 and cs3 temperatures 6 2 3 cs2 and cs4 simulations compared to the cs1 and cs3 springs the cs2 and cs4 springs are located at slightly lower elevations fig 1 and the water collection in the bedrock is slightly deeper 4 m compared with 3 m for cs1 and 2 5 m for cs3 this deeper location certainly explains the smaller annual variation ranges of temperatures at cs2 and cs4 0 4 c than at cs1 and cs3 sources 2 c for the cs2 and cs4 springs the amplitude of the thermal variations and the gradient of the increasing decreasing temperature periods can be well simulated irrespective of the selected simulation model one layer vs two layers it is worth noting that the two layer model renders valuable results for a large set of geometrical configurations regarding the proportion occupied by the upper layer within the whole thickness of the aquifer also observed for cs1 and cs3 see above again the quality of the simulations mainly depends on the uniform constant over time temperature value at the bottom of the sections in a scenario considering a granitic material without organic carbon the best simulations are obtained for a temperature invariance level slightly deeper for cs2 and cs4 4 6 5 1 m than for cs1 and cs3 4 4 5 m but in those calculations the simulated signal is systematically in advance of at least 2 weeks in the best simulations of cs4 fig 16 and 4 weeks for cs2 fig 17 correct simulations of temperature phase shifts in the cs2 and cs4 springs impose an integration of organic carbon in the system which induces a greater attenuation of the temperature signal while delaying it with the one layer model the best fits of cs4 data are obtained for an organic matter content of 20 a thermal invariance level at 5 1 m depth and a maximum porosity of 0 5 organic carbon content of 20 or more is observed in the surface soil horizons at the strengbach catchment but not in the deeper horizons and probably not in the regolith at 4 5 m depth this obviously renders the simulation results hardly consistent with expectations for the strengbach case it is even worse with cs2 for which satisfactory modeling of the temperature shift imposes 80 to 100 organic carbon in the whole aquifer the use of a two layer model beyond allowing for prescribing more realistic porosity parameters 0 3 and 0 1 in the upper and lower layers respectively also reduces the thickness of the layer containing organic matter however the simulation results remain difficult to reconcile with the organic carbon content measured in the field the two layers model still requires high organic carbon content in the upper layer of the model for example with a thermal invariance depth of 5 2 m the correct simulation of cs4 data is obtained with an upper layer containing 50 organic carbon and representing 50 to 80 of the total thickness of the aquifer it is necessary to increase the organic carbon content of the upper layer and deepen the thermal invariance zone to compensate for the signal attenuation and maintain good fits of the data with a smaller vertical extension of the upper layer indeed the higher the organic carbon content of the upper layer the more delayed the temperature signal is at a given depth and the more it is attenuated thus for cs4 a 100 organic carbon layer with a vertical extension of 10 20 can be used to account for the data if the thermal invariance depth is lowered to 5 7 m depth these simulations seem to be more realistic in terms of soil extension even though layers concealing organic matter at the strengbach catchment still have a small vertical extension of a few centimeters at most for cs2 the simulated results are unrealistic since a correct signal is only obtained with a top layer of pure organic carbon over at least 50 of the total vertical extension of the system ackerer et al 2020 used the nihm hydrological model that feeds the cs1 and cs3 springs with relatively parallel flow lines they showed that while cs2 and cs4 would be fed by two different groups of flow lines one draining the northern slope the other the southern slope each group was characterized by specific hydrological parameters with two distinct water flow paths supplying cs2 and cs4 it is logical that the present modeling exercise handling a single flow path may encounter difficulties in reproducing the observations at cs2 and cs4 the construction of a 3d model which is beyond the scope of this work would certainly be necessary nevertheless despite the difficulty of reproducing cs2 and cs4 data all our simulations confirm that the observed temperature variations in the spring waters of the strengbach basin cannot constrain flow features of the subsurface such as water velocities and water residence time in contrast with studies developed on karstic aquifers covington et al 2011 lismonde 2010 tamburini and menichetti 2019 where the flow through conducts allow a better conservation of the inlet thermal signal this assertion relies upon the incapability to reproduce temperature signal attenuations and phase shifts in subsurface waters that would render subsurface flow transforming inlet carried by atmospheric surface waters this implies that the correlation between temperature phase shift and spring discharge which the data might indicate is incidental and cannot be used to justify control of heat transfer by hydrological advection dominated processes that being said and certainly more important the simulation results clearly indicate that the temperature variations of cs springs strongly depend on the average porosity values of the aquifer be it modeled as a single or a two layer system porosity or the separation of the aquifer in diverse layers is poorly documented by available data mainly targeting the first meter of depth in the system the study of temperature variations in spring waters and their modeling could thus become a way to constrain the spatial variability of porosity as well as the geometrical settings of the aquifer number of layers overall depth of the hydrologically active compartment in that sense monitoring subsurface temperature of shallow aquifers would probably help in conducting hydrological studies in small water catchments 7 conclusion the coupled thermo hydrological model developed in this study to interpret the seasonal temperature variations of the strengbach spring waters renders information on the origin of mainly phase shifts and attenuations transforming the inlet signal brought by atmospheric or very shallow soil waters 1 heat transfer is due to heat conduction and not significantly to water motion in soil therefore related parameters such as water fluxes at the soil surface convective travel times or hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer cannot not be estimated through the study of water temperature variations 2 heat transfer by conduction is associated with the diffusivity tensor and heat gradients diffusivity related to mechanical dispersion local heterogeneity of water velocities can be neglected therefore the diffusivity tensor mainly depends on the type of soil material and the water content in addition the propagation of the heat wave also depends on the heat soil capacity the storage of heat energy also related to the static properties of the different materials and water content 3 water temperature variations at different soil depths are conditioned by the forcing term at the soil surface here measured temperatures 5 cm below the topographic surface and the dampening effect related to the diffusive process and the boundary conditions prescribed at the bottom of the aquifer this boundary condition is all the more influential when the aquifer is thin and shallow as is the case in the present study 4 the results are representative of a shallow aquifer modelled as a porous material other systems such as karstic complexes or flow in fractures would require different approaches in the model modeling seasonal temperature variations of spring waters in a catchment such as the strengbach czo might therefore become in the future a way to constrain the saturated water content porosity of the aquifer conclusions grounded in the application of a 2 d hydrological thermal model as developed in this study are sufficient for the analysis of the upstream cs springs marked by a relatively simple flow line geometry the study of the more downstream springs cs2 cs4 fed by a more complex flow lines network geometry would probably require the services of 3 d investigations credit authorship contribution statement daniel s moreno martin investigation conceptualization methodology software writing

2076,this study is geared towards evaluating the hydrological information that can be extracted from spring water temperature variations in shallow and thin aquifers of headwater catchments a series of temperature variations from 2013 to 2017 in four spring water sources at the strengbach critical zone observatory czo was analyzed and interpreted by relying upon a coupled two dimensional unsaturated saturated flow and heat transfer model specifically designed for the study temperature variations of spring waters at the strengbach catchment obey a seasonal non phased and attenuated cyclicity compared with temperature inputs from the air or very shallow waters in soils simulation results show that within the shallow subsurface horizons heat transfer is mainly controlled by thermal conduction and not by fluid flow the results also emphasize that the depth and temperature value of the thermal invariance zone are key parameters to surface temperature attenuation patterns in the first meters beneath the surface the average maximum porosity or saturated water content is another important parameter impacting heat transfers in the shallow subsurface stronger attenuations and delays of the thermal signal occur as the porosity increases these different results indicate that temperature variations in the spring waters especially the attenuation and phase shift of the signals compared with incoming air surface water temperatures do not bring information on hydrological transfers in very shallow systems characteristics such as flow velocities and water residence times cannot be inferred from temperature variations nevertheless this study suggests that spring water temperature variations could become a way of identifying the usually poorly known saturated water content and its spatial variability at the catchment scale data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface water temperature is often considered as a proxy for climate change and or anthropogenic activities such as forest management or flow alteration at the scale of a water catchment caissie 2006 applied to hydrology temperature variation measurements are used as tracers to characterize flow in the hyporheic zones soils or groundwater even if its applicability requires estimates of heat fluxes exchanged between the porous material and water engelhardt

whether via modeling heat transfer in synthetic test cases bundschuh 1993 or temperature measurements analysis szczucińska and wasielewski 2013 zajíček et al 2011 these studies try to derive qualitative information on water flow in the subsurface especially in determining the origin of water feeding springs or water travel times the purpose of this work is to evaluate the hydrogeological information that can be extracted from spring temperature variations in a small catchment here the strengbach catchment located in eastern france and part of the french critical zone observatories network ozcar https www ozcar ri org for this purpose we have developed a coupled two dimensional unsaturated flow and heat transfer model simulating the seasonal temperature variability of four springs outcropping at the strengbach catchment 2 the strengbach water catchment the strengbach catchment is a small granitic entity located in the vosges mountains france referred to as the strengbach critical zone observatory czo also named observatoire hydrogéochimique de l environnement ohge https ohge unistra fr the catchment is one of the elementary sites of the french critical zone observatories network ozcar observatoire de la zone critique application et recherche critical zone observatories applications and research https www ozcar ri org it has been intensively investigated since the 1980 s meteorological hydrological and geochemical data have been recorded since 1986 for additional details see pierret et al 2014 2018 viville et al 2012 2017 the catchment covers an area of 0 8 km2 with an altitude between 880 and 1150 m above sea level slopes are approximately 15 of the north facing part and 9 of the south facing area the climate is mountainous oceanic with an annual mean temperature of 6 7 c and a mean rainfall of 1400 mm year with 15 to 20 falling as snow during 2 to 4 months per year the estimated mean evapotranspiration is approximately 600 mm year the mean

cividini et al 2010 lemarchand et al 2010 pierret et al 2014 prunier 2008 ranchoux et al 2021 schmitt et al 2003 and its concentration variations have been modeled via reactive transport simulations ackerer et al 2020 ackerer et al 2018 this site is equipped with a meteorological station located at an altitude of 1101 m it has continuously registered temperature humidity wind direction wind speed solar radiation and precipitation since 1986 the bedrock is a base poor hercynian granite fractured and hydrothermally overprinted el ghmari 1995 fichter et al 1998 with a small outcrop of gneiss in the summit of the northern part of the catchment a better knowledge of the structure and architecture of the bedrock has been obtained over the last few years from data issued from nine wells drilled at the site three of them cored and ranging over 10 to 100 m whole depth ackerer et al 2021 chabaux et al 2017 ranchoux 2020 ranchoux et al 2021 the granite is mainly composed of quartz 35 albite 31 k

weathering processes during the quaternary ackerer et al 2016 and the catchment is currently covered by a 0 5 to 1 0 m thick acidic and coarse in texture soil hyperdystrict cambisol wrb 2014 more details available in fichter et al 1998 prunier et al 2015 chabaux et al 2019 on the north facing slope the saprolite developed into the bedrock constitutes an aquifer ranging from 1 to 2 m depth on the catchment crests to more than 9 m in a saturated area near the strengbach stream ackerer et al 2020 weill et al 2019 the current study is focused on the four cs springs cs1 to 4 located in the southwestern part of the strengbach catchment fig 1 where the saprolite thickness increases along the hillslope from 1 to 2 m in the upper part to 9 10 m downstream ranchoux 2020 interpretation of magnetic resonance sounding mrs signals in the strengbach catchment boucher et al 2015 led to the subdivision of the catchment into 5 different hydrogeological units with contrasting water volume values these range from less than 0 25 m3 m2 for the area where the cs springs are located to 0 75 m3 m2 for the more downstream area formed by colluvium these contrasts in water retention capacity were confirmed by more recent gravimetric measurements chaffaut et al 2022 furthermore field observations based on the study of weathering profiles e g ackerer et al 2016 ackerer et al 2022 as well as boreholes performed on site e g ranchoux 2020 ranchoux et al 2021 led to propose that the subsurface aquifer on these slopes is composed of two layers with different porosities lesparre et al 2020 confirmed this scheme by validating a two layer hydrological model for the aquifer with mrs measurements in such a model the aquifer on the slope where the cs springs are located is about 4 m thick it is divided into an upper horizon soil 0 5 m thick with a porosity of 0 1 and a lower level saprolite 3 5 m thick with a porosity of 0 02 the more downstream colluvium zone can be up to 14 m thick with a 1 m thick soil layer with a porosity of 0 5 and a 13 m thick saprolite with a porosity of 0 03 for springs cs1 to cs4 water is collected by drains at the bottom of small excavated ditches then refilled and connected to independent pipelines the latter conduct water downstream into a single tank cr used for drinking water supply to the nearby village of aubure the drain in cs1 is the only one passing through the rock in situ at approximately 3 m depth capturing the water flowing between the fissures and fractures through a natural drainage the other three drains are placed in the soil compartment mainly composed of scree the drains collecting cs2 and cs4 are located at 4 m depth with a length of 17 m for cs2 and 3 m for cs4 the drain collecting cs3 is at 2 5 m depth with a length of 10 m drains are assumed to be mainly parallel to the soil surface water temperatures and flow rates are measured at each cs spring before discharge in the collector tank the spring water temperature was analyzed regularly approximately every 15 days from 2013 to 2017 while spring discharges have been measured with a similar frequency since 1988 3 first order analysis of the measured spring temperature for the strengbach catchment the only soil temperature measurements available were collected along a single soil profile at 5 cm 16 cm 42 cm and 71 cm depth in belfort et al 2018 the monitoring was carried out in the experimental spruce parcel located on the opposite slope of the cs springs fig 1 the measurements at 5 cm depth in the soil the daily air temperatures measured at the meteorological station and the spring water temperatures between september 2013 and january 2017 are reported in fig 2 air temperatures at the meteorological station follow seasonality with the warmest months e g temperatures over 20 c occurring in july and august and the coldest months corresponding to january and february where temperatures can reach values below 10 c soil temperatures display a seasonality similar to air temperatures but with lower amplitude when the air temperature reaches values below zero the difference between soil and air temperatures increases this may be due to the litter or snow covering the soil surface and or frozen soil which limit heat fluxes from air to soil spring water temperatures are also marked by seasonal variations but with an amplitude significantly smaller and a shift in time compared to air or soil temperatures specific to each spring fig 2 these shifts are of several weeks or months depending on the spring to estimate the phase shifts between the different temperature sets each data series was fitted to a sinusoidal function defined by an average temperature t0 an amplitude aω a frequency more precisely an angular velocity ω 2 π f with f the frequency and a phase shift φ as an angle equivalent to days of delay relative to the air temperature variations 1 t t t 0 a ω cos ω t φ where φ 0 for the air temperature an analysis by fourier series was applied to the temperature records in order to obtain the parameters explaining the amplitude shift and frequency of the harmonic representing the annual variations significant lower phase shifts have been estimated for the cs1 and cs3 springs 45 and 30 days respectively compared with cs2 110 days and cs4 80 days table 1 the cs1 and cs3 springs are also marked by a larger amplitude of temperature variations 1 1 c and 1 7 c respectively than cs2 0 4 c and cs4 0 8 c based on these data a positive trend between the temperature phase shifts and spring discharges can be assumed this trend might suggest a relationship between thermal and hydrologic transfers in the watershed even if the discharge intensity of the cs springs might have origins other than the sole hydrologic transfer intensity in the bedrock indeed flows measured at the outlet of the drains are also largely controlled by water collection facilities this includes the drain length which increases the drainage capacity see table 1 the drain depth especially close to the surface with drains probably collecting water from partly unsaturated areas this might explain the small flow extracted from cs3 despite the drain length see table 1 the permeability of the soil the aquifer housing cs1 fractured rock differs from the three other springs scree which might also explain the difference in flow rates 4 unsaturated flow and heat transfer modeling a deeper analysis of the information brought by temperature variations on soil transfer properties and or soil heterogeneity was carried out by relying upon a fully coupled physically based model simulating flow and heat transfer for the current study we use a model handling saturated and unsaturated flow conditions transient boundary conditions for both flow and heat transfer and accounting for soil heterogeneity we assume that the subsurface is a heterogeneous porous material the local effects of the vegetation are neglected for flow and heat transfer this is probably acceptable except for summer periods when root water uptake may locally modify flow and heat transfer conditions nevertheless the overall amount of water extracted by the vegetation is taken into account through evapotranspiration the water freezing is not handled by the model the water density and viscosity remain constant in view of the amplitude of temperature variations 10 c 4 1 unsaturated flow model flow in unsaturated porous materials such as non deformable soils is usually modeled using the richards equation richards 1931 given by 2 θ t s w

conductivity tensor l t and k r ψ is the relative hydraulic conductivity the model includes initial and boundary conditions of the prescribed pressure head dirichlet or prescribed flux neumann type we use the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 for the pressure head versus water content relationship defined by 3 s w ψ θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ η m ψ 0 1 ψ 0 where m 1 1 η s w is the effective water saturation θ r and θ s are the residual and saturated volumetric water content respectively and α l 1 and η are experimentally estimated coefficients the relation between the relative permeability and the water saturation of the aqueous phase is represented by the mualem model mualem 1976 4 k r s w s w 1 2 1 1 s w 1 m m 2 ψ 0 1 0 ψ 0 4 2 heat transfer mathematical model if an instantaneous thermal equilibrium between the fluid and soil is assumed and the variations in density and viscosity due to temperature variations are neglected the equation describing the heat transfer by conduction and convection through a porous media can be expressed as stallman 1960 5 ρ b c b t t λ b t q t 0 where ρ b is the density ml 3 c b l2t 2k 1 is the specific heat capacity of the porous plus fluid material t is the temperature k t is time t λ b is the thermal conductivity tensor of the porous medium mlt 3k 1 and q is the darcy flux lt 1 at the domain boundary it is possible to prescribe either the temperature dirichlet type boundary or the heat flux neumann type boundary initial temperature has to be defined over the whole domain the specific heat capacity of the porous plus fluid material is defined by campbell 1985 6 ρ b c b 1 θ s ρ s c s θ ρ w c w θ s θ ρ a c a where θ s is the saturated water content θ is the water content ρ φ is the density ml 3 and c φ l2t 2k 1 is the specific heat capacity of the phase φ with φ s standing for the solid φ w for water and φ a for air the contribution of air is neglected in the model due to its low density compared with water and solid phases the thermal conductivity is assumed to be the addition of mechanical dispersion and heat conduction hecht méndez et al 2010 7 λ b λ disp λ diff θ ρ w c w i where i is the identity matrix λ disp is the mechanical dispersion tensor l2t 1 and λ diff is the effective thermal conductivity coefficient mlt 3k 1 the mechanical dispersion λ disp is the consequence of velocity fluctuations around the mean

calculated as the arithmetic mean of the thermal conductivities of the different constituents solid material and water in saturated soils hoffmann et al 2019 klepikova et al 2016 sarris et al 2018 vandenbohede and lebbe 2010 wildemeersch et al 2014 for unsaturated flow conditions with air also filling the pores the above formulation overestimates the value of the effective thermal conductivity cho and kwon 2010 go et al 2016 stauffer et al 2013 therefore different models were proposed to evaluate the effective thermal conductivity in unsaturated soils those depend on two key parameters the water saturation and the thermal conductivity of solids e g reviews in go et al 2016 he et al 2020 różański and stefaniuk 2016 zhang and wang 2017 after having compared measurements and estimations of thermal conductivity from 15 different models zhang and wang 2017 proposed to keep as the most accurate models those developed by chen 2008 or by côté and konrad 2005 and modified by zhang et al 2017 likewise he et al 2020 on the basis of 16 previously published models recommended the use of the model by côté and konrad 2005 when the soil thermal conductivity in saturated conditions is known they also showed that the model of johansen 1977 could render satisfactory results if the quartz content in soil is known compared to the models of chen 2008 or zhang et al 2017 the model by côté and konrad 2005 has the advantage of being calibrated over a wider panel of geological materials a wider range of rock saturations and a larger range of temperatures for this reason the expression of côté and konrad 2005 is employed to estimate the thermal conductivity in soils as 9 λ diff λ w θ s λ s 1 θ s 10 η θ s x κ s 1 κ 1 s 10 η θ s x where s is saturation and θ s is the water content at saturation l3 l3 the empirical coefficient κ is equal to 4 6 for unfrozen gravel and coarse sand 6 55 for median and fine sand and 1 69 for silt and clay for crushed rocks and gravel x and η correspond to 1 70 and 1 80 respectively and for natural mineral soils 0 75 and 1 2 respectively in côté and konrad 2005 mixed finite elements are used to solve the flow equation and the diffusive part of the heat transfer equation while discontinuous finite elements solve the convective part of the heat transfer equation to avoid excessive numerical diffusion these numerical methods ensure mass and energy conservation in addition to handling complex diffusion and sharp convective fronts these numerical techniques are implemented in the code traces hoteit and ackerer 2004 used in this study 5 model site conception 5 1 model geometry and boundary conditions an optimal representation of the system should lead to a 3 d model at least at the scale of each spring sub catchment this option would require important computation capacities and data handling probably partly useless because the 3 d extension of each spring sub catchment is poorly known this feature inclined us to build 2 d models through the catchment as diverse representative cross sections the subsurface flow is assumed to follow the soil surface topography within cross sections located along the main streamline of the sub catchment area for each source fig 3 a these lines start at the strengbach catchment boundary and are extended downstream from the springs to avoid the eventual effects of inaccurate downstream boundary conditions fig 3b a representative cross section has been delineated as relevant for mimicking the 2 d flow collected by the four sources fig 3 the upper boundary is given by the soil surface the thickness of the section increases from upstream 2 m to downstream 9 m and the lateral boundaries are considered vertical fig 4 the boundary conditions for flow are of the impervious type null flux neumann boundaries at the upstream limit and the bottom of the aquifer a constant head value of 1 m of saturated thickness is prescribed for the vertical section downstream to assure the flow in the aquifer and as told earlier minimize the influence on flow and heat transfer at the spring s location a uniform flux is prescribed at the upper boundary soil surface of the domain this flux varies over time fig 5 a as the difference between precipitation measured at the meteorologic station and evapotranspiration it is worth noting that these fluxes at the surface defined at a daily time step were successfully used in the simulation of water transfer in soils by belfort et al 2018 where they estimated the evapotranspiration with a method based on the penman monteith model and using the software biljou https appgeodb nancy inra fr biljou granier et al 1999 as an initial condition a one meter saturated thickness is set up along the whole profile for heat transfer the upstream vertical boundary is set to a null flux boundary no heat input output for both convective and conductive dispersive fluxes the conductive flux is neglected at the downstream vertical boundary the daily time varying temperature fig 5b is prescribed at the soil surface and is assumed to be uniform over the whole boundary depending on the performed simulations we used as prescribed value either the temperature at equilibrium with the air temperature measured at the meteorological station or the soil temperature measured at the spruce plot at 5 cm depth fig 5b by belfort et al 2018 the bottom of the vertical section is located beneath the lower limit of the so called thermally active zone caissie et al 2014 the latter being the soils and rock surface horizons where the temperature profile over depth is influenced by atmospheric variations in these horizons the amplitude of temperature variations decreases with depth until reaching a level of constant temperature over time taniguchi 1993 both types of boundary conditions prescribed temperature or flux could be applied at the bottom of the cross section both numerical values are unknown but can be estimated a prescribed temperature can be estimated by analyzing the sink water temperature as a first estimation a prescribed flux could also be evaluated considering a geothermal heat gradient estimated at 0 043 c m in the vosges mountains danis and royer 1985 this geothermal gradient has been estimated at a global scale and may significantly vary locally therefore a prescribed temperature seems a better option with estimates as the available local measurements as the initial thermal condition a uniform temperature of 8 c is imposed on the soil profile 5 2 model parameters numerous parameters are involved in the flow and heat transfer models to account for the unsaturated flow conditions over part of the vertical sections however it is possible to define a realistic range for almost every required parameter thanks to the numerous field and modeling works carried out over the catchment for the flow model based on the hydrological study of the strengbach catchment by weill et al 2019 the saturated water content varies between 0 1 and 0 5 for the saturated hydraulic conductivity a mean value of 8 0 10 5 m s has been used for the strengbach aquifer at the catchment scale pierret et al 2018 the spatial distribution of this parameter was proposed by beaulieu et al 2016 by calibrating the hydrological data of a two layer aquifer model a permeable surface layer and a less permeable deeper layer for the sub catchment drained by the cs springs the calibration renders a saturated hydraulic conductivity extending from 1 0 10 5 m s to 6 5 10 5 m s for the upper layer of the aquifer and from 0 10 10 5 m s to 1 0 10 5 m s for the deeper layer greater than 10 m other studies over the same catchment estimated that hydraulic conductivities were in the range 0 1 10 5 m s to 10 0 10 5 m s either assuming a saturated hydraulic conductivity uniform over the catchment lesparre et al 2020 or heterogeneous values within multilayer configurations weill et al 2017 for the current study the tested saturated hydraulic conductivities were taken between 10 7 m s and 10 4 m s the parameters of the van genuchten model are fixed for all the cases and do not play an important role in the modeling of subsurface flow at the strengbach catchment lesparre et al 2020 table 2 summarizes the parameter set for the heat transfer model the values of the thermal dispersivity are assumed to be that of solute dispersivity with values close to or up to 0 1 m at this scale e g hatch et al 2006 stonestrom and constantz 2003 vandenbohede et al 2011 some authors considered that thermal dispersion is negligible compared with the conduction or the convection in heat transfer hopmans et al 2002 irvine et al 2017 for rau et al 2012 mechanical dispersion can be neglected for highly conduction dominated heat fluxes by the thermal dispersivity based on the darcy flow velocity preliminary simulations also showed that mechanical dispersion could be neglected in our context therefore the thermal longitudinal dispersivity λ l is set a priori to 0 10 m the transverse 10 times smaller the thermal conductivity value of the solid phase can be calculated from the thermal conductivity of the individual minerals constituting the host rock for that the mineralogical composition of the str13 samples collected along a weathered profile at the summit of the catchment was used data in ackerer et al 2016 these samples are marked by a high quartz content between 32 and 48 followed by k feldspar plagioclase biotite and muscovite using the thermal conductivity of the individual minerals horai and simmons 1969 the proportion of the minerals and an arithmetic average różański and stefaniuk 2016 the thermal conductivity of the solid in the soil profile ranged from 3 5 to 4 3 w m k with an average value of 3 8 w m k therefore a range of solid thermal conductivity from 3 5 to 4 5 w m k is kept here for the modeling exercises likewise the volumetric heat capacity of the solid was determined through the specific heat and density of the minerals composing the soil stauffer et al 2013 and through a volume weighted sum of heat capacities of the minerals stonestrom and constantz 2003 the resulting volumetric heat capacity of the solid shows a very weak variation from 1 9 106 j m3 k to 2 0 106 j m3 k for the same soil profile a variation range between 1 9 106 j m3 k and 2 5 106 j m3 k has been retained for taking into account the high content of organic matter of some soil layers as organic matter is characterized by higher volumetric heat capacity 2 5 106 j m3 k stonestrom and constantz 2003 the thermal parameters in the subsurface are summarized in table 2 6 modeling results and discussion given the relatively high number of parameters involved in the modeling we conducted a local sensitivity analysis as a first test to better define the variables of interest for the simulation of measured temperature in the spring waters of the strengbach catchment then a simulation of observed temperatures is carried out for the springs cs fig 6 6 1 sensitivity analysis results for the sensitivity analysis the modeled aquifer is considered homogeneous petrological and hydrological characteristics have been given in previous modeling studies ackerer et al 2016 lesparre et al 2020 ranchoux et al 2021 weill et al 2019 the hydrological parameters are given in table 2 column reference value the volumetric heat capacity and the thermal conductivity were set to 1 9x106 j m3 k and 3 5 w m k respectively the boundary conditions for flow at the top of the sections correspond to the precipitation measured at the meteorological station a constant temperature of 7 c is applied at the bottom of the section fig 7 displays the results of temperature simulations from june 2015 to april 2016 the main temperature variations occur in the first two meters of soil with temperatures ranging from 4 c to 24 c the isotherms are parallel to the upper surface of the aquifer such temperature variations are expected when heat transfer occurs mainly in a direction perpendicular to the surface rather than in the flow direction this suggests a preponderance of vertical conduction over lateral convective heat transfer in the system this is also the case with the depth variation of temperature over a hydrological cycle fig 8 the observed dampening and retardation of the input forcing term the temperature at the soil surface is also that of a purely diffusive process the minor contribution of the convection in heat transfer is confirmed by an additional set of simulations where the water flux at the inflow top of the section has been increased from 1100 mm year the measured precipitation on the site to 2200 mm year for both simulations temperature variations show very little differences fig 9 the minor contribution of convection due to water flow also explains the almost uniform temperatures simulated along the drains collecting the springs the most important difference obtained for a drain of 10 m cs3 between the two ends is less than 1 c for the different simulations performed fig 10 altogether the above observations especially the lack of any significant differences between simulated temperature for large variations in water recharge as well as the constancy of temperature along a water flow path imply that the main heat transfer process is related to conduction heat transfer simulation does not require precise knowledge of the infiltration rates at the soil surface heat transfer is not sensitive to water velocity that is to the hydraulic conductivity in the domain the temperature in the vicinity of the spring drains is constant therefore the water temperature inside one drain is constant these simulations also show a clear attenuation of temperature variations with depth in the aquifer with temperatures which tend to vary around the prescribed temperature at the bottom of the section 7 c effects of thermal boundary conditions in the above simulations the surface temperature is calculated from the atmospheric temperature measured at the meteorological station of the catchment this choice neglects the thermal protection effect induced by the snow or ice cover in winter or the litter and its biological activity the comparison of atmospheric temperatures with soil temperatures shows a systematic bias especially in winter with soil temperatures systematically higher and above zero c to evaluate the possible impact of these differences on the simulated temperature along the vertical sections a simulation was run using the soil temperature measured at 5 cm depth by belfort et al 2018 as the surface temperature fig 11 the results show a significant difference compared with calculations relying upon the atmospheric temperature at the surface especially for low temperature values with differences becoming more pronounced in the subsurface the closer the locations are to the soil surface therefore the temperatures measured in the soils are assumed to be the appropriate boundary condition at the surface to simulate spring water temperatures even if these soil temperatures were measured in another subarea of the catchment than that of springs with different climatic characteristics such as radiation soil type or vegetation cover however we consider these to be of secondary importance compared to neglecting the thermal protection effects due to snow cover and litter effects of the temperature value at the bottom boundary the effect of the temperature prescribed at the bottom of the section on the simulation results is evaluated by performing a simulation with a temperature of 6 c instead of 7 c the modification in the prescribed temperature generates a vertical translation of the temperature values which increases with depth fig 12 in general a bottom temperature of 6 c results in lower temperatures in soils than 7 c while a few features such as the amplitude of the thermal variations or the delay in pics propagation remain unchanged hence the temperature at the bottom of the section determines the temperature around which the thermal response varies especially in deeper layers additional simulations were performed by changing the thickness of the aquifer they highlight the damping effects associated with the bottom boundary if the aquifer thickness is small the amplitude of temperature variations is very limited at a given depth on the opposite for the same depth the amplitude increases with the thickness of the cross section effects of saturated water content the impact of the different model parameters on the thermal response of the aquifer is evaluated by performing simulations where the different parameters are modified independently from one another in the variation range defined in 5 2 simulation results show that parameters such as hydraulic conductivity dispersivity and thermal conductivity of solids have no significant impact on the simulated temperatures fig 13 heat capacity and conductivity of the soil depend on effective and saturated water content thermal variations and retardation of heat fluctuations associated with boundary conditions at the surface impact the temperature of the subsurface increasing the saturated water content renders an overall solid plus fluid lower thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity results from the sensitivity analysis will be used in simulating the temperature measured in the different springs these results are heat transfer is mainly associated with conduction not fluid convection therefore the boundary for flow groundwater recharge does not require an accurate estimation as is the case for hydraulic conductivity the saturated water content is a sensitive parameter because it affects the soil solid plus water heat capacity through retardation of the forcing and the soil heat diffusivity the temperature at the soil surface should account for the sheltering effects of snow ice and or litter the temperature measured at 5 cm depth in the soil is better suited to temperature simulations in spring waters the temperature profile in the soil is conditioned by the soil thickness and the temperature prescribed at the bottom of the section more precisely the soil thickness affects the temperature variations over time at a local given depth whereas the prescribed value at the bottom affects the average temperature at a given depth finally the length of the drains collecting spring waters does not significantly modify the temperature at the drain outlets 6 2 spring temperature simulations and hydrogeological implications 6 2 1 adaptation of the modeling scheme and parameters the sensitivity analysis was conducted with conditions of simulations very close to that prevailing in the field however the structure of the modeled aquifer domain was assumed homogeneous throughout its thickness actually the aquifer structure at the strengbach catchment might be more complex because the regolith is subdivided into at least two superimposed layers an upper porous layer formed by a granitic arena on which the soil is developed and a deeper layer of compact granitic saprolite corresponding to a more or less fractured bedrock level marked by a lower porosity ackerer et al 2020 chabaux et al 2017 el ghmari 1995 fichter et al 1998 lesparre et al 2020 ranchoux 2020 weill et al 2019 accounting for this vertical heterogeneity should at least separate the aquifer into two superimposed horizons however an additional complexity must also be considered the cs springs are collected before their emergence at the surface as mentioned in section 2 only the cs1 spring is collected from a saprolite in place with little disturbance the other three springs are collected by drains placed in a trench covered by scree and then secondarily vegetated the lithological nature of the scree is not well known and might be a mix of granitic blocks and loose materials from granitic soils and sands for these springs the aquifer at the level of spring water collection should be better represented by a single layer medium rather than by a two layered system to account for these specific anthropogenic setups the temperature variations were modeled along two designs corresponding to a single layer model and a two layer model in the two layer model the upper part represents the sand saprolite horizon while the lower horizon corresponds to the compact saprolite level the sensitivity analysis showed that the variations of density specific heat capacity and volumetric heat capacity for the solid particles were of little impact on the simulations for variations of less than 15 of clay minerals mixed with a granitic material maximum proportion in the soil levels of the strengbach catchment for the two layers we chose parameter values corresponding to a granitic material namely a density of 2650 kg m3 a specific heat capacity of 731 5 j kg k and a thermal conductivity of 3 5 w m k the two layers are thus considered to be composed of the same type of material but with different saturated water content which is a parameter to be calibrated this was done by varying its value from 0 1 to 0 5 in addition considering the uncertainty related to the boundary between these two layers several scenarios varying each layer thickness as well as the depth of the thermal boundary were assessed for each spring collector the simulations were performed considering upper layers thicknesses of 0 20 50 80 and 100 of the cross section thickness the one layer model was then easily built from the two layer system by using the parameters of the granitic material and testing a uniform saturated water content between 0 1 and 0 5 for the whole cross section the soil organic carbon has not been taken into account in the sensitivity analysis carried out in section 6 1 yet it may affect the heat transfer in the soil by decreasing the effective thermal conductivity chen et al 2012 dai et al 2019 he et al 2021 zhao and si 2019 the soil and saprolite horizons at the strengbach catchment contain between 5 and 20 organic carbon in the first 20 cm below the surface e g aubert 2001 gangloff et al 2014 the influence of the organic carbon content on the spring temperature simulations has been tested for both the single and two layer models by modifying the density specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity in the layers those parameters were recalculated assuming that their values varied proportionally to the organic carbon content of the layer see table 2 for the values used for organic matter in the two layer model only the surface horizon was considered to contain organic matter the proportions of organic matter tested are 10 20 50 and the extreme case of 100 for each source several simulations have been performed in different configurations single vs two layer models with or without organic matter the most relevant results are summarized below the complete set of simulations can be found in the supplementary data in addition for all simulations a warm up period of two years is applied to avoid the potential effects of flawed initial conditions only the results from 2015 and 2016 are discussed and interpreted the sensitivity analysis also shows that a modification of the prescribed temperature at the bottom of the aquifer resulted in a constant shift in temperature values over the whole period of simulation to avoid misinterpretations associated with diverse bottom boundary conditions the temperatures have been recast as their relative value that is the ratio of the effective temperature to the mean temperatures over a period of two years considering the relatively small amount of data one temperature record every 8 to 15 days the quality of the simulations was checked graphically figs 14 17 and supplementary data analyzing i the amplitude of the thermal variations maximum and minimum temperatures ii the phase shift between measurements and simulations correspondence of the peaks and lows in the temperature versus arrival time and iii the trends of the temperature variations similar slopes for increasing decreasing temperature the qualitive evaluation has been preferred to quantitative performance based on metrics such as quadrature differences between measured and computed values because for relatively small data sets usual metrics give too much importance to outliers moreover some discrepancies between simulations and measurements are difficult to detect with usual metrics such as time shift or trends 6 2 2 cs1 and cs3 spring simulations the cs1 and cs3 springs are collected at depths of 3 m and 2 5 m respectively this is close to the limit between the granitic arena and fractured bedrock estimated in this area at approximately 2 2 5 m depth ackerer 2017 ackerer et al 2016 ranchoux 2020 the observed temperature variations are quite easily modeled for the two sources with both the two layer and the one layer models the optimal simulations with the one layer model are obtained by locating the basal thermal boundary between 3 5 and 4 1 m depth for both sources however the simulations impose high values of saturated water content θs 0 3 0 5 lower values of saturated water content render simulations a few days ahead compared to measurements the introduction of 10 or 20 of organic carbon into the layers generates a slight attenuation of the simulated temperatures slightly delayed curves and a better fit of measurements while keeping high water content θs 0 5 high porosity values saturated water content are conceivable in the shallow horizons of the strengbach regolith but keeping those at nearly 4 m depth beneath the surface can be questioned in view of field data ackerer et al 2016 ackerer 2017 simulations with lower and probably more realistic porosity values are obtained in the two layer model fig 14 the key parameters for correctly fitting the data are the maximum porosity of the two layers and the depth of thermal invariance organic carbon content in the upper layer is secondary and must be considered an adjustment factor for the quality of the simulations for the cs1 and cs3 springs very good simulations are obtained with θs 0 3 in the upper horizon and 0 1 in the lower one for a basal thermal invariance at 4 m depth with or without a maximum organic carbon concentration of 10 20 in the upper layer the simulation quality does not really depend on the relative thickness of the upper layer compared to the lower one some simulations of similar quality are obtained either with an upper layer as 80 of the whole aquifer thickness or only 20 fig 15 however if the geometrical configuration of the system is a single layer with a porosity of 0 1 the simulations cannot correctly fit the data this feature highlights how the type of horizon exposed to the surface boundary conditions impacts the system by delaying the thermal signal propagated in the subsurface regardless of this point and irrespective of the aquifer model used one vs two layer models the temperature variations in the strengbach springs are controlled by a thermal diffusion process and not by advection an important consequence is that the observed attenuations and phase shifts between spring and atmospheric or litter temperature variations do not inform hydrological characteristics such as mean water velocity or water residence time the second consequence for this type of hydrological system is that the zone of air temperature influence in the subsurface is decoupled from the water circulation zone this could lead to defining a thermal critical zone separated from the active hydrological zone temperature simulations in cs1 and cs3 also confirm that their variations only depend on a few hydrological parameters two sensitive parameters are the depth of the thermal invariance zone and its temperature value at 4 m depth and 7 c for cs1 and cs3 another key parameter impacting the simulation is the average maximum porosity value saturated water content of the aquifer layers for its part the organic carbon content in the soil layers is of secondary importance for simulating the cs1 and cs3 temperatures 6 2 3 cs2 and cs4 simulations compared to the cs1 and cs3 springs the cs2 and cs4 springs are located at slightly lower elevations fig 1 and the water collection in the bedrock is slightly deeper 4 m compared with 3 m for cs1 and 2 5 m for cs3 this deeper location certainly explains the smaller annual variation ranges of temperatures at cs2 and cs4 0 4 c than at cs1 and cs3 sources 2 c for the cs2 and cs4 springs the amplitude of the thermal variations and the gradient of the increasing decreasing temperature periods can be well simulated irrespective of the selected simulation model one layer vs two layers it is worth noting that the two layer model renders valuable results for a large set of geometrical configurations regarding the proportion occupied by the upper layer within the whole thickness of the aquifer also observed for cs1 and cs3 see above again the quality of the simulations mainly depends on the uniform constant over time temperature value at the bottom of the sections in a scenario considering a granitic material without organic carbon the best simulations are obtained for a temperature invariance level slightly deeper for cs2 and cs4 4 6 5 1 m than for cs1 and cs3 4 4 5 m but in those calculations the simulated signal is systematically in advance of at least 2 weeks in the best simulations of cs4 fig 16 and 4 weeks for cs2 fig 17 correct simulations of temperature phase shifts in the cs2 and cs4 springs impose an integration of organic carbon in the system which induces a greater attenuation of the temperature signal while delaying it with the one layer model the best fits of cs4 data are obtained for an organic matter content of 20 a thermal invariance level at 5 1 m depth and a maximum porosity of 0 5 organic carbon content of 20 or more is observed in the surface soil horizons at the strengbach catchment but not in the deeper horizons and probably not in the regolith at 4 5 m depth this obviously renders the simulation results hardly consistent with expectations for the strengbach case it is even worse with cs2 for which satisfactory modeling of the temperature shift imposes 80 to 100 organic carbon in the whole aquifer the use of a two layer model beyond allowing for prescribing more realistic porosity parameters 0 3 and 0 1 in the upper and lower layers respectively also reduces the thickness of the layer containing organic matter however the simulation results remain difficult to reconcile with the organic carbon content measured in the field the two layers model still requires high organic carbon content in the upper layer of the model for example with a thermal invariance depth of 5 2 m the correct simulation of cs4 data is obtained with an upper layer containing 50 organic carbon and representing 50 to 80 of the total thickness of the aquifer it is necessary to increase the organic carbon content of the upper layer and deepen the thermal invariance zone to compensate for the signal attenuation and maintain good fits of the data with a smaller vertical extension of the upper layer indeed the higher the organic carbon content of the upper layer the more delayed the temperature signal is at a given depth and the more it is attenuated thus for cs4 a 100 organic carbon layer with a vertical extension of 10 20 can be used to account for the data if the thermal invariance depth is lowered to 5 7 m depth these simulations seem to be more realistic in terms of soil extension even though layers concealing organic matter at the strengbach catchment still have a small vertical extension of a few centimeters at most for cs2 the simulated results are unrealistic since a correct signal is only obtained with a top layer of pure organic carbon over at least 50 of the total vertical extension of the system ackerer et al 2020 used the nihm hydrological model that feeds the cs1 and cs3 springs with relatively parallel flow lines they showed that while cs2 and cs4 would be fed by two different groups of flow lines one draining the northern slope the other the southern slope each group was characterized by specific hydrological parameters with two distinct water flow paths supplying cs2 and cs4 it is logical that the present modeling exercise handling a single flow path may encounter difficulties in reproducing the observations at cs2 and cs4 the construction of a 3d model which is beyond the scope of this work would certainly be necessary nevertheless despite the difficulty of reproducing cs2 and cs4 data all our simulations confirm that the observed temperature variations in the spring waters of the strengbach basin cannot constrain flow features of the subsurface such as water velocities and water residence time in contrast with studies developed on karstic aquifers covington et al 2011 lismonde 2010 tamburini and menichetti 2019 where the flow through conducts allow a better conservation of the inlet thermal signal this assertion relies upon the incapability to reproduce temperature signal attenuations and phase shifts in subsurface waters that would render subsurface flow transforming inlet carried by atmospheric surface waters this implies that the correlation between temperature phase shift and spring discharge which the data might indicate is incidental and cannot be used to justify control of heat transfer by hydrological advection dominated processes that being said and certainly more important the simulation results clearly indicate that the temperature variations of cs springs strongly depend on the average porosity values of the aquifer be it modeled as a single or a two layer system porosity or the separation of the aquifer in diverse layers is poorly documented by available data mainly targeting the first meter of depth in the system the study of temperature variations in spring waters and their modeling could thus become a way to constrain the spatial variability of porosity as well as the geometrical settings of the aquifer number of layers overall depth of the hydrologically active compartment in that sense monitoring subsurface temperature of shallow aquifers would probably help in conducting hydrological studies in small water catchments 7 conclusion the coupled thermo hydrological model developed in this study to interpret the seasonal temperature variations of the strengbach spring waters renders information on the origin of mainly phase shifts and attenuations transforming the inlet signal brought by atmospheric or very shallow soil waters 1 heat transfer is due to heat conduction and not significantly to water motion in soil therefore related parameters such as water fluxes at the soil surface convective travel times or hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer cannot not be estimated through the study of water temperature variations 2 heat transfer by conduction is associated with the diffusivity tensor and heat gradients diffusivity related to mechanical dispersion local heterogeneity of water velocities can be neglected therefore the diffusivity tensor mainly depends on the type of soil material and the water content in addition the propagation of the heat wave also depends on the heat soil capacity the storage of heat energy also related to the static properties of the different materials and water content 3 water temperature variations at different soil depths are conditioned by the forcing term at the soil surface here measured temperatures 5 cm below the topographic surface and the dampening effect related to the diffusive process and the boundary conditions prescribed at the bottom of the aquifer this boundary condition is all the more influential when the aquifer is thin and shallow as is the case in the present study 4 the results are representative of a shallow aquifer modelled as a porous material other systems such as karstic complexes or flow in fractures would require different approaches in the model modeling seasonal temperature variations of spring waters in a catchment such as the strengbach czo might therefore become in the future a way to constrain the saturated water content porosity of the aquifer conclusions grounded in the application of a 2 d hydrological thermal model as developed in this study are sufficient for the analysis of the upstream cs springs marked by a relatively simple flow line geometry the study of the more downstream springs cs2 cs4 fed by a more complex flow lines network geometry would probably require the services of 3 d investigations credit authorship contribution statement daniel s moreno martin investigation conceptualization methodology software writing

2077,the saturation excess mechanism infiltration excess mechanism and subsurface stormflow mechanism are the fundamental of the hybrid runoff generation models existing hybrid runoff generation methods pay much attention to the surface runoff and subsurface runoff but less to the characterization of subsurface stormflow additionally the subsurface stormflow was mostly separated from the saturated excess this kind of separation ignores subsurface stormflow in unsaturated areas and therefore may result in significant errors sometimes therefore a novel conceptual method for subsurface stormflow in unsaturated areas over the interface was proposed through a combination of the green ampt equation with the parabolic infiltration capacity distribution curve then the subsurface stormflow was considered as the sum of the infiltration excess over the unsaturated areas and the saturation excess over the saturated areas on this basis an improved flexible runoff generation strategy was developed to incorporate the spatial heterogeneity of underlying surface conditions and rainfall conditions based on the three single runoff generation mechanisms finally the xun river basin was selected as a case study performances of different runoff generation strategies were compared and discussed based on flood events and continues flow and the sensitivity analysis of the parameters was carried out results show that the proposed strategy performed the best among the five strategies and the accuracy of the simulation results was affected significantly by the infiltration excess subsurface stormflow over the unsaturated areas the proposed method can be used for the watersheds where there may be abundant subsurface stormflow keywords hybrid runoff generation flexible model subsurface stormflow excess rainfall hydrological modelling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the process of runoff generation is the redistribution of rainfall through the soils three well known mechanisms i e dunne flow horton flow and subsurface stormflow also known as interflow have been developed to describe the process of runoff generation tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 surface flow subsurface flow and subsurface stormflow are the three most dominant components contributing to the runoff generation process li and sivapalan 2014 surface flow is recharged from rainfall excess while subsurface stormflow and subsurface flow are replenished from the infiltrated water in the soils due to the spatial heterogeneity of underlying surface conditions e g land cover topography antecedent soil moisture and soil properties and rainfall intensity characteristics huang et al 2016a huang et al 2016b shen et al 2020 although numerous hydrological models have been developed for simulating the hydrological processes there are still opportunities remaining for improvement in terms of characterizing the rainfall runoff response clark et al 2015 the runoff generation method which describes the rainfall runoff response provides a potential solution about this issue semenova and beven 2015 shen et al 2020 the dunne flow horton flow and subsurface stormflow occurred in different conditions shen et al 2020 for the dunne flow surface saturation occurs because of a rising water table and ponding and surface flow occur at a time when there is no further soil moisture storage available the dunne flow is more common to happen at near channel areas and sometimes in the arid zones with long storms duration li and sivapalan 2014 the horton flow occurs when the precipitation rate exceeds the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the surface soil ross et al 2019 and there are two necessary conditions for the generation of surface flow by the horton mechanism first the rainfall rate is greater than the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil and second the rainfall duration is longer than the required ponding time for a given initial moisture profile the horton flow is more inclined to generate from partial areas of the hillslope where surface hydraulic conductivities are the lowest in addition the subsurface stormflow is a runoff producing mechanism operating in most upland terrains subsurface stormflow occurs when water moves laterally down a hillslope through soil layers or permeable bedrock to contribute to the storm hydrograph in a river weiler et al 2006 because there may exist a steep hydraulic gradient either on account of the slope of the hillslope or the build up of groundwater mounds on shallow slopes under such conditions the watershed or hillslope response to rainfall may be dominated by subsurface stormflows involving both saturated and unsaturated flows singh 2001 currently a hybrid runoff generation process pattern formed by more than one mechanism can often be identified in semi humid semi arid and mountain watershed because of the heterogeneity of underlying surface conditions and meteorological factors hu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 there are three characteristics for floods in the hybrid runoff generation area 1 high intensity and short duration 2 high local sensitivity and spatial temporal variability 3 close correlation with the topographic features especially in mountainous areas wang et al 2022 runoff generated by the combination of the various single mechanisms in semi humid and semi arid areas as well as mountain watershed is known as the hybrid runoff liu et al 2020 which enables the rapid occurrence of floods and makes hydrological forecast more challenging to solve the limitations of single runoff mechanism models with conceptualized hybrid runoff generation mechanism attracted much attention many conceptual mixed runoff generation models such as the vertically mixed runoff generation model the xaj green ampt model and so on have been developed bao and wang 1997 li et al 2005 huang et al 2016b shen et al 2020 bao and wang 1997 developed a vertically mixed runoff generation model combining the mechanism of the runoff formation in excess of infiltration at soil surface and the mechanism of the runoff formation on repletion of storage at subsurface the vertically mixed runoff has been shown to perform well for semi humid catchments li et al 2005 proposed a xaj green ampt model in which the runoff generating from infiltration excess was added to improve the xaj model for semi arid and semi humid basins results showed that the xaj green ampt model could forecast discharge with higher accuracy huang et al 2016b constructed a spatial combination modeling framework of saturation excess and infiltration excess runoff for semi humid watersheds and the framework performed well shen et al 2020 integrated a hybrid runoff generation mechanism into variable infiltration capacity model to facilitate hydrological simulations the current hybrid runoff models are constructed in the light of the vertical combination of saturation excess module and infiltration excess module or constructed in the light of the spatial combination of saturation excess module and infiltration excess module however the existing hybrid runoff generation method coupled only one or two single generation mechanisms to simulate the process of runoff generation in hydrological models more authentically all of these three mechanisms including saturation excess runoff infiltration excess runoff as well as subsurface stormflow should simultaneously characterize the runoff generating process rather than one or two of them hrachowitz and clark 2017 baroni et al 2019 shen et al 2020 the approach of flexible modeling strategies provides a potential solution to the issues of hybrid runoff simulation studies of hydrological modeling have progressed recently toward the development and application of flexible models which allows selection of alternative representations of runoff processes and different combinations of runoff generation components clark et al 2011 staudinger et al 2011 fenicia et al 2016 huang et al 2016a huang et al 2016b wang et al 2018 liu et al 2020 however existing flexible hybrid runoff generation methods pay much attention to the surface runoff and subsurface runoff but less to the characterization of subsurface stormflow subsurface stormflow is ubiquitous especially in steep and humid catchments subsurface stormflow models mainly include the following types darcy richards model kinematic wave model dual porosity model two phase model stochastic model and so on hu and li 2019 methods range from detailed physically based approaches including the darcy richards model beven and germann 2013 the kinematic wave model flügel and smith 1998 and dual porosity model shao et al 2014 to less complex conceptual models such as the two phase model hosang 1993 the darcy richards model is based on the continuum principle of soil water movement and darcy s law the darcy richards model has a high precision however it is difficult to predict and forecast the flood of rainstorms due to the complexity of the solution process sloan and moore 1984 the dual porosity model shao et al 2014 is also known a kind of two pore domain model which assumes that the soil consists of two domains one representing the soil matrix and the other one representing the macropores in the soil the two pore domain model provided a better description of the observed event than a traditional one pore domain model laine kaulio et al 2014 but its shortcoming is the same as that of the darcy richards model subsequently some more efficient methods such as the kinematic wave theory stochastic model and two phase model have been developed to simulate the subsurface stormflow the stochastic model uses the stochastic mathematical method to describe the transport of preferential flow because macropores are randomly distributed in the soil the stochastic model can be used to better describe the transport of water and solutes in the soils with macropores the stochastic models are however restricted by several simplifying assumptions regarding the statistics and the structure of the formation heterogeneity the local flow regime the local unsaturated conductivity russo 2003 furthermore the stochastic models are often restricted to steady state flow and thus they may not be applicable to practical situations in which water flow is considerably affected by time dependent processes like rain and evapotranspiration russo et al 1998 the kinematic wave theory was first discussed by lighthill and whitham 1955 which has been widely applied to a variety of hydrological processes including the subsurface stormflow however the applicability of the kinematic wave model was considered by singh 2002 to have some limits the kinematic wave model in the simulation of subsurface stormflow was highly dependent on the rate of recharge soil hydraulic conductivity slope angle and the thickness of saturated zone which made it only apply to steep slopes additionally the two phase model was first discussed by hosang 1993 the model divides the generation of preferential flow into two stages the first phase represents times of redistribution and low infiltration which does not generate preferential flow times of heavy infiltration inducing preferential flow are handled by the second phase the richards equation is applied to both phases as the governing flow equation and preferential flow is allowed by increasing the hydraulic conductivity of the soil during the second phase the two phase model is simple and easy to understand but there are a number of parameters in this model although these approaches are useful modelling techniques for capturing subsurface stormflow they are difficult to be coupled into the flexible hydrological model due to the inherent complexity the conceptual models do not require detailed process knowledge but we make the claim that for the development of process based hydrological models a good understanding of the generation of subsurface stormflow and the incorporation of process knowledge is essential chifflard et al 2019 hydrologists have found that the subsurface topography is distinctly different from surficial topography and the subsurface topography exerts a considerable influence on the local hydrological gradients and therefore the dominant flow path directions freer et al 1997 haga et al 2005 du et al 2016 this realization led to new concepts of subsurface stormflow generation via filling and spilling of depressions created by subsurface topography spence and woo 2003 some researchers have tried to address this issue by assuming an interface between the upper soil and the lower soil according to huang et al 2016a the soil profile was divided into the upper and lower layers and the subsurface stormflow in their model was generated between the upper and the lower soil layer the subsurface stormflow was calculated through a combination of the modified horton equation with the parabolic infiltration capacity distribution curve however they assumed that the upper soil has no surface runoff and the performance is poor they concluded that in semi arid catchments a suitable model need include at least one nonlinear component to simulate the main process of surface runoff generation to this end the surface runoff was considered using an infiltration excess method in this study referring bao and wang 1997 and the subsurface stormflow and subsurface flow were generated from the infiltrated water in the soils additionally in traditional flexible models the subsurface stormflow was separated from the saturated excess runoff this kind of separation ignores subsurface stormflow in unsaturated areas and therefore may result in significant errors sometimes most studies shown that subsurface stormflow is a saturated or near saturated water flow phenomenon while some studies have documented subsurface stormflow as unsaturated flow in the unsaturated zone beven 1982 singh 2001 weiler et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2020 however the necessary conditions for unsaturated subsurface stormflow in hillslopes still have not been clearly identified many hydrologists dealt with infiltration into unsaturated sloping soils and attributed lateral flow to either macroscopic or microscopic anisotropy in the soil hydraulic conductivity mccord et al 1991 torres et al 1998 sinai and dirksen 2006 in contrast sinai and dirksen 2006 suggested that the necessary condition for lateral downslope flow is decreasing rain intensity rather than the no flow boundary condition anisotropy or layering more recently some have suggested that subsurface stormflow in semiarid settings may be underestimated and should be investigated in more detail and at more locations wilcox et al 2008 lv et al 2013 explored the necessary conditions for the occurrence of lateral downslope flow in the unsaturated zone and the effects of different slope angles on soil moisture movement therefore it is still a great challenge to simulate subsurface stormflow in unsaturated areas the objective of this study was therefore to propose a flexible runoff generation strategy and focus on runoff generation mechanisms for both continuous flow and flood events especially for the subsurface stormflow generation the main contributions of the present study are given as follows first a novel conceptual method for subsurface stormflow in unsaturated areas over interface was proposed through a combination of the green ampt equation with the parabolic infiltration capacity distribution curve the subsurface stormflow is the sum of the infiltration excess over the unsaturated areas and the saturation excess over the saturated areas second saturation excess mechanism infiltration excess mechanism as well as subsurface stormflow mechanism were used and combined to form various runoff generation strategies third a flexible runoff generation strategy was developed to incorporate the spatial heterogeneity of underlying surface conditions and rainfall conditions the performances of different runoff generation strategies were compared based on flood events and continues flow sensitivity analysis of the parameters was carried out finally the xun river basin in the shaanxi province china was selected as a case study 2 hydrological models 2 1 determination of dominant runoff generation type dominant runoff generation type is influenced by a variety of meteorological and underlying surface factors that interact with each other it is reasonable to assume that a flow event is dominated by saturation excess runoff or infiltration excess runoff otherwise it is hybrid runoff the curve number cn given by eq 1 is the only parameter of the scs cn model williams and laseur 1976 which characterizes the tendency of infiltration excess runoff generation determined by soil type land use type and initial condition without calibration cn ranges from 0 to 100 with a smaller curve number representing low runoff potential and a higher curve number representing high runoff potential a large cn value shows a small infiltration capacity of land surface where infiltration excess runoff is likely to occur similarly a small cn value indicates a large infiltration capacity where infiltration excess runoff is unlikely to occur huang et al 2016b the dominant runoff generation type may vary differently in different flood events due to the various initial condition of each flood event to understand the applicability of the flexible runoff generation models in the study area it is necessary to identify the dominant runoff generation mechanism of each flood event in details 1 cn 25400 s 254 where s mm represents the potential maximum retention depends on the antecedent soil moisture condition in the catchment cn varies from zero to 100 a cn value of 100 represents a condition of zero potential retention i e an impervious catchment and cn 0 represents an infinitely abstracting catchment with s runoff coefficient c given by eq 2 is a dimensionless coefficient relating the amount of runoff to the amount of precipitation received it represents the integrated effect of catchment losses and hence depends upon climate antecedent soil moisture land surface slope and so on goel 2011 c ranges from 0 to 1 and seems to be large in humid areas where saturation excess runoff is likely to occur similarly c seems to be small in arid areas where saturation excess runoff is unlikely to occur merz et al 2006 ardekani et al 2021 qiao et al 2023 2 c r p where r mm is the depth of water superficially drained during rainfall p mm is the depth of precipitation during a certain period then the cn and c values can be served as good criteria to determine the dominant runoff generation type for a specific watershed however there exist the probability that a large cn is due to the soil being relatively moist instead of the infiltration excess runoff mechanism similarly a small c is likely due to the soil being relatively dry and the runoff mechanism might still be saturation excess thus to identify the dominant runoff generation type of flood events c value was used as an initial classification and cn was used as a further refinement to avoid the above possibility the similar research has been conducted by huang et al 2016b and shen et al 2020 first the flood event was tentatively classified as an infiltration excess dominant flow event when its c value was less than 0 2 referring goel 2011 the flow event was re classified as a saturation excess dominant flow event when its c is larger than 0 5 otherwise it was re classified as a hybrid runoff generation flow event on this basis the flood event of which cn value is less than 60 and c value is less than 0 2 can be selected and re classified as a hybrid runoff generation event huang et al 2016b shen et al 2020 in the same way the flood event of which cn value is larger than 80 and c value is larger than 0 5 can be also selected and re classified as a hybrid runoff generation event detailed information on the runoff generation types classification using the cn c method were given in table 1 2 2 construction of flexible runoff generation models normally a model consists of several model components and a proper integration of different components is essential to construct a suitable model huang et al 2016a in this study the modeling strategy was defined as the way of uniting several single runoff generation mechanisms together referring to the flow generation strategy of classical hydrological models different flexible runoff generation models were constructed in this study as shown in fig 1 the model fluxes are defined in table 2 fig 1 a shows the infiltration excess runoff generation mechanism without considering subsurface flow and subsurface stormflow infiltration excess occurs when the rate of rainfall is greater than the infiltration capacity the infiltration capacity distribution curve is analogous to the storage capacity distribution curve used in xaj model which is expressed by 3 a pi a 1 1 f p f m b 1 4 f m f 1 b 1 where a pi is the partial area in which the infiltration capacity is less than or equal to f p f p is the infiltration capacity at a point varying from 0 to f m a is the total watershed area b 1 is the exponential of distribution of the infiltration capacity and f is the areal average infiltration rate which can be calculated by many methods such as green ampt equation horton equation and philip infiltration equation green and ampt 1911 philip 1957 beven 2004 in this study f was calculated using the green ampt equation huo et al 2020 which is given by 5 f k 1 ψ δ θ f where f is the infiltration rate mm h 1 f is the cumulative infiltration mm k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity mm h 1 ψ is the wetting front capillary pressure head mm and δ θ is the change of soil water content across the wetting front fig 1 b shows the saturation excess runoff generation mechanism which has been used in the xaj model the xaj model is a conceptual hydrologic model proposed by zhao et al 1980 for flood forecasts in the xin an river basin it has been widely used in humid and semi humid watersheds all over the world zhao 1992 in the model surface runoff subsurface stormflow and subsurface runoff were considered using a free reservoir nonetheless there was no special subsurface stormflow generation mechanism two parabolic curves were adopted to represent the spatially non uniform distribution of the tension water storage and free water storage the functional relationships of the tension water storage capacity curve and free water storage capacity are given by 6 a ps a p 1 1 wm wmm b 2 7 a f a s 1 1 sm smm b 3 where a ps is the partial pervious area where the tension water storage capacity is less than or equal to the value wm which is the tension water capacity at a point varying from 0 to a maximum wmm a p is the pervious area of the catchment b 2 is the exponential of distribution of the tension water capacity a f is the area where the free water storage capacity is less than or equal to the value sm varying from 0 to smm a s is the runoff generation area and b 3 is the exponential of distribution of the free water storage capacity curve fig 1 c shows the schematic diagram of the vertically mixed runoff generation mechanism which combines the mechanism of the runoff formation in excess of infiltration at soil surface and the mechanism of the runoff formation on repletion of storage at subsurface it suggests that the two runoff generation mechanisms could be produced simultaneously in the vertical direction after the rainfall in excess of evapotranspiration reaches the ground it is separated into surface runoff and infiltration flow based on the infiltration capacity distribution curve as shown in fig 1 a while in areas where the soil water deficit is large the infiltration flow only replenishes soil water deficit without runoff generation otherwise subsurface runoff can be generated after the infiltration flow satisfies the deficiency below field capacity as shown in fig 1 b and the difference is that the saturation excess runoff is separated into subsurface stormflow and subsurface runoff using a steady infiltration rate instead of a free reservoir similarly the hybrid runoff generation mechanism described in fig 1 d is expressed by two generalized parabolic distribution curves this model is intended to be an enhanced xaj model with an addition of infiltration excess runoff generated over the unsaturated area the total watershed is divided into two categories including the saturated area and the unsaturated area the xaj model was specifically used to calculate the saturation excess surface runoff over the saturated area while the green ampt equation and the parabolic infiltration capacity distribution curve were combined to calculate the infiltration excess surface runoff over the unsaturated area the surface runoff was calculated by 8 r s r is r es the flexible runoff generation strategies s1 to s4 described above are widely used in hydrology however all these models describe the subsurface stormflow generation mechanism vaguely strategy s1 ignores the subsurface stormflow whereas the strategies s2 s3 and s4 divide the excess runoff using a free reservoir or the steady infiltration rate as the subsurface stormflow was separated from the saturated excess runoff this kind of separation ignores subsurface stormflow in unsaturated areas and therefore may result in significant errors sometimes it seems that the subsurface stormflow over the unsaturated areas can be characterized by introducing an interface between the upper soil and the lower soil therefore a conceptual module for subsurface stormflow in unsaturated areas over the interface was proposed through a combination of the green ampt equation with the parabolic infiltration capacity distribution curve in this study green and ampt 1911 on this basis a novel hybrid runoff generation strategy was constructed in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 strategy s5 is designed to be regarded as a hybrid runoff generation strategy including the surface runoff subsurface runoff and subsurface stormflow the process of the rainfall infiltrating into the surface layer and subsequently reaching the interface is represented by two analogous nonlinear functions as shown in eq 3 the surface infiltration excess runoff can be calculated by strategy s1 the saturation excess runoff was calculated by strategy s2 the subsurface runoff and the subsurface stormflow over the saturated areas were separated by a steady rate the subsurface stormflow over the interface can be calculated by a strategy similar to strategy s1 combining eqs 3 4 and 5 the subsurface stormflow of the unsaturated areas over the interface can be expressed as 9 r ii f u f i f i 1 f u f im 1 b 4 where f u is the infiltration from the surface to the interface f i is the areal average infiltration rate of the interface f im is the maximum infiltration capacity of the interface b 4 is the exponential of distribution of the infiltration capacity of the interface it should be noted that the infiltration from the surface to the soil f is the input of eq 9 and the notation of f u instead of f is used then the subsurface stormflow r i is equal to the sum of the infiltration excess subsurface stormflow r ii and the saturation excess subsurface stormflow r ei which can be expressed by 10 r i r ii r ei overall the five flexible runoff generation strategies discussed above consist of at least one of the three runoff components to consider the various runoff components a linear reservoir or the steady infiltration rate can be used in strategies s2 s3 and s4 and there is no special subsurface stormflow generation module due to the differences of surficial topography and the subsurface topography strategy s5 was developed to consider both the subsurface stormflow over the unsaturated and saturated areas in this study details about the five runoff generation strategies are shown in table 3 specifically strategy s1 was characterized by the infiltration excess mechanism and the subsurface stormflow was not considered strategy s2 was a saturation excess mechanism characterized model in which the subsurface stormflow was separated from the saturation excess in saturated areas strategy s3 and s4 were developed to consider both the saturation excess and infiltration excess for strategy s3 the subsurface stormflow was dealt similarly with that of strategy s2 and the subsurface stormflow was separated from the infiltrated water in saturated areas strategy s4 was intended to be an enhanced xaj model with an addition of infiltration excess runoff generated over the unsaturated area and the subsurface stormflow was separated from the saturated areas to consider the unsaturated subsurface stormflow strategy s5 was developed in this study to improve the performances of strategy s4 by assuming an interface in the unsaturated regions then the subsurface stormflow was the sum of the infiltrated subsurface stormflow and saturated subsurface stormflow 2 3 hydrological forecasting model framework the xaj model proposed by zhao et al 1980 was used as the hydrological forecasting framework in this study it mainly consists of four modules including evapotranspiration module runoff generation module runoff partition module and runoff routing module zhou et al 2019 inputs of the xaj model are the average areal rainfall as well as evaporation and output is streamflow first for the evapotranspiration module the soil profile of each sub basin is divided into three layers the upper lower and deeper layers and only when water in the layer above it has been exhausted does evaporation in the next layer occur second for the runoff generation module the saturation runoff generation method was replaced by strategies s1 to s5 respectively third the runoff partition in the xaj model divides the total runoff into three components by a free reservoir which consists of surface runoff subsurface stormflow and subsurface runoff while the runoff partition module was supposed to be changed based on the flexible runoff generation strategies as discussed in section 2 2 finally the surface runoff is routed directly to the watershed outlet of each sub basin in a source to sink form moore et al 2006 by means of the lag and route method while the subsurface stormflow and groundwater runoff are routed through linear reservoirs lu and li 2014 more details can be found in zhao et al 1980 the parameters of each runoff generation models are shown in table 4 most of these parameters are consistent with those of the xaj model and green ampt model strategies s1 to s5 are with 13 17 17 20 and 21 parameters respectively specifically the runoff generation module of strategy s1 is with the same parameters as the green ampt model the parameters of strategy s2 are the same with the xaj model the runoff generation strategy s3 is known as the vertically based runoff generation model coupling xaj model and green ampt model in the vertical direction strategy s4 is a conceptual model designed to improve the xaj model for semi arid and semi humid basins li et al 2005 strategy s5 is considered as an improved strategy s4 which considers all the three runoff generation components the interface is assumed to be spatially heterogeneous as the surface then the infiltration excess subsurface stormflow was calculated by combining the green ampt equation with the parabolic infiltration capacity distribution curve and three additional parameters were introduced in strategy s5 the schematic diagram of the flexible runoff generation method is shown in fig 3 the modelling steps are summarized as follows 1 calculate the evapotranspiration using a three layer evapotranspiration scheme 2 construct the five runoff generation strategies s1 to s5 according to the existing saturation excess mechanism infiltration excess mechanism and subsurface stormflow mechanism strategies s1 to s5 compose at least one of the runoff generation mechanisms 3 the total runoff is subdivided into three components by a free reservoir for strategies s2 and s4 while the saturation excess of the strategies s3 and s5 are subdivided into two components using the steady infiltration rate 4 the surface runoff is routed directly to the watershed outlet of each sub basin in a source to sink form by means of the lag and route method moore et al 2006 while the interflow and groundwater runoff are routed through linear reservoirs lu and li 2014 5 compare the modeling performances of the five runoff generation strategies and conduct a parameters sensitivity analysis 2 4 model calibration and evaluation the shuffled complex evolution algorithm sce ua technique was developed by the university of arizona in 1992 for nonlinear high dimension optimization issues duan et al 1992 the technique has been used extensively for calibrating hydrological models zhou et al 2019 consequently the sce ua method was employed in this study to optimize the parameters of the hydrological model a new aggregated objective function made up of three measures and aimed at maximizing flow characteristics was used for the parameter calibration brunner et al 2021 yi et al 2022 particularly the kling gupta efficiency e kg and the nash sutcliffe efficiency e ns focus on high flows the log e ns efficiency emphasizes low flows and r sr quantifies volume errors respectively the aggregated objective function and three metrics are expressed by 11 e ns 1 t 1 t q s t q o t t 1 t q o t q o 12 e kg 1 r 1 2 σ s σ o 1 2 μ s μ o 1 2 13 r sr t

the observed discharge t is the duration of the flood event r is the correlation coefficient between the observed and simulated flood σ s and σ o are the standard deviation values for the simulated

addition the complexity control method structural risk minimization srm was used for the model complexity analysis we can derive analytical estimates of prediction error on the basis of statistical theory in general the estimate takes the following form schoups et al 2008 18 r e r r e where r is a penalization factor r 1 penalization factor r increases as a function of model complexity relative to size of the data set various analytical forms for penalization factor r have been proposed including akaike s information criterion aic bayes information criterion bic and srm r e represents the sum of empirical error r e represents the sum of empirical error considering the model complexity srm is rooted in statistical learning theory and relies on the following expression for penalization factor r 19 r srm 1 d n d n ln d n ln n 2 n 1 where d is the vapnik chervonenkis dimension of the model or number of parameters as a measure of model complexity and n is sample size 3 study area and data the xun river basin was selected as a case study the rationality of the five runoff generation strategies was verified the xun river is a tributary of the han river which originates from shaanxi province china the xun river is 218 km long with a basin area of 6 448 km2 the mean slope of the basin is 2 9 there are 6 meteorological stations and 1 flow station the xiangjiaping station in the basin as shown in fig 4 the xun river basin is located in the mountain area with large variations in terms of topographic relief where the spatial heterogeneity of runoff generation should be considered in hydrological modelling the annual average rainfall of the whole basin is 798 mm and the annual average discharge of the xiangjiaping station is 63 4 m3 s the observed maximum flood peak discharge is 6 090 m3 s floods of the xun river basin are usually with the characteristics of high flow peak and short duration making a major threat to the downstream areas thus the single runoff generation mechanism cannot meet the needs of watershed water management the rainfall and evaporation data from the meteorological stations were collected from 2010 to 2021 the simultaneous 6 hourly runoff data from the xiangjiaping station was collected as well flow series in flood season of each year were selected to calibrate and verify the established model specifically 7 years from 2010 to 2017 were used as calibration period and 4 years from 2018 to 2021 were used as validation period due to a large error of the observed continuous flow flood season of 2016 was not considered in this study to identify the runoff generation type for each flood event 33 flood events whose flood peak is larger than 500 m3 s were identified from the continuous flow the calibration period and the validation period were the same as those of the continuous flow the statistics of these flood events are shown in table 5 the average flood peak is 1 165 m3 s and the average flood duration is about 194 h moreover to consider the initial condition the antecedent precipitation was calculated based on the daily recession coefficient of the water storage 4 results 4 1 results of runoff generation type 33 observed flood events were used to calculate the cn and c values the flood events were divided into three categories using the cn c method including the infiltration excess dominant events saturation excess dominant events and hybrid runoff generation events results are given in table 6 it can be seen from table 6 that most flood events are hybrid runoff events according to the results of the initial classification after a reclassification using the scs cn method 1 flood event were dominated by the infiltration excess runoff generation mechanism 19 flood events were dominated by the saturation excess runoff generation mechanism and 13 flood events were classified as the hybrid runoff events to this end the xun river basin was always taken as a saturation excess runoff generation watershed however nearly half of the flood events in the basin were dominated by the hybrid runoff generation mechanism and predicting the flood peak using the saturation excess runoff generation models may produce large errors therefore it is necessary to develop a hybrid runoff generation model for this basin 4 2 performances of the five runoff generation strategies the xaj model was adopted as the hydrological forecasting framework in which the runoff generation module was replaced by five runoff generation strategies the other modules remain unchanged within the xaj model seven continuous flow processes from 2010 to 2017 were used for model calibration and the rest were used to evaluate the modelling performances the evaluation index system in section 2 4 was used to evaluate the performance of different runoff generation strategies table 7 lists the n es e kg and rmse values for all the models and fig 5 shows part of the flow hydrographs of the five runoff generation methods for continuous floods in 2010 2017 2019 and 2020 among which 2010 and 2017 are the calibration years while 2019 and 2020 are the validation years it can be seen from table 6 and fig 5 that the accuracy of strategy s1 is the poorest the performances of strategy s2 are overall good but there is a problem of overestimating the flood peak discharge for some major floods such as the flood peaks in 2017 2019 and 2020 the performances of strategies s3 and s4 are similar additionally the performances of strategy s5 is slightly better than those of strategies s3 and s4 to demonstrate the model performances of different strategies more visually fig 6 gives the box plots of the evaluation index using different runoff generation strategies for continuous flow processes it can be seen from fig 6 that the average e ns of the strategies s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 are 0 38 0 47 0 63 0 60 and 0 65 the average e kg are 0 60 0 63 0 72 0 70 and 0 72 and the average rmse are 163 56 153 26 130 37 131 86 and 124 85 m3 s respectively results of the evaluation index demonstrates that strategies s3 and s4 outperformed the single runoff generation mode results of strategies s3 and s4 are similar and results of strategy s2 is better than those of strategy s1 it can be concluded that the xun river basin was dominated by the saturation excess runoff generation mechanism but the hybrid runoff generation strategy has a better performance this conclusion is consistent with the analysis of section 4 1 additionally comparing strategies s3 s4 and s5 it can be found that strategy s5 performs slightly better than strategies s3 and s4 it can be seen from the distributions of the three metrics between the lower and upper quartile values the performance of strategy s5 is more robust however the results of strategy are not necessarily superior to those of other strategies the possible reasons can be summarized as follows first the runoff generation mechanisms are various from different years or different flood events and it is a great challenge for one strategy which can get high precision for all flood processes second the flexible conceptual model is an approximation to the physically based model and cannot describe all details of hydrologic processes and error free observations for all the hydrologic processes being simulated third the choice of the flow process used for calibration is subjective and the model parameters may cannot characterize all the flood processes 4 3 comparisons of forecasting results between flood events and continuous flow the hybrid runoff generation may be more inclined to happen in semi arid semi humid areas and mountain watershed with heavy rainstorm wang et al 2022 under such conditions the large flood event attracts more attention because of its huge damage it can be seen from fig 5 that forecasting accuracy of large flood events varies significantly therefore it is necessary to discuss the accuracy of the hybrid flow generation model for large flood events therefore 33 flood events during flood season were chosen from the year 2010 to 2021 and the parameters for both the continuous flow and flood events were calibrated together in order to satisfy the need of future forecast the flow process flow peak flow volume and the occurrence time of flow peak are four main basic elements for describing the flow hydrograph e ns q p w p and t p metrics are plotted with box and whisker as shown in fig 7 fig 7 shows the distributions of evaluation index using different runoff generation strategies for flood events results show that the performance of strategy s5 outperforms other strategies the performances of the hybrid runoff generation strategies are better than those of the single runoff generation strategies for both continuous flows and flood events compared with the prediction results of the continuous flow the proposed hybrid flow generation strategy has better performances for flood events which may be that the hybrid runoff production is more likely to occur during heavy rainstorms 4 4 analysis of runoff components for the five runoff generation strategies to explore the runoff components for flood events we selected several flood events from different years detailed information of 6 flood events are given in table 8 specifically flood peaks of flood events no 20100820 20110905 20120702 and 20140908 are large and those of the flood events no 20180728 and 20190625 are low flood events no 20120702 and 20190625 are dominated by hybrid runoff generation mechanism and the other floods are classified as saturation generation types the flood peaks of flood events no 20180728 and 20190625 are similar while the runoff generation types are actually different this is because that flood event no 20190625 has a shorter flood duration and is caused by a heavy rainfall storm the stacked bar charts of runoff components for the flexible runoff generation strategies are presented in fig 8 fig 8 shows the runoff components calculated by the five runoff generation strategies for 6 flood events strategy s1 only include the surface flow strategies s2 s3 s4 and s5 includes all the 3 runoff components strategy s2 represents the saturation excess runoff generation model and its various runoff components are considered using the linear reservoir method strategies s3 and s4 considers both the saturation excess and infiltration excess runoffs while their subsurface stormflow only originates from the saturation excess moreover the surface runoff of strategy s4 is the sum of infiltration excess surface runoff and the saturation excess surface runoff the percentage of the surface flow of strategy s4 accounts for the most among the three hybrid runoff generation strategies additionally an interface was introduced in strategy s5 to consider the subsurface stormflow in the unsaturated areas theoretically strategy s5 produces the most subsurface stormflow because it considers both the saturated and unsaturated subsurface stormflow however it can be seen from fig 8 that the percentage of the subsurface stormflow in strategy s5 is less than that of strategies s3 and s4 and the proportion of the subsurface flow increased this is probably due to the changes in the structure of the hybrid runoff generation model and there is a coupling relationship between the different modules leading to changes in the proportions of the three runoff components moreover strategy s2 has the smallest subsurface stormflow proportion and the proportion of the subsurface stormflow in all flood events was below 15 it is noted that strategy s5 for flood event no 20180728 does not have a subsurface stormflow while flood event no 20190625 does as analyzed above flood event no 20180728 was caused by a heavy rainstorm within a shorter duration and other strategies could not characterize this property in the flood events with small peak discharges like strategy s5 4 5 parameters sensitivity analysis of the model based on strategy s5 sensitivity of the parameters characterizes the influence degree of the output of the model with the changes in the parameters uhlenbrook et al 1999 the objective of this section is to explore the influence of the unsaturated infiltration excess subsurface stormflow on the performance of the hybrid runoff generation model the increased parameters significantly affected the model performances to investigate whether the model uncertainty increased significantly with the increasing model complexity a sensitivity analysis for parameters of strategy s5 is necessary the proposed strategy s5 is a novel hybrid runoff generation strategy three new parameters representing the characteristics of the interface are increased while the total number of parameters is nearly consistent with strategy s4 to this end the three parameters inflicting the characteristic of interface were selected including b 4 k sl and ψ l simultaneously for the purpose of comparing the differences between the surface and the interface three parameters representing the subsurface distribution characteristics were selected including b 1 k su and ψ u additionally parameters c s c i and c g have a significant impact on the routing processes which were also selected for the sensitivity analysis to better explore the distribution and characteristics of uncertainties a flood event with a good forecasting performance in the study was chosen flood event no 20210817 was used to analyze the parameter sensitivity using the controlling variable method the relationship between the parameters and e ns and e kg values is given in fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 that the recession constants of the lower subsurface stormflow runoff storage c i the recession constants of the surface runoff storage c s the saturated hydraulic conductivity over the upper soil layer k su and the saturated hydraulic conductivity over the lower soil layer k sl were the sensitive parameters moreover the sensitivity parameters of the surface and the interface were absolutely the same liu et al 2020 has done a similar work and found that the lower subsurface stormflow runoff storage c i was not sensitive but in our study this parameter has a great influence on the model performance it may be because that the hybrid strategies in their research did not consider the interface and the subsurface stormflow was generated from the saturation excess mechanism the sensitivity analysis of other parameters was consistent with our study it can be concluded that the surface and the interface have similar physical characteristics the subsurface stormflow is essential for the xun river basin for the reasons that 1 the parameters c i has a significant influence on the model performance 2 the subsurface stormflow accounts for more than 20 percent of the total runoff 5 discussion 5 1 influence of model complexity on model performance in conceptual hydrologic models parameters are used as part of equations intended to describe hydrologic behavior and ideally models that are appropriate descriptions of the dominant processes in a catchment would perform well in such a catchment regardless of the number of parameters used pilz et al 2020 the number of model parameters is often used to explain differences in model performance and a key question that then arises is how to decide when the model has sufficient complexity several methods have been developed for this purpose all of them relying on two ingredients 1 specification of two or more model structures of varying complexity and 2 evaluation and comparison of the ability of the models to mimic observed data schoups et al 2008 statistical model selection methods and model complexity control methods are widely used for example akaike s information criterion aic bayes information criterion bic and structural risk minimization srm et al akaike 1970 schwarz 1978 khalil et al 2005 a common assumption in the development of both aic and bic is that an infinitely large data set is available for estimating prediction error however in many situations e g hydrologic prediction one is faced with limited and noisy data sets in which case these methods do not strictly apply an alternative model complexity control method that has been developed for use with finite data sets is srm thus the srm method was selected for the model complexity analysis in this study the simulated flow discharges from 2010 to 2021 were used for the model complexity analysis the sum of empirical error was characterized by the mean square error mse and the sample size is 6259 the vapnik chervonenkis dimension for strategies s1 to s5 are 13 17 17 20 21 respectively the mse considering model complexity for the five strategies are given in table 9 results show that three hybrid runoff generation models perform better than the models with single runoff generation mechanism strategy s5 still performs the best among all methods followed by the strategies s3 and s4 and it is worth noting that the accuracy of strategy 5 and strategy 3 is similar with each other the difference lies in that the performance of strategy s1 exceeds that of strategy s2 it can be concluded that the hybrid runoff generation mechanisms are more suitable for the xun river basin additionally the improvement of accuracy of strategy s5 is not caused by the increased number of parameters 5 2 conformity of strategy s5 with the reality of the watershed it can be seen from fig 8 that considering subsurface stormflow in unsaturated regions actually decreased the proportion of subsurface stormflow the possible reasons are that these five strategies are calibrated separately and if the parameters of strategy s3 and s4 remain unchanged with those of strategy s5 the proportion of subsurface stormflow for strategy s5 would be the largest to this end it is necessary to further analyze the reality of strategy s5 specifically the simulated time varying soil moisture in 2014 2017 2020 and 2021 were chosen for analysis we compared the changes of soil moisture among three hybrid runoff generation strategies the time varying soil moisture of the strategies s3 s4 and s5 are shown in fig 10 below it can be seen from fig 10 that the time varying soil moisture of the three strategies were basically consistent which means that the runoff depth calculated by the three strategies are with small variation it is worth noting that the soil moisture content of strategy s5 is between that of strategy s3 and strategy s4 thus if strategies s3 and s4 reflected the reality of the watershed there is no evidence that strategy s5 was wrong however this indeed raise a problem that whether we can really model subsurface stormflow correctly without the observation on the scale of interest determining and quantifying the subsurface stormflow generating processes is a challenging task as they cannot be observed directly currently the quality of a rainfall runoff model is still assessed by comparing modelled and observed total runoff at a gauge often situated at the catchment outlet the assumption is that if the model discharge fits the discharge observations satisfyingly subsurface stormflow is also simulated correctly although this is not necessarily true particularly when considering changes in subsurface stormflow contributions over the course of an event chifflard et al 2019 however this is an accepted compromise in challenging hydrological studies 6 conclusions an improved flexible hybrid runoff generation model coupled with the saturation excess mechanism infiltration excess mechanism and subsurface stormflow mechanism was proposed the flexible runoff generation strategy considered the subsurface stormflow over the both unsaturated and saturated areas can be used for watersheds dominated by different runoff generation mechanisms the xun river basin was selected as a case study the cn c method was used to identify runoff generation types the xaj model was selected as the hydrological forecasting framework and simulated results of the five strategies for both continues flow and flood events were compared and discussed in details in addition the sensitivity analysis of the parameters of the proposed strategy s5 was conducted the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 a novel conceptual strategy for subsurface stormflow in the unsaturated areas over the interface was proposed through a combination of the green ampt equation with the parabolic infiltration capacity distribution curve the subsurface stormflow was the sum of the infiltration excess subsurface stormflow and the saturation excess subsurface stormflow the saturation excess infiltration excess as well as subsurface stormflow mechanisms were used and combined to form an improved flexible runoff generation strategy namely s5 in this study 2 five runoff generation strategies were used for flood prediction and the cn c method was used for flood events classification results shows that the xun river basin is dominated by the saturation excess mechanism while the accuracy of the saturation excess runoff generation strategy s2 is lower than that of the hybrid runoff generation strategies s3 s4 and s5 it is found that the hybrid runoff generation mechanisms are the most suitable for the xun river basin 3 predicted hydrographs and criteria of the case study for both the continuous flow processes and the flood events shows that the accuracy of strategy s5 is the highest followed by strategies s3 s4 and s2 and finally strategy s1 moreover the performances of flood events are better than those of the continuous flow processes indicating that the high and low flow discharges may have different runoff generation mechanisms 4 the sensitivity analysis of the parameters was conducted for strategy s5 results of sensitivity analysis show that the accuracy of the simulation results is affected significantly by the infiltration excess subsurface stormflow over the unsaturated areas and the physical characteristic of the interface is similar to that of the surface the sensitive parameters of strategy s5 consist of the recession constants of the lower subsurface stormflow runoff storage c i the recession constants of the surface runoff storage c s the

2077,the saturation excess mechanism infiltration excess mechanism and subsurface stormflow mechanism are the fundamental of the hybrid runoff generation models existing hybrid runoff generation methods pay much attention to the surface runoff and subsurface runoff but less to the characterization of subsurface stormflow additionally the subsurface stormflow was mostly separated from the saturated excess this kind of separation ignores subsurface stormflow in unsaturated areas and therefore may result in significant errors sometimes therefore a novel conceptual method for subsurface stormflow in unsaturated areas over the interface was proposed through a combination of the green ampt equation with the parabolic infiltration capacity distribution curve then the subsurface stormflow was considered as the sum of the infiltration excess over the unsaturated areas and the saturation excess over the saturated areas on this basis an improved flexible runoff generation strategy was developed to incorporate the spatial heterogeneity of underlying surface conditions and rainfall conditions based on the three single runoff generation mechanisms finally the xun river basin was selected as a case study performances of different runoff generation strategies were compared and discussed based on flood events and continues flow and the sensitivity analysis of the parameters was carried out results show that the proposed strategy performed the best among the five strategies and the accuracy of the simulation results was affected significantly by the infiltration excess subsurface stormflow over the unsaturated areas the proposed method can be used for the watersheds where there may be abundant subsurface stormflow keywords hybrid runoff generation flexible model subsurface stormflow excess rainfall hydrological modelling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the process of runoff generation is the redistribution of rainfall through the soils three well known mechanisms i e dunne flow horton flow and subsurface stormflow also known as interflow have been developed to describe the process of runoff generation tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 surface flow subsurface flow and subsurface stormflow are the three most dominant components contributing to the runoff generation process li and sivapalan 2014 surface flow is recharged from rainfall excess while subsurface stormflow and subsurface flow are replenished from the infiltrated water in the soils due to the spatial heterogeneity of underlying surface conditions e g land cover topography antecedent soil moisture and soil properties and rainfall intensity characteristics huang et al 2016a huang et al 2016b shen et al 2020 although numerous hydrological models have been developed for simulating the hydrological processes there are still opportunities remaining for improvement in terms of characterizing the rainfall runoff response clark et al 2015 the runoff generation method which describes the rainfall runoff response provides a potential solution about this issue semenova and beven 2015 shen et al 2020 the dunne flow horton flow and subsurface stormflow occurred in different conditions shen et al 2020 for the dunne flow surface saturation occurs because of a rising water table and ponding and surface flow occur at a time when there is no further soil moisture storage available the dunne flow is more common to happen at near channel areas and sometimes in the arid zones with long storms duration li and sivapalan 2014 the horton flow occurs when the precipitation rate exceeds the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the surface soil ross et al 2019 and there are two necessary conditions for the generation of surface flow by the horton mechanism first the rainfall rate is greater than the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil and second the rainfall duration is longer than the required ponding time for a given initial moisture profile the horton flow is more inclined to generate from partial areas of the hillslope where surface hydraulic conductivities are the lowest in addition the subsurface stormflow is a runoff producing mechanism operating in most upland terrains subsurface stormflow occurs when water moves laterally down a hillslope through soil layers or permeable bedrock to contribute to the storm hydrograph in a river weiler et al 2006 because there may exist a steep hydraulic gradient either on account of the slope of the hillslope or the build up of groundwater mounds on shallow slopes under such conditions the watershed or hillslope response to rainfall may be dominated by subsurface stormflows involving both saturated and unsaturated flows singh 2001 currently a hybrid runoff generation process pattern formed by more than one mechanism can often be identified in semi humid semi arid and mountain watershed because of the heterogeneity of underlying surface conditions and meteorological factors hu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 there are three characteristics for floods in the hybrid runoff generation area 1 high intensity and short duration 2 high local sensitivity and spatial temporal variability 3 close correlation with the topographic features especially in mountainous areas wang et al 2022 runoff generated by the combination of the various single mechanisms in semi humid and semi arid areas as well as mountain watershed is known as the hybrid runoff liu et al 2020 which enables the rapid occurrence of floods and makes hydrological forecast more challenging to solve the limitations of single runoff mechanism models with conceptualized hybrid runoff generation mechanism attracted much attention many conceptual mixed runoff generation models such as the vertically mixed runoff generation model the xaj green ampt model and so on have been developed bao and wang 1997 li et al 2005 huang et al 2016b shen et al 2020 bao and wang 1997 developed a vertically mixed runoff generation model combining the mechanism of the runoff formation in excess of infiltration at soil surface and the mechanism of the runoff formation on repletion of storage at subsurface the vertically mixed runoff has been shown to perform well for semi humid catchments li et al 2005 proposed a xaj green ampt model in which the runoff generating from infiltration excess was added to improve the xaj model for semi arid and semi humid basins results showed that the xaj green ampt model could forecast discharge with higher accuracy huang et al 2016b constructed a spatial combination modeling framework of saturation excess and infiltration excess runoff for semi humid watersheds and the framework performed well shen et al 2020 integrated a hybrid runoff generation mechanism into variable infiltration capacity model to facilitate hydrological simulations the current hybrid runoff models are constructed in the light of the vertical combination of saturation excess module and infiltration excess module or constructed in the light of the spatial combination of saturation excess module and infiltration excess module however the existing hybrid runoff generation method coupled only one or two single generation mechanisms to simulate the process of runoff generation in hydrological models more authentically all of these three mechanisms including saturation excess runoff infiltration excess runoff as well as subsurface stormflow should simultaneously characterize the runoff generating process rather than one or two of them hrachowitz and clark 2017 baroni et al 2019 shen et al 2020 the approach of flexible modeling strategies provides a potential solution to the issues of hybrid runoff simulation studies of hydrological modeling have progressed recently toward the development and application of flexible models which allows selection of alternative representations of runoff processes and different combinations of runoff generation components clark et al 2011 staudinger et al 2011 fenicia et al 2016 huang et al 2016a huang et al 2016b wang et al 2018 liu et al 2020 however existing flexible hybrid runoff generation methods pay much attention to the surface runoff and subsurface runoff but less to the characterization of subsurface stormflow subsurface stormflow is ubiquitous especially in steep and humid catchments subsurface stormflow models mainly include the following types darcy richards model kinematic wave model dual porosity model two phase model stochastic model and so on hu and li 2019 methods range from detailed physically based approaches including the darcy richards model beven and germann 2013 the kinematic wave model flügel and smith 1998 and dual porosity model shao et al 2014 to less complex conceptual models such as the two phase model hosang 1993 the darcy richards model is based on the continuum principle of soil water movement and darcy s law the darcy richards model has a high precision however it is difficult to predict and forecast the flood of rainstorms due to the complexity of the solution process sloan and moore 1984 the dual porosity model shao et al 2014 is also known a kind of two pore domain model which assumes that the soil consists of two domains one representing the soil matrix and the other one representing the macropores in the soil the two pore domain model provided a better description of the observed event than a traditional one pore domain model laine kaulio et al 2014 but its shortcoming is the same as that of the darcy richards model subsequently some more efficient methods such as the kinematic wave theory stochastic model and two phase model have been developed to simulate the subsurface stormflow the stochastic model uses the stochastic mathematical method to describe the transport of preferential flow because macropores are randomly distributed in the soil the stochastic model can be used to better describe the transport of water and solutes in the soils with macropores the stochastic models are however restricted by several simplifying assumptions regarding the statistics and the structure of the formation heterogeneity the local flow regime the local unsaturated conductivity russo 2003 furthermore the stochastic models are often restricted to steady state flow and thus they may not be applicable to practical situations in which water flow is considerably affected by time dependent processes like rain and evapotranspiration russo et al 1998 the kinematic wave theory was first discussed by lighthill and whitham 1955 which has been widely applied to a variety of hydrological processes including the subsurface stormflow however the applicability of the kinematic wave model was considered by singh 2002 to have some limits the kinematic wave model in the simulation of subsurface stormflow was highly dependent on the rate of recharge soil hydraulic conductivity slope angle and the thickness of saturated zone which made it only apply to steep slopes additionally the two phase model was first discussed by hosang 1993 the model divides the generation of preferential flow into two stages the first phase represents times of redistribution and low infiltration which does not generate preferential flow times of heavy infiltration inducing preferential flow are handled by the second phase the richards equation is applied to both phases as the governing flow equation and preferential flow is allowed by increasing the hydraulic conductivity of the soil during the second phase the two phase model is simple and easy to understand but there are a number of parameters in this model although these approaches are useful modelling techniques for capturing subsurface stormflow they are difficult to be coupled into the flexible hydrological model due to the inherent complexity the conceptual models do not require detailed process knowledge but we make the claim that for the development of process based hydrological models a good understanding of the generation of subsurface stormflow and the incorporation of process knowledge is essential chifflard et al 2019 hydrologists have found that the subsurface topography is distinctly different from surficial topography and the subsurface topography exerts a considerable influence on the local hydrological gradients and therefore the dominant flow path directions freer et al 1997 haga et al 2005 du et al 2016 this realization led to new concepts of subsurface stormflow generation via filling and spilling of depressions created by subsurface topography spence and woo 2003 some researchers have tried to address this issue by assuming an interface between the upper soil and the lower soil according to huang et al 2016a the soil profile was divided into the upper and lower layers and the subsurface stormflow in their model was generated between the upper and the lower soil layer the subsurface stormflow was calculated through a combination of the modified horton equation with the parabolic infiltration capacity distribution curve however they assumed that the upper soil has no surface runoff and the performance is poor they concluded that in semi arid catchments a suitable model need include at least one nonlinear component to simulate the main process of surface runoff generation to this end the surface runoff was considered using an infiltration excess method in this study referring bao and wang 1997 and the subsurface stormflow and subsurface flow were generated from the infiltrated water in the soils additionally in traditional flexible models the subsurface stormflow was separated from the saturated excess runoff this kind of separation ignores subsurface stormflow in unsaturated areas and therefore may result in significant errors sometimes most studies shown that subsurface stormflow is a saturated or near saturated water flow phenomenon while some studies have documented subsurface stormflow as unsaturated flow in the unsaturated zone beven 1982 singh 2001 weiler et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2020 however the necessary conditions for unsaturated subsurface stormflow in hillslopes still have not been clearly identified many hydrologists dealt with infiltration into unsaturated sloping soils and attributed lateral flow to either macroscopic or microscopic anisotropy in the soil hydraulic conductivity mccord et al 1991 torres et al 1998 sinai and dirksen 2006 in contrast sinai and dirksen 2006 suggested that the necessary condition for lateral downslope flow is decreasing rain intensity rather than the no flow boundary condition anisotropy or layering more recently some have suggested that subsurface stormflow in semiarid settings may be underestimated and should be investigated in more detail and at more locations wilcox et al 2008 lv et al 2013 explored the necessary conditions for the occurrence of lateral downslope flow in the unsaturated zone and the effects of different slope angles on soil moisture movement therefore it is still a great challenge to simulate subsurface stormflow in unsaturated areas the objective of this study was therefore to propose a flexible runoff generation strategy and focus on runoff generation mechanisms for both continuous flow and flood events especially for the subsurface stormflow generation the main contributions of the present study are given as follows first a novel conceptual method for subsurface stormflow in unsaturated areas over interface was proposed through a combination of the green ampt equation with the parabolic infiltration capacity distribution curve the subsurface stormflow is the sum of the infiltration excess over the unsaturated areas and the saturation excess over the saturated areas second saturation excess mechanism infiltration excess mechanism as well as subsurface stormflow mechanism were used and combined to form various runoff generation strategies third a flexible runoff generation strategy was developed to incorporate the spatial heterogeneity of underlying surface conditions and rainfall conditions the performances of different runoff generation strategies were compared based on flood events and continues flow sensitivity analysis of the parameters was carried out finally the xun river basin in the shaanxi province china was selected as a case study 2 hydrological models 2 1 determination of dominant runoff generation type dominant runoff generation type is influenced by a variety of meteorological and underlying surface factors that interact with each other it is reasonable to assume that a flow event is dominated by saturation excess runoff or infiltration excess runoff otherwise it is hybrid runoff the curve number cn given by eq 1 is the only parameter of the scs cn model williams and laseur 1976 which characterizes the tendency of infiltration excess runoff generation determined by soil type land use type and initial condition without calibration cn ranges from 0 to 100 with a smaller curve number representing low runoff potential and a higher curve number representing high runoff potential a large cn value shows a small infiltration capacity of land surface where infiltration excess runoff is likely to occur similarly a small cn value indicates a large infiltration capacity where infiltration excess runoff is unlikely to occur huang et al 2016b the dominant runoff generation type may vary differently in different flood events due to the various initial condition of each flood event to understand the applicability of the flexible runoff generation models in the study area it is necessary to identify the dominant runoff generation mechanism of each flood event in details 1 cn 25400 s 254 where s mm represents the potential maximum retention depends on the antecedent soil moisture condition in the catchment cn varies from zero to 100 a cn value of 100 represents a condition of zero potential retention i e an impervious catchment and cn 0 represents an infinitely abstracting catchment with s runoff coefficient c given by eq 2 is a dimensionless coefficient relating the amount of runoff to the amount of precipitation received it represents the integrated effect of catchment losses and hence depends upon climate antecedent soil moisture land surface slope and so on goel 2011 c ranges from 0 to 1 and seems to be large in humid areas where saturation excess runoff is likely to occur similarly c seems to be small in arid areas where saturation excess runoff is unlikely to occur merz et al 2006 ardekani et al 2021 qiao et al 2023 2 c r p where r mm is the depth of water superficially drained during rainfall p mm is the depth of precipitation during a certain period then the cn and c values can be served as good criteria to determine the dominant runoff generation type for a specific watershed however there exist the probability that a large cn is due to the soil being relatively moist instead of the infiltration excess runoff mechanism similarly a small c is likely due to the soil being relatively dry and the runoff mechanism might still be saturation excess thus to identify the dominant runoff generation type of flood events c value was used as an initial classification and cn was used as a further refinement to avoid the above possibility the similar research has been conducted by huang et al 2016b and shen et al 2020 first the flood event was tentatively classified as an infiltration excess dominant flow event when its c value was less than 0 2 referring goel 2011 the flow event was re classified as a saturation excess dominant flow event when its c is larger than 0 5 otherwise it was re classified as a hybrid runoff generation flow event on this basis the flood event of which cn value is less than 60 and c value is less than 0 2 can be selected and re classified as a hybrid runoff generation event huang et al 2016b shen et al 2020 in the same way the flood event of which cn value is larger than 80 and c value is larger than 0 5 can be also selected and re classified as a hybrid runoff generation event detailed information on the runoff generation types classification using the cn c method were given in table 1 2 2 construction of flexible runoff generation models normally a model consists of several model components and a proper integration of different components is essential to construct a suitable model huang et al 2016a in this study the modeling strategy was defined as the way of uniting several single runoff generation mechanisms together referring to the flow generation strategy of classical hydrological models different flexible runoff generation models were constructed in this study as shown in fig 1 the model fluxes are defined in table 2 fig 1 a shows the infiltration excess runoff generation mechanism without considering subsurface flow and subsurface stormflow infiltration excess occurs when the rate of rainfall is greater than the infiltration capacity the infiltration capacity distribution curve is analogous to the storage capacity distribution curve used in xaj model which is expressed by 3 a pi a 1 1 f p f m b 1 4 f m f 1 b 1 where a pi is the partial area in which the infiltration capacity is less than or equal to f p f p is the infiltration capacity at a point varying from 0 to f m a is the total watershed area b 1 is the exponential of distribution of the infiltration capacity and f is the areal average infiltration rate which can be calculated by many methods such as green ampt equation horton equation and philip infiltration equation green and ampt 1911 philip 1957 beven 2004 in this study f was calculated using the green ampt equation huo et al 2020 which is given by 5 f k 1 ψ δ θ f where f is the infiltration rate mm h 1 f is the cumulative infiltration mm k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity mm h 1 ψ is the wetting front capillary pressure head mm and δ θ is the change of soil water content across the wetting front fig 1 b shows the saturation excess runoff generation mechanism which has been used in the xaj model the xaj model is a conceptual hydrologic model proposed by zhao et al 1980 for flood forecasts in the xin an river basin it has been widely used in humid and semi humid watersheds all over the world zhao 1992 in the model surface runoff subsurface stormflow and subsurface runoff were considered using a free reservoir nonetheless there was no special subsurface stormflow generation mechanism two parabolic curves were adopted to represent the spatially non uniform distribution of the tension water storage and free water storage the functional relationships of the tension water storage capacity curve and free water storage capacity are given by 6 a ps a p 1 1 wm wmm b 2 7 a f a s 1 1 sm smm b 3 where a ps is the partial pervious area where the tension water storage capacity is less than or equal to the value wm which is the tension water capacity at a point varying from 0 to a maximum wmm a p is the pervious area of the catchment b 2 is the exponential of distribution of the tension water capacity a f is the area where the free water storage capacity is less than or equal to the value sm varying from 0 to smm a s is the runoff generation area and b 3 is the exponential of distribution of the free water storage capacity curve fig 1 c shows the schematic diagram of the vertically mixed runoff generation mechanism which combines the mechanism of the runoff formation in excess of infiltration at soil surface and the mechanism of the runoff formation on repletion of storage at subsurface it suggests that the two runoff generation mechanisms could be produced simultaneously in the vertical direction after the rainfall in excess of evapotranspiration reaches the ground it is separated into surface runoff and infiltration flow based on the infiltration capacity distribution curve as shown in fig 1 a while in areas where the soil water deficit is large the infiltration flow only replenishes soil water deficit without runoff generation otherwise subsurface runoff can be generated after the infiltration flow satisfies the deficiency below field capacity as shown in fig 1 b and the difference is that the saturation excess runoff is separated into subsurface stormflow and subsurface runoff using a steady infiltration rate instead of a free reservoir similarly the hybrid runoff generation mechanism described in fig 1 d is expressed by two generalized parabolic distribution curves this model is intended to be an enhanced xaj model with an addition of infiltration excess runoff generated over the unsaturated area the total watershed is divided into two categories including the saturated area and the unsaturated area the xaj model was specifically used to calculate the saturation excess surface runoff over the saturated area while the green ampt equation and the parabolic infiltration capacity distribution curve were combined to calculate the infiltration excess surface runoff over the unsaturated area the surface runoff was calculated by 8 r s r is r es the flexible runoff generation strategies s1 to s4 described above are widely used in hydrology however all these models describe the subsurface stormflow generation mechanism vaguely strategy s1 ignores the subsurface stormflow whereas the strategies s2 s3 and s4 divide the excess runoff using a free reservoir or the steady infiltration rate as the subsurface stormflow was separated from the saturated excess runoff this kind of separation ignores subsurface stormflow in unsaturated areas and therefore may result in significant errors sometimes it seems that the subsurface stormflow over the unsaturated areas can be characterized by introducing an interface between the upper soil and the lower soil therefore a conceptual module for subsurface stormflow in unsaturated areas over the interface was proposed through a combination of the green ampt equation with the parabolic infiltration capacity distribution curve in this study green and ampt 1911 on this basis a novel hybrid runoff generation strategy was constructed in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 strategy s5 is designed to be regarded as a hybrid runoff generation strategy including the surface runoff subsurface runoff and subsurface stormflow the process of the rainfall infiltrating into the surface layer and subsequently reaching the interface is represented by two analogous nonlinear functions as shown in eq 3 the surface infiltration excess runoff can be calculated by strategy s1 the saturation excess runoff was calculated by strategy s2 the subsurface runoff and the subsurface stormflow over the saturated areas were separated by a steady rate the subsurface stormflow over the interface can be calculated by a strategy similar to strategy s1 combining eqs 3 4 and 5 the subsurface stormflow of the unsaturated areas over the interface can be expressed as 9 r ii f u f i f i 1 f u f im 1 b 4 where f u is the infiltration from the surface to the interface f i is the areal average infiltration rate of the interface f im is the maximum infiltration capacity of the interface b 4 is the exponential of distribution of the infiltration capacity of the interface it should be noted that the infiltration from the surface to the soil f is the input of eq 9 and the notation of f u instead of f is used then the subsurface stormflow r i is equal to the sum of the infiltration excess subsurface stormflow r ii and the saturation excess subsurface stormflow r ei which can be expressed by 10 r i r ii r ei overall the five flexible runoff generation strategies discussed above consist of at least one of the three runoff components to consider the various runoff components a linear reservoir or the steady infiltration rate can be used in strategies s2 s3 and s4 and there is no special subsurface stormflow generation module due to the differences of surficial topography and the subsurface topography strategy s5 was developed to consider both the subsurface stormflow over the unsaturated and saturated areas in this study details about the five runoff generation strategies are shown in table 3 specifically strategy s1 was characterized by the infiltration excess mechanism and the subsurface stormflow was not considered strategy s2 was a saturation excess mechanism characterized model in which the subsurface stormflow was separated from the saturation excess in saturated areas strategy s3 and s4 were developed to consider both the saturation excess and infiltration excess for strategy s3 the subsurface stormflow was dealt similarly with that of strategy s2 and the subsurface stormflow was separated from the infiltrated water in saturated areas strategy s4 was intended to be an enhanced xaj model with an addition of infiltration excess runoff generated over the unsaturated area and the subsurface stormflow was separated from the saturated areas to consider the unsaturated subsurface stormflow strategy s5 was developed in this study to improve the performances of strategy s4 by assuming an interface in the unsaturated regions then the subsurface stormflow was the sum of the infiltrated subsurface stormflow and saturated subsurface stormflow 2 3 hydrological forecasting model framework the xaj model proposed by zhao et al 1980 was used as the hydrological forecasting framework in this study it mainly consists of four modules including evapotranspiration module runoff generation module runoff partition module and runoff routing module zhou et al 2019 inputs of the xaj model are the average areal rainfall as well as evaporation and output is streamflow first for the evapotranspiration module the soil profile of each sub basin is divided into three layers the upper lower and deeper layers and only when water in the layer above it has been exhausted does evaporation in the next layer occur second for the runoff generation module the saturation runoff generation method was replaced by strategies s1 to s5 respectively third the runoff partition in the xaj model divides the total runoff into three components by a free reservoir which consists of surface runoff subsurface stormflow and subsurface runoff while the runoff partition module was supposed to be changed based on the flexible runoff generation strategies as discussed in section 2 2 finally the surface runoff is routed directly to the watershed outlet of each sub basin in a source to sink form moore et al 2006 by means of the lag and route method while the subsurface stormflow and groundwater runoff are routed through linear reservoirs lu and li 2014 more details can be found in zhao et al 1980 the parameters of each runoff generation models are shown in table 4 most of these parameters are consistent with those of the xaj model and green ampt model strategies s1 to s5 are with 13 17 17 20 and 21 parameters respectively specifically the runoff generation module of strategy s1 is with the same parameters as the green ampt model the parameters of strategy s2 are the same with the xaj model the runoff generation strategy s3 is known as the vertically based runoff generation model coupling xaj model and green ampt model in the vertical direction strategy s4 is a conceptual model designed to improve the xaj model for semi arid and semi humid basins li et al 2005 strategy s5 is considered as an improved strategy s4 which considers all the three runoff generation components the interface is assumed to be spatially heterogeneous as the surface then the infiltration excess subsurface stormflow was calculated by combining the green ampt equation with the parabolic infiltration capacity distribution curve and three additional parameters were introduced in strategy s5 the schematic diagram of the flexible runoff generation method is shown in fig 3 the modelling steps are summarized as follows 1 calculate the evapotranspiration using a three layer evapotranspiration scheme 2 construct the five runoff generation strategies s1 to s5 according to the existing saturation excess mechanism infiltration excess mechanism and subsurface stormflow mechanism strategies s1 to s5 compose at least one of the runoff generation mechanisms 3 the total runoff is subdivided into three components by a free reservoir for strategies s2 and s4 while the saturation excess of the strategies s3 and s5 are subdivided into two components using the steady infiltration rate 4 the surface runoff is routed directly to the watershed outlet of each sub basin in a source to sink form by means of the lag and route method moore et al 2006 while the interflow and groundwater runoff are routed through linear reservoirs lu and li 2014 5 compare the modeling performances of the five runoff generation strategies and conduct a parameters sensitivity analysis 2 4 model calibration and evaluation the shuffled complex evolution algorithm sce ua technique was developed by the university of arizona in 1992 for nonlinear high dimension optimization issues duan et al 1992 the technique has been used extensively for calibrating hydrological models zhou et al 2019 consequently the sce ua method was employed in this study to optimize the parameters of the hydrological model a new aggregated objective function made up of three measures and aimed at maximizing flow characteristics was used for the parameter calibration brunner et al 2021 yi et al 2022 particularly the kling gupta efficiency e kg and the nash sutcliffe efficiency e ns focus on high flows the log e ns efficiency emphasizes low flows and r sr quantifies volume errors respectively the aggregated objective function and three metrics are expressed by 11 e ns 1 t 1 t q s t q o t t 1 t q o t q o 12 e kg 1 r 1 2 σ s σ o 1 2 μ s μ o 1 2 13 r sr t 1 t q o t q s t 2 t 1 t q o t q o 2 14 m 0 5 1 e ns 0 25 1 e kg 0 15 1 log e ns 0 1 r sr where q o t is the observed discharge at time t q s t is the simulated discharge at time t q o is the mean of the observed discharge t is the duration of the flood event r is the correlation coefficient between the observed and simulated flood σ s and σ o are the standard deviation values for the simulated and observed responses respectively and μ s and μ o are the corresponding mean values several criteria were used for the model performance evaluation which included the e ns e kg the relative flood peak error q p the relative flood volume error w p and the root mean square error rmse which can be expressed by 15 q p q p s q p o q p o 16 w p t 1 t w s t t 1 t w o t t 1 t w o t 17 rmse 1 t t 1 t q s t q o t 2 where q p s is the simulated flood peak discharge q p o is the observed flood peak discharge w o t is the observed flood volume at time t w s t is the simulated flood volume at time t in addition the complexity control method structural risk minimization srm was used for the model complexity analysis we can derive analytical estimates of prediction error on the basis of statistical theory in general the estimate takes the following form schoups et al 2008 18 r e r r e where r is a penalization factor r 1 penalization factor r increases as a function of model complexity relative to size of the data set various analytical forms for penalization factor r have been proposed including akaike s information criterion aic bayes information criterion bic and srm r e represents the sum of empirical error r e represents the sum of empirical error considering the model complexity srm is rooted in statistical learning theory and relies on the following expression for penalization factor r 19 r srm 1 d n d n ln d n ln n 2 n 1 where d is the vapnik chervonenkis dimension of the model or number of parameters as a measure of model complexity and n is sample size 3 study area and data the xun river basin was selected as a case study the rationality of the five runoff generation strategies was verified the xun river is a tributary of the han river which originates from shaanxi province china the xun river is 218 km long with a basin area of 6 448 km2 the mean slope of the basin is 2 9 there are 6 meteorological stations and 1 flow station the xiangjiaping station in the basin as shown in fig 4 the xun river basin is located in the mountain area with large variations in terms of topographic relief where the spatial heterogeneity of runoff generation should be considered in hydrological modelling the annual average rainfall of the whole basin is 798 mm and the annual average discharge of the xiangjiaping station is 63 4 m3 s the observed maximum flood peak discharge is 6 090 m3 s floods of the xun river basin are usually with the characteristics of high flow peak and short duration making a major threat to the downstream areas thus the single runoff generation mechanism cannot meet the needs of watershed water management the rainfall and evaporation data from the meteorological stations were collected from 2010 to 2021 the simultaneous 6 hourly runoff data from the xiangjiaping station was collected as well flow series in flood season of each year were selected to calibrate and verify the established model specifically 7 years from 2010 to 2017 were used as calibration period and 4 years from 2018 to 2021 were used as validation period due to a large error of the observed continuous flow flood season of 2016 was not considered in this study to identify the runoff generation type for each flood event 33 flood events whose flood peak is larger than 500 m3 s were identified from the continuous flow the calibration period and the validation period were the same as those of the continuous flow the statistics of these flood events are shown in table 5 the average flood peak is 1 165 m3 s and the average flood duration is about 194 h moreover to consider the initial condition the antecedent precipitation was calculated based on the daily recession coefficient of the water storage 4 results 4 1 results of runoff generation type 33 observed flood events were used to calculate the cn and c values the flood events were divided into three categories using the cn c method including the infiltration excess dominant events saturation excess dominant events and hybrid runoff generation events results are given in table 6 it can be seen from table 6 that most flood events are hybrid runoff events according to the results of the initial classification after a reclassification using the scs cn method 1 flood event were dominated by the infiltration excess runoff generation mechanism 19 flood events were dominated by the saturation excess runoff generation mechanism and 13 flood events were classified as the hybrid runoff events to this end the xun river basin was always taken as a saturation excess runoff generation watershed however nearly half of the flood events in the basin were dominated by the hybrid runoff generation mechanism and predicting the flood peak using the saturation excess runoff generation models may produce large errors therefore it is necessary to develop a hybrid runoff generation model for this basin 4 2 performances of the five runoff generation strategies the xaj model was adopted as the hydrological forecasting framework in which the runoff generation module was replaced by five runoff generation strategies the other modules remain unchanged within the xaj model seven continuous flow processes from 2010 to 2017 were used for model calibration and the rest were used to evaluate the modelling performances the evaluation index system in section 2 4 was used to evaluate the performance of different runoff generation strategies table 7 lists the n es e kg and rmse values for all the models and fig 5 shows part of the flow hydrographs of the five runoff generation methods for continuous floods in 2010 2017 2019 and 2020 among which 2010 and 2017 are the calibration years while 2019 and 2020 are the validation years it can be seen from table 6 and fig 5 that the accuracy of strategy s1 is the poorest the performances of strategy s2 are overall good but there is a problem of overestimating the flood peak discharge for some major floods such as the flood peaks in 2017 2019 and 2020 the performances of strategies s3 and s4 are similar additionally the performances of strategy s5 is slightly better than those of strategies s3 and s4 to demonstrate the model performances of different strategies more visually fig 6 gives the box plots of the evaluation index using different runoff generation strategies for continuous flow processes it can be seen from fig 6 that the average e ns of the strategies s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 are 0 38 0 47 0 63 0 60 and 0 65 the average e kg are 0 60 0 63 0 72 0 70 and 0 72 and the average rmse are 163 56 153 26 130 37 131 86 and 124 85 m3 s respectively results of the evaluation index demonstrates that strategies s3 and s4 outperformed the single runoff generation mode results of strategies s3 and s4 are similar and results of strategy s2 is better than those of strategy s1 it can be concluded that the xun river basin was dominated by the saturation excess runoff generation mechanism but the hybrid runoff generation strategy has a better performance this conclusion is consistent with the analysis of section 4 1 additionally comparing strategies s3 s4 and s5 it can be found that strategy s5 performs slightly better than strategies s3 and s4 it can be seen from the distributions of the three metrics between the lower and upper quartile values the performance of strategy s5 is more robust however the results of strategy are not necessarily superior to those of other strategies the possible reasons can be summarized as follows first the runoff generation mechanisms are various from different years or different flood events and it is a great challenge for one strategy which can get high precision for all flood processes second the flexible conceptual model is an approximation to the physically based model and cannot describe all details of hydrologic processes and error free observations for all the hydrologic processes being simulated third the choice of the flow process used for calibration is subjective and the model parameters may cannot characterize all the flood processes 4 3 comparisons of forecasting results between flood events and continuous flow the hybrid runoff generation may be more inclined to happen in semi arid semi humid areas and mountain watershed with heavy rainstorm wang et al 2022 under such conditions the large flood event attracts more attention because of its huge damage it can be seen from fig 5 that forecasting accuracy of large flood events varies significantly therefore it is necessary to discuss the accuracy of the hybrid flow generation model for large flood events therefore 33 flood events during flood season were chosen from the year 2010 to 2021 and the parameters for both the continuous flow and flood events were calibrated together in order to satisfy the need of future forecast the flow process flow peak flow volume and the occurrence time of flow peak are four main basic elements for describing the flow hydrograph e ns q p w p and t p metrics are plotted with box and whisker as shown in fig 7 fig 7 shows the distributions of evaluation index using different runoff generation strategies for flood events results show that the performance of strategy s5 outperforms other strategies the performances of the hybrid runoff generation strategies are better than those of the single runoff generation strategies for both continuous flows and flood events compared with the prediction results of the continuous flow the proposed hybrid flow generation strategy has better performances for flood events which may be that the hybrid runoff production is more likely to occur during heavy rainstorms 4 4 analysis of runoff components for the five runoff generation strategies to explore the runoff components for flood events we selected several flood events from different years detailed information of 6 flood events are given in table 8 specifically flood peaks of flood events no 20100820 20110905 20120702 and 20140908 are large and those of the flood events no 20180728 and 20190625 are low flood events no 20120702 and 20190625 are dominated by hybrid runoff generation mechanism and the other floods are classified as saturation generation types the flood peaks of flood events no 20180728 and 20190625 are similar while the runoff generation types are actually different this is because that flood event no 20190625 has a shorter flood duration and is caused by a heavy rainfall storm the stacked bar charts of runoff components for the flexible runoff generation strategies are presented in fig 8 fig 8 shows the runoff components calculated by the five runoff generation strategies for 6 flood events strategy s1 only include the surface flow strategies s2 s3 s4 and s5 includes all the 3 runoff components strategy s2 represents the saturation excess runoff generation model and its various runoff components are considered using the linear reservoir method strategies s3 and s4 considers both the saturation excess and infiltration excess runoffs while their subsurface stormflow only originates from the saturation excess moreover the surface runoff of strategy s4 is the sum of infiltration excess surface runoff and the saturation excess surface runoff the percentage of the surface flow of strategy s4 accounts for the most among the three hybrid runoff generation strategies additionally an interface was introduced in strategy s5 to consider the subsurface stormflow in the unsaturated areas theoretically strategy s5 produces the most subsurface stormflow because it considers both the saturated and unsaturated subsurface stormflow however it can be seen from fig 8 that the percentage of the subsurface stormflow in strategy s5 is less than that of strategies s3 and s4 and the proportion of the subsurface flow increased this is probably due to the changes in the structure of the hybrid runoff generation model and there is a coupling relationship between the different modules leading to changes in the proportions of the three runoff components moreover strategy s2 has the smallest subsurface stormflow proportion and the proportion of the subsurface stormflow in all flood events was below 15 it is noted that strategy s5 for flood event no 20180728 does not have a subsurface stormflow while flood event no 20190625 does as analyzed above flood event no 20180728 was caused by a heavy rainstorm within a shorter duration and other strategies could not characterize this property in the flood events with small peak discharges like strategy s5 4 5 parameters sensitivity analysis of the model based on strategy s5 sensitivity of the parameters characterizes the influence degree of the output of the model with the changes in the parameters uhlenbrook et al 1999 the objective of this section is to explore the influence of the unsaturated infiltration excess subsurface stormflow on the performance of the hybrid runoff generation model the increased parameters significantly affected the model performances to investigate whether the model uncertainty increased significantly with the increasing model complexity a sensitivity analysis for parameters of strategy s5 is necessary the proposed strategy s5 is a novel hybrid runoff generation strategy three new parameters representing the characteristics of the interface are increased while the total number of parameters is nearly consistent with strategy s4 to this end the three parameters inflicting the characteristic of interface were selected including b 4 k sl and ψ l simultaneously for the purpose of comparing the differences between the surface and the interface three parameters representing the subsurface distribution characteristics were selected including b 1 k su and ψ u additionally parameters c s c i and c g have a significant impact on the routing processes which were also selected for the sensitivity analysis to better explore the distribution and characteristics of uncertainties a flood event with a good forecasting performance in the study was chosen flood event no 20210817 was used to analyze the parameter sensitivity using the controlling variable method the relationship between the parameters and e ns and e kg values is given in fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 that the recession constants of the lower subsurface stormflow runoff storage c i the recession constants of the surface runoff storage c s the saturated hydraulic conductivity over the upper soil layer k su and the saturated hydraulic conductivity over the lower soil layer k sl were the sensitive parameters moreover the sensitivity parameters of the surface and the interface were absolutely the same liu et al 2020 has done a similar work and found that the lower subsurface stormflow runoff storage c i was not sensitive but in our study this parameter has a great influence on the model performance it may be because that the hybrid strategies in their research did not consider the interface and the subsurface stormflow was generated from the saturation excess mechanism the sensitivity analysis of other parameters was consistent with our study it can be concluded that the surface and the interface have similar physical characteristics the subsurface stormflow is essential for the xun river basin for the reasons that 1 the parameters c i has a significant influence on the model performance 2 the subsurface stormflow accounts for more than 20 percent of the total runoff 5 discussion 5 1 influence of model complexity on model performance in conceptual hydrologic models parameters are used as part of equations intended to describe hydrologic behavior and ideally models that are appropriate descriptions of the dominant processes in a catchment would perform well in such a catchment regardless of the number of parameters used pilz et al 2020 the number of model parameters is often used to explain differences in model performance and a key question that then arises is how to decide when the model has sufficient complexity several methods have been developed for this purpose all of them relying on two ingredients 1 specification of two or more model structures of varying complexity and 2 evaluation and comparison of the ability of the models to mimic observed data schoups et al 2008 statistical model selection methods and model complexity control methods are widely used for example akaike s information criterion aic bayes information criterion bic and structural risk minimization srm et al akaike 1970 schwarz 1978 khalil et al 2005 a common assumption in the development of both aic and bic is that an infinitely large data set is available for estimating prediction error however in many situations e g hydrologic prediction one is faced with limited and noisy data sets in which case these methods do not strictly apply an alternative model complexity control method that has been developed for use with finite data sets is srm thus the srm method was selected for the model complexity analysis in this study the simulated flow discharges from 2010 to 2021 were used for the model complexity analysis the sum of empirical error was characterized by the mean square error mse and the sample size is 6259 the vapnik chervonenkis dimension for strategies s1 to s5 are 13 17 17 20 21 respectively the mse considering model complexity for the five strategies are given in table 9 results show that three hybrid runoff generation models perform better than the models with single runoff generation mechanism strategy s5 still performs the best among all methods followed by the strategies s3 and s4 and it is worth noting that the accuracy of strategy 5 and strategy 3 is similar with each other the difference lies in that the performance of strategy s1 exceeds that of strategy s2 it can be concluded that the hybrid runoff generation mechanisms are more suitable for the xun river basin additionally the improvement of accuracy of strategy s5 is not caused by the increased number of parameters 5 2 conformity of strategy s5 with the reality of the watershed it can be seen from fig 8 that considering subsurface stormflow in unsaturated regions actually decreased the proportion of subsurface stormflow the possible reasons are that these five strategies are calibrated separately and if the parameters of strategy s3 and s4 remain unchanged with those of strategy s5 the proportion of subsurface stormflow for strategy s5 would be the largest to this end it is necessary to further analyze the reality of strategy s5 specifically the simulated time varying soil moisture in 2014 2017 2020 and 2021 were chosen for analysis we compared the changes of soil moisture among three hybrid runoff generation strategies the time varying soil moisture of the strategies s3 s4 and s5 are shown in fig 10 below it can be seen from fig 10 that the time varying soil moisture of the three strategies were basically consistent which means that the runoff depth calculated by the three strategies are with small variation it is worth noting that the soil moisture content of strategy s5 is between that of strategy s3 and strategy s4 thus if strategies s3 and s4 reflected the reality of the watershed there is no evidence that strategy s5 was wrong however this indeed raise a problem that whether we can really model subsurface stormflow correctly without the observation on the scale of interest determining and quantifying the subsurface stormflow generating processes is a challenging task as they cannot be observed directly currently the quality of a rainfall runoff model is still assessed by comparing modelled and observed total runoff at a gauge often situated at the catchment outlet the assumption is that if the model discharge fits the discharge observations satisfyingly subsurface stormflow is also simulated correctly although this is not necessarily true particularly when considering changes in subsurface stormflow contributions over the course of an event chifflard et al 2019 however this is an accepted compromise in challenging hydrological studies 6 conclusions an improved flexible hybrid runoff generation model coupled with the saturation excess mechanism infiltration excess mechanism and subsurface stormflow mechanism was proposed the flexible runoff generation strategy considered the subsurface stormflow over the both unsaturated and saturated areas can be used for watersheds dominated by different runoff generation mechanisms the xun river basin was selected as a case study the cn c method was used to identify runoff generation types the xaj model was selected as the hydrological forecasting framework and simulated results of the five strategies for both continues flow and flood events were compared and discussed in details in addition the sensitivity analysis of the parameters of the proposed strategy s5 was conducted the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 a novel conceptual strategy for subsurface stormflow in the unsaturated areas over the interface was proposed through a combination of the green ampt equation with the parabolic infiltration capacity distribution curve the subsurface stormflow was the sum of the infiltration excess subsurface stormflow and the saturation excess subsurface stormflow the saturation excess infiltration excess as well as subsurface stormflow mechanisms were used and combined to form an improved flexible runoff generation strategy namely s5 in this study 2 five runoff generation strategies were used for flood prediction and the cn c method was used for flood events classification results shows that the xun river basin is dominated by the saturation excess mechanism while the accuracy of the saturation excess runoff generation strategy s2 is lower than that of the hybrid runoff generation strategies s3 s4 and s5 it is found that the hybrid runoff generation mechanisms are the most suitable for the xun river basin 3 predicted hydrographs and criteria of the case study for both the continuous flow processes and the flood events shows that the accuracy of strategy s5 is the highest followed by strategies s3 s4 and s2 and finally strategy s1 moreover the performances of flood events are better than those of the continuous flow processes indicating that the high and low flow discharges may have different runoff generation mechanisms 4 the sensitivity analysis of the parameters was conducted for strategy s5 results of sensitivity analysis show that the accuracy of the simulation results is affected significantly by the infiltration excess subsurface stormflow over the unsaturated areas and the physical characteristic of the interface is similar to that of the surface the sensitive parameters of strategy s5 consist of the recession constants of the lower subsurface stormflow runoff storage c i the recession constants of the surface runoff storage c s the

2078,understanding the role of river discharge on tide river dynamics is of essential importance for sustainable water management flood control salt intrusion and navigation in estuarine environments it is well known that river discharge impacts fundamental tide river dynamics especially in terms of subtidal residual water levels and tidal properties amplitudes and phases for different tidal constituents however the quantification of the impact of river discharge on tide river dynamics is challenging due to the complex interactions of barotropic tides with channel geometry bottom friction and river discharge in this study we propose a data driven model to quantify the impact of river discharge on tide river dynamics using water level time series data collected through long term observations along an estuary with substantial variations in river discharge the proposed model has a physically based structure representing the tide river interaction and can be used to predict water level using river discharge as the sole predictor the satisfactory correspondence of the model outputs with measurements at six gauging stations along the yangtze river estuary suggest that the proposed model can serve as a powerful instrument to quantify the impacts of river discharge on tide river dynamics including time varying tidal properties and tidal distortion and separate the contribution made by riverine and tidal forcing on water level the proposed approach is very efficient and can be applied to other estuaries showing considerable impacts of river discharge on tide river dynamics keywords residual water level tidal properties harmonic analysis data driven model water management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction quantifying the impact of river discharge on tide river dynamics in terms of subtidal and tidal properties residual water level amplitudes and phases is challenging because tides in rivers are highly nonlinear and nonstationary due to nontidal processes jay and flinchem 1997 1999 matte et al 2013 2014 2018 pan et al 2018a b zhou et al 2018 however understanding the tide river interplay is essential for many purposes such as for flood control tidal elevation prediction sediment transport and to understand estuarine ecosystems in general kukulka and jay 2003b hoitink and jay 2016 hoitink et al 2017 du et al 2018 jones et al 2020 more specifically accurate predictions of water surface elevation variations under the influence of river discharge are essential to assess the risk of costal inundation and to plan navigation projects since the dynamics of subtidal water levels and tidal properties are strongly related to the changes in river discharge buschman et al 2009 sassi and hoitink 2013 kastner et al 2019 moreover exploring the historical development of water level dynamics with river discharge along an estuary may provide insights into the impacts of natural e g global sea level rise and anthropogenic e g dam construction sand excavation dredging land reclamation changes on sediment transport and ecosystem dynamics over a wide range of time scales jay et al 2011 it is well known that as a tide propagates from the ocean into an estuary it is increasingly distorted and damped due to nonlinear interactions of the barotropic tides with channel geometry bottom friction and river discharge godin 1985 1999 horrevoets et al 2004 cai et al 2014 2016 zhou et al 2017 to understand such dynamics a number of modelling techniques have been developed empirical regression models linking tidal properties to river discharge are commonly used to predict the variation in the tides as a function of river discharge godin 1985 1999 jay and flinchem 1997 kukulka and jay 2003a buschman et al 2009 sassi and hoitink 2013 although they cannot specify the underlying nonlinear interaction mechanisms of the tide with bottom friction due to bed forms and external forcing e g river discharge alternatively many researchers used physically based numerical modelling to quantify the impact of river discharge on tide river dynamics godin and martinez 1994 lu et al 2015 guo et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 2018b this approach accounts for complex channel geometry and accurate boundary conditions and provides elevation and velocity outputs at both temporally and spatially high resolutions however it should be noted that constant river discharge is usually incorporated in these numerical models in order to extract tidal properties of different constituents using traditional harmonic analyses thus the response of tidal properties to varying levels of river discharge is generally not addressed matte et al 2014 in recent years based on certain assumptions in both geometry and flow characteristics analytical models focusing on a single predominant tidal constituent e g m 2 can be used to understand the underlying mechanism of tide river interplay and the impact of river discharge on tidal damping horrevoets et al 2004 schuttelaars et al 2013 cai et al 2014 2016 2018 2019 wang et al 2021 however these analytical models can only capture the first order tide river dynamics due to the fact that they usually neglect the nonlinear interactions among tidal constituents e g k 1 s 2 m 4 msf unlike the traditional harmonic analysis pawlowicz et al 2002 which is only applicable to stationary signals i e signals not influenced by time varying external factors other than astronomical forcing several methods have been developed to better understand the impact of river discharge on tide river dynamics including short term harmonic analyses guo et al 2015 continuous wavelet transforms jay and flinchem 1997 empirical mode decompositions pan et al 2018a and nonstationary harmonic analyses matte et al 2013 2014 pan et al 2018b gan et al 2019 however most of them cannot directly obtain the time varying harmonic constants for each individual tidal constituent owing to the varying levels of river discharge except the nonstationary harmonic analyses in this study building on the previous studies by matte et al 2013 2014 that used the river discharge and ocean tidal range as model inputs for predicting tides in tidal rivers ns tide we propose a modified version termed as r tide representing river discharge driven harmonic analysis that uses river discharge as the only model input to assess the impact on the temporal variation in residual water levels and tidal properties although the perturbations of the tidal signal may arise due to multiple sources of external forcing oceanic meteorological hydrological or climatic we argue that the major modulation made to the tides in tidal rivers can be primarily attributed to the impacts caused by river discharge since the overall contribution of nontidal oceanic processes short term storm surge or long term sea level rise is relatively small in addition we also argue that the tidal properties along a tidal river can be well reconstructed by a series of independent tidal constituents together with a river stage term this indicates that the time varying tidal properties are only driven by the varying levels of river discharge thus the extracted tidal properties would remain constant for a given constant river discharge which is different from the ns tide model owing to the impact caused by the imposed oceanic forcing the advantage of identification of time varying tidal properties allows us to explore the way in which the tide deforms along the estuary as a function of river discharge this paper is organized as follows the model derived from ns tide is described in section 2 along with the objective function adopted for model calibration and validation in section 3 the proposed approach is applied to the yangtze river estuary in china the results discuss tidal distortion and the relative importance of tidal and riverine forcing on tide river dynamics section 4 finally some conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 data driven model to analyse water level in order to quantify the impact of river discharge on tide river dynamics a modified nonstationary tidal harmonic analysis r tide using river discharge as the only external forcing was used to understand the temporal changes in residual water levels and tidal properties tidal amplitudes and phases the r tide source code is available at https github com huayangcai r tide matlab toolbox the method is based on the classical harmonic analysis doodson 1921 where the water level z is typically described as 1 z t b 0 0 k 1 n b 1 k cos σ k t b 2 k sin σ k t where t is the time σ k are priori prescribed frequencies k 1 2 3 n corresponds to various tidal constituents and b 0 0 b 1 k and b 2 k are unknown coefficients that are determined using a regression analysis based on the principle of least squares to investigate the properties of the nonlinear and nonstationary tides in rivers caused by the variation in river discharge we followed the approach proposed by matte et al 2013 2014 the time varying river discharge is directly incorporated as a functional representation which was theoretically derived from a tidal wave propagation model jay 1991 kukulka and jay 2003a b jay et al 2011 unlike the original ns tide model that uses the greater diurnal tidal range i e the difference between higher high water and lower low water within a lunar day to represent the external oceanic forcing e g the neap spring variations we argue that the influence of oceanic forcing can well be represented by the usual harmonic constituents e g m 2 k 1 msf and the mutual nonlinear interactions among different tidal components which is the essence of classical harmonic analysis based on the tidal potential theory proposed by doodson 1921 it is also worth noting that in river deltas with multiple branches it is often difficult to identify a gauging station where the greater diurnal tidal range is representative of the whole delta based on this assumption the model is driven using river discharge as the sole predictor and can advantageously be applied to river deltas with complex morphologies in this case the unknown constants b 0 0 b 1 k and b 2 k in eq 1 can be expressed as a function of river discharge alone 2 b l k t a 0 l k a 1 l k q q k t where l is the index for coefficients l 0 1 2 corresponding to the three unknown coefficients presented in eq 1 q k a 0 l k and a 1 l k are the regression coefficients for each observatory station and frequency band in addition for each gauging station for the sake of simplification a constant time lag τ in hours was imposed to the forcing variable q accounting for the average travelling time of river discharge propagating to the station hence the coefficients b l k t can be modified as follows 3 b l k t a 0 l k a 1 l k q q k t τ after substituting eq 3 into eq 1 the final model of water level z can be derived using two time dependent parts 4 z t s t f t 5 s t a 0 0 0 a 1 0 0 q q 0 t τ 6 f t k 1 n a 0 1 k a 1 1 k q q k t τ cos σ k t k 1 n a 0 2 k a 1 2 k q q k t τ sin σ k t where s and f are calculated using the residual water level model and the tidal fluvial water level model respectively it is worth noting that the calibrated model parameters describe the system as a whole thus implicitly accounting for some factors of difficult quantification in addition to the usual river discharge like the influence of friction effect due to bed forms with eqs 4 6 the relative importance in terms of variance contributions induced by riverine p r and tidal p t forcing can be computed by the following formula 7 p r var s t var s t f t p t var f t var s t f t for a specific gauging station if the river discharge is negligible q 0 then the proposed data driven model eq 4 can be simplified as the classical harmonic tidal model eq 1 on the other hand for the case of large river discharge we also define a critical river discharge q c beyond which the tidal properties such as amplitudes and phases should be set to be identical as those q q c see the same strategy adopted in ns tide matte et al 2013 owing to the model s inaccuracy at very high discharge in practice we initially run the r tide model by setting the q c value being the observed maximum river discharge i e without specifying the value of q c and determine the actual q c from the computed tidal phase river discharge curve where the q c corresponds to the critical value with maximum shift of tidal phase with respect to river discharge i e maximum gradient if q q c the fluctuation of water level is mainly driven by the alteration in river discharge with negligible tidal influence and hence the data driven model eq 4 is reduced to the classical stage river discharge relationship eq 5 specifically when the river discharge is larger than the critical value q c we adopted the correction factor f f proposed by matte et al 2013 for the tidal fluvial model which can be described as 8 f f min q c i q i 1 in this case in eq 8 we set q i q c i if q i q c i it should be noted that for each studied gauging station we defined the eventually critical river discharge q c by using the minimum q c value among the significant tidal components e g msf m 2 k 1 m 4 this is due to the fact that the responses of different constituents to river discharge are highly nonlinear especially for large river discharges when the tide is approaching vanishing 2 2 constituent selection and rayleigh criterion it is well known that most harmonic codes such as t tide adopted the twofold strategy to select constituents for analysis this means that the rayleigh criterion is used a priori to select constituents to include in the analysis while the significance of constituents based on error estimates is used posteriori to exclude those that are not significant here in order to account for the nonstationary feature introduced by the nonlinear effects due to river discharge and bottom friction we adopted a modified rayleigh criterion δ σ proposed by matte et al 2013 specifically for given two adjacent tidal frequencies σ 1 and σ 2 we can define the minimal allowable frequency separation δ σ 9 σ 1 σ 2 δ σ with 0 δ σ h σ d σ 0 h σ d σ 1 η where h σ is the normalized power spectrum of q q and η is a user defined criterion representing a fraction of its total spectral power matte et al 2013 in this study we adopted η 0 05 the error model adopted here is exactly the same as that used in ns tide here a correlated noise model see details in matte et al 2013 describing the uncertainty in model parameters which is propagated to the tidal amplitudes and phases via monte carlo simulations the output of this computation is then used to define a signal to noise ratio snr defined as the square of the ratio of amplitude to amplitude error which is then used as a criterion for constituent output or selection since both the amplitude and phase errors are time variant the mean snr is used to identify these constituents with snr greater than 2 for the further analysis for more details concerning the noise models and parametric estimations in common tidal packages readers can refer to innocenti et al 2022 2 3 objective functions for model calibration and validation in this study the optimized q and τ at a given station are obtained by means of the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm kennedy and eberhart 1995 which is a population based stochastic optimization technique for a given metric for details refer to appendix with the obtained q and τ values a regression model can be used to determine the coefficients a 0 l k and a 1 l k based on the least square method here the root mean square error rmse between the observed z and the simulated z water level was chosen to be the metric of model performance defined as 10 rmse 1 m i 1 m z i z i 2 where m is the total number of observed samples in addition we also used the commonly used coefficient of determination r 2 to evaluate the overall performance of the data driven model 11 r 2 1 i 1 m z i z i 2 i 1 m z i z 2 where z represents the mean of the observed water levels 3 application to the yangtze river estuary 3 1 study site and data the yangtze river estuary located in the seaward end of the yangtze river drains into the east china sea fig 1 river discharge data near the estuary head from datong denoted by dt hydrological station located at about 640 km landward from the mouth was already available this data collected from 1950 2012 indicates an annual mean discharge of around 28 200 m 3 s 1 with a monthly mean maximum value of 49 500 m 3 s 1 in july and a minimum value of 11 300 m 3 s 1 in january cai et al 2016 the estuary features meso tidal characteristics with a mean tidal range of 2 66 m and a spring tidal range of up to 5 m based on multi year observations near the mouth zhang et al 2012 in this study water level data from 2002 to 2012 from six gauging stations along the estuary tianshenggang tsg jiangyin jy zhenjiang zj nanjing nj maanshan mas wuhu wh was obtained from the yangtze hydrology bureau of the people s republic of china since the yangtze river estuary is characterized by a dominant semidiurnal tidal signal the collected water level time series data generally contained two high and two low water levels for each day which was then interpolated to one hour intervals for nonstationary harmonic analysis by using the shape preserving piecewise cubic interpolation figure s1 see supporting information shows that the correspondence between the interpolated and observed water levels at nj gauging station is good with a reasonable rmse being 0 27 m on the other hand figure s2 see supporting information shows the power spectra density of observed and interpolated water levels where we observe a similar frequency structure especially for the low frequency bands in general the results show that the tidal water levels derived from such an interpolation method can well retain the power spectra of low frequency bands and principal tides e g m 2 k 1 while the high frequency bands d 8 and higher may not be entirely reproduced daily mean river discharge observed at the dt hydrological station was interpolated using the same approach as with water levels and then imposed as an upstream boundary for the nonstationary harmonic analysis during the study period 2002 2012 the maximum and minimum daily river discharge was 66 600 m 3 s 1 and 8 380 m 3 s 1 respectively the interpolated water level and river discharge time series data used in the data driven model are depicted in figures s3 and s4 respectively see supporting information fig 2 illustrates the along channel variation in season averaged tidal range and water levels wet season from may to october dry season from november to april from 2002 to 2012 at the six gauging stations the seasonal differences in tidal range and water levels tend to increase in the landward direction owing to the seasonal regulation of river discharge specifically the seasonal differences in the tidal range are minimum in the seaward reach with variations of 0 01 m and 0 04 m at tsg and jy respectively but increase more than 0 2 m upstream see fig 2a and table s1 in the supporting information this indicates that the impact of river discharge on tide river dynamics in the seaward reach is negligible similarly the seasonal difference in residual water level gradually increases from 0 67 m at tsg to 3 17 m at wh consequently the yangtze river estuary being studied here can be divided into two sectors based on the seasonal variations in tidal range and water levels the seaward reach between the tsg and jy which is tide dominated and characterized by minimum seasonal variation and the upstream reach between the jy and wh which is river dominated and characterized by relatively large seasonal variation 3 2 model performance based on the constituent selection criterion presented in section 2 2 the selected constituents and the corresponding optimized exponents q k k 1 2 9 are displayed in table 1 thus the hourly water level data was broken down into residual water levels and 35 tidal constituents by means of the proposed data driven model presented in section 2 1 as a general setup we used the first 2 3 2002 2008 of the measured time series data for model calibration and the remaining 1 3 2009 2012 for model validation an example of matlab scripts is provided at open access r tide matlab toolbox comparisons between modelled and observed water levels at the six gauging stations during the calibration period 2002 2008 presented a favourable general correspondence fig 3 it is worth noting that some apparent outliers exist in fig 3 mainly due to unrealistic interpolation when there is missing data between the two nearby interpolated points the calibrated parameters q τ and q c for each frequency band are presented in table 1 it can be observed from table 1 that the calibrated time lag τ accounting for the mean travelling time of river discharge propagating to the studied tidal gauging station does increase in the seaward direction with the maximum time lag occurred in tsg station being 14 82 hr for the critical river discharges q c they are 58 088 m 3 s 49 531 m 3 s and 44 653 m 3 s at nj mas and wh stations respectively based on the reproduced tidal phase river discharge curves and the corresponding gradient curves see figure s5 in the supporting information without specifying the value of q c critical river discharges are not available for other stations tsg jy and zj stations due to the strong influence of tidal forcing as expected it can be seen from figure s6 see the supporting information that the reproduced daily averaged water level is almost linearly proportional to the river discharge if q q c the model was consecutively applied during the validation period 2009 2012 using the same values of the coefficients calibrated between 2002 and 2008 the comparison of predicted and observed water levels during the validation period can be seen in figure s7 see the supporting information the model performances in terms of rmse and the coefficient of determination r 2 are shown in table 2 for both the calibration and validation periods the rmse for both calibration and validation was always smaller than 0 30 m and the values of r 2 were always larger than 0 91 which suggests that the model can successfully reproduce the water level dynamics along the estuary in addition we note that the model performance for the upstream stations the mas and wh stations was generally better than for those located downstream the tsg and jy stations this could be due to the fact that the linkage between water level dynamics and river discharge is much stronger in the upper river dominated region compared to the downstream tide dominated region of the estuary although the model performance can be improved by including more tidal constituents such as the solar annual constituent sa and the solar semiannual constituent ssa see also table s2 in the supporting information for the model performance when manually including sa and ssa for these downstream stations here we did not manually include these nonsignificant constituents since the relationship between the amplitudes or phases of major tidal constituents and river discharge is not significantly affected by the number of constituents selected in the analysis see figure s8 in the supporting information for an illustration to clarify the model performance of r tide the ns tide was also applied to the yangtze river estuary where we do observe a slightly better performance in the seaward stations tsg and jy stations owing to the additional input from greater diurnal tidal range term using the data from tsg station while the performance in the upstream river dominated region zj nj mas and wh is more or less the same see table 2 however it can be seen from figures s8 and s9 see the supporting information that the extracted tidal amplitudes and phases taking m 2 s 2 m 4 o 1 and k 1 tides as example at tsg and mas stations are strongly fluctuant for the whole channel even in the very upstream river dominated region this is mainly due to the fact that the driven tidal range term is featured by typical neap spring and monthly changes consequently the inclusion of the additional tidal range term may hinder the establishment of correct relationship between tidal amplitude and river discharge in addition it can be observed from figure s8 that the quantities of m 2 s 2 m 4 o 1 and k 1 tidal amplitude remains more or less the same for different numbers of tidal constituents selected in the analysis which suggests that the proposed r tide model is robust with regard to the reproduction of river tide dynamics when compared to the ns tide however it is worth noting that the model performance is closely related to the number of tidal constituents selected owing to the regression model adopted for fitting the observed water levels see table s3 in the supporting information especially for the tide dominated regions such as tsg jy and zj stations 3 3 impact of river discharge on residual water levels and tidal properties 3 3 1 variation in residual water levels fig 4 illustrates the spatial variations in the modelled residual water levels s eq 5 along with its slope δ s as a function of the imposed river discharge q at the dt hydrological station we observe that both variables increase approximately linearly with river discharge here we assume a constant residual water level slope over the tsg jy reach as expected the residual water level rises in the landward direction due to a steady and positive slope in the water level which is mainly induced by the residual frictional effect caused by tide river interactions sassi and hoitink 2013 cai et al 2016 in addition we note that the difference in residual water levels between two nearby gauging stations tends to increase with river discharge see fig 4a since the residual water level slope is positively correlated with river discharge in fig 4b we observe that the maximum residual water level slope occurred in central part of the yangtze river estuary i e the jy zj reach and the difference between the central reach and the upstream reach i e the zj wh reach increased with the river discharge this is mainly due to a larger increase of δ s with the river discharge in the central reach when compared with that in the upstream reach since the residual water level slope is mainly balanced by the residual frictional effect e g sassi and hoitink 2013 cai et al 2016 this suggests the maximum tidal damping occurred in the central part as well which has important implications for sediment transport flood control and tidal propagation etc moreover the different responses of the residual water level and slope between the seaward and upstream parts of the estuary are also indicated by the calibrated q 0 values at the six gauging stations see table 1 and eq 5 with relative smaller q 0 values q 0 0 443 0 491 in the seaward reach tsg and jy stations compared to those in the upstream reach q 0 0 674 it is worth noting that the residual water levels are featured by a typical neap spring variation owing to the periodic dynamics of subtidal friction e g guo et al 2020 this phenomenon can be clearly observed by reproducing the water level making use of the low frequency tides e g msf mm constituents unlike the ns tide stage model representing the low frequency variations in water levels matte et al 2013 2014 the current r tide model implicitly accounts for the neap spring changes by the usual low frequency harmonic constituents and the mutual nonlinear interactions among semi diurnal or diurnal tides see figures s10 and s11 in the supporting information consequently the reconstructed water levels from ns tide stage model are comparable with those reconstructed by the sum of r tide stage model and low frequency tides see figure s12 in the supporting information 3 3 2 variation in tidal properties it is worth noting that the proposed approach allows residual water levels and tidal properties to be modelled separately as a function of time varying river discharge fig 5 illustrates the spatial variations in the modelled tidal amplitudes denoted by a of six major tidal constituents o 1 k 1 m 2 s 2 m 4 ms 4 as a function of river discharge which provides direct insights into the impact of river discharge on tide river dynamics it can be clearly observed from fig 5a b e f that in the seaward reach tsg jy where the tide dominates the river discharge the extracted amplitudes of diurnal o 1 k 1 and quarter diurnal m 4 and ms 4 tides generally increase with the river discharge on the other hand the amplitudes of the dominant semidiurnal constituents m 2 s 2 slightly decrease with river discharge see fig 5c d as a result the seasonal variation in the overall tidal amplitude at tsg and jy stations are minor in the upstream reach jy wh we see a general decrease in tidal amplitudes for all the constituents as river discharge increases which is primarily due to the tidal damping by the river discharge and bottom friction in addition we note that the variation of tidal amplitudes in the upstream mas wh reach is minor for very high river flow conditions 50 000 m 3 s 1 approximately such a phenomenon is primarily due to reduced residual friction caused by the increase in residual water level 6 m see fig 4a fig 6 shows the spatial variations in the phases denoted by ϕ of tidal constituents along the yangtze river estuary as a function of river discharge in general we observe a weak decreasing phase as river discharge increases in the seaward reach of the estuary tsg jy this suggests that the tidal waves travel slightly faster with increasing river discharge this is likely due to the increase in the residual water level and hence larger water depth and less effective friction caused by river discharge fig 4a on the contrary for the upstream reach jy wh the phases tend to increase with river discharge since the river discharge exerts a primary impact on tidal damping for each tidal constituent as wave celerity is generally negatively correlated with tidal damping garel and cai 2018 the travelling time is increased with river discharge it is worth examining the difference in tidal damping rate δ a defined as the amplitude difference between two adjacent stations over the distance for different tidal constituents as a function of river discharge see fig 7 noticeably positive tidal damping rates are only observed for the quarter diurnal constituents m 4 and ms 4 along the tsg jy reach which indicates an increase in amplitude contrarily the tidal damping rates for semidiurnal and diurnal constituents are negative with maximum damping observed for the m 2 tide followed by the s 2 tide a larger tidal damping rate for semidiurnal compared to diurnal constituents especially in the seaward reach suggests a stronger damping of astronomical tides with higher frequencies see also godin and martinez 1994 godin 1999 meanwhile we also observed that the most significant damping occurred at the jy zj reach where the tidal damping rate for the m 2 tide exceeds 6 mm km and the corresponding residual water level slope or residual friction is the maximum for the whole estuary in the upstream parts of the estuary the damping of the quarter diurnal species generally reduces with the river discharge while those of the semidiurnal and diurnal constituents remain more or less the same the underlying mechanism is mainly due to the imbalance between the channel convergence effect and the residual friction effect for more details regarding this issue please refer to cai et al 2019 the fortnightly msf tide with a tidal period of 14 7653 days mainly generated by the nonlinear interaction between the semidiurnal constituents m 2 and s 2 is one of the primary low frequency constituents in tidal rivers aubrey and speer 1985 parker 1991 due to its long wavelength and the difficulties in separating fortnightly tides from effects of highly variable river discharge msf river interactions have received limited attention guo et al 2020 fig 8 shows the extracted amplitude and phase of the msf tidal constituent as a function of river discharge indicating a very similar wave behaviour compared to that of the m 4 specifically for low river discharge conditions q 25 000 m 3 s 1 the msf amplitude significantly increases in the seaward reach tsg to zj and gradually decreases at the upstream stations see fig 8a amplification in the seaward reach with a maximum of 0 21 m observed at the zj station indicates that the msf generating effect is greater than the frictional damping effect induced by bottom friction and river discharge on the other hand for high river discharge conditions q 25 000 m 3 s 1 the inflection point retreated seaward to the jy station owing to the enhanced frictional effect with regard to the phase it can be seen from fig 8b that the phase was slightly increased with river discharge at the tsg station while it remained more or less the same for the jy and zj stations which suggests a relatively minor impact due to river discharge for the stations in the upstream reach i e mas wh we observe an increase of phase by approximately 30 due to the considerable damping of river discharge 4 discussion 4 1 alteration in tidal form and distortion numbers as a tide propagates into an estuary it becomes distorted due to the nonlinear impact from channel geometry bottom friction and river discharge buschman et al 2009 sassi and hoitink 2013 the tidal regime can be classified by using the tidal form number f nos 2000 defined as 12 f a o 1 a k 1 a m 2 a s 2 for f 0 25 the tide is classified as semidiurnal for 0 25 f 1 5 the tide is mixed mainly semidiurnal for 1 5 f 3 0 the tide is mixed mainly diurnal and for f 3 0 the tide is diurnal on the other hand the degree of distortion and the nature of tidal asymmetry can be characterized by the tidal distortion number d friedrichs and aubrey 1988 defined as 13 d a m 4 a m 2 where the larger the d value the more distorted the tide and the more strongly flood or ebb dominant the system becomes in fig 9a we observe that the tidal form number f generally increases in the landward direction which is mainly due to the larger tidal damping of the semidiurnal tides when compared with diurnal tides this phenomenon is consistent with that reported by godin 1999 who showed that the tidal damping is frequency dependent thus those with the higher frequencies e g semi diurnals are being damped faster than lower frequencies e g diurnals owing to the nonlinear effects of bottom friction river discharge and geometry in general the tidal regime in the yangtze river estuary is classified as mixed mainly semidiurnal since the tidal form number 0 25 f 1 5 indicates a relatively large diurnal inequality in the high or low waters or both in addition the larger the river discharge the larger the tidal form number regarding the tidal distortion number d it can be seen from fig 9b that the d value increases along the seaward reach tsg jy due to the amplification of the m 4 tide along with the strong damping of the m 2 tide furthermore as river discharge increases so does the d value this suggests that the m 4 generating effect is greater than the frictional damping effect of m 4 in the seaward reach the variation in the d values in the upstream parts of the estuary is relatively complex owing to the highly nonlinear interplay between the tide and river discharge at the zj gauging station the d values are larger than those downstream for river discharge less than around 20 000 m 3 s 1 and they are less than values at the jy where the river discharge exceeds around 20 000 m 3 s 1 for stations upstream of nj it appears that there is a critical river discharge value approximately 30 000 m 3 s 1 corresponding to a maximum d value beyond which d decreases with the river discharge this has to do with the fact that the damping rates of m 2 and m 4 varied with river discharge specifically for river discharge ranging between 10 000 30 000 m 3 s 1 the damping rate of m 2 is much faster than that of m 4 leading to an increase of d value with river discharge the case is quite opposite when the river discharge exceeds approximately 30 000 m 3 s 1 resulting in a reduction of d value with increasing river discharge 4 2 relative importance of tidal and riverine forcing on water level using eqs 4 6 the contributions made by tidal and riverine forcing to the temporal variation in water level can be quantified by computing their variances and the contribution made by each component to the total variance fig 10 fig 10 confirms that both the tsg and jy stations are tide dominated as the annual mean variance caused by the tidal level is significantly larger than that caused by river stage on the other hand the stations located in the upstream regions can be classified as river dominated owing to the larger variance induced by river stage on average the contribution made by the tidal forcing to the overall water level variance is 76 54 and 57 47 at the tsg and jy gauging stations respectively the more upstream the location of the station the higher the contribution made by the riverine forcing to the overall water level variance in particular the contribution made by the riverine forcing gradually increase from 89 84 at zj to 99 39 at wh it is worth quantifying the monthly variability in relative importance between tidal and riverine forcing as this has significant implications for water management in general such as flood control navigation and salt intrusion fig 11 shows the monthly variation in the tidal and riverine contributions where we can see a very distinct response between the seaward and upstream parts of the estuary in the seaward reach tsg jy reach where the tide dominates over the river discharge two local minimum values of tidal forcing contributions occurred in may and september while a local maximum contribution occurred in july in particular these two local minimum tidal contributions in may and september correspond to the two local maximum variances see figure s13 in the supporting information in daily averaged river discharge observed at dt hydrological station owing to the strong fluctuations during the dry to wet and wet to dry transitions on the contrary the local maximum tidal contribution in july approximately corresponds to the local minimum variance in daily averaged river discharge observed in june in the upstream parts of the estuary where river discharge dominates over the tide we observe a clear seasonal pattern with a markedly larger riverine forcing contribution during the wet season may october compared to the dry season november to april in addition this contribution is approximately constant from may to september for a detailed assessment of the relative contributions made by both tidal and riverine forcing in each month please refer to table s4 in the supporting information 4 3 implications for tidal rivers worldwide the mutual interactions between tides and river flow have been extensively studied in many tidal rivers worldwide such as the columbia river estuary e g jay et al 2011 2015 the st lawrence river estuary e g godin 1999 matte et al 2014 the mahakam river e g buschman et al 2009 sassi and hoitink 2013 the yangtze river estuary e g guo et al 2015 2020 and the pearl river estuary e g zhang et al 2018a these studies have highlighted the importance of bottom friction channel convergence and river discharge on the alterations in tidal amplitude phase and shape as tidal waves travelling into tidal rivers in this study with the proposed r tide harmonic model using the river discharge as the sole predictor it is possible to isolate and to quantify the impacts of time varying river discharge on the tidal properties of individual tidal constituent which is particularly useful for further understanding the underlying mechanism of tides and river flow interplay especially for the responses of different tidal constituents to the river discharge moreover the proposed data driven model provides a new yet effective tool for quantifying the impacts of freshwater regulation due to dam s operation on the downstream tide river dynamics this can be made by using the data driven model calibrated during the pre dam period to reconstruct the tide river dynamics that would have occurred in absence of the dam s freshwater regulation in this direction and taking the yangtze river estuary as a significant case study our contribution provides a novel approach for quantifying the impact of dam s operation on tide river dynamics which is particularly useful for setting scientific guidelines for dam s operation and related water resources management similar approach can be adopted to quantify the potential effect of river discharge alteration induced by the climate change owing to the global warming land use cover change or intensifying precipitation and so on 5 conclusions in this study we propose a simple yet effective data driven model building on the previously developed nonstationary harmonic analysis ns tide matte et al 2013 2014 to quantify the impacts of river discharge on tide river dynamics the model requires only river discharge as input data which makes the proposed model a powerful tool for modelling and predicting water level in estuaries with substantial freshwater discharge like the ns tide this model allows distinguishing frequencies within the tidal bands and extracts time series data of subtidal residual water levels and tidal properties amplitudes and phases as a function of river discharge for each resolved tidal frequency the advantages of the proposed model lie in the correct reproduction of relationship between tidal amplitude and river discharge since it does not need a tidal range term in the seaward boundary and removing the dependency on a coastal station especially when no representative coastal station is available e g in river deltas moreover the proposed model can help explore the energy transfer among different tidal bands the means by which a tide deforms with river discharge and the relative importance between riverine and tidal forcing on water level the application to the yangtze river estuary with substantial freshwater discharge and nonstationary tide suggests that the model can successfully reproduce the dynamics of river tides with a hindcast explaining more than 90 of the original signal variance and an rmse of less than 0 30 m for a four year period with highly variable river discharge the successful application to the yangtze river estuary indicates that the proposed approach can be a particularly useful tool for tidal prediction and associated water management measures such as flood control navigation and salt intrusion etc in other estuaries showing considerable impact of river

particle swarm optimization pso algorithm the particle swarm optimization pso is a multi agent based meta heuristic approach that attempts to improve a candidate solution concerning a given measure of quality candidate solutions are described as a population of particles which are driven to move within the search space according to simple mathematical formulae based on the particle s position and velocity the computation process of the standard pso algorithm consists of a velocity particle moving velocity v update step and a position particle position x update step these updates are controlled by the inertia weight and two learning factors related to cognitive local best known solution and social knowledge exchange global best known solution for the whole search space in the standard pso algorithm each particle s movement is guided toward the best known positions by its own individual best position denoted by p and global best position denoted by g the velocity and position are updated according to the following equations a 1 v k 1 i d ω v k i d c 1 r 1 d p k i d x k i d c 2 r 2 d g k d x k i d a 2 x k 1 i d x k i d v k i d where the superscript i indicates the i th particle

in general a large value of inertia weight facilitates the global exploration while a small value tends to facilitate the local exploration parameters c 1 and c 2 are acceleration coefficients representing the weight of the stochastic acceleration terms that move each particle toward the local best known p and global best known g positions respectively parameters r 1 d and r 2 d are the d

2078,understanding the role of river discharge on tide river dynamics is of essential importance for sustainable water management flood control salt intrusion and navigation in estuarine environments it is well known that river discharge impacts fundamental tide river dynamics especially in terms of subtidal residual water levels and tidal properties amplitudes and phases for different tidal constituents however the quantification of the impact of river discharge on tide river dynamics is challenging due to the complex interactions of barotropic tides with channel geometry bottom friction and river discharge in this study we propose a data driven model to quantify the impact of river discharge on tide river dynamics using water level time series data collected through long term observations along an estuary with substantial variations in river discharge the proposed model has a physically based structure representing the tide river interaction and can be used to predict water level using river discharge as the sole predictor the satisfactory correspondence of the model outputs with measurements at six gauging stations along the yangtze river estuary suggest that the proposed model can serve as a powerful instrument to quantify the impacts of river discharge on tide river dynamics including time varying tidal properties and tidal distortion and separate the contribution made by riverine and tidal forcing on water level the proposed approach is very efficient and can be applied to other estuaries showing considerable impacts of river discharge on tide river dynamics keywords residual water level tidal properties harmonic analysis data driven model water management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction quantifying the impact of river discharge on tide river dynamics in terms of subtidal and tidal properties residual water level amplitudes and phases is challenging because tides in rivers are highly nonlinear and nonstationary due to nontidal processes jay and flinchem 1997 1999 matte et al 2013 2014 2018 pan et al 2018a b zhou et al 2018 however understanding the tide river interplay is essential for many purposes such as for flood control tidal elevation prediction sediment transport and to understand estuarine ecosystems in general kukulka and jay 2003b hoitink and jay 2016 hoitink et al 2017 du et al 2018 jones et al 2020 more specifically accurate predictions of water surface elevation variations under the influence of river discharge are essential to assess the risk of costal inundation and to plan navigation projects since the dynamics of subtidal water levels and tidal properties are strongly related to the changes in river discharge buschman et al 2009 sassi and hoitink 2013 kastner et al 2019 moreover exploring the historical development of water level dynamics with river discharge along an estuary may provide insights into the impacts of natural e g global sea level rise and anthropogenic e g dam construction sand excavation dredging land reclamation changes on sediment transport and ecosystem dynamics over a wide range of time scales jay et al 2011 it is well known that as a tide propagates from the ocean into an estuary it is increasingly distorted and damped due to nonlinear interactions of the barotropic tides with channel geometry bottom friction and river discharge godin 1985 1999 horrevoets et al 2004 cai et al 2014 2016 zhou et al 2017 to understand such dynamics a number of modelling techniques have been developed empirical regression models linking tidal properties to river discharge are commonly used to predict the variation in the tides as a function of river discharge godin 1985 1999 jay and flinchem 1997 kukulka and jay 2003a buschman et al 2009 sassi and hoitink 2013 although they cannot specify the underlying nonlinear interaction mechanisms of the tide with bottom friction due to bed forms and external forcing e g river discharge alternatively many researchers used physically based numerical modelling to quantify the impact of river discharge on tide river dynamics godin and martinez 1994 lu et al 2015 guo et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 2018b this approach accounts for complex channel geometry and accurate boundary conditions and provides elevation and velocity outputs at both temporally and spatially high resolutions however it should be noted that constant river discharge is usually incorporated in these numerical models in order to extract tidal properties of different constituents using traditional harmonic analyses thus the response of tidal properties to varying levels of river discharge is generally not addressed matte et al 2014 in recent years based on certain assumptions in both geometry and flow characteristics analytical models focusing on a single predominant tidal constituent e g m 2 can be used to understand the underlying mechanism of tide river interplay and the impact of river discharge on tidal damping horrevoets et al 2004 schuttelaars et al 2013 cai et al 2014 2016 2018 2019 wang et al 2021 however these analytical models can only capture the first order tide river dynamics due to the fact that they usually neglect the nonlinear interactions among tidal constituents e g k 1 s 2 m 4 msf unlike the traditional harmonic analysis pawlowicz et al 2002 which is only applicable to stationary signals i e signals not influenced by time varying external factors other than astronomical forcing several methods have been developed to better understand the impact of river discharge on tide river dynamics including short term harmonic analyses guo et al 2015 continuous wavelet transforms jay and flinchem 1997 empirical mode decompositions pan et al 2018a and nonstationary harmonic analyses matte et al 2013 2014 pan et al 2018b gan et al 2019 however most of them cannot directly obtain the time varying harmonic constants for each individual tidal constituent owing to the varying levels of river discharge except the nonstationary harmonic analyses in this study building on the previous studies by matte et al 2013 2014 that used the river discharge and ocean tidal range as model inputs for predicting tides in tidal rivers ns tide we propose a modified version termed as r tide representing river discharge driven harmonic analysis that uses river discharge as the only model input to assess the impact on the temporal variation in residual water levels and tidal properties although the perturbations of the tidal signal may arise due to multiple sources of external forcing oceanic meteorological hydrological or climatic we argue that the major modulation made to the tides in tidal rivers can be primarily attributed to the impacts caused by river discharge since the overall contribution of nontidal oceanic processes short term storm surge or long term sea level rise is relatively small in addition we also argue that the tidal properties along a tidal river can be well reconstructed by a series of independent tidal constituents together with a river stage term this indicates that the time varying tidal properties are only driven by the varying levels of river discharge thus the extracted tidal properties would remain constant for a given constant river discharge which is different from the ns tide model owing to the impact caused by the imposed oceanic forcing the advantage of identification of time varying tidal properties allows us to explore the way in which the tide deforms along the estuary as a function of river discharge this paper is organized as follows the model derived from ns tide is described in section 2 along with the objective function adopted for model calibration and validation in section 3 the proposed approach is applied to the yangtze river estuary in china the results discuss tidal distortion and the relative importance of tidal and riverine forcing on tide river dynamics section 4 finally some conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 data driven model to analyse water level in order to quantify the impact of river discharge on tide river dynamics a modified nonstationary tidal harmonic analysis r tide using river discharge as the only external forcing was used to understand the temporal changes in residual water levels and tidal properties tidal amplitudes and phases the r tide source code is available at https github com huayangcai r tide matlab toolbox the method is based on the classical harmonic analysis doodson 1921 where the water level z is typically described as 1 z t b 0 0 k 1 n b 1 k cos σ k t b 2 k sin σ k t where t is the time σ k are priori prescribed frequencies k 1 2 3 n corresponds to various tidal constituents and b 0 0 b 1 k and b 2 k are unknown coefficients that are determined using a regression analysis based on the principle of least squares to investigate the properties of the nonlinear and nonstationary tides in rivers caused by the variation in river discharge we followed the approach proposed by matte et al 2013 2014 the time varying river discharge is directly incorporated as a functional representation which was theoretically derived from a tidal wave propagation model jay 1991 kukulka and jay 2003a b jay et al 2011 unlike the original ns tide model that uses the greater diurnal tidal range i e the difference between higher high water and lower low water within a lunar day to represent the external oceanic forcing e g the neap spring variations we argue that the influence of oceanic forcing can well be represented by the usual harmonic constituents e g m 2 k 1 msf and the mutual nonlinear interactions among different tidal components which is the essence of classical harmonic analysis based on the tidal potential theory proposed by doodson 1921 it is also worth noting that in river deltas with multiple branches it is often difficult to identify a gauging station where the greater diurnal tidal range is representative of the whole delta based on this assumption the model is driven using river discharge as the sole predictor and can advantageously be applied to river deltas with complex morphologies in this case the unknown constants b 0 0 b 1 k and b 2 k in eq 1 can be expressed as a function of river discharge alone 2 b l k t a 0 l k a 1 l k q q k t where l is the index for coefficients l 0 1 2 corresponding to the three unknown coefficients presented in eq 1 q k a 0 l k and a 1 l k are the regression coefficients for each observatory station and frequency band in addition for each gauging station for the sake of simplification a constant time lag τ in hours was imposed to the forcing variable q accounting for the average travelling time of river discharge propagating to the station hence the coefficients b l k t can be modified as follows 3 b l k t a 0 l k a 1 l k q q k t τ after substituting eq 3 into eq 1 the final model of water level z can be derived using two time dependent parts 4 z t s t f t 5 s t a 0 0 0 a 1 0 0 q q 0 t τ 6 f t k 1 n a 0 1 k a 1 1 k q q k t τ cos σ k t k 1 n a 0 2 k a 1 2 k q q k t τ sin σ k t where s and f are calculated using the residual water level model and the tidal fluvial water level model respectively it is worth noting that the calibrated model parameters describe the system as a whole thus implicitly accounting for some factors of difficult quantification in addition to the usual river discharge like the influence of friction effect due to bed forms with eqs 4 6 the relative importance in terms of variance contributions induced by riverine p r and tidal p t forcing can be computed by the following formula 7 p r var s t var s t f t p t var f t var s t f t for a specific gauging station if the river discharge is negligible q 0 then the proposed data driven model eq 4 can be simplified as the classical harmonic tidal model eq 1 on the other hand for the case of large river discharge we also define a critical river discharge q c beyond which the tidal properties such as amplitudes and phases should be set to be identical as those q q c see the same strategy adopted in ns tide matte et al 2013 owing to the model s inaccuracy at very high discharge in practice we initially run the r tide model by setting the q c value being the observed maximum river discharge i e without specifying the value of q c and determine the actual q c from the computed tidal phase river discharge curve where the q c corresponds to the critical value with maximum shift of tidal phase with respect to river discharge i e maximum gradient if q q c the fluctuation of water level is mainly driven by the alteration in river discharge with negligible tidal influence and hence the data driven model eq 4 is reduced to the classical stage river discharge relationship eq 5 specifically when the river discharge is larger than the critical value q c we adopted the correction factor f f proposed by matte et al 2013 for the tidal fluvial model which can be described as 8 f f min q c i q i 1 in this case in eq 8 we set q i q c i if q i q c i it should be noted that for each studied gauging station we defined the eventually critical river discharge q c by using the minimum q c value among the significant tidal components e g msf m 2 k 1 m 4 this is due to the fact that the responses of different constituents to river discharge are highly nonlinear especially for large river discharges when the tide is approaching vanishing 2 2 constituent selection and rayleigh criterion it is well known that most harmonic codes such as t tide adopted the twofold strategy to select constituents for analysis this means that the rayleigh criterion is used a priori to select constituents to include in the analysis while the significance of constituents based on error estimates is used posteriori to exclude those that are not significant here in order to account for the nonstationary feature introduced by the nonlinear effects due to river discharge and bottom friction we adopted a modified rayleigh criterion δ σ proposed by matte et al 2013 specifically for given two adjacent tidal frequencies σ 1 and σ 2 we can define the minimal allowable frequency separation δ σ 9 σ 1 σ 2 δ σ with 0 δ σ h σ d σ 0 h σ d σ 1 η where h σ is the normalized power spectrum of q q and η is a user defined criterion representing a fraction of its total spectral power matte et al 2013 in this study we adopted η 0 05 the error model adopted here is exactly the same as that used in ns tide here a correlated noise model see details in matte et al 2013 describing the uncertainty in model parameters which is propagated to the tidal amplitudes and phases via monte carlo simulations the output of this computation is then used to define a signal to noise ratio snr defined as the square of the ratio of amplitude to amplitude error which is then used as a criterion for constituent output or selection since both the amplitude and phase errors are time variant the mean snr is used to identify these constituents with snr greater than 2 for the further analysis for more details concerning the noise models and parametric estimations in common tidal packages readers can refer to innocenti et al 2022 2 3 objective functions for model calibration and validation in this study the optimized q and τ at a given station are obtained by means of the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm kennedy and eberhart 1995 which is a population based stochastic optimization technique for a given metric for details refer to appendix with the obtained q and τ values a regression model can be used to determine the coefficients a 0 l k and a 1 l k based on the least square method here the root mean square error rmse between the observed z and the simulated z water level was chosen to be the metric of model performance defined as 10 rmse 1 m i 1 m z i z i 2 where m is the total number of observed samples in addition we also used the commonly used coefficient of determination r 2 to evaluate the overall performance of the data driven model 11 r 2 1 i 1 m z i z i 2 i 1 m z i z 2 where z represents the mean of the observed water levels 3 application to the yangtze river estuary 3 1 study site and data the yangtze river estuary located in the seaward end of the yangtze river drains into the east china sea fig 1 river discharge data near the estuary head from datong denoted by dt hydrological station located at about 640 km landward from the mouth was already available this data collected from 1950 2012 indicates an annual mean discharge of around 28 200 m 3 s 1 with a monthly mean maximum value of 49 500 m 3 s 1 in july and a minimum value of 11 300 m 3 s 1 in january cai et al 2016 the estuary features meso tidal characteristics with a mean tidal range of 2 66 m and a spring tidal range of up to 5 m based on multi year observations near the mouth zhang et al 2012 in this study water level data from 2002 to 2012 from six gauging stations along the estuary tianshenggang tsg jiangyin jy zhenjiang zj nanjing nj maanshan mas wuhu wh was obtained from the yangtze hydrology bureau of the people s republic of china since the yangtze river estuary is characterized by a dominant semidiurnal tidal signal the collected water level time series data generally contained two high and two low water levels for each day which was then interpolated to one hour intervals for nonstationary harmonic analysis by using the shape preserving piecewise cubic interpolation figure s1 see supporting information shows that the correspondence between the interpolated and observed water levels at nj gauging station is good with a reasonable rmse being 0 27 m on the other hand figure s2 see supporting information shows the power spectra density of observed and interpolated water levels where we observe a similar frequency structure especially for the low frequency bands in general the results show that the tidal water levels derived from such an interpolation method can well retain the power spectra of low frequency bands and principal tides e g m 2 k 1 while the high frequency bands d 8 and higher may not be entirely reproduced daily mean river discharge observed at the dt hydrological station was interpolated using the same approach as with water levels and then imposed as an upstream boundary for the nonstationary harmonic analysis during the study period 2002 2012 the maximum and minimum daily river discharge was 66 600 m 3 s 1 and 8 380 m 3 s 1 respectively the interpolated water level and river discharge time series data used in the data driven model are depicted in figures s3 and s4 respectively see supporting information fig 2 illustrates the along channel variation in season averaged tidal range and water levels wet season from may to october dry season from november to april from 2002 to 2012 at the six gauging stations the seasonal differences in tidal range and water levels tend to increase in the landward direction owing to the seasonal regulation of river discharge specifically the seasonal differences in the tidal range are minimum in the seaward reach with variations of 0 01 m and 0 04 m at tsg and jy respectively but increase more than 0 2 m upstream see fig 2a and table s1 in the supporting information this indicates that the impact of river discharge on tide river dynamics in the seaward reach is negligible similarly the seasonal difference in residual water level gradually increases from 0 67 m at tsg to 3 17 m at wh consequently the yangtze river estuary being studied here can be divided into two sectors based on the seasonal variations in tidal range and water levels the seaward reach between the tsg and jy which is tide dominated and characterized by minimum seasonal variation and the upstream reach between the jy and wh which is river dominated and characterized by relatively large seasonal variation 3 2 model performance based on the constituent selection criterion presented in section 2 2 the selected constituents and the corresponding optimized exponents q k k 1 2 9 are displayed in table 1 thus the hourly water level data was broken down into residual water levels and 35 tidal constituents by means of the proposed data driven model presented in section 2 1 as a general setup we used the first 2 3 2002 2008 of the measured time series data for model calibration and the remaining 1 3 2009 2012 for model validation an example of matlab scripts is provided at open access r tide matlab toolbox comparisons between modelled and observed water levels at the six gauging stations during the calibration period 2002 2008 presented a favourable general correspondence fig 3 it is worth noting that some apparent outliers exist in fig 3 mainly due to unrealistic interpolation when there is missing data between the two nearby interpolated points the calibrated parameters q τ and q c for each frequency band are presented in table 1 it can be observed from table 1 that the calibrated time lag τ accounting for the mean travelling time of river discharge propagating to the studied tidal gauging station does increase in the seaward direction with the maximum time lag occurred in tsg station being 14 82 hr for the critical river discharges q c they are 58 088 m 3 s 49 531 m 3 s and 44 653 m 3 s at nj mas and wh stations respectively based on the reproduced tidal phase river discharge curves and the corresponding gradient curves see figure s5 in the supporting information without specifying the value of q c critical river discharges are not available for other stations tsg jy and zj stations due to the strong influence of tidal forcing as expected it can be seen from figure s6 see the supporting information that the reproduced daily averaged water level is almost linearly proportional to the river discharge if q q c the model was consecutively applied during the validation period 2009 2012 using the same values of the coefficients calibrated between 2002 and 2008 the comparison of predicted and observed water levels during the validation period can be seen in figure s7 see the supporting information the model performances in terms of rmse and the coefficient of determination r 2 are shown in table 2 for both the calibration and validation periods the rmse for both calibration and validation was always smaller than 0 30 m and the values of r 2 were always larger than 0 91 which suggests that the model can successfully reproduce the water level dynamics along the estuary in addition we note that the model performance for the upstream stations the mas and wh stations was generally better than for those located downstream the tsg and jy stations this could be due to the fact that the linkage between water level dynamics and river discharge is much stronger in the upper river dominated region compared to the downstream tide dominated region of the estuary although the model performance can be improved by including more tidal constituents such as the solar annual constituent sa and the solar semiannual constituent ssa see also table s2 in the supporting information for the model performance when manually including sa and ssa for these downstream stations here we did not manually include these nonsignificant constituents since the relationship between the amplitudes or phases of major tidal constituents and river discharge is not significantly affected by the number of constituents selected in the analysis see figure s8 in the supporting information for an illustration to clarify the model performance of r tide the ns tide was also applied to the yangtze river estuary where we do observe a slightly better performance in the seaward stations tsg and jy stations owing to the additional input from greater diurnal tidal range term using the data from tsg station while the performance in the upstream river dominated region zj nj mas and wh is more or less the same see table 2 however it can be seen from figures s8 and s9 see the supporting information that the extracted tidal amplitudes and phases taking m 2 s 2 m 4 o 1 and k 1 tides as example at tsg and mas stations are strongly fluctuant for the whole channel even in the very upstream river dominated region this is mainly due to the fact that the driven tidal range term is featured by typical neap spring and monthly changes consequently the inclusion of the additional tidal range term may hinder the establishment of correct relationship between tidal amplitude and river discharge in addition it can be observed from figure s8 that the quantities of m 2 s 2 m 4 o 1 and k 1 tidal amplitude remains more or less the same for different numbers of tidal constituents selected in the analysis which suggests that the proposed r tide model is robust with regard to the reproduction of river tide dynamics when compared to the ns tide however it is worth noting that the model performance is closely related to the number of tidal constituents selected owing to the regression model adopted for fitting the observed water levels see table s3 in the supporting information especially for the tide dominated regions such as tsg jy and zj stations 3 3 impact of river discharge on residual water levels and tidal properties 3 3 1 variation in residual water levels fig 4 illustrates the spatial variations in the modelled residual water levels s eq 5 along with its slope δ s as a function of the imposed river discharge q at the dt hydrological station we observe that both variables increase approximately linearly with river discharge here we assume a constant residual water level slope over the tsg jy reach as expected the residual water level rises in the landward direction due to a steady and positive slope in the water level which is mainly induced by the residual frictional effect caused by tide river interactions sassi and hoitink 2013 cai et al 2016 in addition we note that the difference in residual water levels between two nearby gauging stations tends to increase with river discharge see fig 4a since the residual water level slope is positively correlated with river discharge in fig 4b we observe that the maximum residual water level slope occurred in central part of the yangtze river estuary i e the jy zj reach and the difference between the central reach and the upstream reach i e the zj wh reach increased with the river discharge this is mainly due to a larger increase of δ s with the river discharge in the central reach when compared with that in the upstream reach since the residual water level slope is mainly balanced by the residual frictional effect e g sassi and hoitink 2013 cai et al 2016 this suggests the maximum tidal damping occurred in the central part as well which has important implications for sediment transport flood control and tidal propagation etc moreover the different responses of the residual water level and slope between the seaward and upstream parts of the estuary are also indicated by the calibrated q 0 values at the six gauging stations see table 1 and eq 5 with relative smaller q 0 values q 0 0 443 0 491 in the seaward reach tsg and jy stations compared to those in the upstream reach q 0 0 674 it is worth noting that the residual water levels are featured by a typical neap spring variation owing to the periodic dynamics of subtidal friction e g guo et al 2020 this phenomenon can be clearly observed by reproducing the water level making use of the low frequency tides e g msf mm constituents unlike the ns tide stage model representing the low frequency variations in water levels matte et al 2013 2014 the current r tide model implicitly accounts for the neap spring changes by the usual low frequency harmonic constituents and the mutual nonlinear interactions among semi diurnal or diurnal tides see figures s10 and s11 in the supporting information consequently the reconstructed water levels from ns tide stage model are comparable with those reconstructed by the sum of r tide stage model and low frequency tides see figure s12 in the supporting information 3 3 2 variation in tidal properties it is worth noting that the proposed approach allows residual water levels and tidal properties to be modelled separately as a function of time varying river discharge fig 5 illustrates the spatial variations in the modelled tidal amplitudes denoted by a of six major tidal constituents o 1 k 1 m 2 s 2 m 4 ms 4 as a function of river discharge which provides direct insights into the impact of river discharge on tide river dynamics it can be clearly observed from fig 5a b e f that in the seaward reach tsg jy where the tide dominates the river discharge the extracted amplitudes of diurnal o 1 k 1 and quarter diurnal m 4 and ms 4 tides generally increase with the river discharge on the other hand the amplitudes of the dominant semidiurnal constituents m 2 s 2 slightly decrease with river discharge see fig 5c d as a result the seasonal variation in the overall tidal amplitude at tsg and jy stations are minor in the upstream reach jy wh we see a general decrease in tidal amplitudes for all the constituents as river discharge increases which is primarily due to the tidal damping by the river discharge and bottom friction in addition we note that the variation of tidal amplitudes in the upstream mas wh reach is minor for very high river flow conditions 50 000 m 3 s 1 approximately such a phenomenon is primarily due to reduced residual friction caused by the increase in residual water level 6 m see fig 4a fig 6 shows the spatial variations in the phases denoted by ϕ of tidal constituents along the yangtze river estuary as a function of river discharge in general we observe a weak decreasing phase as river discharge increases in the seaward reach of the estuary tsg jy this suggests that the tidal waves travel slightly faster with increasing river discharge this is likely due to the increase in the residual water level and hence larger water depth and less effective friction caused by river discharge fig 4a on the contrary for the upstream reach jy wh the phases tend to increase with river discharge since the river discharge exerts a primary impact on tidal damping for each tidal constituent as wave celerity is generally negatively correlated with tidal damping garel and cai 2018 the travelling time is increased with river discharge it is worth examining the difference in tidal damping rate δ a defined as the amplitude difference between two adjacent stations over the distance for different tidal constituents as a function of river discharge see fig 7 noticeably positive tidal damping rates are only observed for the quarter diurnal constituents m 4 and ms 4 along the tsg jy reach which indicates an increase in amplitude contrarily the tidal damping rates for semidiurnal and diurnal constituents are negative with maximum damping observed for the m 2 tide followed by the s 2 tide a larger tidal damping rate for semidiurnal compared to diurnal constituents especially in the seaward reach suggests a stronger damping of astronomical tides with higher frequencies see also godin and martinez 1994 godin 1999 meanwhile we also observed that the most significant damping occurred at the jy zj reach where the tidal damping rate for the m 2 tide exceeds 6 mm km and the corresponding residual water level slope or residual friction is the maximum for the whole estuary in the upstream parts of the estuary the damping of the quarter diurnal species generally reduces with the river discharge while those of the semidiurnal and diurnal constituents remain more or less the same the underlying mechanism is mainly due to the imbalance between the channel convergence effect and the residual friction effect for more details regarding this issue please refer to cai et al 2019 the fortnightly msf tide with a tidal period of 14 7653 days mainly generated by the nonlinear interaction between the semidiurnal constituents m 2 and s 2 is one of the primary low frequency constituents in tidal rivers aubrey and speer 1985 parker 1991 due to its long wavelength and the difficulties in separating fortnightly tides from effects of highly variable river discharge msf river interactions have received limited attention guo et al 2020 fig 8 shows the extracted amplitude and phase of the msf tidal constituent as a function of river discharge indicating a very similar wave behaviour compared to that of the m 4 specifically for low river discharge conditions q 25 000 m 3 s 1 the msf amplitude significantly increases in the seaward reach tsg to zj and gradually decreases at the upstream stations see fig 8a amplification in the seaward reach with a maximum of 0 21 m observed at the zj station indicates that the msf generating effect is greater than the frictional damping effect induced by bottom friction and river discharge on the other hand for high river discharge conditions q 25 000 m 3 s 1 the inflection point retreated seaward to the jy station owing to the enhanced frictional effect with regard to the phase it can be seen from fig 8b that the phase was slightly increased with river discharge at the tsg station while it remained more or less the same for the jy and zj stations which suggests a relatively minor impact due to river discharge for the stations in the upstream reach i e mas wh we observe an increase of phase by approximately 30 due to the considerable damping of river discharge 4 discussion 4 1 alteration in tidal form and distortion numbers as a tide propagates into an estuary it becomes distorted due to the nonlinear impact from channel geometry bottom friction and river discharge buschman et al 2009 sassi and hoitink 2013 the tidal regime can be classified by using the tidal form number f nos 2000 defined as 12 f a o 1 a k 1 a m 2 a s 2 for f 0 25 the tide is classified as semidiurnal for 0 25 f 1 5 the tide is mixed mainly semidiurnal for 1 5 f 3 0 the tide is mixed mainly diurnal and for f 3 0 the tide is diurnal on the other hand the degree of distortion and the nature of tidal asymmetry can be characterized by the tidal distortion number d friedrichs and aubrey 1988 defined as 13 d a m 4 a m 2 where the larger the d value the more distorted the tide and the more strongly flood or ebb dominant the system becomes in fig 9a we observe that the tidal form number f generally increases in the landward direction which is mainly due to the larger tidal damping of the semidiurnal tides when compared with diurnal tides this phenomenon is consistent with that reported by godin 1999 who showed that the tidal damping is frequency dependent thus those with the higher frequencies e g semi diurnals are being damped faster than lower frequencies e g diurnals owing to the nonlinear effects of bottom friction river discharge and geometry in general the tidal regime in the yangtze river estuary is classified as mixed mainly semidiurnal since the tidal form number 0 25 f 1 5 indicates a relatively large diurnal inequality in the high or low waters or both in addition the larger the river discharge the larger the tidal form number regarding the tidal distortion number d it can be seen from fig 9b that the d value increases along the seaward reach tsg jy due to the amplification of the m 4 tide along with the strong damping of the m 2 tide furthermore as river discharge increases so does the d value this suggests that the m 4 generating effect is greater than the frictional damping effect of m 4 in the seaward reach the variation in the d values in the upstream parts of the estuary is relatively complex owing to the highly nonlinear interplay between the tide and river discharge at the zj gauging station the d values are larger than those downstream for river discharge less than around 20 000 m 3 s 1 and they are less than values at the jy where the river discharge exceeds around 20 000 m 3 s 1 for stations upstream of nj it appears that there is a critical river discharge value approximately 30 000 m 3 s 1 corresponding to a maximum d value beyond which d decreases with the river discharge this has to do with the fact that the damping rates of m 2 and m 4 varied with river discharge specifically for river discharge ranging between 10 000 30 000 m 3 s 1 the damping rate of m 2 is much faster than that of m 4 leading to an increase of d value with river discharge the case is quite opposite when the river discharge exceeds approximately 30 000 m 3 s 1 resulting in a reduction of d value with increasing river discharge 4 2 relative importance of tidal and riverine forcing on water level using eqs 4 6 the contributions made by tidal and riverine forcing to the temporal variation in water level can be quantified by computing their variances and the contribution made by each component to the total variance fig 10 fig 10 confirms that both the tsg and jy stations are tide dominated as the annual mean variance caused by the tidal level is significantly larger than that caused by river stage on the other hand the stations located in the upstream regions can be classified as river dominated owing to the larger variance induced by river stage on average the contribution made by the tidal forcing to the overall water level variance is 76 54 and 57 47 at the tsg and jy gauging stations respectively the more upstream the location of the station the higher the contribution made by the riverine forcing to the overall water level variance in particular the contribution made by the riverine forcing gradually increase from 89 84 at zj to 99 39 at wh it is worth quantifying the monthly variability in relative importance between tidal and riverine forcing as this has significant implications for water management in general such as flood control navigation and salt intrusion fig 11 shows the monthly variation in the tidal and riverine contributions where we can see a very distinct response between the seaward and upstream parts of the estuary in the seaward reach tsg jy reach where the tide dominates over the river discharge two local minimum values of tidal forcing contributions occurred in may and september while a local maximum contribution occurred in july in particular these two local minimum tidal contributions in may and september correspond to the two local maximum variances see figure s13 in the supporting information in daily averaged river discharge observed at dt hydrological station owing to the strong fluctuations during the dry to wet and wet to dry transitions on the contrary the local maximum tidal contribution in july approximately corresponds to the local minimum variance in daily averaged river discharge observed in june in the upstream parts of the estuary where river discharge dominates over the tide we observe a clear seasonal pattern with a markedly larger riverine forcing contribution during the wet season may october compared to the dry season november to april in addition this contribution is approximately constant from may to september for a detailed assessment of the relative contributions made by both tidal and riverine forcing in each month please refer to table s4 in the supporting information 4 3 implications for tidal rivers worldwide the mutual interactions between tides and river flow have been extensively studied in many tidal rivers worldwide such as the columbia river estuary e g jay et al 2011 2015 the st lawrence river estuary e g godin 1999 matte et al 2014 the mahakam river e g buschman et al 2009 sassi and hoitink 2013 the yangtze river estuary e g guo et al 2015 2020 and the pearl river estuary e g zhang et al 2018a these studies have highlighted the importance of bottom friction channel convergence and river discharge on the alterations in tidal amplitude phase and shape as tidal waves travelling into tidal rivers in this study with the proposed r tide harmonic model using the river discharge as the sole predictor it is possible to isolate and to quantify the impacts of time varying river discharge on the tidal properties of individual tidal constituent which is particularly useful for further understanding the underlying mechanism of tides and river flow interplay especially for the responses of different tidal constituents to the river discharge moreover the proposed data driven model provides a new yet effective tool for quantifying the impacts of freshwater regulation due to dam s operation on the downstream tide river dynamics this can be made by using the data driven model calibrated during the pre dam period to reconstruct the tide river dynamics that would have occurred in absence of the dam s freshwater regulation in this direction and taking the yangtze river estuary as a significant case study our contribution provides a novel approach for quantifying the impact of dam s operation on tide river dynamics which is particularly useful for setting scientific guidelines for dam s operation and related water resources management similar approach can be adopted to quantify the potential effect of river discharge alteration induced by the climate change owing to the global warming land use cover change or intensifying precipitation and so on 5 conclusions in this study we propose a simple yet effective data driven model building on the previously developed nonstationary harmonic analysis ns tide matte et al 2013 2014 to quantify the impacts of river discharge on tide river dynamics the model requires only river discharge as input data which makes the proposed model a powerful tool for modelling and predicting water level in estuaries with substantial freshwater discharge like the ns tide this model allows distinguishing frequencies within the tidal bands and extracts time series data of subtidal residual water levels and tidal properties amplitudes and phases as a function of river discharge for each resolved tidal frequency the advantages of the proposed model lie in the correct reproduction of relationship between tidal amplitude and river discharge since it does not need a tidal range term in the seaward boundary and removing the dependency on a coastal station especially when no representative coastal station is available e g in river deltas moreover the proposed model can help explore the energy transfer among different tidal bands the means by which a tide deforms with river discharge and the relative importance between riverine and tidal forcing on water level the application to the yangtze river estuary with substantial freshwater discharge and nonstationary tide suggests that the model can successfully reproduce the dynamics of river tides with a hindcast explaining more than 90 of the original signal variance and an rmse of less than 0 30 m for a four year period with highly variable river discharge the successful application to the yangtze river estuary indicates that the proposed approach can be a particularly useful tool for tidal prediction and associated water management measures such as flood control navigation and salt intrusion etc in other estuaries showing considerable impact of river

particle swarm optimization pso algorithm the particle swarm optimization pso is a multi agent based meta heuristic approach that attempts to improve a candidate solution concerning a given measure of quality candidate solutions are described as a population of particles which are driven to move within the search space according to simple mathematical formulae based on the particle s position and velocity the computation process of the standard pso algorithm consists of a velocity particle moving velocity v update step and a position particle position x update step these updates are controlled by the inertia weight and two learning factors related to cognitive local best known solution and social knowledge exchange global best known solution for the whole search space in the standard pso algorithm each particle s movement is guided toward the best known positions by its own individual best position denoted by p and global best position denoted by g the velocity and position are updated according to the following equations a 1 v k 1 i d ω v k i d c 1 r 1 d p k i d x k i d c 2 r 2 d g k d x k i d a 2 x k 1 i d x k i d v k i d where the superscript i indicates the i th particle

in general a large value of inertia weight facilitates the global exploration while a small value tends to facilitate the local exploration parameters c 1 and c 2 are acceleration coefficients representing the weight of the stochastic acceleration terms that move each particle toward the local best known p and global best known g positions respectively parameters r 1 d and r 2 d are the d dimensional random cognitive and social learning factors uniformly distributed in a range between 0 and 1 the iteration repeats from k to k 1 and terminates when the maximum allowed iteration k m a x is reached or when a solution with adequate objective function value is found it was shown that the inertia weight ω plays a vital role in moving particles toward the optimal solution in this study we adopted the commonly used linearly decreasing algorithm for the inertial weight which is given by a 3 ω k ω i n i t ω i n i t ω e n d k k max where ω i n i t is the upper bound of the inertial weight

2079,climate change leads to more severe floods which needs to be modeled properly this study uses two hydraulic models including hydrologic engineering center river analysis system hec ras and lisflood fp to simulate floods in two basins kashkan and missouri with different topographies mountain and plain terrain the impacts of different parameters like input resolutions digital elevation models dems roughness coefficient and modeling techniques on flood simulation are examined results indicate that the performance of the models varies based on topography input resolutions and modeling approach indeed the 2d modeling of both models in different topography types leads to better results compared to 1d 2d modeling in kashkan basin hec ras and lisflood fp models simulate floodplain flow with accuracies of 74 and 70 respectively and the accuracies of the models in missouri basin are 80 and 84 respectively although both models particularly hec ras with alos 30 m can provide reasonable results with an accuracy of 74 for kashkan and 63 for missouri basin lisflood fp can perform better about 4 higher accuracy than hec ras with a higher resolution of dem 3dep in missouri basin with significantly lower computational costs in addition the performance of the two models significantly decreases using aster dem in plain topography results confirm that hec ras outperforms lisflood fp in coarser resolution dems while lisflood fp performs better in plain topography which requires higher resolution dems despite the low sensitivity of the two models to roughness coefficients the variability of the lisflood fp simulations is smaller than hec ras this work uses the best setting and factors to simulate floodplain zones which is valuable for flood risk and hazard assessment to reduce and manage damages and losses keywords flood modeling hec ras and lisflood fp dems topography roughness flood hazard zones data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction current and historical statistics confirm that natural hydrological hazards can lead to economic damages and deaths one of the most frequent and dangerous hydrological hazards are floods which cause severe damages to infrastructure and human lives every year khan et al 2010 moghim and gharehtoragh 2022 only in the united states of america 26 important flood events have occurred between 1980 and 2016 and on average causes about 4 3 billion dollar damage to the country smith et al 2017 moreover climate change has a significant effect on the magnitude and frequency of the flood e g kvočka et al 2015 malaekeh et al 2022 effects of severe flood events induced by climate change are expected to increase in the future by population and economic growth alfieri et al 2017 although floods are inevitable events flood zoning and finding high risk regions enables us to reduce related risks over the last few years due to flood risks and impacts on human life flood models 1d and 2d have been widely used these models are useful to simulate and analyze the magnitude and frequency of the flood especially in areas where hydrometric data are insufficient or lacking flood modeling includes processes of transforming precipitation into flood hydrographs and simulating associated streamflow over a watershed ramírez 2000 in general three main groups of flood modeling including empirical models conceptual models and hydrodynamic models have been developed since 1970 s santiago collazo et al 2019 afshari et al 2018 teng et al 2017 one of the most widely used of the methods is hydrodynamic models mathematical model which attempt to simulate fluid motion and floods in one dimensional two dimensional and three dimensional teng et al 2017 although 1d models are widely used due to their simplicity they ignore some important aspects of flood modeling unlike 1d models the two dimensional approach is able to consider flow path in x y direction complex effects of topography and flood propagation rong et al 2020 bates et al 1998 lisflood fp and hec ras are two hydrodynamic models for flood simulation and projection with 1d 2d and coupled 1d 2d modeling technique that are widely used dasallas et al 2019 neal et al 2011 lisflood fp is one of the models that can be used for rainfall runoff modeling and sensitivity analysis of important parameters horritt and bates 2001 evaluated the effect of different resolutions of the digital elevation models dem in the range of 10 m to 1000 m on lisflood fp performance their results showed that the maximum accuracy is attained by 10 m resolution in addition they showed that the accuracy of the flood travel time is closely linked to the resolution of inputs lim and brandt 2019 evaluated the impact of the dem resolution and the manning coefficient on flood modeling in the lisflood fp their results showed that a higher resolution of dem with a larger manning value leads to a better result while a smaller manning value is better for a coarser resolution neal et al 2011 assessed the impact of new formulation of the lisflood fp on the model performance at the city scale resolution their result revealed that although the new version of the model is as accurate as the previous version it is 67 times faster which significantly reduces computational cost the other commonly used model for flood modeling is the hec ras model 1d 2d and coupled 1d 2d developed by the us army center for hydrological engineering caviedes voullième et al 2020 dazzi et al 2020 wing et al 2019 leandro et al 2014 ghimire et al 2022 evaluated the impact of 1d and 2d hec ras modeling on the flood travel time in grand river of ohio usa their results showed a significant difference in results of the flood extent 4 1 and the flood travel time 20 obtained by 1d and 2d approach yalcin 2020 used hec ras to assess the impact of resolution of the land cover and topography on simulated flooded areas in kilicozu creek he showed that 10 m resolution produces similar results as 2 m resolution with a slightly lower accuracy in simulated flooded areas geravand et al 2020 used the 1d hec ras modeling to investigate the effect of the resolution of river geometry data on flood inundation their results indicated that a coarser and finer resolution of the cross section tends to overestimate and underestimate respectively patel et al 2017 used coupled 1d 2d modeling in hec ras to evaluate flood inundation they used 299 cross sections in the river channel to estimate the flood plain based on the srtm dem their results indicated that important outputs e g flood depth and flooded areas can be simulated in 2d modeling of hec ras better than 1d in addition they showed that coupled 1d 2d approach leads to more reliable results than fully one dimensional modeling shustikova et al 2020 compared the performance of hec ras and lisflood fp in levee breaching their results showed that both models lead to similar results and they only have less than 1 difference in maximum flow over the breach shustikovaa et al 2019 used hec ras and lisflood fp 2d to assess the effect of different grid sizes on their performance in the secchia river their results showed that the computational cost in lisflood fp is lower while hec ras slightly outperforms lisflood fp horritt and bates 2002 compared the performance of the 1d and 2d flood models including hec ras lisflood fp and telemac 2 they used channel and floodplain manning coefficients for the calibration their results showed that the lisflood fp model is more sensitive to the calibration than hec ras and telemac 2d tariq et al 2021 used the hec ras model and landsat 8 images for flood frequency analysis to estimate extreme flows and damages of the 2014 flood event in pakistan their results highlighted an important role of hydrodynamic models and satellite imagery for flood mapping which can aid in flood damage assessment in addition to the physical models data driven approaches are used for the flood analysis avand et al 2022 used artificial neural networks anns random forests rf and generalized linear models glms to evaluate the impact of different dem resolutions on flood probability maps they showed that the accuracy of the flood probability prediction depends on not only the resolution of the dems but also other parameters like precipitation altitude and the distance from the river to evaluate flood vulnerability of different sub basins in kalan basin iran ilderomi et al 2022 combined the picture fuzzy analytic hierarchy and picture fuzzy linear assignment models to find weights for 13 morphometric criteria their results found regions with the highest and lowest susceptibility to flooding based on the rank frequency matrix flood models perform differently in various topographies with different parameters in addition the computational cost and memory usage of modeling can affect a proper choice of a flood model although many studies confirmed the main role of topography and physical features of the domain in flood simulations enyew and steeneveld 2014 shustikova et al 2019 rahimzadeh et al 2019 there are limited studies in comparative analysis of different flood models in various topography types considering different parameters this study provides a complete assessment of flood simulations by two different flood models considering different parameters we evaluate the performance of the hec ras and lisflood model in different topography types mountain and plain topography to investigate the impact of topography and different factors including different modeling techniques dems inputs resolution and roughness coefficient on flood modeling remote sensing and hydrometric data are used to find a suitable model in different conditions considering time and memory efficiency proper established models are used to simulate heavy flood events in the case studies the case study and methodology are described in sections 2 and 3 followed by the results and discussion in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 case study this study uses hec ras and lisflood fp to evaluate flood events in two case studies with different topographies in march and april 2019 the first case study is kashkan river basin in iran with mountainous region and the second one is missouri river basin in usa with a relatively flat land 2 1 kashkan river basin kashkan river basin is one of the main hydrological units in the karkheh basin in iran which is located in western iran id code 222 poldokhtar city is located in the outlet of the kashkan river basin area with an approximate area of 9524 2 km2 this basin is geographically extended from 47 12 to 48 59 east and 33 8 to 34 2 north poldokhtar has hot summers and slightly cold winters with a semi arid climate according to the hydrological classification of iran this basin is a subset of the persian gulf catchment area and one of the water tributaries of the karkheh river dehghani et al 2020 due to the topography mountain terrain and climate of the region kashkan basin has usually experienced severe flood events kashkan river which is one of the most prominent rivers in this basin has experienced sixteen flood events with discharge of more than 1000 m3 s 1 during the last fifty years one of the most significant flood events in the study area occurred in march 2019 with a maximum flow rate of more than 5 000 m3 s 1 which caused severe damages to the region hosseini et al 2021 thus this study simulates the flood event of march 2019 in this basin with the mountain terrain fig 1 a shows a digital elevation model dem of the study area provided by the aster satellite sensor with a spatial resolution of 30 m this study uses different digital elevation models including aster 30 m srtm 30 m 90 m and alos 30 m to consider the effect of dem hydrometric data for kashkan are provided from the regional water company of lorestan and iran water resources management company data include temperature precipitation and streamflow at hourly resolution during flood and at daily and monthly resolution when there is no flood hydrometric data are provided by the stream gauges including afrineh kashkan station at upstream poldokhtar station at downstream and two stations of afrineh visian doab and baraftab gauges on the two tributaries of the chulhol river and madian river in the kashkan basin fig 1a the inputs of the both models are hourly flow data from all hydrometric stations to assess the effect of the digital elevation model a 30 m dem prepared by alos that is claimed as the best digital elevation model azizian and brocca 2020 grohmann 2018 is obtained from the japan aerospace exploration agency in addition three other digital elevation models including srtm 30 m srtm 90 m and aster are used 2 2 missouri river basin the second case study is the missouri river basin in the state of nebraska with a typical mid western climate hot summers and cold winters the missouri river is the longest river in the united states which possesses a catchment area of about 529 000 square miles extending over ten states more than 40 dams are along the missouri river to provide water mainly for agriculture the state of nebraska encompasses an area of about 200 000 km2 with several catchments the largest city in the state and the second largest city located near the missouri river is omaha with a population of about 500 000 and an area of approximately 380 000 km2 the missouri basin has experienced extensive floods frequently for instance a flood event happened with a flow rate of about 11 000 m3 s 1 in 1952 and there was a severe flood event with a flow rate of more than 5000 m3 s 1 in march 2019 which caused more than 3 billion damages flanagan et al 2020 thus this study considers missouri basin with the plain terrain that has a different topography compared to the first case study kashkan basin we use six stream gauges including one in decator id code 06601200 as the upstream gauge one in omaha id code 06610000 as the downstream gauge and four other gauges id codes 06602400 06607500 06608500 06609500 along the river the 15 minute flow data from all stations in the missouri basin are used as inputs to the both models fig 1b shows the dem of the basin with an accuracy of 30 m with related gauges data including streamflow and water level with 15 minute resolution and cross sections are obtained from the united states geological survey usgs in the missouri basin in addition to the four types of dems used for the flood modeling in kashkan basin a 10 meter 3dep digital elevation model developed by the us geological survey usgs are also used for flood simulation 3 methodology this work uses different approaches including coupled 1d 2d and 2d modeling in hec ras and lisflood fp over two distinct topographies including kashkan with mountain topography and missouri with plain topography most flood models estimate the general one dimensional equation of the saint venant for 1d modeling the 2d modeling of hec ras can solve the two dimensional saint venant equation or two dimensional wave propagation equations through an implicit finite volume solution vreugdenhil 1994 cunge 1980 de saint venant and adhémar jean claude 1871 another model that can simulate floodplain and flood hydraulics is lisflood fp bates et al 2010 savage et al 2016 lisflood fp developed by the university of bristol is based on the inertial formulation of surface water equations bates and de roo 2000 the lisflood fp model includes different solvers which can be selected based on physical features of the basins the solvers are based on the momentum and continuity equations lisflood fp model uses the one dimensional kinematic wave equation for the river channel within a finite difference scheme and the two dimensional diffusion wave equation for the floodplain the choice of the numerical solution depends on the features of the system available data required computational time and accuracy to control the stability of the models hec ras and lisflood fp the courant friedrichs lewy condition is used to determine the time step indeed time step in the flood modeling is one of the most important parameters an improper time step leads to instability of the model and invalid results leandro et al 2014 to establish a model in kashkan basin a mesh structure 100 m by 100 m for a square geometric shape and a five or hexagonal mesh for the border is used for 2d modeling in the hec ras for the main river channel in kashkan basin 233 cross sections are considered in the coupled 1d 2d modeling which is integrated with the 2d modeling for the flood plains with the mesh of 50 m by 50 m on the other hand lisflood fp needs dem provided by raster files as one of important inputs o loughlin et al 2020 based on the physical geometry of the case study the acceleration and subgrid solvers are selected for the 2d modeling of the flood plain and 1d modeling of the main river channel respectively furthermore to evaluate the roughness effect different manning coefficients for the flood plain f and channel c are used the best manning coefficients are selected based on model calibration in the historical event to prepare a model structure in missouri a one dimensional channel with 800 cross sections and two floodplains with 50 by 50 mesh grid is used for 2d modeling in hec ras similar to kashkan 2d and coupled 1d 2d modeling is used for lisflood fp in coupled 1d 2d modeling the 2d and 1d solver is used for simulating floodplain and main channel respectively the acceleration floodplain solver is used in the 2d modeling and the subgrid solver as one of the best solver is used to calculate channel flow bates et al 2013 in both 2d and coupled 1d 2d modeling the 3dep dem with 10 m resolution is used the cross sections provided by the usgs are used in the coupled 1d 2d approach for the main channel the performance of the two models hec ras and lisflood is validated at the downstream hydrometric stations which is pol dokhtar in kashkan basin and 06610000 station in missouri basin to evaluate the performance of the models statistical measures including correlation root mean square error rmse normalized root mean square error nrmse fit percentage indicator fi and bias percentage indicator bi are used the nrmse that is the rmse of the normalized discharge values evaluates the models performance and shows how well flood discharge particularly high values peaks are simulated the fi which is the flood modeling evaluation index schumann et al 2009 is used to compare the results of the flooded areas with the satellite images as 1 fi a a b c 100 where a is the number of pixels that are correctly predicted b is the number of pixels that are not flooded but the model defines them as flooded areas and c is the number of pixels that are flooded but the model defines them as no flood the second indicator bi bernini and franchini 2013 represents errors of the simulated flooded areas relative to the reference maps obtained from the satellite images which can be expressed as 2 bi a b a c 1 100 where a b and c are defined in eq 1 the positive and negative bi indicates that the flooded areas are overestimated and underestimated respectively 4 results to evaluate the impact of different dem resolutions and digital elevation model on model performance different dems are used in hec ras and lisflood to simulate floodplain in kashkan and missouri case studies to compare results statistical metrics including fi and bi are calculated and presented in table 1 table 1 shows that the overall performance of the hec ras model is slightly better 5 than the lisflood fp in kashkan case study there is a slight underestimation in both models with the highest resolution dem alos 2d and an overestimation in both 1d and 2d modeling with all other dems results of lisflood fp and hec ras in 2d and 1d modeling under alos dem are close with about 1 and 3 differences respectively while lisflood fp leads a larger difference than hec ras using srtm with a 90 m resolution generally the performance of the lisflood fp and hec ras decreases by about 11 and 5 from 30 to 90 m resolution respectively results indicate that the hec ras model is more stable and less sensitive to the inputs resolution dems and mesh dimensions while the lisflood fp model is more sensitive to the resolution of inputs raster data that can lead to a considerable different result although hec ras model shows the best results in kashkan basin under 2d modeling with alos lisflood fp is more computationally efficient and can consider different solvers for river channels and floodplains for the missouri basin the performance of the lisflood fp in 2d and the coupled 1d 2d modeling by 3dep is satisfactory and slightly better than the hec ras model while with a decrease of the dem s resolution the performance of the lisflood fp reduces significantly for instance the performance of the lisflood fp decreases by 56 with the srtm 90 m dem in addition the stability of the model with the srtm 30 m fails which indicates the importance of the dem in model performance in the missouri basin all dems with either 1d or 2d modeling approaches lead to an overestimation additionally these overestimations are higher in lisflood fp compared to hec ras for most dems excluding the 3dep where lisflood fp shows the lowest overestimation and the best results with 84 accuracy results show that models have the best performance using alos and 3dep dems in kashkan and missouri basins respectively indeed the hec ras 2d modeling with alos dem illustrates a better performance compared to the lisflood fp in mountain topography on the other hand lisflood fp is able to produce more accurate results with increasing dem resolutions in the missouri basin with plain topography table 1 confirms that using 3dep in the missouri basin and alos in the kashkan basin lead to the best results to evaluate variation of the dems the longitudinal and cross profiles of the dems are compared in two study areas in fig 2 fig 2 illustrates profiles longitudinal and cross section of the elevation using different dems in two case studies results show that there is a larger difference between dems in kashkan in mountain topography compared to missouri in plain topography to examine the performance of the models to simulate the flood event in march and april 2019 with different dems time series of the estimated and observed discharge for kashkan basin is illustrated in fig 3 results show that the hec ras model fig 3a and 3b with the srtm 90 m dem underestimates discharges compared to the observations and the peak discharge is shifted by about one hour compared to the results of other dems indeed the coupled 1d 2d modeling and srtm90 m lead to the peak discharge one hour earlier and one hour later from observations respectively in addition fig 3 shows that different dems in lisflood fp model lead to similar results excluding the alos in 2d modeling which exhibitssuperiorperformance in the kashkan basin with mountain topography in other words results indicate that the lisflood fp with the alos 2d simulates discharges better than other dems the correlation and rmse between simulated and observed discharge are 96 5 and 320 cms respectively in general the overall performance of the two models under alos dem in the 2d modeling approach is close to evaluate the performance of the hec ras and lisflood in the other case study missouri basin two models are used to simulate discharge and depth with different dems for the flood event of march 2019 fig 4 fig 4 shows that hec ras with 3dep alos and srtm30 with 30 m resolution leads to better results in plain topography missouri basin the better performance of the 3dep is more noticeable in depth simulation although aster has finer resolution than srtm90 m it leads to the worst results this can refer to the lack of dem characterization capability of aster for plain areas which indicates the sensitivity of both models not only to the resolution of the dems but also to their appropriateness and compatibility in different topography types although hec ras performs well with srtm30 m lisflood fp becomes unstable with that dem results are shown in the second column in fig 4 furthermore results show that lisflood fp with the alos leads to better simulations in both discharge and depth second column in fig 4 statistical measures table 1 and simulations figs 3 and 4 indicate that alos and 3dep are proper dems for hec ras and lisflood in kashkan and missouri basin respectively the alos digital elevation model in lisflood fp leads to the best results after 3dep dem table 1 after 3dep dems including alos and srtm30 m with the same 30 m resolution provide the best results in simulating flood discharge compared to other digital elevation models in the hec ras model based on the results we use alos and 3dep with 10 m resolution as the proper dems in the kashkan and missouri basin for other assessment in this work to determine the most optimal manning coefficient the performance of the two models in the kashkan basin is evaluated using different manning coefficients we define two manning coefficients for the floodplain nf and channel nc in lisflood fp due to two separate solvers in the model for the channel and floodplain while in hec ras with the same solver we define a single manning coefficient for the entire domain fig 5 shows that although both models can simulate discharge well the variability of the simulations by lisflood fp with different manning coefficients is smaller than that of the hec ras model indeed the hec ras model is more sensitive to the manning coefficient than the lisflood fp furthermore the hydrograph fluctuation increases by reducing manning values and leads to about one hour earlier peak discharge fig 5a and 5b although different manning coefficients for the floodplain and channel in lisflood shows varied performance the same values of roughness for floodplain and channel in hec ras leads to a better result in kashkan basin the overall performance of the two models is close with a correlation of 0 94 and 0 95 rmse of 312 and 300 cms and nrmse of 5 and 4 8 relative to the observations for hec ras and lisflood fp respectively results indicate that the simulated discharge by lisflood fp follows observations better than that of the hec ras model and hec ras slightly overestimates observed hydrograph the same analysis and results are obtained for the missouri basin figure is not shown thus the manning coefficients of 0 04 and 0 03 as the proper values for the kashkan and missouri basin are selected for the rest of this work to assess the performance of the two models at the best structure optimized manning coefficient best dems and solvers hydrographs of the final outputs for the flood event of march and april 2019 in kashkan and missouri basin are illustrated in fig 6 fig 6 shows that the simulated discharge by two models with the alos dem in the kashkan basin follows observations well while the simulated hydrograph at the beginning of the event in the missouri basin is different from the observations that can be due to the warm up period although hec ras model outperforms lisflood in simulating the maximum flood in the basin lisflood fp captures the trend of the observed hydrograph better than hec ras statistical measures indicate that correlation and nrmse are about 95 and 0 16 for lisflood fp 92 and 0 2 for hec ras respectively which can confirm a proper performance of the two models to further illustrate the performance of the hec ras and lisflood fp simulated flood map for kashkan basin is illustrated in fig 7 fig 7 shows flood areas perfectly simulated by the models that are validated by the satellite images blue color called same in the figure although two models can simulate floodplain zoning well hec ras outperforms lisflood in many areas e g in the city of poldakhtar shown with the circle similarly the flood zones simulated by the two models with the 3dep dem in the missouri basin are shown in fig 8 fig 8 shows that the two models particularly hec ras slightly overestimate the flood area green pixels the performance of the models varies in different parts for instance the hec ras model overestimates the flood area over the east corner of the region green pixels in the square in fig 8a while lisflood fp underestimates the flood zone over that region red pixels in the square in fig 8b an overall performance of the two models is different by about 3 which is dominant in the east and downstream regions near carter lake where hec ras overestimates the flood zone circles and square in fig 8a results showed that alos and 3dep are the proper dems for the flood simulation in kashkan and missouri basin respectively to evaluate the impact of dems on flood zoning simulation we use alos dem with 30 m resolution in hec ras to provide a map of the flood event of march 2019 in the missouri basin fig 9 results show that the model overestimates flood propagation overflow channels especially in the urban areas due to a coarser resolution of the dem which is not consistent with the results of the 3dep dem fig 8 a coarser resolution of the dem e g alos cannot capture the height difference between pixels accurately in the plain and complex topography e g different land cover types which is important due to rapid flood propagation over these terrains figs 8 and 9 indicate that although alos is a proper dem to simulate the floodplain zone in kashkan basin with mountainous topography it cannot suitable for the missouri basin with plain topography a coarse resolution of dems for flood simulation in plain topography and complex land systems e g urban areas with a high concentration of structures can decrease the model performance due to lack of dems accuracy while in mountain topography dems with a coarser resolution e g 30 m can provide desired data and thus yield satisfactory results in flood mapping 5 discussion and concluding remarks floods as natural disasters are occurring more frequently with greater magnitudes in different parts of the world due to global warming which results in considerable financial damages and loss of human lives each year thus flood analysis and assessment is critical for hazard identification and risk management this work selected two basins with different features kashkan basin with mountain topography and missouri basin with plain topography to evaluate the skill of two models including hec ras and lisflood fp for flood simulation in addition the impact of topography and different parameters including dems inputs resolution roughness and modeling techniques on flood simulations by two models is examined this study can help find a suitable model for different topographies with a proper set of parameters considering time and memory consumption furthermore a best set of parameters in hec ras and lisflood fp is used for the floodplain mapping in two different topography types this guide and complete analysis is valuable particularly for water resources management and flood control the performance of the hec ras model in the plain topography varies with different modeling approaches particularly in 2d and coupled 1d 2d approaches for which the accuracy reached about 80 in 2d modeling and 69 in the coupled 1d 2d approach results indicated that coupled 1d 2d modeling in such a plain topography requires accurate mapping data to achieve higher accuracy compared to 2d modeling while the performance of the 2d modeling of the hec ras decreases with the aster dem in the flat topography although a slight overestimation of the flood discharge simulated by the hec ras and lisflood fp model is observed in the missouri basin lisflood fp with the 3dep dem shows the best performance in 2d modeling in addition the performance of the hec ras and lisflood fp models with the 3dep in flood depth simulation is highly precise based on the maximum observed depth recorded by the omaha city hydrometric station note that the lisflood fp model is computationally more efficient than hec ras particularly in the 2d modeling approach that is almost 20 times faster with the 3dep dem which is consistent with the results obtained by shustikova et al 2019 results confirmed that the skill of the modeling approaches depends on the physical characteristics of the study area as one of the critical factors in selecting solvers and resolution of the inputs and dems these factors also affect computational costs and memory usages findings are beneficial for water resources managers and planners to establish stream gauges in proper sits based on the topography of the basin which can save considerable amounts of money and increase flood analysis accuracy topography of the basin defined by the dems is another factor that affects the performance of the hec ras and lisflood fp models results showed that both models with alos 30 m performed well in kashkan basin in mountainous area and yielded satisfactory results in simulating hydrograph and floodplain zoning however in the missouri basin in the plain region both models showed satisfactory results with 3dep 10 m resolution dem although alos in hec ras and lisflood fp led to a proper flood zones map with a more than 85 overlap with satellite images in kashkan basin this dem resulted in overestimation of flood inundation in missouri basin the performance of the lisflood fp in plain topography varies by resolution of the dems and the more accurate input data mainly in the main river channel leads to the higher model accuracy while the performance of the model is less sensitive in mountain topography although hec ras model can simulate flood with all dems lisflood fp with srtm 30 m became unstable in the missouri basin thus the hec ras model outperforms the lisflood fp model due to compatibility with various dems particularly for smaller areas on the other hand the lisflood fp model has high computing speed and different solvers for modeling in different conditions which can make it better than hec ras especially for larger regions with high resolution dems although bessar et al 2021 claimed that the lisflood fp model is less accurate than the hec ras model our results showed that the model performance depends on different factors e g topography types inputs and solvers and an appropriate flood model needs to be selected based on topography and the complexity of the sites for instance lisflood fp with high resolution dems is suitable for the flat topography due to a lower computational cost while with a decrease of dem resolution hec ras can perform better than lisflood fp in addition hec ras is more appropriate for mountain topography and coarser resolutions of dems and it can provide reasonable results for floodplains particularly in complex case studies this can indicate the necessity of choosing a correct model solver and the right approach according to the physical features of the region which is crucial in flood modeling and management in addition to dems the impact of roughness coefficients on flood simulations is examined although past studies found different sensitivities of the flood models to the manning coefficient e g dimitriadis et al 2016 our results showed that both models are less sensitive to different manning coefficients and lisflood fp performs smoother with smaller variation using different manning coefficients than hec ras which is consistent with the results obtained by liu et al 2019 after finding the best setting e g solver dem and manning coefficients for the models proper established models are used to simulate flood maps results showed that although both models simulate flooded areas similarly with about 70 accuracy in kashan basin with mountain topography hec ras has a higher performance by 3 while with an increase of dem resolution e g to 10 m in 3dep dem in missouri basin lisflood fp can perform better than hec ras and produce the most accurate results with 4 higher accuracy generally results indicated that in missouri basin with plain topography a higher resolution of the input data e g dems leads to a larger sensitivity of the outputs an initial check of the data found no clear outliers in the digital elevation models in addition the aim of this work is to analyze and compare different dems e g their accuracy performance resolution thus although flood simulations usually need preprocessed elevation data the flood events in this study are simulated directly using the original dems note that the inputs of both models in both case studies are flow data from all hydrometric stations thus although the number and location of the flow stations can affect the accuracy of the results the close proximity of the flow stations to the main channel can increase the validity and reliability of our analysis this study shows satisfactory results using a few inputs e g flow data dems roughness coefficient which is valuable due to limited data temporally and spatially in many regions results can be even better with more inputs data if available like hydrometeorological variables e g precipitation and physical properties of soil and rivers to develop flood modeling techniques more flood models can be compared in different types of land cover and topography as future work the flood can be simulated at finer resolution over a larger floodplain domain in addition the flood modeling can be linked to the machine learning models for data postprocessing this work provides a proper guide to choose an appropriate model and solver based on the physics of the region to get efficient results with the highest accuracy and minimum computational cost results are valuable in finding flood prone areas and impacts of different flood scenarios which can be used for flood risk and hazard assessment to develop adaptation and mitigation plans especially for areas with a high risk of floods to save human lives and reduce financial damages declaration

2079,climate change leads to more severe floods which needs to be modeled properly this study uses two hydraulic models including hydrologic engineering center river analysis system hec ras and lisflood fp to simulate floods in two basins kashkan and missouri with different topographies mountain and plain terrain the impacts of different parameters like input resolutions digital elevation models dems roughness coefficient and modeling techniques on flood simulation are examined results indicate that the performance of the models varies based on topography input resolutions and modeling approach indeed the 2d modeling of both models in different topography types leads to better results compared to 1d 2d modeling in kashkan basin hec ras and lisflood fp models simulate floodplain flow with accuracies of 74 and 70 respectively and the accuracies of the models in missouri basin are 80 and 84 respectively although both models particularly hec ras with alos 30 m can provide reasonable results with an accuracy of 74 for kashkan and 63 for missouri basin lisflood fp can perform better about 4 higher accuracy than hec ras with a higher resolution of dem 3dep in missouri basin with significantly lower computational costs in addition the performance of the two models significantly decreases using aster dem in plain topography results confirm that hec ras outperforms lisflood fp in coarser resolution dems while lisflood fp performs better in plain topography which requires higher resolution dems despite the low sensitivity of the two models to roughness coefficients the variability of the lisflood fp simulations is smaller than hec ras this work uses the best setting and factors to simulate floodplain zones which is valuable for flood risk and hazard assessment to reduce and manage damages and losses keywords flood modeling hec ras and lisflood fp dems topography roughness flood hazard zones data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction current and historical statistics confirm that natural hydrological hazards can lead to economic damages and deaths one of the most frequent and dangerous hydrological hazards are floods which cause severe damages to infrastructure and human lives every year khan et al 2010 moghim and gharehtoragh 2022 only in the united states of america 26 important flood events have occurred between 1980 and 2016 and on average causes about 4 3 billion dollar damage to the country smith et al 2017 moreover climate change has a significant effect on the magnitude and frequency of the flood e g kvočka et al 2015 malaekeh et al 2022 effects of severe flood events induced by climate change are expected to increase in the future by population and economic growth alfieri et al 2017 although floods are inevitable events flood zoning and finding high risk regions enables us to reduce related risks over the last few years due to flood risks and impacts on human life flood models 1d and 2d have been widely used these models are useful to simulate and analyze the magnitude and frequency of the flood especially in areas where hydrometric data are insufficient or lacking flood modeling includes processes of transforming precipitation into flood hydrographs and simulating associated streamflow over a watershed ramírez 2000 in general three main groups of flood modeling including empirical models conceptual models and hydrodynamic models have been developed since 1970 s santiago collazo et al 2019 afshari et al 2018 teng et al 2017 one of the most widely used of the methods is hydrodynamic models mathematical model which attempt to simulate fluid motion and floods in one dimensional two dimensional and three dimensional teng et al 2017 although 1d models are widely used due to their simplicity they ignore some important aspects of flood modeling unlike 1d models the two dimensional approach is able to consider flow path in x y direction complex effects of topography and flood propagation rong et al 2020 bates et al 1998 lisflood fp and hec ras are two hydrodynamic models for flood simulation and projection with 1d 2d and coupled 1d 2d modeling technique that are widely used dasallas et al 2019 neal et al 2011 lisflood fp is one of the models that can be used for rainfall runoff modeling and sensitivity analysis of important parameters horritt and bates 2001 evaluated the effect of different resolutions of the digital elevation models dem in the range of 10 m to 1000 m on lisflood fp performance their results showed that the maximum accuracy is attained by 10 m resolution in addition they showed that the accuracy of the flood travel time is closely linked to the resolution of inputs lim and brandt 2019 evaluated the impact of the dem resolution and the manning coefficient on flood modeling in the lisflood fp their results showed that a higher resolution of dem with a larger manning value leads to a better result while a smaller manning value is better for a coarser resolution neal et al 2011 assessed the impact of new formulation of the lisflood fp on the model performance at the city scale resolution their result revealed that although the new version of the model is as accurate as the previous version it is 67 times faster which significantly reduces computational cost the other commonly used model for flood modeling is the hec ras model 1d 2d and coupled 1d 2d developed by the us army center for hydrological engineering caviedes voullième et al 2020 dazzi et al 2020 wing et al 2019 leandro et al 2014 ghimire et al 2022 evaluated the impact of 1d and 2d hec ras modeling on the flood travel time in grand river of ohio usa their results showed a significant difference in results of the flood extent 4 1 and the flood travel time 20 obtained by 1d and 2d approach yalcin 2020 used hec ras to assess the impact of resolution of the land cover and topography on simulated flooded areas in kilicozu creek he showed that 10 m resolution produces similar results as 2 m resolution with a slightly lower accuracy in simulated flooded areas geravand et al 2020 used the 1d hec ras modeling to investigate the effect of the resolution of river geometry data on flood inundation their results indicated that a coarser and finer resolution of the cross section tends to overestimate and underestimate respectively patel et al 2017 used coupled 1d 2d modeling in hec ras to evaluate flood inundation they used 299 cross sections in the river channel to estimate the flood plain based on the srtm dem their results indicated that important outputs e g flood depth and flooded areas can be simulated in 2d modeling of hec ras better than 1d in addition they showed that coupled 1d 2d approach leads to more reliable results than fully one dimensional modeling shustikova et al 2020 compared the performance of hec ras and lisflood fp in levee breaching their results showed that both models lead to similar results and they only have less than 1 difference in maximum flow over the breach shustikovaa et al 2019 used hec ras and lisflood fp 2d to assess the effect of different grid sizes on their performance in the secchia river their results showed that the computational cost in lisflood fp is lower while hec ras slightly outperforms lisflood fp horritt and bates 2002 compared the performance of the 1d and 2d flood models including hec ras lisflood fp and telemac 2 they used channel and floodplain manning coefficients for the calibration their results showed that the lisflood fp model is more sensitive to the calibration than hec ras and telemac 2d tariq et al 2021 used the hec ras model and landsat 8 images for flood frequency analysis to estimate extreme flows and damages of the 2014 flood event in pakistan their results highlighted an important role of hydrodynamic models and satellite imagery for flood mapping which can aid in flood damage assessment in addition to the physical models data driven approaches are used for the flood analysis avand et al 2022 used artificial neural networks anns random forests rf and generalized linear models glms to evaluate the impact of different dem resolutions on flood probability maps they showed that the accuracy of the flood probability prediction depends on not only the resolution of the dems but also other parameters like precipitation altitude and the distance from the river to evaluate flood vulnerability of different sub basins in kalan basin iran ilderomi et al 2022 combined the picture fuzzy analytic hierarchy and picture fuzzy linear assignment models to find weights for 13 morphometric criteria their results found regions with the highest and lowest susceptibility to flooding based on the rank frequency matrix flood models perform differently in various topographies with different parameters in addition the computational cost and memory usage of modeling can affect a proper choice of a flood model although many studies confirmed the main role of topography and physical features of the domain in flood simulations enyew and steeneveld 2014 shustikova et al 2019 rahimzadeh et al 2019 there are limited studies in comparative analysis of different flood models in various topography types considering different parameters this study provides a complete assessment of flood simulations by two different flood models considering different parameters we evaluate the performance of the hec ras and lisflood model in different topography types mountain and plain topography to investigate the impact of topography and different factors including different modeling techniques dems inputs resolution and roughness coefficient on flood modeling remote sensing and hydrometric data are used to find a suitable model in different conditions considering time and memory efficiency proper established models are used to simulate heavy flood events in the case studies the case study and methodology are described in sections 2 and 3 followed by the results and discussion in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 case study this study uses hec ras and lisflood fp to evaluate flood events in two case studies with different topographies in march and april 2019 the first case study is kashkan river basin in iran with mountainous region and the second one is missouri river basin in usa with a relatively flat land 2 1 kashkan river basin kashkan river basin is one of the main hydrological units in the karkheh basin in iran which is located in western iran id code 222 poldokhtar city is located in the outlet of the kashkan river basin area with an approximate area of 9524 2 km2 this basin is geographically extended from 47 12 to 48 59 east and 33 8 to 34 2 north poldokhtar has hot summers and slightly cold winters with a semi arid climate according to the hydrological classification of iran this basin is a subset of the persian gulf catchment area and one of the water tributaries of the karkheh river dehghani et al 2020 due to the topography mountain terrain and climate of the region kashkan basin has usually experienced severe flood events kashkan river which is one of the most prominent rivers in this basin has experienced sixteen flood events with discharge of more than 1000 m3 s 1 during the last fifty years one of the most significant flood events in the study area occurred in march 2019 with a maximum flow rate of more than 5 000 m3 s 1 which caused severe damages to the region hosseini et al 2021 thus this study simulates the flood event of march 2019 in this basin with the mountain terrain fig 1 a shows a digital elevation model dem of the study area provided by the aster satellite sensor with a spatial resolution of 30 m this study uses different digital elevation models including aster 30 m srtm 30 m 90 m and alos 30 m to consider the effect of dem hydrometric data for kashkan are provided from the regional water company of lorestan and iran water resources management company data include temperature precipitation and streamflow at hourly resolution during flood and at daily and monthly resolution when there is no flood hydrometric data are provided by the stream gauges including afrineh kashkan station at upstream poldokhtar station at downstream and two stations of afrineh visian doab and baraftab gauges on the two tributaries of the chulhol river and madian river in the kashkan basin fig 1a the inputs of the both models are hourly flow data from all hydrometric stations to assess the effect of the digital elevation model a 30 m dem prepared by alos that is claimed as the best digital elevation model azizian and brocca 2020 grohmann 2018 is obtained from the japan aerospace exploration agency in addition three other digital elevation models including srtm 30 m srtm 90 m and aster are used 2 2 missouri river basin the second case study is the missouri river basin in the state of nebraska with a typical mid western climate hot summers and cold winters the missouri river is the longest river in the united states which possesses a catchment area of about 529 000 square miles extending over ten states more than 40 dams are along the missouri river to provide water mainly for agriculture the state of nebraska encompasses an area of about 200 000 km2 with several catchments the largest city in the state and the second largest city located near the missouri river is omaha with a population of about 500 000 and an area of approximately 380 000 km2 the missouri basin has experienced extensive floods frequently for instance a flood event happened with a flow rate of about 11 000 m3 s 1 in 1952 and there was a severe flood event with a flow rate of more than 5000 m3 s 1 in march 2019 which caused more than 3 billion damages flanagan et al 2020 thus this study considers missouri basin with the plain terrain that has a different topography compared to the first case study kashkan basin we use six stream gauges including one in decator id code 06601200 as the upstream gauge one in omaha id code 06610000 as the downstream gauge and four other gauges id codes 06602400 06607500 06608500 06609500 along the river the 15 minute flow data from all stations in the missouri basin are used as inputs to the both models fig 1b shows the dem of the basin with an accuracy of 30 m with related gauges data including streamflow and water level with 15 minute resolution and cross sections are obtained from the united states geological survey usgs in the missouri basin in addition to the four types of dems used for the flood modeling in kashkan basin a 10 meter 3dep digital elevation model developed by the us geological survey usgs are also used for flood simulation 3 methodology this work uses different approaches including coupled 1d 2d and 2d modeling in hec ras and lisflood fp over two distinct topographies including kashkan with mountain topography and missouri with plain topography most flood models estimate the general one dimensional equation of the saint venant for 1d modeling the 2d modeling of hec ras can solve the two dimensional saint venant equation or two dimensional wave propagation equations through an implicit finite volume solution vreugdenhil 1994 cunge 1980 de saint venant and adhémar jean claude 1871 another model that can simulate floodplain and flood hydraulics is lisflood fp bates et al 2010 savage et al 2016 lisflood fp developed by the university of bristol is based on the inertial formulation of surface water equations bates and de roo 2000 the lisflood fp model includes different solvers which can be selected based on physical features of the basins the solvers are based on the momentum and continuity equations lisflood fp model uses the one dimensional kinematic wave equation for the river channel within a finite difference scheme and the two dimensional diffusion wave equation for the floodplain the choice of the numerical solution depends on the features of the system available data required computational time and accuracy to control the stability of the models hec ras and lisflood fp the courant friedrichs lewy condition is used to determine the time step indeed time step in the flood modeling is one of the most important parameters an improper time step leads to instability of the model and invalid results leandro et al 2014 to establish a model in kashkan basin a mesh structure 100 m by 100 m for a square geometric shape and a five or hexagonal mesh for the border is used for 2d modeling in the hec ras for the main river channel in kashkan basin 233 cross sections are considered in the coupled 1d 2d modeling which is integrated with the 2d modeling for the flood plains with the mesh of 50 m by 50 m on the other hand lisflood fp needs dem provided by raster files as one of important inputs o loughlin et al 2020 based on the physical geometry of the case study the acceleration and subgrid solvers are selected for the 2d modeling of the flood plain and 1d modeling of the main river channel respectively furthermore to evaluate the roughness effect different manning coefficients for the flood plain f and channel c are used the best manning coefficients are selected based on model calibration in the historical event to prepare a model structure in missouri a one dimensional channel with 800 cross sections and two floodplains with 50 by 50 mesh grid is used for 2d modeling in hec ras similar to kashkan 2d and coupled 1d 2d modeling is used for lisflood fp in coupled 1d 2d modeling the 2d and 1d solver is used for simulating floodplain and main channel respectively the acceleration floodplain solver is used in the 2d modeling and the subgrid solver as one of the best solver is used to calculate channel flow bates et al 2013 in both 2d and coupled 1d 2d modeling the 3dep dem with 10 m resolution is used the cross sections provided by the usgs are used in the coupled 1d 2d approach for the main channel the performance of the two models hec ras and lisflood is validated at the downstream hydrometric stations which is pol dokhtar in kashkan basin and 06610000 station in missouri basin to evaluate the performance of the models statistical measures including correlation root mean square error rmse normalized root mean square error nrmse fit percentage indicator fi and bias percentage indicator bi are used the nrmse that is the rmse of the normalized discharge values evaluates the models performance and shows how well flood discharge particularly high values peaks are simulated the fi which is the flood modeling evaluation index schumann et al 2009 is used to compare the results of the flooded areas with the satellite images as 1 fi a a b c 100 where a is the number of pixels that are correctly predicted b is the number of pixels that are not flooded but the model defines them as flooded areas and c is the number of pixels that are flooded but the model defines them as no flood the second indicator bi bernini and franchini 2013 represents errors of the simulated flooded areas relative to the reference maps obtained from the satellite images which can be expressed as 2 bi a b a c 1 100 where a b and c are defined in eq 1 the positive and negative bi indicates that the flooded areas are overestimated and underestimated respectively 4 results to evaluate the impact of different dem resolutions and digital elevation model on model performance different dems are used in hec ras and lisflood to simulate floodplain in kashkan and missouri case studies to compare results statistical metrics including fi and bi are calculated and presented in table 1 table 1 shows that the overall performance of the hec ras model is slightly better 5 than the lisflood fp in kashkan case study there is a slight underestimation in both models with the highest resolution dem alos 2d and an overestimation in both 1d and 2d modeling with all other dems results of lisflood fp and hec ras in 2d and 1d modeling under alos dem are close with about 1 and 3 differences respectively while lisflood fp leads a larger difference than hec ras using srtm with a 90 m resolution generally the performance of the lisflood fp and hec ras decreases by about 11 and 5 from 30 to 90 m resolution respectively results indicate that the hec ras model is more stable and less sensitive to the inputs resolution dems and mesh dimensions while the lisflood fp model is more sensitive to the resolution of inputs raster data that can lead to a considerable different result although hec ras model shows the best results in kashkan basin under 2d modeling with alos lisflood fp is more computationally efficient and can consider different solvers for river channels and floodplains for the missouri basin the performance of the lisflood fp in 2d and the coupled 1d 2d modeling by 3dep is satisfactory and slightly better than the hec ras model while with a decrease of the dem s resolution the performance of the lisflood fp reduces significantly for instance the performance of the lisflood fp decreases by 56 with the srtm 90 m dem in addition the stability of the model with the srtm 30 m fails which indicates the importance of the dem in model performance in the missouri basin all dems with either 1d or 2d modeling approaches lead to an overestimation additionally these overestimations are higher in lisflood fp compared to hec ras for most dems excluding the 3dep where lisflood fp shows the lowest overestimation and the best results with 84 accuracy results show that models have the best performance using alos and 3dep dems in kashkan and missouri basins respectively indeed the hec ras 2d modeling with alos dem illustrates a better performance compared to the lisflood fp in mountain topography on the other hand lisflood fp is able to produce more accurate results with increasing dem resolutions in the missouri basin with plain topography table 1 confirms that using 3dep in the missouri basin and alos in the kashkan basin lead to the best results to evaluate variation of the dems the longitudinal and cross profiles of the dems are compared in two study areas in fig 2 fig 2 illustrates profiles longitudinal and cross section of the elevation using different dems in two case studies results show that there is a larger difference between dems in kashkan in mountain topography compared to missouri in plain topography to examine the performance of the models to simulate the flood event in march and april 2019 with different dems time series of the estimated and observed discharge for kashkan basin is illustrated in fig 3 results show that the hec ras model fig 3a and 3b with the srtm 90 m dem underestimates discharges compared to the observations and the peak discharge is shifted by about one hour compared to the results of other dems indeed the coupled 1d 2d modeling and srtm90 m lead to the peak discharge one hour earlier and one hour later from observations respectively in addition fig 3 shows that different dems in lisflood fp model lead to similar results excluding the alos in 2d modeling which exhibitssuperiorperformance in the kashkan basin with mountain topography in other words results indicate that the lisflood fp with the alos 2d simulates discharges better than other dems the correlation and rmse between simulated and observed discharge are 96 5 and 320 cms respectively in general the overall performance of the two models under alos dem in the 2d modeling approach is close to evaluate the performance of the hec ras and lisflood in the other case study missouri basin two models are used to simulate discharge and depth with different dems for the flood event of march 2019 fig 4 fig 4 shows that hec ras with 3dep alos and srtm30 with 30 m resolution leads to better results in plain topography missouri basin the better performance of the 3dep is more noticeable in depth simulation although aster has finer resolution than srtm90 m it leads to the worst results this can refer to the lack of dem characterization capability of aster for plain areas which indicates the sensitivity of both models not only to the resolution of the dems but also to their appropriateness and compatibility in different topography types although hec ras performs well with srtm30 m lisflood fp becomes unstable with that dem results are shown in the second column in fig 4 furthermore results show that lisflood fp with the alos leads to better simulations in both discharge and depth second column in fig 4 statistical measures table 1 and simulations figs 3 and 4 indicate that alos and 3dep are proper dems for hec ras and lisflood in kashkan and missouri basin respectively the alos digital elevation model in lisflood fp leads to the best results after 3dep dem table 1 after 3dep dems including alos and srtm30 m with the same 30 m resolution provide the best results in simulating flood discharge compared to other digital elevation models in the hec ras model based on the results we use alos and 3dep with 10 m resolution as the proper dems in the kashkan and missouri basin for other assessment in this work to determine the most optimal manning coefficient the performance of the two models in the kashkan basin is evaluated using different manning coefficients we define two manning coefficients for the floodplain nf and channel nc in lisflood fp due to two separate solvers in the model for the channel and floodplain while in hec ras with the same solver we define a single manning coefficient for the entire domain fig 5 shows that although both models can simulate discharge well the variability of the simulations by lisflood fp with different manning coefficients is smaller than that of the hec ras model indeed the hec ras model is more sensitive to the manning coefficient than the lisflood fp furthermore the hydrograph fluctuation increases by reducing manning values and leads to about one hour earlier peak discharge fig 5a and 5b although different manning coefficients for the floodplain and channel in lisflood shows varied performance the same values of roughness for floodplain and channel in hec ras leads to a better result in kashkan basin the overall performance of the two models is close with a correlation of 0 94 and 0 95 rmse of 312 and 300 cms and nrmse of 5 and 4 8 relative to the observations for hec ras and lisflood fp respectively results indicate that the simulated discharge by lisflood fp follows observations better than that of the hec ras model and hec ras slightly overestimates observed hydrograph the same analysis and results are obtained for the missouri basin figure is not shown thus the manning coefficients of 0 04 and 0 03 as the proper values for the kashkan and missouri basin are selected for the rest of this work to assess the performance of the two models at the best structure optimized manning coefficient best dems and solvers hydrographs of the final outputs for the flood event of march and april 2019 in kashkan and missouri basin are illustrated in fig 6 fig 6 shows that the simulated discharge by two models with the alos dem in the kashkan basin follows observations well while the simulated hydrograph at the beginning of the event in the missouri basin is different from the observations that can be due to the warm up period although hec ras model outperforms lisflood in simulating the maximum flood in the basin lisflood fp captures the trend of the observed hydrograph better than hec ras statistical measures indicate that correlation and nrmse are about 95 and 0 16 for lisflood fp 92 and 0 2 for hec ras respectively which can confirm a proper performance of the two models to further illustrate the performance of the hec ras and lisflood fp simulated flood map for kashkan basin is illustrated in fig 7 fig 7 shows flood areas perfectly simulated by the models that are validated by the satellite images blue color called same in the figure although two models can simulate floodplain zoning well hec ras outperforms lisflood in many areas e g in the city of poldakhtar shown with the circle similarly the flood zones simulated by the two models with the 3dep dem in the missouri basin are shown in fig 8 fig 8 shows that the two models particularly hec ras slightly overestimate the flood area green pixels the performance of the models varies in different parts for instance the hec ras model overestimates the flood area over the east corner of the region green pixels in the square in fig 8a while lisflood fp underestimates the flood zone over that region red pixels in the square in fig 8b an overall performance of the two models is different by about 3 which is dominant in the east and downstream regions near carter lake where hec ras overestimates the flood zone circles and square in fig 8a results showed that alos and 3dep are the proper dems for the flood simulation in kashkan and missouri basin respectively to evaluate the impact of dems on flood zoning simulation we use alos dem with 30 m resolution in hec ras to provide a map of the flood event of march 2019 in the missouri basin fig 9 results show that the model overestimates flood propagation overflow channels especially in the urban areas due to a coarser resolution of the dem which is not consistent with the results of the 3dep dem fig 8 a coarser resolution of the dem e g alos cannot capture the height difference between pixels accurately in the plain and complex topography e g different land cover types which is important due to rapid flood propagation over these terrains figs 8 and 9 indicate that although alos is a proper dem to simulate the floodplain zone in kashkan basin with mountainous topography it cannot suitable for the missouri basin with plain topography a coarse resolution of dems for flood simulation in plain topography and complex land systems e g urban areas with a high concentration of structures can decrease the model performance due to lack of dems accuracy while in mountain topography dems with a coarser resolution e g 30 m can provide desired data and thus yield satisfactory results in flood mapping 5 discussion and concluding remarks floods as natural disasters are occurring more frequently with greater magnitudes in different parts of the world due to global warming which results in considerable financial damages and loss of human lives each year thus flood analysis and assessment is critical for hazard identification and risk management this work selected two basins with different features kashkan basin with mountain topography and missouri basin with plain topography to evaluate the skill of two models including hec ras and lisflood fp for flood simulation in addition the impact of topography and different parameters including dems inputs resolution roughness and modeling techniques on flood simulations by two models is examined this study can help find a suitable model for different topographies with a proper set of parameters considering time and memory consumption furthermore a best set of parameters in hec ras and lisflood fp is used for the floodplain mapping in two different topography types this guide and complete analysis is valuable particularly for water resources management and flood control the performance of the hec ras model in the plain topography varies with different modeling approaches particularly in 2d and coupled 1d 2d approaches for which the accuracy reached about 80 in 2d modeling and 69 in the coupled 1d 2d approach results indicated that coupled 1d 2d modeling in such a plain topography requires accurate mapping data to achieve higher accuracy compared to 2d modeling while the performance of the 2d modeling of the hec ras decreases with the aster dem in the flat topography although a slight overestimation of the flood discharge simulated by the hec ras and lisflood fp model is observed in the missouri basin lisflood fp with the 3dep dem shows the best performance in 2d modeling in addition the performance of the hec ras and lisflood fp models with the 3dep in flood depth simulation is highly precise based on the maximum observed depth recorded by the omaha city hydrometric station note that the lisflood fp model is computationally more efficient than hec ras particularly in the 2d modeling approach that is almost 20 times faster with the 3dep dem which is consistent with the results obtained by shustikova et al 2019 results confirmed that the skill of the modeling approaches depends on the physical characteristics of the study area as one of the critical factors in selecting solvers and resolution of the inputs and dems these factors also affect computational costs and memory usages findings are beneficial for water resources managers and planners to establish stream gauges in proper sits based on the topography of the basin which can save considerable amounts of money and increase flood analysis accuracy topography of the basin defined by the dems is another factor that affects the performance of the hec ras and lisflood fp models results showed that both models with alos 30 m performed well in kashkan basin in mountainous area and yielded satisfactory results in simulating hydrograph and floodplain zoning however in the missouri basin in the plain region both models showed satisfactory results with 3dep 10 m resolution dem although alos in hec ras and lisflood fp led to a proper flood zones map with a more than 85 overlap with satellite images in kashkan basin this dem resulted in overestimation of flood inundation in missouri basin the performance of the lisflood fp in plain topography varies by resolution of the dems and the more accurate input data mainly in the main river channel leads to the higher model accuracy while the performance of the model is less sensitive in mountain topography although hec ras model can simulate flood with all dems lisflood fp with srtm 30 m became unstable in the missouri basin thus the hec ras model outperforms the lisflood fp model due to compatibility with various dems particularly for smaller areas on the other hand the lisflood fp model has high computing speed and different solvers for modeling in different conditions which can make it better than hec ras especially for larger regions with high resolution dems although bessar et al 2021 claimed that the lisflood fp model is less accurate than the hec ras model our results showed that the model performance depends on different factors e g topography types inputs and solvers and an appropriate flood model needs to be selected based on topography and the complexity of the sites for instance lisflood fp with high resolution dems is suitable for the flat topography due to a lower computational cost while with a decrease of dem resolution hec ras can perform better than lisflood fp in addition hec ras is more appropriate for mountain topography and coarser resolutions of dems and it can provide reasonable results for floodplains particularly in complex case studies this can indicate the necessity of choosing a correct model solver and the right approach according to the physical features of the region which is crucial in flood modeling and management in addition to dems the impact of roughness coefficients on flood simulations is examined although past studies found different sensitivities of the flood models to the manning coefficient e g dimitriadis et al 2016 our results showed that both models are less sensitive to different manning coefficients and lisflood fp performs smoother with smaller variation using different manning coefficients than hec ras which is consistent with the results obtained by liu et al 2019 after finding the best setting e g solver dem and manning coefficients for the models proper established models are used to simulate flood maps results showed that although both models simulate flooded areas similarly with about 70 accuracy in kashan basin with mountain topography hec ras has a higher performance by 3 while with an increase of dem resolution e g to 10 m in 3dep dem in missouri basin lisflood fp can perform better than hec ras and produce the most accurate results with 4 higher accuracy generally results indicated that in missouri basin with plain topography a higher resolution of the input data e g dems leads to a larger sensitivity of the outputs an initial check of the data found no clear outliers in the digital elevation models in addition the aim of this work is to analyze and compare different dems e g their accuracy performance resolution thus although flood simulations usually need preprocessed elevation data the flood events in this study are simulated directly using the original dems note that the inputs of both models in both case studies are flow data from all hydrometric stations thus although the number and location of the flow stations can affect the accuracy of the results the close proximity of the flow stations to the main channel can increase the validity and reliability of our analysis this study shows satisfactory results using a few inputs e g flow data dems roughness coefficient which is valuable due to limited data temporally and spatially in many regions results can be even better with more inputs data if available like hydrometeorological variables e g precipitation and physical properties of soil and rivers to develop flood modeling techniques more flood models can be compared in different types of land cover and topography as future work the flood can be simulated at finer resolution over a larger floodplain domain in addition the flood modeling can be linked to the machine learning models for data postprocessing this work provides a proper guide to choose an appropriate model and solver based on the physics of the region to get efficient results with the highest accuracy and minimum computational cost results are valuable in finding flood prone areas and impacts of different flood scenarios which can be used for flood risk and hazard assessment to develop adaptation and mitigation plans especially for areas with a high risk of floods to save human lives and reduce financial damages declaration
