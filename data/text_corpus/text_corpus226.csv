high water level mature salix alba and salix viminalis occur in tidal freshwater wetlands and studied the tree trunk form and position in a subsequent field experiment we aimed to answer the questions i if both floodplain willow species are able to regenerate vegetatively under tidal influence in estuarine field conditions and ii if mature willows differ in their response to increasing flooding in tidal freshwater wetlands compared to juvenile willows 2 material and methods both an estuarine field survey on mature willow individuals and a subsequent field experiment on juvenile willows on flooding stairways were conducted in tidal freshwater wetlands at the elbe estuary ger close to the hamburg harbour fig 1 the elbe estuary comprises a 142 km long tidal stretch with a salinity gradient from the mouth at the north sea to the upstream border at a weir close to geesthacht in hamburg in the mid 20th century the tidal freshwater zone was found between geesthacht and glückstadt including the estuarine stretch in hamburg caspers 1959 were freshwater conditions were also confirmed for tidal wetlands comprised of softwood forests markus michalczyk et al 2014b hamburg is located

june to august average 80 mm and the mean annual precipitation is 793 mm dwd 1981 2010 http www dwd de the tidal wetlands at the elbe estuary were lost almost 1000 years ago to a large extent due to dike construction garniel and mierwald 1996 and river deepening for shipping since the middle of the nineteenth century has led to an increased tidal amplitude from 1 8 m in 1840 to 3 6 m in 1996 kausch 1996 recently the mean tidal amplitude at the upper head of the estuary was 2 m and increased towards its maximum along the tidal freshwater stretch at hamburg harbour kappenberg 2014 2 1 field survey the objective was to study field effects on the willow in tidal freshwater wetlands within a degraded estuary thus the field survey was conducted along the tidal freshwater stretch close to the hamburg harbour were the tidal amplitude reaches its maximum of 3 6 m close to the industrial and harbour sites the study sites chosen contained the largest remaining tidal wetlands with an adequate number of willow individuals of both s alba and s viminalis fig 1 protected site heuckenlock 53 28 28 n 10 2 19 e we chose woody patches in these tidal freshwater wetlands based on aerial photographs and listed them according to a random generator within these plots we selected 25 mature specimens per species s alba and s viminalis as study individuals we measured elevation above sea level for the salix specimen in september 2010 using levelling technology starting from the gauge located near the dike the level of each specimen was measured to 2 mm accuracy pentax automatik nivelliere al m5c

2 field experiment subsequent to the field survey a field experiment was conducted at the shore of the elbe estuary in hamburg from june to september 2011 sixty juvenile willow plants of both salix alba and salix viminalis were placed on flooding stairways and exposed to three elevations relative to mean high water plants on stair 1 experienced springtide flooding only tidal flooding level 1 6 25 cm relative to mean high water level mhwl while plants on stair 2 tidal flooding level 2 62 50 cm below mhwl and stair 3 tidal flooding level 3 131 25 cm below mhwl experienced a twice daily tidal flooding regime the plants on stair 1 served as a control since both willow species generally occur above mean high tide level in tidal wetlands ellenberg and leuschner 2010 four sites at the tidal freshwater stretch in hamburg close to the harbour fig 1 and with a tidal range of 3 6 m were selected for exposing the willows to tidal flooding on stairways 1 bunthäuser spitze 53 27 41 67 n 10 3 49

collected as plant material from tidal wetland sites along the elbe estuary the selection criterion for s alba and s viminalis individuals for generating cuttings was the presence of straight shoots the cuttings were equalized to 20 cm length and had equal conditions in a control in a hydroponic greenhouse experiment from february to april 2011 markus michalczyk et al 2014 during may 2011 the vegetative propagules previously used in the control were allowed to regenerate in order to test their general resprouting capacity before starting the experiment shoot and root biomass were removed from the cuttings and the cleared cuttings served as plant samples in the field experiment at each of the four sites along the tidal freshwater stretch one stairway was installed at the slope 1 3 of the shore the metal stairways consisted of grid stairs with 68 75 cm difference in height between each single willow cuttings were planted in pots 14 cm height 18 cm diameter with mixed 1 1 river sand and compost soil the pots were filled to the top with the soil mix the soil mix was covered with gauze to keep the soil in the pots and the gauze was taped to the outside of the pots ten pots with cuttings of one salix species s alba or s viminalis were arranged on each of the three flooding stairs s alba was placed on the tidal flooding stairways at site 1 and site 2 s viminalis was placed on the tidal flooding stairways at site 3 and 4 this resulted in 30 pots per flooding stairway and added up to 60 pots per species and 120 pots in total all pots were fastened with cable ties at the stairways to avoid any losses due to tidal current the field experiment was set up on june 18th and concluded on september 15th shoot number and number of leaves were recorded once a month july 8th august 6th and september 3rd 2011 at the end of the experiment on september 15th the pots were removed from the stairways and final shoot length was measured finally above ground and below ground biomass was harvested from each of the plants all harvested biomass was cleaned and dried separately at 60 c to constant weight before weighing 2 3 data analysis all data analyses were carried out

with increasing flooding level fig 5 table 3 4 discussion 4 1 occurrence of mature willows at elevational gradients in tidal freshwater wetlands the results of the field survey showed firstly that mature willow individuals occur below mhwl level in tidal freshwater wetlands we thus provide the first record of the ability of two characteristic floodplain willow species s alba and s viminalis to grow at elevations below mhwl level up to approx 60 cm macrophytes in the elbe estuary e g phragmites australis may be largely stimulated due to regional evolutionary history and human alterations affecting abiotic conditions and species composition in estuaries engels and jensen 2009 the increase in tidal amplitude 2 m in the year 1900 to 3 6 m in 2000 in hamburg kappenberg 2014 due to the deepening of the elbe shipping channel from 3 m to more than 14 m in the metropolitan area of hamburg kerner 2007 may have induced an increased tidal inundation and may have also induced an increasing tidal flooding on our studied willow species during their life time in the tidal freshwater wetlands additionally the predominant number of inclined and prostrate trunks as well as the shorter height mean 15 m of s alba trees in our study may be due to this increased tidal amplitude since s alba usually grows as a large upright tree attaining heights of 20 m or more dickmann and kuzovkina 2014 in particular the high number of prostrate trees may be caused by reduced stability and decreased below ground biomass this root cease is common in many wetland plants mitsch and gosselink 2000 since flooding fills soil pores with water and lowers oxygen supply for roots blom and voesenek 1996 this is also supported by a separate study that measured an increased shoot root ratio of s alba in a tidal flooding experiment under controlled conditions markus michalczyk et al 2016a however the low water level decreased by 50 cm from 1970 to 2004 due to fairway deepening and large scale embankments that shifted the maximum tidal amplitude in the elbe estuary further upstream to hamburg kappenberg 2014 thus the willows in the tidal freshwater wetlands experience not only increased tidal flooding due to the increased tidal amplitude but willow habitats below mean high water are less flooded than before meaning that the root system may get aerated during ebb tide according to the review on adaptations to flooding blom 1999 the establishment of willows along tidal freshwater riverine stretches is generally at first prevented by flooding and later on by the competition of phragmites thus the decreased low water may have enhanced the continuing growth of the willows at sites below mean water in the elbe estuary these findings specify previous assertions of willows ability to settle at tidal wetlands up to the river mouth at the north sea ellenberg and leuschner 2010 they built upon the description by struyf et al 2009 of woody communities comprising both salix study species at the final stage of succession in european tidal freshwater wetlands at higher elevations increasing tidal flooding may have facilitated the dendriform mature s alba compared to the shrubby s viminalis salix viminalis may be outcompeted by s alba and others e g phragmites australis a natural reed species component in tidal wetlands that is stimulated by increasing tidal flooding engels and jensen 2009 4 2 regeneration and growth of two willow species under estuarine field conditions salix alba and s viminalis cuttings responded differently to increasing tidal flooding in the field experiment at all flooding levels up to 60 cm inundation depth s viminalis resprouted faster and developed more leaves more and longer shoots and more shoot and root dry mass compared to s alba this may confirm a better adaptation to flooding of the shrubby form compared to the dendriform in the genus salix mosner et al 2011 our results further show coppicing s viminalis and extracting plant material to limit river eutrophication may be possible at locations where the fast growing willows accumulate high phosphorus loads in the water column as suggested by skłodowski et al 2014 furthermore this corresponds with the larger dry mass documented in juvenile s viminalis compared to s alba in a former tidal flooding experiment under controlled conditions markus michalczyk et al 2016a by contrast in that former study leaf number and shoot length increased significantly more in salix alba over time resprouting rates after shoot removal were greater than 90 in both species and thus both s alba and s viminalis were presumed to tolerate tidal flooding up to 60 cm markus michalczyk et al 2016a contrary to the experiment by mosner et al 2011 we used cuttings from which shoots and roots were removed twice before starting the presented experiment and s alba shoot and root dry mass were similarly low at all tidal flooding levels so that no effect of tidal flooding was found the repeated disturbance may have better suited the life characteristics of s viminalis life characteristics since floodplain shrubs are able to grow under severe abiotic disturbance at the floodplain edge at low elevations amlin and rood 2002 francis and gurnell 2006 due to high resprouting capacity from flood damaged stumps bendix and hupp 2000 keoleian and volk 2005 mention willows rapid growth after coppices as a characteristic trait of plants that are adapted to disturbed environments but highlight shrub willows as ideal for short rotation coppices src according to mitchell et al 1999 src willows resprout vigorously after harvest so that seven to ten harvests are possible from a single planting thus the better performance of juvenile s viminalis compared to juvenile s alba in our tidal flooding experiment may be due to differences in resprouting capacity rather than in tolerance to tidal flooding 4 3 differences in juvenile compared to mature willows in increasing tidal flooding the existence of adaptations by floodplain vegetation to inundation has been known for decades e g blom 1999 willows colonize exposed riverbanks in the northern temperate zone seeds germinate if surfaces stay moist and seedlings establish when undisturbed for a sufficient period the bending stability of large plants enables them to withstand moderate floods and if branches break off they resprout successfully karrenberg et al 2002 however this breaking off of branches is species specific s fragilis is characterized by preformed breaking points at twig bases due to differences in lignin content this is not the case in s alba beismann et al 2000 and therefor juvenile s alba may have failed to resprout successfully in our tidal flooding experiment our findings on mature willows at low lying sites correspond to mosner et al 2011 suggesting that in addition to flooding hydraulic forces restrict the niches for woody vegetation at low lying sites further factors in the estuarine environment may be taken in account in further studies floodplain vegetation feedback on sediment dynamics regulates succession and established woody vegetation may reduce river flow during floods leading to increasing sedimentation corenblit et al 2009 moreover floodplain willows enhance river self purification by accumulating phosphorus and managed coppicing and removal of the biomass may limit downstream eutrophication kiedrzyńska et al 2008 skłodowski et al 2014 dryer conditions may limit vegetative propagule establishment due to juvenile plants small root system johnson 2000 and hydrodynamic forcing in addition to tidal inundation predicts the window of opportunity for early establishment of biota hu et al 2015 in our study in a degraded estuary the occurrence of s viminalis was limited to 2 1 m whereas s alba were found up to 2 7 m above mhwl this corresponds to mosner et al 2011 who documented that willows at high elevation river floodplain sites may suffer from drought stress whereas at locations where water levels strongly fluctuate both mature and juvenile willow individuals may settle at a wider range of different elevations similarly markus michalczyk et al 2016b showed that s alba seedlings germinate anchor and establish under a tidal flooding regime in estuarine conditions where water level fluctuates due to tides and provides recurring soil moisture both willow species occupy a similar niche regarding the site elevation below mhwl s viminalis may have an advantage in the early establishment phase of it vegetative propagules due to better resprouting capacity after disturbance and faster growth rate in contrast s alba mature trees may have the advantage in both habitats where the tidal inundation increases below mhwl during the tree s life time and at dryer sites above mhwl influenced by spring tides because s alba produces deep rooting trees evolved during dynamic erosion sedimentation disturbance processes in tidal wetlands 5 conclusion the presented field survey on the morphology and occurrence of mature floodplain willows is the first study that shows the settlement of tidal freshwater wetlands with s viminalis and s alba up to a level of 57 cm below mean high water level our corresponding field experiment on juvenile plants confirms the growth capacity of s viminalis and s alba up to a level of 60 cm below the mean high water in tidal freshwater wetlands at the elbe estuary this finding is relevant to predicted rising sea level scenarios and integrated management plans to restore tidal willow softwood

i if both floodplain willow species are able to regenerate vegetatively under tidal influence in estuarine field conditions and ii if mature willows differ in their response to increasing flooding in tidal freshwater wetlands compared to juvenile willows 2 material and methods both an estuarine field survey on mature willow individuals and a subsequent field experiment on juvenile willows on flooding stairways were conducted in tidal freshwater wetlands at the elbe estuary ger close to the hamburg harbour fig 1 the elbe estuary comprises a 142 km long tidal stretch with a salinity gradient from the mouth at the north sea to the upstream border at a weir close to geesthacht in hamburg in the mid 20th century the tidal freshwater zone was found between geesthacht and glückstadt including the estuarine stretch in hamburg caspers 1959 were freshwater conditions were also confirmed for tidal wetlands comprised of softwood forests markus michalczyk et al 2014b hamburg is located in the temperate zone and characterized by an atlantic climate with 9 c mean annual air temperature 26 summer days t max 25 c and 70 frost days t max 0 c the highest precipitation rates occur from june to august average 80 mm and the mean annual precipitation is 793 mm dwd 1981 2010 http www dwd de the tidal wetlands at the elbe estuary were lost almost 1000 years ago to a large extent due to dike construction garniel and mierwald 1996 and river deepening for shipping since the middle of the nineteenth century has led to an increased tidal amplitude from 1 8 m in 1840 to 3 6 m in 1996 kausch 1996 recently the mean tidal amplitude at the upper head of the estuary was 2 m and increased towards its maximum along the tidal freshwater stretch at hamburg harbour kappenberg 2014 2 1 field survey the objective was to study field effects on the willow in tidal freshwater wetlands within a degraded estuary thus the field survey was conducted along the tidal freshwater stretch close to the hamburg harbour were the tidal amplitude reaches its maximum of 3 6 m close to the industrial and harbour sites the study sites chosen contained the largest remaining tidal wetlands with an adequate number of willow individuals of both s alba and s viminalis fig 1 protected site heuckenlock 53 28 28 n 10 2 19 e we chose woody patches in these tidal freshwater wetlands based on aerial photographs and listed them according to a random generator within these plots we selected 25 mature specimens per species s alba and s viminalis as study individuals we measured elevation above sea level for the salix specimen in september 2010 using levelling technology starting from the gauge located near the dike the level of each specimen was measured to 2 mm accuracy pentax automatik nivelliere al m5c furthermore we measured tree height using a tree altimeter blume leiss carl leiss berlin steglitz and measured tree diameter at a measuring height of 130 cm tape rule stewe a difference in trunk position and trunk form indicates increasing stress data were recorded in categories according to gockel 1994 trunk position erect 1 inclined 2 prostrate 3 trunk form straight 1 arching 2 crooked 3 2 2 field experiment subsequent to the field survey a field experiment was conducted at the shore of the elbe estuary in hamburg from june to september 2011 sixty juvenile willow plants of both salix alba and salix viminalis were placed on flooding stairways and exposed to three elevations relative to mean high water plants on stair 1 experienced springtide flooding only tidal flooding level 1 6 25 cm relative to mean high water level mhwl while plants on stair 2 tidal flooding level 2 62 50 cm below mhwl and stair 3 tidal flooding level 3 131 25 cm below mhwl experienced a twice daily tidal flooding regime the plants on stair 1 served as a control since both willow species generally occur above mean high tide level in tidal wetlands ellenberg and leuschner 2010 four sites at the tidal freshwater stretch in hamburg close to the harbour fig 1 and with a tidal range of 3 6 m were selected for exposing the willows to tidal flooding on stairways 1 bunthäuser spitze 53 27 41 67 n 10 3 49

collected as plant material from tidal wetland sites along the elbe estuary the selection criterion for s alba and s viminalis individuals for generating cuttings was the presence of straight shoots the cuttings were equalized to 20 cm length and had equal conditions in a control in a hydroponic greenhouse experiment from february to april 2011 markus michalczyk et al 2014 during may 2011 the vegetative propagules previously used in the control were allowed to regenerate in order to test their general resprouting capacity before starting the experiment shoot and root biomass were removed from the cuttings and the cleared cuttings served as plant samples in the field experiment at each of the four sites along the tidal freshwater stretch one stairway was installed at the slope 1 3 of the shore the metal stairways consisted of grid stairs with 68 75 cm difference in height between each single willow cuttings were planted in pots 14 cm height 18 cm diameter with mixed 1 1 river sand and compost soil the pots were filled to the top with the soil mix the soil mix was covered with gauze to keep the soil in the pots and the gauze was taped to the outside of the pots ten pots with cuttings of one salix species s alba or s viminalis were arranged on each of the three flooding stairs s alba was placed on the tidal flooding stairways at site 1 and site 2 s viminalis was placed on the tidal flooding stairways at site 3 and 4 this resulted in 30 pots per flooding stairway and added up to 60 pots per species and 120 pots in total all pots were fastened with cable ties at the stairways to avoid any losses due to tidal current the field experiment was set up on june 18th and concluded on september 15th shoot number and number of leaves were recorded once a month july 8th august 6th and september 3rd 2011 at the end of the experiment on september 15th the pots were removed from the stairways and final shoot length was measured finally above ground and below ground biomass was harvested from each of the plants all harvested biomass was cleaned and dried separately at 60 c to constant weight before weighing 2 3 data analysis all data analyses were carried out with statistica 9 0 statsoft 2009 all graphs were created with sigma plot 2014 2 3 1 field survey to analyse the recorded data on the elevation of the salix individuals relative to sea level the elevation of each willow individual relative to mean high water was calculated taking into account the mhwl at the site according to bundesamt für seeschifffahrt und hydrographie 2010 one factorial anovas were applied to analyse whether s alba and s viminalis occurred at different elevations and whether the height of tidal inundation impacted species occurrence salix specimens mean and standard

larger height and diameter values were found for s alba no significant differences in trunk position were found the median of trunk position was inclined for both salix species however seven white willow trunks were recorded as erect and 11 as prostrate three s viminalis trunks were erect and for 14 individuals the trunk was categorized as prostrate trunk form was significantly more crooked in s viminalis compared to s alba p 0 01 z 3 1 whereas the median for s alba was arching and crooked for s viminalis fourteen white willow trunks were recorded as straight and eight as crooked two s viminalis trunks were straight and for four individuals the trunk was categorized as arching table 1 3 2 field experiment 3 2 1 growth of willow cuttings repeated measurement anovas on the effects of the elevation relative to mean water and species showed that salix viminalis developed significantly more shoots f 76 26 p 0 001 and more leaves compared to salix alba f 148 47 p 0 001 whereas neither the number of shoots nor the number of leaves was significantly affected by flooding level moreover the development of leaves over time was different between species salix alba leaf number generally remained similar whereas salix viminalis developed significantly more leaves between june and august p 0 001 although leaf number remained similar between august and september fig 3 table 2 elongation of total shoot length at the end of the experiment was significantly smaller with increasing flooding level f 5 13 p 0 01 tukey s test showed that this was true for level 1 compared to 3 but not for level 1 compared to 2 or level 2 compared to 3 in addition shoot length was significantly different between species s viminalis developed longer shoots compared to s alba f 53 01 p 0 001 fig 4 3 2 2 dry mass of willow cuttings overall the flooding level significantly affected dry mass fig 5 table 3 shoot mass f 5 43 p 0 01 and total dry mass f 5 48 p 0 01 was smaller with increasing flooding level f 5 48 p 0 01 however this was not true for roots moreover tukey s test showed that the difference in shoot and total dry mass due to flooding level was significant between level 1 and 3 only species differed significantly in dry mass s viminalis produced more shoot f 45 96 p 0 001 root f 32 93 p 0 001 and total dry mass f 50 56 p 0 001 than s alba the interaction between flooding and species was significant in shoot mass f 4 38 p 0 05 and in total dry mass f 4 23 p 0 05 dry mass in s alba was similarly low at all flooding levels while the gain in s viminalis dry mass decreased with increasing flooding level fig 5 table 3 4 discussion 4 1 occurrence of mature willows at elevational gradients in tidal freshwater wetlands the results of the field survey showed firstly that mature willow individuals occur below mhwl level in tidal freshwater wetlands we thus provide the first record of the ability of two characteristic floodplain willow species s alba and s viminalis to grow at elevations below mhwl level up to approx 60 cm macrophytes in the elbe estuary e g phragmites australis may be largely stimulated due to regional evolutionary history and human alterations affecting abiotic conditions and species composition in estuaries engels and jensen 2009 the increase in tidal amplitude 2 m in the year 1900 to 3 6 m in 2000 in hamburg kappenberg 2014 due to the deepening of the elbe shipping channel from 3 m to more than 14 m in the metropolitan area of hamburg kerner 2007 may have induced an increased tidal inundation and may have also induced an increasing tidal flooding on our studied willow species during their life time in the tidal freshwater wetlands additionally the predominant number of inclined and prostrate trunks as well as the shorter height mean 15 m of s alba trees in our study may be due to this increased tidal amplitude since s alba usually grows as a large upright tree attaining heights of 20 m or more dickmann and kuzovkina 2014 in particular the high number of prostrate trees may be caused by reduced stability and decreased below ground biomass this root cease is common in many wetland plants mitsch and gosselink 2000 since flooding fills soil pores with water and lowers oxygen supply for roots blom and voesenek 1996 this is also supported by a separate study that measured an increased shoot root ratio of s alba in a tidal flooding experiment under controlled conditions markus michalczyk et al 2016a however the low water level decreased by 50 cm from 1970 to 2004 due to fairway deepening and large scale embankments that shifted the maximum tidal amplitude in the elbe estuary further upstream to hamburg kappenberg 2014 thus the willows in the tidal freshwater wetlands experience not only increased tidal flooding due to the increased tidal amplitude but willow habitats below mean high water are less flooded than before meaning that the root system may get aerated during ebb tide according to the review on adaptations to flooding blom 1999 the establishment of willows along tidal freshwater riverine stretches is generally at first prevented by flooding and later on by the competition of phragmites thus the decreased low water may have enhanced the continuing growth of the willows at sites below mean water in the elbe estuary these findings specify previous assertions of willows ability to settle at tidal wetlands up to the river mouth at the north sea ellenberg and leuschner 2010 they built upon the description by struyf et al 2009 of woody communities comprising both salix study species at the final stage of succession in european tidal freshwater wetlands at higher elevations increasing tidal flooding may have facilitated the dendriform mature s alba compared to the shrubby s viminalis salix viminalis may be outcompeted by s alba and others e g phragmites australis a natural reed species component in tidal wetlands that is stimulated by increasing tidal flooding engels and jensen 2009 4 2 regeneration and growth of two willow species under estuarine field conditions salix alba and s viminalis cuttings responded differently to increasing tidal flooding in the field experiment at all flooding levels up to 60 cm inundation depth s viminalis resprouted faster and developed more leaves more and longer shoots and more shoot and root dry mass compared to s alba this may confirm a better adaptation to flooding of the shrubby form compared to the dendriform in the genus salix mosner et al 2011 our results further show coppicing s viminalis and extracting plant material to limit river eutrophication may be possible at locations where the fast growing willows accumulate high phosphorus loads in the water column as suggested by skłodowski et al 2014 furthermore this corresponds with the larger dry mass documented in juvenile s viminalis compared to s alba in a former tidal flooding experiment under controlled conditions markus michalczyk et al 2016a by contrast in that former study leaf number and shoot length increased significantly more in salix alba over time resprouting rates after shoot removal were greater than 90 in both species and thus both s alba and s viminalis were presumed to tolerate tidal flooding up to 60 cm markus michalczyk et al 2016a contrary to the experiment by mosner et al 2011 we used cuttings from which shoots and roots were removed twice before starting the presented experiment and s alba shoot and root dry mass were similarly low at all tidal flooding levels so that no effect of tidal flooding was found the repeated disturbance may have better suited the life characteristics of s viminalis life characteristics since floodplain shrubs are able to grow under severe abiotic disturbance at the floodplain edge at low elevations amlin and rood 2002 francis and gurnell 2006 due to high resprouting capacity from flood damaged stumps bendix and hupp 2000 keoleian and volk 2005 mention willows rapid growth after coppices as a characteristic trait of plants that are adapted to disturbed environments but highlight shrub willows as ideal for short rotation coppices src according to mitchell et al 1999 src willows resprout vigorously after harvest so that seven to ten harvests are possible from a single planting thus the better performance of juvenile s viminalis compared to juvenile s alba in our tidal flooding experiment may be due to differences in resprouting capacity rather than in tolerance to tidal flooding 4 3 differences in juvenile compared to mature willows in increasing tidal flooding the existence of adaptations by floodplain vegetation to inundation has been known for decades e g blom 1999 willows colonize exposed riverbanks in the northern temperate zone seeds germinate if surfaces stay moist and seedlings establish when undisturbed for a sufficient period the bending stability of large plants enables them to withstand moderate floods and if branches break off they resprout successfully karrenberg et al 2002 however this breaking off of branches is species specific s fragilis is characterized by preformed breaking points at twig bases due to differences in lignin content this is not the case in s alba beismann et al 2000 and therefor juvenile s alba may have failed to resprout successfully in our tidal flooding experiment our findings on mature willows at low lying sites correspond to mosner et al 2011 suggesting that in addition to flooding hydraulic forces restrict the niches for woody vegetation at low lying sites further factors in the estuarine environment may be taken in account in further studies floodplain vegetation feedback on sediment dynamics regulates succession and established woody vegetation may reduce river flow during floods leading to increasing sedimentation corenblit et al 2009 moreover floodplain willows enhance river self purification by accumulating phosphorus and managed coppicing and removal of the biomass may limit downstream eutrophication kiedrzyńska et al 2008 skłodowski et al 2014 dryer conditions may limit vegetative propagule establishment due to juvenile plants small root system johnson 2000 and hydrodynamic forcing in addition to tidal inundation predicts the window of opportunity for early establishment of biota hu et al 2015 in our study in a degraded estuary the occurrence of s viminalis was limited to 2 1 m whereas s alba were found up to 2 7 m above mhwl this corresponds to mosner et al 2011 who documented that willows at high elevation river floodplain sites may suffer from drought stress whereas at locations where water levels strongly fluctuate both mature and juvenile willow individuals may settle at a wider range of different elevations similarly markus michalczyk et al 2016b showed that s alba seedlings germinate anchor and establish under a tidal flooding regime in estuarine conditions where water level fluctuates due to tides and provides recurring soil moisture both willow species occupy a similar niche regarding the site elevation below mhwl s viminalis may have an advantage in the early establishment phase of it vegetative propagules due to better resprouting capacity after disturbance and faster growth rate in contrast s alba mature trees may have the advantage in both habitats where the tidal inundation increases below mhwl during the tree s life time and at dryer sites above mhwl influenced by spring tides because s alba produces deep rooting trees evolved during dynamic erosion sedimentation disturbance processes in tidal wetlands 5 conclusion the presented field survey on the morphology and occurrence of mature floodplain willows is the first study that shows the settlement of tidal freshwater wetlands with s viminalis and s alba up to a level of 57 cm below mean high water level our corresponding field experiment on juvenile plants confirms the growth capacity of s viminalis and s alba up to a level of 60 cm below the mean high water in tidal freshwater wetlands at the elbe estuary this finding is relevant to predicted rising sea level scenarios and integrated management plans to restore tidal willow softwood forests tidal floodplain forests are protected via the european habitats directive 1992 and willows are highly recognized ecosystem service species fao 2014 we conclude that our findings enhance the

1131,in situ land surface flux monitoring studies can be useful to extrapolate canopy scales processes to weather and climate analysis this paper evaluated the interaction between ecosystems and environmental forces in partitioning available energy from multi sensor platform in the semi arid region of the snake river basin in idaho usa field measurements of latent and sensible heat fluxes using scintillometers and the eddy covariance flux data during the growing season in 2011 2012 were able to identify spatial and seasonal variability in partitioning of surface energy components including net radiation latent sensible ground heat fluxes available energy measured from sagebrush cheatgrass and lodgepole pine ecosystems indicate that 79 58 and 62 partitioned into latent heat fluxes of 24 20 and 35 respectively role of precipitation and soil moisture which in turn influenced the latent and sensible heat flux more profoundly were evident in sagebrush and cheatgrass as compared to lodgepole pine with a higher vapor pressure deficit and decreased relative humidity especially in the summertime between june and september the budyko analysis revealed that aridity index ratio was found to vary between 3 and 5 suggesting a degree of aridity in these ecosystems evapotranspiration et was severely constrained by lack of soil moisture for cheatgrass and sagebrush when compared to the lodgepole pine ecosystem in addition it has been concluded that the sagebrush ecosystem regions can serve as recharge zones for enhancing groundwater storage in the snake river plains as they exhibit lower evapotranspiration rates in comparison to other ecosystems this study emphasizes that use of field data can provide a better understanding of boundary layer fluxes which in turn can help validate the fluxes simulated by land surface models implications of these results include the need for sustained monitoring and land atmosphere interaction studies that are beneficial for effective water resource assessment and management keywords eddy covariance latent heat flux scintillometer sensible heat flux surface energy partitioning 1 introduction the snake river basin is a vast semi arid system supporting irrigated agriculture and natural ecosystems hoekema and sridhar 2013 large scale agricultural activities with both surface water and groundwater sources are changing the local and regional climates sridhar 2013 the present distributions of vegetation in the remaining parts of the basin such as sagebrush cheatgrass and logdepole forest systems serve as recharge zones for the vast aquifer lying underneath this terrain since both irrigated agriculture and natural ecosystems function in specific ways while partitioning surface energy and water fluxes the representation of these land surface characteristics in land surface models has drawn the attention of research more than ever before the water balance of this large hydrographic system is linked with the land cover and land use changes which in turn may change the flow regimes of the snake river sridhar et al 2013 jaksa and sridhar 2015 since the energy budget and water budget are tightly linked investigating the partitioning of energy fluxes into latent and sensible heat fluxes is key to understanding the regional water resources and boundary layer meteorological properties land surface processes are linked to the regional climate and their anomalies are related to land climate coupling the partitioning of available energy between sensible and latent heat fluxes impacts boundary layer dynamics and hydrological processes at various spatio temporal scales dirmeyer 1994 seth and giorgi 1996 however many studies have found that energy partitioning as a function of the vegetation response is difficult because it requires the quantification of biogeochemical and biogeophysical interactions bounoua et al 2002 wilson et al 2002 kueppers et al 2007 irrigated surfaces and clear and cloudy skies have control over environmental forces and in turn on vegetation s response to local climatic requirements field and mooney 1986 woodward 1987 neilson 1995 baldocchi and meyers 1998 fitzjarrald et al 2001 numerous studies have investigated the responses of different land surfaces to exchanges of energy and momentum between the land and atmosphere jacobs and de bruin 1992 betts and ball 1995 pielke et al 1998 raupach 1998 wilson et al 1999 thompson et al 2004 chen et al 2009 sridhar and wedin 2009 liu et al 2016 land surface heterogeneity arising from soil vegetation topography etc contributes to soil moisture redistribution and hence the partitioning of incoming solar energy into latent and sensible heat fluxes feddema et al 2005 jin and sridhar 2012 gallego elvira et al 2016 in addition environmental variables such as the net radiation and vapor pressure deficit can enhance or dampen the relative magnitude of the latent and sensible heat fluxes gu et al 2006 to assess the regional climate and hydrologic systems observational data from multi sensor platforms and modeling techniques are used to understand the dynamic nature of latent and sensible heat fluxes over canopy to field scales entekhabi et al 1996 eltahir 1998 gu et al 1999 feddema et al 2005 our hypothesis is that the latent heat flux exchange is larger in lodgepole pine forest than in the sagebrush and cheatgrass ecosystem due to the higher utilization of available energy and soil moisture supported by multi sensor data sets this paper evaluated soil moisture and energy fluxes in lodgepole pine sagebrush and cheatgrass communities in the snake river basin srb during 2011 2012 hoekema and sridhar 2013 field observations using the eddy covariance method and a scintillometer were used to quantify the impact of precipitation soil moisture net radiation and vapor pressure in modulating the sensible and latent heat fluxes understanding the surface energy fluxes from multiple measurements across three ecosystems not only provides the opportunity to relate multi sensors but also serves as a reliable observational data source for validation collecting field data is labor intensive and expensive however these data need to be collected to categorically understand the local scale surface energy components and plant responses to refine and improve hydrological model algorithms the objectives of this study are to 1 perform an intercomparison analysis of fluxes measured by the eddy covariance and scintillometer systems 2 evaluate the separation of energy fluxes over sagebrush cheatgrass and lodgepole pine ecosystems and 3 understand the influence of land atmospheric factors in partitioning sensible and latent heat fluxes over the ecosystems this assessment is required to understand the role of surface energy fluxes in modulating the boundary layer dynamics streamflow and aquifer recharge 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field observations of energy budget components soil moisture and standard weather variables from a collaborative network comprising three study sites hollister sagebrush raft river cheatgrass and island park lodgepole pine in idaho u s formed a central part of this study fig 1 hollister located in the southwest region of the eastern snake plain aquifer espa is densely covered with sagebrush that is 50 100 cm tall sagebrush is the most important shrub in the western semiarid region which is well adapted to soils like deep fertile loamy and sandy loamy soils at least 0 9 m deep and the annual precipitation ranges from 200 mm to more than 750 mm accessed from usda nrcs plant database https plants usda gov java the raft river situated east of hollister is dominated by cheatgrass that is 75 cm tall interspersed with crested wheat grass and invasive wild mustard cheatgrass has smooth softly hairy leaves with a dense fibrous root system concentrated mainly in the upper 30 cm of the soil layer island park located within the targhee national forest is predominantly covered with lodgepole pine trees that are 15 m tall and contains a mix of grass and shrubs as the understory vegetation lodgepole pine trees are characterized by needle leaves of 2 5 7 5 cm long and a deep tap root system which helps the plant extract moisture from deep soil layers and provide stability in loose sandy soils 2 2 instrumentation in order to understand the surface energy partitioning at sagebrush cheatgrass and lodgepole pine ecosystems in the snake river basin the study used eddy covariance ec and large aperture scintillometer las surface flux data measurements from zhao and allen 2014 each ec site contained a suite of sensors including radiometers an anemometer precipitation gauges soil moisture sensors a scintillometer and two eddy covariance systems the layout for the instrumentation set up at each site was based on the homogeneity of the surface vegetation and a reasonable fetch in the upwind direction baldocchi 1997 to corroborate the measurements a second eddy covariance system was deployed at a distance of 1 2 km which aided to minimize eliminate or flag any error introduced in the first flux tower data in addition the large aperture scintillometer las was co located with a transmitter adjacent to the first eddy covariance system and a receiver near the second eddy covariance system to measure the sensible heat flux across the transect over the three ecosystems table 1 the ec sites are equipped with 3 d sonic anemometers rmyoung 81000 and csi csat3 4 component net radiometers primarily hukseflux nr01 and kipp and zonen cnr1 pyranometers rebs hft 3 1 soil heat flux plates hukseflux hfp01sc self calibrating soil heat flux plates campbell scientific cs616 volumetric soil water content sensors vaisalla air temperature and relative humidity and air temperature sensors and tipping bucket precipitation gauges with antifreeze filled catches to melt snow for the ground heat flux gh data two different soil heat flux shf plate depths 4 and 8 cm were used heat storage change between the plates and surface computed using four thermocouples above each plate the shf data were averaged at each location to provide a good spatial average value all measurements were sampled at 1 second intervalues and were reported over 30 minute periods zhao and allen 2014 the most commonly used scintillometer for sensible heat measurement is the large aperture scintillometer las meijninger et al 2006 scintillometers can be best suited for the accurate error estimation of remote sensed or satellite measured and simulated sensible heat fluxes kleissl et al 2009 samain et al 2011 lee et al 2015 due to their path lengths that are generally larger than footprints of ec systems the main components of las include a transmitter and a receiver to measure the fluctuations of the beam that are caused by the density and turbulence induced atmospheric scintillation this study used the scintec bls900 las system the bls900 transmitter consists of two disks populated with infrared and visible light emitting diodes and the receiver can perform corrections for absorption fluctuations and outer scale effects the fluctuations in the intensity i of electromagnetic radiation measured by a scintillometer relates to the variations in the refractive index of air along the las transect the variations in the intensity of the beam are directly related to the structure function constant of the refractive index fluctuation in the wavelengths of the scintillometer and then to the transect area averaged sensible heat flux chehbouni et al 1999 at sagebrush site the las transect is 1 86 km in length running north transmitter to south receiver at cheatgrass site the las transect is 840 m in length spanning from east northeast to west southwest direction at sagebrush and cheatgrass site las is installed at height of 2 m lodgepole site is characterized by a 1 73 km las path that runs north to south installed at 24 m height above the lodgepole pine canopy at hollister and raft river las is installed at a height of 2 m and at island park it is 22 23 m 2 3 flux data collection a nr01 4 way radiometer q7 net radiometer csat3 3d sonic along with bls 900 scintec transmitter rmyoung 3d sonic and licor 7500 hygrometer were mounted on a tower over the canopy data from bls 900 and csat3 3d instruments were used for our analysis however rmyoung 3d sonic data were not included in the study since they were similar to csat3 3d data the mounting heights of csat3 3d anemometers that measure three dimensional wind turbulence with minimal flow distortion differed for locations due to vegetation growth and they were 5 6 m 2 3 m and 22 24 m at hollister raft river and island park respectively to measure water vapor a licor 7500 hygrometer was placed on the same level but 10 cm apart from anemometers on the tower this arrangement of csat3 3d and the licor 7500 hygrometer not only maximized the co location but also minimized wind distortion kurc and small 2007 in addition a licor 7500 hygrometer instrument was tilted approximately 45 degrees to avoid any water accumulation on the sensor eddy covariance data were processed using campbell scientific crbasic code in addition to other programs and they were used to compute the sensible latent and radiation heat fluxes after performing self calibration exercises with the instruments the self calibration exercise included time lag adjustments among instruments data spike removal flagging for the air flow direction from the backside of the csat3 3d anemometer the influence of slope stream flow coordinate rotation and wpl corrections see zhao and allen 2014 for detailed description of data quality flags and corrections applied to reduce the power consumption the eddy covariance data were collected at 20 hz in the first year followed by a decrease to 10 hz in the following years the ground heat flux at the surface was calculated by summing the plate reading with the change in heat storage above the plate change in heat storage was computed using at least four thermocouples and the thermocouple readings were extrapolated to the surface using a 3rd degree polynomial equation net radiation measurements were recorded every 10 s using a huskeflux nr01 4 way radiometer and q7 net radiometer and averaged over every 30 min a nr01 4 way radiometer measured incoming and surface reflected shortwave and longwave above the canopy using two types of sensors built in the radiometer the pyranometer and pyrgeometer were used to measure shortwave or solar radiation and longwave radiation respectively the q7 net radiometer with its thermopile sensor was also used to measure the change in incoming and surface reflected radiation the rebs soil heat flux plate hft 3 1 hukseflux soil heat flux plate hfp01sc and rshf were used to measure the ground heat flux and soil temperature at 10 s intervals which were averaged over 5 and 10 min the plates were placed in two locations under the plant canopy or vegetation or under a bare patch between 4 and 12 cm below the soil surface thermocouples were also used to measure the ground temperature at a depth between 1 and 40 cm volumetric soil moisture data were collected every 10 min and averaged over every 30 min measurements of soil moisture were obtained from a number of locations and depths using from 10 to 28 of echo5 and from 6 to 29 of campbell scientific cs616 tdt for each ecosystem echo5 and cs616 were installed between 5 and 42 cm below the surface and between 0 and 30 cm respectively this installation was done to collect duplicate records of reliable soil moisture in both the horizontal and vertical directions and to evaluate them more closely if there is significant spatial heterogeneity in addition two tipping bucket precipitation gauges were installed to measure the precipitation and these gauges were capable of melting snow using antifreeze filled reservoirs 2 4 data processing despite strictly following various protocols in setting up instruments errors can occur in measurements due to random fluctuations in the flux magnitude topographical complexity and surface heterogeneity hollinger and richardson 2005 vickers et al 2010 the errors in the measured fluxes from both the eddy covariance and scintillometer systems were marked with quality flags when deviations in the magnitude of the same flux measured with a different instrument bad wind directions values out of the normal range rain events missing data and low battery voltage were encountered for hollister and raft river we excluded all the data that were flagged because of the above mentioned reasons however the influence of the wind was dominant most of the time in island park due to its location in a higher elevation therefore wind was not a factor for flagging the data subjecting the data to these quality control criteria the analysis included only 78 94 and 72 data for hollister raft river and island park respectively at hollister the flagged data included 11 missing data 6 rain events and 3 wind direction rain events flagged 5 data at raft river and missing data flagged 17 data at island park 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 budyko curve estimation to understand the annual patterns and relationships between water supply and energy availability this study employed the approach proposed by budyko 1974 this method introduces a scheme to assess the long term average water and energy balances by considering actual evapotranspiration et precipitation p and energy availability or potential evapotranspiration etp effective precipitation is defined as the difference between precipitation and change in soil moisture δs the budyko equation helps to estimate evapotranspiration as a function of the ratio of etp to precipitation p as shown below 1 e t p α t a n h 1 α 1 e α where α etp p 1 and e t and p are the annual values of actual evapotranspiration and precipitation respectively etp was calculated based on the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 2 5 2 footprint analysis the footprint analysis is performed to quantify the role of vegetation and environmental conditions on the measured sensible heat flux the footprint is defined as the area that contributes the vertical flux or concentration to the eddy covariance sensors both the flux and concentration footprints vary in their spatial extent and to quantify the footprint the cumulative normalized contribution to flux cnf was computed from schuepp et al 1990 and gash 1986 which is represented in the following equation 2 c n f 0 x l u z d u k x 2 e x p u z d u k x d x where x l is the distance from the station m u is the integrated wind speed m s 1 z is the measurement height m d is the zero plane displacement height m u is the friction velocity m s 1 k is von karman s coefficient 0 4 and exp is the base for the natural logarithm system 2 71 2 5 3 wind function and relative humidity in order to establish the relationship between turbulent flux drying power of air and relative humidity we demonstrated the differences among the ecosystems using the complementarity principles for dry soils the unspent excess energy from the available energy during the et partitioning increases the surface air temperature and decreases vapor pressure deficit this also increases the potential evapotranspiration etp by establishing a complementary relationship between et and etp jaksa et al 2013 sridhar et al 2013 etp mm day 1 based on penman 1948 is expressed as e t p δ q n γ e a δ γ 3 where δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve at an air temperature ta q n is the available energy rn gh at the surface expressed in terms of the water depth mm day 1 γ is the psychometric constant and e a is the drying power of the air mm day 1 the quantity e a can be expressed considering penman s original rome wind function for a wet vegetated surface or free water surface as 4 e a 0 26 1 0 54 u e s e a where u is the measured wind speed at a 2 m height m s and e a and e s are respectively the actual and saturation vapor pressures measured by the ec system 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil moisture distribution seasonal variations in soil moisture i e the volumetric water content of the soil it is the ratio of water volume to soil volume multiplied by 100 for the soil column of 42 cm from the three sites are shown graphically in fig 2 which covered period between jan 1 2011 and dec 31 2012 the top soil column of 30 cm for sagebrush and cheatgrass showed similar variations with peaks in march april followed by decreased soil moisture in july august the soil moisture in lodgepole pine showed a delayed peak in may june until the snowpack is on the ground the intersensor variability in soil moisture s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 and s6 was quite high up to 10 in sagebrush and cheatgrass demonstrating spatial heterogeneity across ecosystems and seasons the box and whisker plots of the average and median monthly soil moisture was high during spring march may and winter dec feb 10 20 due to being highly variable in arid environments with an average precipitation of 65 mm in the spring and 21 mm in the summer june aug the soil moisture dropped from 30 to 15 with precipitation being the principle reason for the seasonal difference in soil moisture in the sagebrush ecosystem clearly a limited amount of soil moisture that was available during the driest period from these ecosystems was left for soil evaporation and plant transpiration on average the soil moisture in the cheatgrass ecosystem was less than 5 due to an average precipitation of less than 24 mm in the summer cheatgrass normally greened up earlier in the season hence their stomatal activities did not favor transpiration in the peak of the growing season in the summer however as shown in table 4 which will be discussed in the later sections average spring precipitation of 72 mm precipitation augmented soil moisture up to 30 during the spring season the variability ranged between 5 and 10 due to intermittent spring rain events the highest amount of precipitation of 145 mm over the lodgepole pine system in the spring increased the soil moisture in the top 42 cm up to 25 a 5 decrease in the summer related to evapotranspiration because the root zone extraction of soil moisture by the dense canopy effectively transpired moisture into the boundary layer 3 2 analysis of energy budget closure energy budget closure is critical to understanding the partitioning of the energy balance components and quantifying the residual flux comparisons of 30 min turbulent a sum of sensible and latent heat fluxes and available energy a sum of net radiation and ground heat flux from 1 jan 2011 to 31 dec 2012 are shown in fig 3 revealing an overall underestimation of the sensible and latent heat fluxes over the three ecosystems the biases toward the available energy occurred during the day and differed minimally when verified with the regression analysis based on a spreadsheet program table 2 the slope of the line representing the turbulence and available energy relationship showed an average value of 0 78 which ranged between 0 70 and 0 90 the correlation coefficient was between 0 85 and 0 92 in general both the growing and non growing periods showed some differences over sagebrush but they were not significant in contrast differences over cheatgrass and lodgepole pine were noticeable nevertheless the underestimation of turbulent energy generated residual fluxes up to 0 18 mj m 2 200 w m 2 during noon over each ecosystem the residual energy analysis was restricted to the daytime since it pertained to the partitioning of energy during the most active period of day 3 3 impacts of land cover on seasonal energy balance components seasonal patterns of energy balance components net radiation and latent sensible and ground heat fluxes for the three ecosystems were plotted as shown in fig 4 significant seasonal variations were seen in the average diurnal fluxes during the period of april to september which can be mainly attributed to radiative forcing and growing season plant activities net radiation showed a gradual increase from march to a maximum between may and july followed by a decrease in the autumn season net radiation values were between 300 and 500 w m 2 and approximately 90 70 and 75 of it was partitioned into sensible and latent heat fluxes over sagebrush cheatgrass and lodgepole pine respectively table 3 the differences in partitioning between 10 and 30 could be partly attributed to closure of the energy budget and measurement error frank et al 2016 mauder and zeeman 2017 diurnal distributions of sensible and latent heat fluxes followed a similar seasonal pattern as that of net radiation the magnitudes varied over the ecosystems fig 4 and table 4 the sensible heat flux over sagebrush was the highest with values from 200 to 300 w m 2 may september followed by the fluxes over cheatgrass june august and lodgepole pine june july annually 90 of available energy rn gh was partitioned into the sensible and latent heat flux le h over sagebrush and 70 for cheatgrass and 75 for lodgepole pine ecosystem the annual values of sensible heat flux h over available energy rn gh for sagebrush cheatgrass and lodgepole pine was approximately 66 50 and 41 furthermore the wet periods in late fall and spring showed a high conversion an average of 27 w m 2 of net radiation into latent heat flux than the non rainy periods in the summer an average of 20 w m 2 and this may be attributed to soil moisture control over the surface fluxes table 4 the latent heat flux gradually increased for both sagebrush and cheatgrass when the vegetation started greening up in the spring months however the lodgepole pine ecosystem converted 34 of net radiation into latent heat flux the abundance of soil moisture along with relatively thick canopy may have resulted in an increased latent heat flux 37 in the spring and summer months which later decreased to 18 in the remainder of the year in general ground heat flux ranged between 100 to 100 w m 2 with some exceptions in the winter and peak summer seasons 3 4 evaluation of the eddy covariance measured sensible heat fluxes with scintillometer daily estimates of the sensible heat flux from the eddy covariance systems were compared to the scintillometer measurements to evaluate their performances for the period of study fig 4 this analysis was to illustrate the energy balance components on a monthly time step across three ecosystems however seasonal monthly assessment provided some insights into fluxes averaged over 6 hrly periods furthermore they exhibited two distinguishing features as to how net radiation was partitioned into latent and sensible heat fluxes diurnally and over the entire year and how they differed between months across these ecosystems the scintillometer based sensible heat flux was measured at the same height as that of the eddy covariance system to minimize discrepancies in measurements scintillometer based sensible heat flux measurements were slightly higher compared to that of eddy covariance data for all ecosystems and the differences were estimated as 8 7 and 5 over the sagebrush cheatgrass and lodgepole pine ecosystems respectively a slightly reduced magnitude from the eddy covariance data may be related to factors including the footprint vegetation heterogeneity and vertical wind velocity figs 5 and 6 however as in table 4 the highest deviation in sensible heat fluxes over sagebrush appeared to be approximately 8 for the cheatgrass site invasive wild mustard mixed with cheatgrass decreased the vertical wind velocity which may have contributed to the deviation of up to 7 in the sensible heat flux flux measurements in the lodgepole pine ecosystem indicated that topography surface roughness and canopy cover may have altered the wind speed resulting in a difference of approximately 5 between the fluxes measured by the two systems 3 5 comparison of sensible heat flux over ecosystems fig 5a illustrates the daily variation in sensible heat fluxes over sagebrush cheatgrass and lodgepole pine for the period from jan 1 2011 to dec 31 2012 from the data it is clear that the sensible heat flux was the highest over the sagebrush ecosystem followed by cheatgrass and lodgepole pine on a seasonal scale between june and august sensible heat flux was as high as 12 mj day 1 m 2 this may have been due to several factors including higher net radiation decreased precipitation an average of 21 mm and dry soils an average of 14 which influenced the warming of the near surface layer table 4 fig 5b shows a site wise comparison of the seven day moving average of penman s wind function ea and relative humidity rh variability between the ecosystems in ea and rh was observed with sagebrush and cheatgrass showing higher ea and a larger decrease in rh while lodgepole pine recording a slightly diminished ea and rh relatively this suggests that higher lh over the lodgepole system is supported by higher rh and lower ea relative to the other two ecosystems additional analysis to distinguish the interannual variability based on the scatter plots of e a and rh revealed that 2011 was no different from 2010 and 2012 with regard to ea and rh the average sensible flux over sagebrush was 8 1 mj day 1 m 2 between april and september whereas for the non growing period this magnitude was 2 4 mj day 1 m 2 sagebrush which is typically 50 100 cm tall captured 80 of the sensible heat flux within a distance of 200 m in contrast for cheatgrass that is approximately 75 cm tall the contribution was less than 75 for a similar distance of approximately 200 m the sensible heat flux was insignificant for a similar upwind distance in the lodgepole pine system since the tree canopy was almost 15 m tall and their footprint size reached 80 when the upward distance increased to 1500 2000 m fig 6 in addition to height understory vegetation including grass shrubs and planted pine trees with regular spacing also impacted the wind conditions these findings agreed with baldocchi 1997 who concluded that reductions in the sensible heat flux contribution occur for a certain upwind distance 3 6 comparison of evapotranspiration flux over ecosystems the diurnal characteristics of evapotranspiration over three ecosystems showed seasonal variations during the growing and non growing periods and the estimates across the ecosystems differed fig 7 increased evapotranspiration from march to july was evident and the daily magnitudes of measured evapotranspiration over sagebrush was 2 0 mm day 1 in the active growing season in 2011 which significantly p value 0 001 on non parametric mann whitney test decreased to 1 2 mm day 1 during the remainder of the year the lack of soil moisture increased temperature and nearly dormant vegetation after flowering in the late summer and early fall periods may result in decreased evapotranspiration and these conclusions agreed with earlier studies raven 1996 evapotranspiration for cheatgrass and lodgepole pine ecosystems during the growing season was 2 3 mm day 1 a range of 1 0 3 7 and 5 5 mm day 1 a range of 2 7 9 3 respectively relatively high precipitation and low vapor pressure deficits over lodgepole pine resulted in the highest evapotranspiration up to 9 3 mm day 1 in the growing period on a seasonal basis it was almost five times greater than the non growing period while sagebrush and cheatgrass exhibited only approximately a two fold difference between the two seasons the budyko analysis of annual evapotranspiration over three ecosystems is presented in fig 8 computed based on the values shown in table 4 the results highlighted the water limited conditions a condition that arose due to limited available soil moisture for evapotranspiration during 2011 2012 in all three ecosystems this was particularly consistent with a meager annual precipitation over sagebrush and cheatgrass ecosystems during this two year period the lowest evapotranspiration measurements suggested the critical role of stomatal resistance in maintaining the ecosystem functions under dry climate regimes despite diminished precipitation the drought tolerant vegetation that was relatively hardy with higher stomatal resistance aided in conserving the soil moisture that was available in the root zone the ratio between potential evapotranspiration and effective precipitation p δs varied from 3 to 5 and indicated the degree of aridity at these ecosystems et was severely constrained by lack of soil moisture for cheatgrass and sagebrush but soil moisture deficit was lower for the lodgepole pine ecosystem a high aridity index of 4 5 was due to high available energy and low precipitation in the sagebrush system 80 of precipitation was converted to evapotranspiration and over cheatgrass more than 90 of precipitation contributed to evapotranspiration in contrast the lodgepole pine ecosystem which experienced higher soil moisture conditions due to higher precipitation approximately 60 80 of precipitation was available for evapotranspiration a reduction of 20 evapotranspiration between the two years was due to a decrease in precipitation up to 100 mm and the role of soil moisture control on evapotranspiration could be related to decreased soil moisture storage in the soil column jaksa and sridhar 2015 jaksa et al 2013 williams et al 2012 investigated the climate and vegetation control on surface water balances using budyko framework their study reported that grassland showed higher evaporative ratio compared to forest ecosystems overall both sagebrush shrubland and cheatgrass grassland produced similar et obrist et al 2003 kurc and small 2004 also dugas et al 1996 reported that in arid environments the differences in surface energy balance mainly related to leaf area index and water supply rather than vegetation type malek et al 1997 malek and bingham 1997 and prater and delucia 2006 found similar magnitude and seasonal patterns of turbulent heat fluxes of american west sagebrush as in the current study 4 conclusions accurate understanding of relative roles and interactions these characteristics of ecosystem vegetation type and climate in energy and hydrological response has great importance in predicting and managing future water resources and their associated ecological services under climate and land cover changes this study evaluated the strong correlation between three different ecosystems characteristics on energy portioning specifically the influence of rainfall soil vegetation and topography on mean annual interannual and seasonal water and energy balance were investigated using field measurements from three sites in southern idaho using field measurements of precipitation soil moisture and surface fluxes the analysis of fluxes across over sagebrush cheatgrass and lodgepole pine demonstrated the differential role of environmental factors in partitioning the surface energy balance components differences in available energy rn gh measured from sagebrush cheatgrass and lodgepole pine ecosystems indicated that 79 58 and 62 partitioned into latent heat fluxes of 24 20 and 35 respectively it was evident that both environmental and vegetation conditions were influencing the partitioning of fluxes evapotranspiration et for cheatgrass and lodgepole pine ecosystems during the growing season was 2 3 and 5 5 mm day 1 respectively and on a seasonal basis it was almost five times greater than the non growing period et for sagebrush was sagebrush was 2 0 mm day 1 and sagebrush and cheatgrass exhibited only approximately a two fold difference between the two seasons soil moisture variability in these natural ecosystems were driven by both snow in the winter and early spring and fall precipitation events depending on the temperature a function of elevation the lodge pole ecosystem exhibited a different energy budget partitioning unlike the sagebrush or the cheat grass ecosystems the latent heat flux was the highest over lodgepole pine which was distinctly controlled by high precipitation and increased the soil moisture storage however from the footprint analysis we concluded that the sensible heat flux was dominant over sagebrush and cheatgrass ecosystem in contrast the analysis revealed that the complex topography and spatial heterogeneity within the tall canopy reduced the footprint size for the sensible heat flux over lodgepole pine the budyko analysis showed that variability in precipitation controlled the evaporative fraction across all the three ecosystems the estimated aridity indices were found to vary between 3 and 5 indicating high evaporative demand and diminished moisture supply as the major reasons for the variations between them knowledge about factors causing variability in surface fluxes over dominant ecosystems is useful for improving land surface model processes and prediction capabilities at multiple space and time scales since evapotranspiration plays a significant role in water resource assessment this study offers impetus to characterize the basin scale water balance and aquifer recharge potential in response to boundary layer processes and ecosystem functioning the broader implications of this study suggest that sagebrush ecosystem regions may serve as potential recharge zones for enhancing groundwater storage in the snake river plains as they exhibit lower evapotranspiration rates in comparison to other ecosystems furthermore this study implies that use of field data can provide a better understanding of boundary layer fluxes which in turn can help validate the fluxes simulated by land surface models acknowledgements we gratefully acknowledge idaho epscor and the national science foundation for support provided under grant eps 0814387 this

1131,in situ land surface flux monitoring studies can be useful to extrapolate canopy scales processes to weather and climate analysis this paper evaluated the interaction between ecosystems and environmental forces in partitioning available energy from multi sensor platform in the semi arid region of the snake river basin in idaho usa field measurements of latent and sensible heat fluxes using scintillometers and the eddy covariance flux data during the growing season in 2011 2012 were able to identify spatial and seasonal variability in partitioning of surface energy components including net radiation latent sensible ground heat fluxes available energy measured from sagebrush cheatgrass and lodgepole pine ecosystems indicate that 79 58 and 62 partitioned into latent heat fluxes of 24 20 and 35 respectively role of precipitation and soil moisture which in turn influenced the latent and sensible heat flux more profoundly were evident in sagebrush and cheatgrass as compared to lodgepole pine with a higher vapor pressure deficit and decreased relative humidity especially in the summertime between june and september the budyko analysis revealed that aridity index ratio was found to vary between 3 and 5 suggesting a degree of aridity in these ecosystems evapotranspiration et was severely constrained by lack of soil moisture for cheatgrass and sagebrush when compared to the lodgepole pine ecosystem in addition it has been concluded that the sagebrush ecosystem regions can serve as recharge zones for enhancing groundwater storage in the snake river plains as they exhibit lower evapotranspiration rates in comparison to other ecosystems this study emphasizes that use of field data can provide a better understanding of boundary layer fluxes which in turn can help validate the fluxes simulated by land surface models implications of these results include the need for sustained monitoring and land atmosphere interaction studies that are beneficial for effective water resource assessment and management keywords eddy covariance latent heat flux scintillometer sensible heat flux surface energy partitioning 1 introduction the snake river basin is a vast semi arid system supporting irrigated agriculture and natural ecosystems hoekema and sridhar 2013 large scale agricultural activities with both surface water and groundwater sources are changing the local and regional climates sridhar 2013 the present distributions of vegetation in the remaining parts of the basin such as sagebrush cheatgrass and logdepole forest systems serve as recharge zones for the vast aquifer lying underneath this terrain since both irrigated agriculture and natural ecosystems function in specific ways while partitioning surface energy and water fluxes the representation of these land surface characteristics in land surface models has drawn the attention of research more than ever before the water balance of this large hydrographic system is linked with the land cover and land use changes which in turn may change the flow regimes of the snake river sridhar et al 2013 jaksa and sridhar 2015 since the energy budget and water budget are tightly linked investigating the partitioning of energy fluxes into latent and sensible heat fluxes is key to understanding the regional water resources and boundary layer meteorological properties land surface processes are linked to the regional climate and their anomalies are related to land climate coupling the partitioning of available energy between sensible and latent heat fluxes impacts boundary layer dynamics and hydrological processes at various spatio temporal scales dirmeyer 1994 seth and giorgi 1996 however many studies have found that energy partitioning as a function of the vegetation response is difficult because it requires the quantification of biogeochemical and biogeophysical interactions bounoua et al 2002 wilson et al 2002 kueppers et al 2007 irrigated surfaces and clear and cloudy skies have control over environmental forces and in turn on vegetation s response to local climatic requirements field and mooney 1986 woodward 1987 neilson 1995 baldocchi and meyers 1998 fitzjarrald et al 2001 numerous studies have investigated the responses of different land surfaces to exchanges of energy and momentum between the land and atmosphere jacobs and de bruin 1992 betts and ball 1995 pielke et al 1998 raupach 1998 wilson et al 1999 thompson et al 2004 chen et al 2009 sridhar and wedin 2009 liu et al 2016 land surface heterogeneity arising from soil vegetation topography etc contributes to soil moisture redistribution and hence the partitioning of incoming solar energy into latent and sensible heat fluxes feddema et al 2005 jin and sridhar 2012 gallego elvira et al 2016 in addition environmental variables such as the net radiation and vapor pressure deficit can enhance or dampen the relative magnitude of the latent and sensible heat fluxes gu et al 2006 to assess the regional climate and hydrologic systems observational data from multi sensor platforms and modeling techniques are used to understand the dynamic nature of latent and sensible heat fluxes over canopy to field scales entekhabi et al 1996 eltahir 1998 gu et al 1999 feddema et al 2005 our hypothesis is that the latent heat flux exchange is larger in lodgepole pine forest than in the sagebrush and cheatgrass ecosystem due to the higher utilization of available energy and soil moisture supported by multi sensor data sets this paper evaluated soil moisture and energy fluxes in lodgepole pine sagebrush and cheatgrass communities in the snake river basin srb during 2011 2012 hoekema and sridhar 2013 field observations using the eddy covariance method and a scintillometer were used to quantify the impact of precipitation soil moisture net radiation and vapor pressure in modulating the sensible and latent heat fluxes understanding the surface energy fluxes from multiple measurements across three ecosystems not only provides the opportunity to relate multi sensors but also serves as a reliable observational data source for validation collecting field data is labor intensive and expensive however these data need to be collected to categorically understand the local scale surface energy components and plant responses to refine and improve hydrological model algorithms the objectives of this study are to 1 perform an intercomparison analysis of fluxes measured by the eddy covariance and scintillometer systems 2 evaluate the separation of energy fluxes over sagebrush cheatgrass and lodgepole pine ecosystems and 3 understand the influence of land atmospheric factors in partitioning sensible and latent heat fluxes over the ecosystems this assessment is required to understand the role of surface energy fluxes in modulating the boundary layer dynamics streamflow and aquifer recharge 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field observations of energy budget components soil moisture and standard weather variables from a collaborative network comprising three study sites hollister sagebrush raft river cheatgrass and island park lodgepole pine in idaho u s formed a central part of this study fig 1 hollister located in the southwest region of the eastern snake plain aquifer espa is densely covered with sagebrush that is 50 100 cm tall sagebrush is the most important shrub in the western semiarid region which is well adapted to soils like deep fertile loamy and sandy loamy soils at least 0 9 m deep and the annual precipitation ranges from 200 mm to more than 750 mm accessed from usda nrcs plant database https plants usda gov java the raft river situated east of hollister is dominated by cheatgrass that is 75 cm tall interspersed with crested wheat grass and invasive wild mustard cheatgrass has smooth softly hairy leaves with a dense fibrous root system concentrated mainly in the upper 30 cm of the soil layer island park located within the targhee national forest is predominantly covered with lodgepole pine trees that are 15 m tall and contains a mix of grass and shrubs as the understory vegetation lodgepole pine trees are characterized by needle leaves of 2 5 7 5 cm long and a deep tap root system which helps the plant extract moisture from deep soil layers and provide stability in loose sandy soils 2 2 instrumentation in order to understand the surface energy partitioning at sagebrush cheatgrass and lodgepole pine ecosystems in the snake river basin the study used eddy covariance ec and large aperture scintillometer las surface flux data measurements from zhao and allen 2014 each ec site contained a suite of sensors including radiometers an anemometer precipitation gauges soil moisture sensors a scintillometer and two eddy covariance systems the layout for the instrumentation set up at each site was based on the homogeneity of the surface vegetation and a reasonable fetch in the upwind direction baldocchi 1997 to corroborate the measurements a second eddy covariance system was deployed at a distance of 1 2 km which aided to minimize eliminate or flag any error introduced in the first flux tower data in addition the large aperture scintillometer las was co located with a transmitter adjacent to the first eddy covariance system and a receiver near the second eddy covariance system to measure the sensible heat flux across the transect over the three ecosystems table 1 the ec sites are equipped with 3 d sonic anemometers rmyoung 81000 and csi csat3 4 component net radiometers primarily hukseflux nr01 and kipp and zonen cnr1 pyranometers rebs hft 3 1 soil heat flux plates hukseflux hfp01sc self calibrating soil heat flux plates campbell scientific cs616 volumetric soil water content sensors vaisalla air temperature and relative humidity and air temperature sensors and tipping bucket precipitation gauges with antifreeze filled catches to melt snow for the ground heat flux gh data two different soil heat flux shf plate depths 4 and 8 cm were used heat storage change between the plates and surface computed using four thermocouples above each plate the shf data were averaged at each location to provide a good spatial average value all measurements were sampled at 1 second intervalues and were reported over 30 minute periods zhao and allen 2014 the most commonly used scintillometer for sensible heat measurement is the large aperture scintillometer las meijninger et al 2006 scintillometers can be best suited for the accurate error estimation of remote sensed or satellite measured and simulated sensible heat fluxes kleissl et al 2009 samain et al 2011 lee et al 2015 due to their path lengths that are generally larger than footprints of ec systems the main components of las include a transmitter and a receiver to measure the fluctuations of the beam that are caused by the density and turbulence induced atmospheric scintillation this study used the scintec bls900 las system the bls900 transmitter consists of two disks populated with infrared and visible light emitting diodes and the receiver can perform corrections for absorption fluctuations and outer scale effects the fluctuations in the intensity i of electromagnetic radiation measured by a scintillometer relates to the variations in the refractive index of air along the las transect the variations in the intensity of the beam are directly related to the structure function constant of the refractive index fluctuation in the wavelengths of the scintillometer and then to the transect area averaged sensible heat flux chehbouni et al 1999 at sagebrush site the las transect is 1 86 km in length running north transmitter to south receiver at cheatgrass site the las transect is 840 m in length spanning from east northeast to west southwest direction at sagebrush and cheatgrass site las is installed at height of 2 m lodgepole site is characterized by a 1 73 km las path that runs north to south installed at 24 m height above the lodgepole pine canopy at hollister and raft river las is installed at a height of 2 m and at island park it is 22 23 m 2 3 flux data collection a nr01 4 way radiometer q7 net radiometer csat3 3d sonic along with bls 900 scintec transmitter rmyoung 3d sonic and licor 7500 hygrometer were mounted on a tower over the canopy data from bls 900 and csat3 3d instruments were used for our analysis however rmyoung 3d sonic data were not included in the study since they were similar to csat3 3d data the mounting heights of csat3 3d anemometers that measure three dimensional wind turbulence with minimal flow distortion differed for locations due to vegetation growth and they were 5 6 m 2 3 m and 22 24 m at hollister raft river and island park respectively to measure water vapor a licor 7500 hygrometer was placed on the same level but 10 cm apart from anemometers on the tower this arrangement of csat3 3d and the licor 7500 hygrometer not only maximized the co location but also minimized wind distortion kurc and small 2007 in addition a licor 7500 hygrometer instrument was tilted approximately 45 degrees to avoid any water accumulation on the sensor eddy covariance data were processed using campbell scientific crbasic code in addition to other programs and they were used to compute the sensible latent and radiation heat fluxes after performing self calibration exercises with the instruments the self calibration exercise included time lag adjustments among instruments data spike removal flagging for the air flow direction from the backside of the csat3 3d anemometer the influence of slope stream flow coordinate rotation and wpl corrections see zhao and allen 2014 for detailed description of data quality flags and corrections applied to reduce the power consumption the eddy covariance data were collected at 20 hz in the first year followed by a decrease to 10 hz in the following years the ground heat flux at the surface was calculated by summing the plate reading with the change in heat storage above the plate change in heat storage was computed using at least four thermocouples and the thermocouple readings were extrapolated to the surface using a 3rd degree polynomial equation net radiation measurements were recorded every 10 s using a huskeflux nr01 4 way radiometer and q7 net radiometer and averaged over every 30 min a nr01 4 way radiometer measured incoming and surface reflected shortwave and longwave above the canopy using two types of sensors built in the radiometer the pyranometer and pyrgeometer were used to measure shortwave or solar radiation and longwave radiation respectively the q7 net radiometer with its thermopile sensor was also used to measure the change in incoming and surface reflected radiation the rebs soil heat flux plate hft 3 1 hukseflux soil heat flux plate hfp01sc and rshf were used to measure the ground heat flux and soil temperature at 10 s intervals which were averaged over 5 and 10 min the plates were placed in two locations under the plant canopy or vegetation or under a bare patch between 4 and 12 cm below the soil surface thermocouples were also used to measure the ground temperature at a depth between 1 and 40 cm volumetric soil moisture data were collected every 10 min and averaged over every 30 min measurements of soil moisture were obtained from a number of locations and depths using from 10 to 28 of echo5 and from 6 to 29 of campbell scientific cs616 tdt for each ecosystem echo5 and cs616 were installed between 5 and 42 cm below the surface and between 0 and 30 cm respectively this installation was done to collect duplicate records of reliable soil moisture in both the horizontal and vertical directions and to evaluate them more closely if there is significant spatial heterogeneity in addition two tipping bucket precipitation gauges were installed to measure the precipitation and these gauges were capable of melting snow using antifreeze filled reservoirs 2 4 data processing despite strictly following various protocols in setting up instruments errors can occur in measurements due to random fluctuations in the flux magnitude topographical complexity and surface heterogeneity hollinger and richardson 2005 vickers et al 2010 the errors in the measured fluxes from both the eddy covariance and scintillometer systems were marked with quality flags when deviations in the magnitude of the same flux measured with a different instrument bad wind directions values out of the normal range rain events missing data and low battery voltage were encountered for hollister and raft river we excluded all the data that were flagged because of the above mentioned reasons however the influence of the wind was dominant most of the time in island park due to its location in a higher elevation therefore wind was not a factor for flagging the data subjecting the data to these quality control criteria the analysis included only 78 94 and 72 data for hollister raft river and island park respectively at hollister the flagged data included 11 missing data 6 rain events and 3 wind direction rain events flagged 5 data at raft river and missing data flagged 17 data at island park 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 budyko curve estimation to understand the annual patterns and relationships between water supply and energy availability this study employed the approach proposed by budyko 1974 this method introduces a scheme to assess the long term average water and energy balances by considering actual evapotranspiration et precipitation p and energy availability or potential evapotranspiration etp effective precipitation is defined as the difference between precipitation and change in soil moisture δs the budyko equation helps to estimate evapotranspiration as a function of the ratio of etp to precipitation p as shown below 1 e t p α t a n h 1 α 1 e α where α etp p 1 and e t and p are the annual values of actual evapotranspiration and precipitation respectively etp was calculated based on the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 2 5 2 footprint analysis the footprint analysis is performed to quantify the role of vegetation and environmental conditions on the measured sensible heat flux the footprint is defined as the area that contributes the vertical flux or concentration to the eddy covariance sensors both the flux and concentration footprints vary in their spatial extent and to quantify the footprint the cumulative normalized contribution to flux cnf was computed from schuepp et al 1990 and gash 1986 which is represented in the following equation 2 c n f 0 x l u z d u k x 2 e x p u z d u k x d x where x l is the distance from the station m u is the integrated wind speed m s 1 z is the measurement height m d is the zero plane displacement height m u is the friction velocity m s 1 k is von karman s coefficient 0 4 and exp is the base for the natural logarithm system 2 71 2 5 3 wind function and relative humidity in order to establish the relationship between turbulent flux drying power of air and relative humidity we demonstrated the differences among the ecosystems using the complementarity principles for dry soils the unspent excess energy from the available energy during the et partitioning increases the surface air temperature and decreases vapor pressure deficit this also increases the potential evapotranspiration etp by establishing a complementary relationship between et and etp jaksa et al 2013 sridhar et al 2013 etp mm day 1 based on penman 1948 is expressed as e t p δ q n γ e a δ γ 3 where δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve at an air temperature ta q n is the available energy rn gh at the surface expressed in terms of the water depth mm day 1 γ is the psychometric constant and e a is the drying power of the air mm day 1 the quantity e a can be expressed considering penman s original rome wind function for a wet vegetated surface or free water surface as 4 e a 0 26 1 0 54 u e s e a where u is the measured wind speed at a 2 m height m s and e a and e s are respectively the actual and saturation vapor pressures measured by the ec system 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil moisture distribution seasonal variations in soil moisture i e the volumetric water content of the soil it is the ratio of water volume to soil volume multiplied by 100 for the soil column of 42 cm from the three sites are shown graphically in fig 2 which covered period between jan 1 2011 and dec 31 2012 the top soil column of 30 cm for sagebrush and cheatgrass showed similar variations with peaks in march april followed by decreased soil moisture in july august the soil moisture in lodgepole pine showed a delayed peak in may june until the snowpack is on the ground the intersensor variability in soil moisture s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 and s6 was quite high up to 10 in sagebrush and cheatgrass demonstrating spatial heterogeneity across ecosystems and seasons the box and whisker plots of the average and median monthly soil moisture was high during spring march may and winter dec feb 10 20 due to being highly variable in arid environments with an average precipitation of 65 mm in the spring and 21 mm in the summer june aug the soil moisture dropped from 30 to 15 with precipitation being the principle reason for the seasonal difference in soil moisture in the sagebrush ecosystem clearly a limited amount of soil moisture that was available during the driest period from these ecosystems was left for soil evaporation and plant transpiration on average the soil moisture in the cheatgrass ecosystem was less than 5 due to an average precipitation of less than 24 mm in the summer cheatgrass normally greened up earlier in the season hence their stomatal activities did not favor transpiration in the peak of the growing season in the summer however as shown in table 4 which will be discussed in the later sections average spring precipitation of 72 mm precipitation augmented soil moisture up to 30 during the spring season the variability ranged between 5 and 10 due to intermittent spring rain events the highest amount of precipitation of 145 mm over the lodgepole pine system in the spring increased the soil moisture in the top 42 cm up to 25 a 5 decrease in the summer related to evapotranspiration because the root zone extraction of soil moisture by the dense canopy effectively transpired moisture into the boundary layer 3 2 analysis of energy budget closure energy budget closure is critical to understanding the partitioning of the energy balance components and quantifying the residual flux comparisons of 30 min turbulent a sum of sensible and latent heat fluxes and available energy a sum of net radiation and ground heat flux from 1 jan 2011 to 31 dec 2012 are shown in fig 3 revealing an overall underestimation of the sensible and latent heat fluxes over the three ecosystems the biases toward the available energy occurred during the day and differed minimally when verified with the regression analysis based on a spreadsheet program table 2 the slope of the line representing the turbulence and available energy relationship showed an average value of 0 78 which ranged between 0 70 and 0 90 the correlation coefficient was between 0 85 and 0 92 in general both the growing and non growing periods showed some differences over sagebrush but they were not significant in contrast differences over cheatgrass and lodgepole pine were noticeable nevertheless the underestimation of turbulent energy generated residual fluxes up to 0 18 mj m 2 200 w m 2 during noon over each ecosystem the residual energy analysis was restricted to the daytime since it pertained to the partitioning of energy during the most active period of day 3 3 impacts of land cover on seasonal energy balance components seasonal patterns of energy balance components net radiation and latent sensible and ground heat fluxes for the three ecosystems were plotted as shown in fig 4 significant seasonal variations were seen in the average diurnal fluxes during the period of april to september which can be mainly attributed to radiative forcing and growing season plant activities net radiation showed a gradual increase from march to a maximum between may and july followed by a decrease in the autumn season net radiation values were between 300 and 500 w m 2 and approximately 90 70 and 75 of it was partitioned into sensible and latent heat fluxes over sagebrush cheatgrass and lodgepole pine respectively table 3 the differences in partitioning between 10 and 30 could be partly attributed to closure of the energy budget and measurement error frank et al 2016 mauder and zeeman 2017 diurnal distributions of sensible and latent heat fluxes followed a similar seasonal pattern as that of net radiation the magnitudes varied over the ecosystems fig 4 and table 4 the sensible heat flux over sagebrush was the highest with values from 200 to 300 w m 2 may september followed by the fluxes over cheatgrass june august and lodgepole pine june july annually 90 of available energy rn gh was partitioned into the sensible and latent heat flux le h over sagebrush and 70 for cheatgrass and 75 for lodgepole pine ecosystem the annual values of sensible heat flux h over available energy rn gh for sagebrush cheatgrass and lodgepole pine was approximately 66 50 and 41 furthermore the wet periods in late fall and spring showed a high conversion an average of 27 w m 2 of net radiation into latent heat flux than the non rainy periods in the summer an average of 20 w m 2 and this may be attributed to soil moisture control over the surface fluxes table 4 the latent heat flux gradually increased for both sagebrush and cheatgrass when the vegetation started greening up in the spring months however the lodgepole pine ecosystem converted 34 of net radiation into latent heat flux the abundance of soil moisture along with relatively thick canopy may have resulted in an increased latent heat flux 37 in the spring and summer months which later decreased to 18 in the remainder of the year in general ground heat flux ranged between 100 to 100 w m 2 with some exceptions in the winter and peak summer seasons 3 4 evaluation of the eddy covariance measured sensible heat fluxes with scintillometer daily estimates of the sensible heat flux from the eddy covariance systems were compared to the scintillometer measurements to evaluate their performances for the period of study fig 4 this analysis was to illustrate the energy balance components on a monthly time step across three ecosystems however seasonal monthly assessment provided some insights into fluxes averaged over 6 hrly periods furthermore they exhibited two distinguishing features as to how net radiation was partitioned into latent and sensible heat fluxes diurnally and over the entire year and how they differed between months across these ecosystems the scintillometer based sensible heat flux was measured at the same height as that of the eddy covariance system to minimize discrepancies in measurements scintillometer based sensible heat flux measurements were slightly higher compared to that of eddy covariance data for all ecosystems and the differences were estimated as 8 7 and 5 over the sagebrush cheatgrass and lodgepole pine ecosystems respectively a slightly reduced magnitude from the eddy covariance data may be related to factors including the footprint vegetation heterogeneity and vertical wind velocity figs 5 and 6 however as in table 4 the highest deviation in sensible heat fluxes over sagebrush appeared to be approximately 8 for the cheatgrass site invasive wild mustard mixed with cheatgrass decreased the vertical wind velocity which may have contributed to the deviation of up to 7 in the sensible heat flux flux measurements in the lodgepole pine ecosystem indicated that topography surface roughness and canopy cover may have altered the wind speed resulting in a difference of approximately 5 between the fluxes measured by the two systems 3 5 comparison of sensible heat flux over ecosystems fig 5a illustrates the daily variation in sensible heat fluxes over sagebrush cheatgrass and lodgepole pine for the period from jan 1 2011 to dec 31 2012 from the data it is clear that the sensible heat flux was the highest over the sagebrush ecosystem followed by cheatgrass and lodgepole pine on a seasonal scale between june and august sensible heat flux was as high as 12 mj day 1 m 2 this may have been due to several factors including higher net radiation decreased precipitation an average of 21 mm and dry soils an average of 14 which influenced the warming of the near surface layer table 4 fig 5b shows a site wise comparison of the seven day moving average of penman s wind function ea and relative humidity rh variability between the ecosystems in ea and rh was observed with sagebrush and cheatgrass showing higher ea and a larger decrease in rh while lodgepole pine recording a slightly diminished ea and rh relatively this suggests that higher lh over the lodgepole system is supported by higher rh and lower ea relative to the other two ecosystems additional analysis to distinguish the interannual variability based on the scatter plots of e a and rh revealed that 2011 was no different from 2010 and 2012 with regard to ea and rh the average sensible flux over sagebrush was 8 1 mj day 1 m 2 between april and september whereas for the non growing period this magnitude was 2 4 mj day 1 m 2 sagebrush which is typically 50 100 cm tall captured 80 of the sensible heat flux within a distance of 200 m in contrast for cheatgrass that is approximately 75 cm tall the contribution was less than 75 for a similar distance of approximately 200 m the sensible heat flux was insignificant for a similar upwind distance in the lodgepole pine system since the tree canopy was almost 15 m tall and their footprint size reached 80 when the upward distance increased to 1500 2000 m fig 6 in addition to height understory vegetation including grass shrubs and planted pine trees with regular spacing also impacted the wind conditions these findings agreed with baldocchi 1997 who concluded that reductions in the sensible heat flux contribution occur for a certain upwind distance 3 6 comparison of evapotranspiration flux over ecosystems the diurnal characteristics of evapotranspiration over three ecosystems showed seasonal variations during the growing and non growing periods and the estimates across the ecosystems differed fig 7 increased evapotranspiration from march to july was evident and the daily magnitudes of measured evapotranspiration over sagebrush was 2 0 mm day 1 in the active growing season in 2011 which significantly p value 0 001 on non parametric mann whitney test decreased to 1 2 mm day 1 during the remainder of the year the lack of soil moisture increased temperature and nearly dormant vegetation after flowering in the late summer and early fall periods may result in decreased evapotranspiration and these conclusions agreed with earlier studies raven 1996 evapotranspiration for cheatgrass and lodgepole pine ecosystems during the growing season was 2 3 mm day 1 a range of 1 0 3 7 and 5 5 mm day 1 a range of 2 7 9 3 respectively relatively high precipitation and low vapor pressure deficits over lodgepole pine resulted in the highest evapotranspiration up to 9 3 mm day 1 in the growing period on a seasonal basis it was almost five times greater than the non growing period while sagebrush and cheatgrass exhibited only approximately a two fold difference between the two seasons the budyko analysis of annual evapotranspiration over three ecosystems is presented in fig 8 computed based on the values shown in table 4 the results highlighted the water limited conditions a condition that arose due to limited available soil moisture for evapotranspiration during 2011 2012 in all three ecosystems this was particularly consistent with a meager annual precipitation over sagebrush and cheatgrass ecosystems during this two year period the lowest evapotranspiration measurements suggested the critical role of stomatal resistance in maintaining the ecosystem functions under dry climate regimes despite diminished precipitation the drought tolerant vegetation that was relatively hardy with higher stomatal resistance aided in conserving the soil moisture that was available in the root zone the ratio between potential evapotranspiration and effective precipitation p δs varied from 3 to 5 and indicated the degree of aridity at these ecosystems et was severely constrained by lack of soil moisture for cheatgrass and sagebrush but soil moisture deficit was lower for the lodgepole pine ecosystem a high aridity index of 4 5 was due to high available energy and low precipitation in the sagebrush system 80 of precipitation was converted to evapotranspiration and over cheatgrass more than 90 of precipitation contributed to evapotranspiration in contrast the lodgepole pine ecosystem which experienced higher soil moisture conditions due to higher precipitation approximately 60 80 of precipitation was available for evapotranspiration a reduction of 20 evapotranspiration between the two years was due to a decrease in precipitation up to 100 mm and the role of soil moisture control on evapotranspiration could be related to decreased soil moisture storage in the soil column jaksa and sridhar 2015 jaksa et al 2013 williams et al 2012 investigated the climate and vegetation control on surface water balances using budyko framework their study reported that grassland showed higher evaporative ratio compared to forest ecosystems overall both sagebrush shrubland and cheatgrass grassland produced similar et obrist et al 2003 kurc and small 2004 also dugas et al 1996 reported that in arid environments the differences in surface energy balance mainly related to leaf area index and water supply rather than vegetation type malek et al 1997 malek and bingham 1997 and prater and delucia 2006 found similar magnitude and seasonal patterns of turbulent heat fluxes of american west sagebrush as in the current study 4 conclusions accurate understanding of relative roles and interactions these characteristics of ecosystem vegetation type and climate in energy and hydrological response has great importance in predicting and managing future water resources and their associated ecological services under climate and land cover changes this study evaluated the strong correlation between three different ecosystems characteristics on energy portioning specifically the influence of rainfall soil vegetation and topography on mean annual interannual and seasonal water and energy balance were investigated using field measurements from three sites in southern idaho using field measurements of precipitation soil moisture and surface fluxes the analysis of fluxes across over sagebrush cheatgrass and lodgepole pine demonstrated the differential role of environmental factors in partitioning the surface energy balance components differences in available energy rn gh measured from sagebrush cheatgrass and lodgepole pine ecosystems indicated that 79 58 and 62 partitioned into latent heat fluxes of 24 20 and 35 respectively it was evident that both environmental and vegetation conditions were influencing the partitioning of fluxes evapotranspiration et for cheatgrass and lodgepole pine ecosystems during the growing season was 2 3 and 5 5 mm day 1 respectively and on a seasonal basis it was almost five times greater than the non growing period et for sagebrush was sagebrush was 2 0 mm day 1 and sagebrush and cheatgrass exhibited only approximately a two fold difference between the two seasons soil moisture variability in these natural ecosystems were driven by both snow in the winter and early spring and fall precipitation events depending on the temperature a function of elevation the lodge pole ecosystem exhibited a different energy budget partitioning unlike the sagebrush or the cheat grass ecosystems the latent heat flux was the highest over lodgepole pine which was distinctly controlled by high precipitation and increased the soil moisture storage however from the footprint analysis we concluded that the sensible heat flux was dominant over sagebrush and cheatgrass ecosystem in contrast the analysis revealed that the complex topography and spatial heterogeneity within the tall canopy reduced the footprint size for the sensible heat flux over lodgepole pine the budyko analysis showed that variability in precipitation controlled the evaporative fraction across all the three ecosystems the estimated aridity indices were found to vary between 3 and 5 indicating high evaporative demand and diminished moisture supply as the major reasons for the variations between them knowledge about factors causing variability in surface fluxes over dominant ecosystems is useful for improving land surface model processes and prediction capabilities at multiple space and time scales since evapotranspiration plays a significant role in water resource assessment this study offers impetus to characterize the basin scale water balance and aquifer recharge potential in response to boundary layer processes and ecosystem functioning the broader implications of this study suggest that sagebrush ecosystem regions may serve as potential recharge zones for enhancing groundwater storage in the snake river plains as they exhibit lower evapotranspiration rates in comparison to other ecosystems furthermore this study implies that use of field data can provide a better understanding of boundary layer fluxes which in turn can help validate the fluxes simulated by land surface models acknowledgements we gratefully acknowledge idaho epscor and the national science foundation for support provided under grant eps 0814387 this

1132,many studies have illustrated the elevational gradient of plant zonation in estuarine marshes nevertheless little is known about the elevational patterns of plant zones and marsh edge existing along deepened navigation channels compared to their shallow anabranches our study analyzed the factors controlling these patterns this knowledge is required when restoring tidal marshes to compensate for anthropogenic impacts we determined the species elevation pattern in the navigable german elbe and weser estuaries using the key species scirpus tabernaemontani scirpus maritimus and phragmites australis we compared 1 marshes along navigation channels and anabranches and 2 their marsh edges 3 additionally we tested how tidal range affects the lowest elevation of marsh edges we analyzed data derived from digital vegetation maps and digital elevation models and then normalized the elevation data using the mean tidal range we determined the elevational distributions of plant zones on regularly flooded estuarine marshes and quantified the lowest elevation as an important niche boundary which reflects the resistance against physical stress our findings indicate that the patterns result not only from tidal range but also from hydrodynamics due to the dredging history diversely shaped channels bank morphologies and vessel frequencies the patterns found and the species specific elevations need to be considered when choosing suitable elevations when restoring tidal marshes in dredged estuaries the results might also inspire reconsidering the reference plants zonation while monitoring ecological potential of severely modified estuaries under water framework directive keywords elevation gradient mean high tide plant zonation restoration wetlands floodplain models 1 introduction the elevational gradient is a well known indicator for explaining vegetation zonation in regularly flooded marshes e g coops et al 1999 keddy 2010 it indicates that inundation stress and hydrodynamic stress decreases when surface elevation increases coops and van der velde 1996 pennings and callaway 1992 sanchez et al 1996 therefore it is defined as an integrative proxy for tidal inundation and hydrodynamic forces bertness 2006 the relationship between the elevation of the marsh surface and local water level determines the frequency and duration of tidal inundation montalto and steenhuis 2004 thus this hydroperiod regime governs the creation of niches for different plant species foti et al 2012 they often form conspicuous plant zonation landwards of the marsh edge adams 1963 bockelmann et al 2002 engels and jensen 2010 which is characterized by an abrupt transition from low bare flats to higher elevation vegetated marshes wang and temmerman 2013 beside biotic determinants such as competition e g wilson and keddy 1986 the emergence of different habitat zones is determined by a hydrodynamic stress gradient silinski et al 2016a van wesenbeeck 2007 wang and temmerman 2013 regularly flooded marsh plants form monocultures where flow velocity is low bertness 1988 greiner la peyre et al 2001 van wesenbeeck et al 2007 phragmites australis for instance can dominate across the elevation zones so that plant zonation is absent e g coops and van der velde 1996 weak correlation between the elevational gradient and plant zonation exists on broader marshes and marsh plains kim 2014 where gradients of physical stress become inconsistent bockelmann et al 2002 costa et al 2003 silvestri et al 2005 nevertheless in regularly flooded marshes elevational zones of plants are closely related to inundation frequency bockelmann et al 2002 white and madsen 2016 and groundwater wilson et al 2015 tidal range can also directly affect the variability of plant zones orson et al 1985 exposed to higher tidal ranges low parts of tidal flats are inundated at a later point in time and become dry early in the same period of time as lower tidal ranges are acting upon vegetation there inundation stress is therefore diminished on these flats and plants are able to grow at lower elevations balke et al 2016 mckee and patrick 1988 that is why marshes exposed to higher tidal range are deemed to be more resilient to sea level rise than marshes affected by low tidal range kirwan and guntenspergen 2010 additionally a higher tidal range often triggers higher rates of vertical accretion provided that the sediment supply is sufficient kirwan et al 2016 rogers et al 2006 with the increasing tidal range the elevational range of the lowest marsh zones increases since other stress factors such as high hydrodynamic forces or salinity can still impede the expansion of the marsh edge to lower elevations carus et al 2017a the tidal fluvial gradient and the exposure gradient result from water motions that are triggered by tide gravity different water densities and wave inducing drivers such as wind and shipping movements the tidal fluvial gradient is formed by non linear interactions of tidal energy fluxes and fluvial energy fluxes jay et al 1990 while tidal energy fluxes are generated by the tides fluvial energy fluxes are created by the surface discharge decreasing toward the sea these fluxes determine the characteristic river geomorphology the tidal inundation and flow velocities moreover they affect the hydrodynamic forces resulting from shipping and cargo traffic at low tide for instance shipping induced waves have a lower impact on shorelines and marsh plants than at high tide the exposure gradient is determined by the magnitude of the tidal fluvial energy exposure is defined as the entire effect of waves on shorelines and vegetation keddy 1982 the mechanical wave energy and the resulting current velocities directly affect vegetation by removing biomass and uprooting seedlings coops et al 1991 keddy 1983 additionally the vegetation is indirectly influenced by erosion or sediment deposition keddy 1983 these effects are correlated with sediment characteristics as well as the inclination and length of the slope which affect wave and flow attenuation e g bouma et al 2009 marani et al 2013 möller and spencer 2002 for example vegetation along anabranches as well as along the main channel far away from shipping traffic and or with a long gentle slope is likely to suffer less from mechanical stress than exposed sites near navigation channels silinski et al 2015 and on steep slopes in navigable estuaries the tidal fluvial gradient and the exposure gradient have undergone enormous alterations over the last two centuries building embankments and taking land from estuaries for agriculture the intertidal and flooding areas diminished atwater et al 1979 doody 2004 temmerman et al 2013 the channels were dredged to provide a deeper and wider waterway for cargo vessels needed by an emerging industry blott et al 2006 pye and blott 2014 van der wal et al 2002 these human activities caused an increase of tidal prism water volume and a decrease of channel roughness which results in higher tidal fluvial energy and therefore accelerates the current velocities cox et al 2003 kerner 2007 velocities tend to be higher on flood than on ebb causing the tide to rise faster than it falls this tidal asymmetry is defined as flood dominated fortunato and oliveira 2005 ongoing deepening of the channel increases flood dominance of tidal currents and decreases the river s flushing capacity winterwerp and wang 2013 large amounts of fine sediments would accumulate in the inner estuary da silva and duck 2001 li et al 2014 townend et al 2011 in contrast dredged estuaries or parts of them can also be ebb dominant i e have short ebb duration but higher maximum ebb flow velocities lange et al 2008 van der wal et al 2002 in this case sediment is transported downstream and the risk of shore and marsh erosion is high substantial revetments lange et al 2008 and bank nourishment helped to prevent this erosion in the past bfg 2014 lange et al 2008 the tidal asymmetry can vary spatially and temporally depending on the amount of discharge guo et al 2014 and the extent of tidal flats fortunato and oliveira 2005 both feed back to the sedimentation erosion processes which therefore vary as well van maren and winterwerp 2013 marsh dynamics are the result of complex interactions among hydrodynamics sediment transport and biology townend et al 2011 the altered hydro and morphodynamics clearly impact the vegetation zonation on marshes cox et al 2003 low marshes with pioneer species are rare butzeck et al 2016 da silva and duck 2001 hartig et al 2002 because high tides reaching the edge of the fringing marshes increase the risk of erosion cox et al 2003 van der wal and pye 2004 marsh edges exposed to navigational channels clearly suffer higher erosion rates browne 2017 gain of marshes is also reported in areas where sedimentation has taken place e g in anabranches or on hydrological regulated tidal flats more sedimentation can also lead to steeper slopes causing marsh edges to become more exposed to waves coops et al 1999 as a consequence intertidal scirpus stands diminish whereas species of higher marshes such as phragmites australis expand butzeck et al 2016 coops et al 1999 petersen et al 2009 this forms part of vegetation succession from a low marsh pioneer vegetation toward a high marsh vegetation butzeck et al 2016 comparing marshes in navigable estuaries past studies have quantified changes in marsh morphology but have not considered elevation butzeck et al 2016 cox et al 2003 or species zonation wang and temmerman 2013 on a local scale though spatial patterns resulting from hydrodynamic stress were quantified carus et al 2017a silinski et al 2016a van wesenbeeck 2007 these investigations however cannot spatially transfer to other parts of the estuary moreover there are very few analyses that look at the ecosystem as a whole friess et al 2012 moffett et al 2015 although this is indispensable in the context of estuarine management to compensate for historical damage and negative impacts of human actions remaining estuarine natural structures and their functioning need to be maintained and promoted at the same time economic development should not be disturbed boerema and meire 2017 effectively restoring and thereby creating marsh habitats for sedimentation erosion dynamics means enlarging water storage and friction lowering inland storm surges and enhancing biodiversity temmerman et al 2013 therefore more extensive knowledge is needed on how plant zones respond to elevation in regularly flooded marshes after years of dredging estuarine channels the difference between the main channel and its anabranches became more significant since estuaries shift from a multi channel to a single channel system due to dredging stark et al 2017 we already know that plants zones differ in elevation relative to mean high water when comparing estuaries and deep navigation channels with shallow anabranches heuner et al 2016 however we still do not know if these differences are only due to a contrasting tidal range or if they can also be contributed to contrasting hydrodynamic forces the positioning of the marsh edge in relation to elevation also depends on hydrodynamic forces carus et al 2017a thus we expect that the elevational responses of marsh plants would also differ between the estuaries their deepened navigation channels and their shallow anabranches when we normalize the elevation by tidal range mean low water 0 mean high water 1 if so these differences need to be considered when restoring tidal marshes because restoration sites should be diligently selected on the basis of suitable elevations temmerman et al 2013 to verify these differences our objectives are 1 to determine how plant zones vary in normalized elevation across estuaries 2 how tidal range affects the lowest elevation of estuarine marsh edges and 3 how the marsh edge differs in normalized elevation and bank exposure between shallow anabranches and the deep main channels navigable for sea going vessels 2 material and methods 2 1 studied species tidal flats and marshes along the elbe and weser estuaries were lost due to embankment and damming of tributaries since the 19th century elbe 140 km² 25 weser 40 km² 9 butzeck et al 2016 hamer et al 2013 thus in the 21st century regularly flooded marshes are restricted to narrow ribbons along north sea estuaries often not broader than 200 500 m as a result vegetation zonation is less diverse and usually very distinct with few habitat shaping emergent macrophytes engels and jensen 2009 phragmites australis cav trin ex steud scirpus maritimus l palla and scirpus tabernaemontani c c gmel palla syn scirpus

estuaries elbe and weser discharge into the german bight of the north sea the pore water salinity ranged from freshwater to brackish water with salinity up to around 4 5 psu carus et al 2017a heuner et al 2012 since these waterways are used for international cargo transport the navigation channel of the two estuaries were widened and deepened several times the tidal range has doubled over the past two centuries appendix a variance and magnitude of the mean tidal range differ between the estuaries table 1 appendix b weser and elbe have been classified as upper meso to lower macro tidal estuaries kappenberg and grabemann 2001 masselink and hughes 2003 fig 1 in contrast to tidal range many other properties such as river discharge depth width volume and current velocities are weaker in the weser than in the elbe estuary table 1 these estuaries are notably affected not only by natural hydrodynamics such as wind induced waves anabranches and main channels fig 2a but also by wakes main channels only the elbe main channel witnessed higher transport frequencies vessel passages and vessels coming into port as well as bigger vessel sizes and drafts than the weser main channel table 1 however the maximum drawdown and the ship induced wave heights in both estuaries were similar as a consequence the river cross section vessel draft proportion for the weser main channel was smaller than for the elbe main channel thus the passage of a single vessel had a higher impact on the banks of the weser main channel this higher navigation effect on the banks was also reflected by a higher percentage of artificial bank reinforcement table 1 bare stone fillings on more steeply inclined bank slopes were the most predominant bank reinforcements but groynes and longitudinal structures such as breakwaters were also found between marsh edge and flood embankments the elbe estuary featured 57 km² of marshland 2009 while the weser estuary covered 48 km² 2008 thirty five percent of the weser marshes and 55 of the elbe marshes were in a natural state and not used as arable land or grassland the species s tabernaemontani s maritimus and p australis often zoned fig 2b1 covered 23 of the total weser marsh in 2008 and 26 of the total elbe marsh in 2009 they also formed the marsh edge in the study area of the elbe estuary it was 130 km long 30 s tabernaemontani 37 s maritimus 33 p australis the weser marsh edge was 90 km long 11 s tabernaemontani 15 s maritimus and 74 p australis phragmites australis is dominant along the marsh edge of the anabranches of the elbe as well as along the entire weser estuary fig 2b2 whereas s maritimus dominates the marsh edge of the main elbe river 2 3 study design and digital data because tidal and fluvial fluxes channel extents and navigation characteristics differ between the estuaries and between main channels and anabranches table 1 we have categorized four river classes elbe main channel elbe anabranches weser main channel weser anabranches to distinguish main channel and anabranches on each stream island fig 2a its area above mean low water was used to calculate a centerline fig 2c1 this divides the area into the classes main channel and anabranches each river class was split into the classes marsh and marsh edge the class marsh was created in order to analyze the elevations of the plant zones question 1 the class marsh edge was defined for the examination of the effect of tidal range on the elevation of the marsh edge question 2 and the elevational difference of the marsh edge question 3 depending on the exposure gradient each class comprised areas of s tabernaemontani s maritimus and p australis verified by digital vegetation maps petersen et al 2010 they were also used for data sampling the vegetation maps also including bare tidal flats were generated on the basis of aerial photographs with a ground resolution of 0 25 m these photos were geometrically corrected using the data of the global positioning system and the inertial navigation system of the aircraft gps ins the photos were ortho rectified based on of a digital elevation model dem including elevation data of bare tidal flats and streets petersen et al 2006 the orthophotos were automatically classified and revised manually on the screen by the vegetation experts who worked on the training areas in the field petersen et al 2010 they were thoroughly verified in the field particularly for areas with uncertainties during the revision the vegetation maps have a very high accuracy regarding geometrical locations less than 2 m boundary uncertainties and with regard to assignments of reeds and sedges correct classification rate approximately 99 verified by petersen et al 2010 the analyzed species areas representing monospecific stands amounted to almost 100 vegetation cover after the vegetation had been separated from tidal flats by the infrared signature vegetation pixels were merged by a multilevel raster based neighborhood filtering 5 5 9 9 pixels petersen et al 2010 every vegetation patch larger than 2 5 m² was classified as vegetation smaller than 2 5 m² as tidal flat due to the boundary uncertainty of less than 2 m the boundary of the marsh edge was compared visually with the aerial imagery and corrected where necessary for each river class we generated 70 random data points for the areas of each species belonging to the class marsh as well as to the class marsh edge these data points represent the presence of the species additionally we defined the following sample conditions fig 2c2 1 the minimum sampling distance was 50 m 2 the minimum distance between data points of the classes marsh and marsh edge was 2 m to avoid sampling bias due to modified hydrodynamic forces 3 the data points have a minimum distance of 10 m to groynes 4 and areas protected by breakwaters or ripraps were excluded from sampling in a geographical information system gis see table b 1 we extracted the elevation above mhw for each data point using a dem this included bathymetry echo sound data as well as gauge data from both elbe and weser estuaries the high resolution dem was produced on the basis of lidar light detection and ranging data recorded in winter 1 m grid 0 5 m position accuracy to validate the dem terrestrial data was sampled in transects every 200 m using a differential global positioning system dgps with high precision real time correction leuzinger and boehlich 2011 for determining the elevation accuracy in the vegetation we used these control points we calculated the mean differences between these values and the dem data lidar at the same position m sd gauge data were verified and corrected in the altitude according to weiß and sudau 2012 thus having a minimum error of less than 0 10 m the elevation data was normalized by tidal range based on the following equation n o r m a l i z e d e l e v a t i o n e l e v a t i o n m e a n l o w w a t e r t i d a l r a n g e in order to compare the elevations of the plant zones and marsh edge of sites affected by contrasting tidal range cf heuner et al 2016 ooms et al 2011 this dimensionless ratio represents mean low water as 0 and mean high water as 1 to examine the elevational differences of the marsh edges subjected to the exposure gradient we defined two proxies 1 the mean bank slope was calculated as the slope between the shallow water 2 m deeper than the mean low water and each data point using the elevations of the dem analysis of dems was conducted using arcgis 10 1 esri redlands ca usa extension 3d analyst 2 the distance from the thalweg was defined as the line with the lowest elevations and the highest current velocities in a water course it was computed as the euclidean distance from the thalweg to the marsh edge for the anabranches the thalweg was calculated using the river bathymetry toolkit a free extension for arcgis 10 1 lisenby et al 2014 mckean et al 2009 for main river channels the thalweg is congruent with the navigation channel axis which could be extracted from the digital charts of the federal waterways table b 1 because the water depth of the navigation channel 10 16 m in the elbe and weser estuaries is much smaller than half of the ship length 100 400 m gourlay 2012 waves induced by cargo vessels are usually shallow water waves and continually experience bottom friction thus the distance from navigation channel is a rough inverse proxy for the hydrodynamic impact by ship waves on vegetation ali et al 1999 2 4 statistical analyses for the marsh dataset we used the kruskal wallis rank sum test to evaluate the significance of elevational differences between plant zones we compared the elevational differences between i the species within each river class and ii the river classes for each species after detection of significant differences we ran a multiple comparison test α 0 05 using the kruskalmc algorithm giraudoux 2015 analyzing the elevational differences of the marsh edge between the elbe and weser estuary for each species and river class we used the wilcoxon signed rank test we performed this for the parameter elevation above mean high water mhw as well as for the normalized elevation to examine the effect of tidal range we presumed that the marsh edge in estuaries is often not equal to the lower limit of species occurrences governed by tidal range along the shoreline most of the marshes are young and have not yet fully expanded toward the water furthermore severe hydrodynamics locally occurring on river banks can inhibit the species reaching the lower limit in order to decrease the variation of these effects we defined the lowest elevation of species occurrence along the marsh edge as the 5th percentile of the elevational species distribution to test the relationship between tidal range and elevation kirwan and guntenspergen 2010 mckee and patrick 1988 we grouped the data points into classes of ten centimeter tidal range for each species along the elbe and weser marsh edge when a class had at least ten samples we calculated the 5th percentile of elevation in this class then we matched the linear regressions to the lowest elevation for each species using ordinary least squares for parameter estimation all analyses were performed using the r statistical computing platform version 3 3 0 r development core team 2016 3 results 3 1 elevation accuracy the elevation accuracy of the scirpus zones has a difference of 0 03 0 14 s tabernaemontani and 0 04 0 17 s maritimus the accuracy of the

obvious and significant plant zonation the zonation showed the same species formation for all river classes from the lowest to the highest elevation s tabernaemontani s maritimus p australis although s tabernaemontani and s maritimus were also significantly zoned in the marshes of the anabranches their zones overlap more than the zones on the main channels the zones on the weser main channel were significantly lower in normalized elevation fig 3b 3 3 marsh edge 3 3 1 the relationship between mean tidal range and elevation above mhw scirpus tabernaemontani s maritimus and p australis grow at lower elevation when mean tidal range increases in the target estuaries fig 4 3 3 2 the effect of tidal range on elevation comparing the elbe and weser main channel the scirpus edges differed significantly in the elevation above mhw fig 5a they were 0 5 m lower on the weser than on the elbe in contrast the scirpus edges do not differ in the elevation normalized by tidal range the phragmites edge on the elbe main channel is clearly higher than on the weser main channel which applies to both elevation parameters 3 3 3 the effect of tidal range on elevation comparing elbe and weser anabranches in comparison to the elbe anabranches only the marsh edge of s tabernaemontani along the weser anabranches was significantly lower in elevation above mhw fig 5b the normalized elevation showed that the marsh edge for all species found on the weser anabranches was significantly higher than on the elbe anabranches 3 3 4 effects of distance from the thalweg and mean bank slope

was only found 600 m 5th percentile 25th percentile 900 m from the thalweg and only when combined with a gentle bank slope the mean bank slope of phragmites edges was often more steeply inclined than the scirpus edges the marsh edge along the weser main channel was already formed at distances of 250 m 5th percentile 25th percentile 360 m from the thalweg 3 3 5 effects of distance from the thalweg and mean bank slope on the anabranches the marsh edge of the anabranches was very close to the thalweg particularly on the narrow weser anabranches cf table 1 here the marsh edges of all species were also located on more steeply inclined bank slopes 4 discussion many studies have illustrated plant zonation in response to the elevational gradient in marshes amsberry et al 2000 baldwin et al 2001 bertness and hacker 1994 castillo et al 2000a engels et al 2010 guo and pennings 2012 furthermore for navigable estuaries several studies exist which quantify the marsh extension e g castillo et al 2000b cox et al 2003 and elevation silinski et al 2016a wang and temmerman 2013 for restoration purposes knowledge of precise elevation and factors affecting the elevation is substantial and needs to be considered in estuarine management boerema and meire 2017 the findings support our expectation that both tidal range and hydrodynamic forces beside river morphology affect the elevational responses of tidal marsh plants across estuaries the detected differences in marsh elevation between elbe and weser main channels as well as between main channels and anabranches need to be considered for a successful restoration of tidal marshes 4 1 plant zones scirpus and phragmites zones are common plant zones in the freshwater and brackish parts of estuaries coops et al 1999 engels and jensen 2009 gordon et al 2011 theve 2014 wang et al 2009 zonneveld 1959 we compared the elevation zones of s tabernaemontani s maritimus and p australis between the weser and elbe estuaries fig 3 table 2 the three species exhibit the same vertical zonation fig 3a however all species zones were situated at a significantly higher normalized elevation along the elbe main channel than along the weser main channel and their anabranches when comparing the year of 1980 to the year of 2010 however low elbe marshes slowly morphed into high marshes especially in the anabranches butzeck et al 2016 this development of marsh accretion and succession is explained by the increased sediment transport due to dominance of flood flow velocity in the elbe system at the same time flow velocities in the anabranches are reduced however this argument does not elucidate the higher normalized marsh elevation along the elbe main channel we infer that the high flow velocities combined with higher frequency of vessel traffic table 1 clearly cause more exposed sites where hydrodynamics are too severe for tidal marshes on low elevations bertness 2006 carus et al 2017b the weser marshes respond to lower normalized elevations than the marshes on the elbe main channel which can be explained by the lower flood flow velocity table 1 however many banks along the inner weser main channel are protected with ripraps they prevent shore and marsh erosion which is caused by the dominance of ebb flow velocity transporting sediment downstream lange et al 2008 and are therefore not part of our analysis however the bank protections are a reason why in the inner weser estuary south west the area of scirpus and phragmites marshes have been more or less balanced since the 1990s after a strong decline after 1954 fig 37 in petersen et al 2009 steege 2007 although the hydrodynamic load caused by a single vessel passage is higher in the weser main channel due to its small channel width compared to the elbe channel peters et al 2013 this effect is negligible for the elevational response of the target species based on our findings fig 3b the plant zonation along the anabranches exhibits similar elevations these patterns indicate a comparable effect of low flow velocities on the response of plant zonation even though the flow velocities between elbe and weser anabranches clearly differ table 1 from the main channel flood dominated currents transported more sediments loosened by dredging activities into the anabranches which are characterized by lower flow velocities bfg 2014 butzeck et al 2016 küste und raum nlwkn 2012 here the sediment accretion increased resulting in marsh extension butzeck et al 2016 petersen et al 2009 an increase of s tabernaemontani was even observed on the weser anabranches petersen et al 2009 the zonation of s tabernaemontani and s maritimus along the elbe and weser anabranches exhibited a stronger overlap than along the main channels fig 3 even though the elevational gradient often shows clear plant zones niche overlap is also a common phenomenon in marshes e g moffett et al 2010 russell et al 1985 these patterns of niche overlap need to be researched further while taking into account hydrodynamic forces and biotic factors see mcintire and fajardo 2014 pielou and routledge 1976 xu et al 2007 4 2 marsh edge the elevational range of our gis data fig 5 is consistent with in situ data e g of the edge of s maritimus in the elbe carus and schröder 2014 and schelde estuary silinski et al 2016a comparing the elevation above mhw and the elevation normalized by tidal range our findings demonstrate that the tidal range has a considerable effect on the elevational variation of the marsh edge in the elbe and weser estuaries this is also supported by the lowest elevation of the species occurrence the higher the tidal range the lower the elevational threshold of species occurrence fig 4 this result is in line with the relationship found for spartina alterniflora along the atlantic and gulf coast found by mckee and patrick 1988 balke et al 2016 verified also for the german dutch coast that tidal range correlates negatively with the lowest elevation of pioneer vegetation however for the same tidal range of 3 m our estuarine species was settled 0 5 m lower in the tidal frame than the coastal species this could result from a decrease in porewater salinity in the estuaries compared to the coast in fact when porewater salinity is low marsh plants can settle on lower elevation in the elbe estuary and be inundated for a longer time carus et al 2017a the tidal range will rise along with the regional sea level slr in the near future 2030 2049 because mhw will increase at a greater rate than mlw hein et al 2014 in this case our results suggest that the regional slr will cause a slight lateral expansion in the two estuaries an increase of tidal range due to river deepening is often not only characterized by an increase of mhw but also by a decrease of mlw subsequently the area below the marsh edge is inundated later and dries up earlier the inundation stress is therefore diminished at these positions lowest possible elevation where pioneers are able to settle butzeck et al 2016 thus marsh vegetation with rhizomes can expand toward the water lateral expansion with the assumption that the hydrodynamic force will not increase the lateral expansion is often combined with vertical accretion orson et al 1985 particularly in more flood dominated estuaries than the elbe estuary which promotes the net import of sediment into the estuary friedrichs and perry 2001 seiffert and hesser 2014 however at exposed sites the relation between elevation and expansion rate is less strong due to wave impact silinski et al 2016a channel and bank morphology also affect the elevation of the marsh edge in contrast to the elbe main channel the more steeply inclined banks and lower marsh to channel thalweg distances along the weser main channel can be explained by the lower flow volumes relative to the channel cross sectional area and the transport frequency table 1 fig 6 although the edges of s maritimus did not differ in elevation between the weser and elbe main channel fig 5a they showed a contrasting slope pattern typical for sheltered versus exposed sites on the scheldt estuary at sheltered sites marshes are able to grow on more steeply inclined slopes than at exposed sites silinski et al 2016a the marsh edge of p australis along the main elbe channel was found at a significantly higher normalized elevation than along the other river classes this finding was supported by the positive relationship between the elevational distribution of p australis and the mean bank slope of the elbe main channel fig 6 which is comparable to other studies of p australis coops and van der velde 1996 keddy 1983 this species establishes in the high marsh and can expand via rhizomes into lower marshes amsberry et al 2000 thus p australis is able to create the marsh edge at low elevations figs 5 and 6 in case of either 1 low hydrodynamic stress on tidal flats cf weser main channel anabranches table 1 or 2 gently inclined long bank slopes reducing hydrodynamic stress if the slope is too steeply inclined e g due to erosion or due to a continuous sedimentation see introduction p australis will only form the marsh edge at high elevation where the hydrodynamic stress dissipates as described for the elbe main channel fig 6 as an ecosystem engineer p australis significantly increases the sediment accretion rates chambers et al 2003 and therefore controls the bank slope thus it is an active player in the sedimentation erosion loop on tidal banks regarding the elbe anabranches the marsh edge of all species expanded to lower elevations due to more gently inclined bank slopes figs 5b and 6 in contrast the higher marsh edge on the weser anabranches is linked to more steeply inclined banks and to the short distance from the thalweg this is probably due to a narrower and shallower shape as well as the significantly lower flow velocities than those on the elbe anabranches table 1 low flow velocities often result in the accretion of clay particles affecting the bank slope these different characteristics indicate that the interactions between shoreline morphology sediment characteristics elevational variation of marsh edge and hydrodynamics in anabranches are diverse 4 3 deriving a conceptual model we determined the elevational distributions of plant zones figs 2b1 and 3 on regularly flooded estuarine marshes and quantified the lowest elevation as an important niche boundary figs 4 6 which reflects the resistance against physical stress balke et al 2016 callaghan et al 2010 van wesenbeeck et al 2007 at the marsh edge where the stress is highest competition is often absent as only disturbance tolerant plants can establish while using a window of opportunity when physical stress is low balke et al 2014 silinski et al 2016b when inundation stress e g bockelmann and neuhaus 1999 morzaria luna and zedler 2014 or mechanical stress e g van wesenbeeck 2007 is constantly low plant competition increases in regularly flooded marshes this trade off between resistance against physical stress and the competitive ability of marsh plants can be explained by the conceptual competitive hierarchy model bertness and penning 2000 keddy 2001 malanson 1997 even though competitive hierarchy is usually investigated experimentally we should not lose sight of large scale patterns keddy 2003 being aware that the temporal scale strongly correlates with elevation driving competition and succession processes we set up a conceptual model of the realized niche spaces spanned by two hydrodynamic stress gradients on a spatial scale fig 7 the occurring niche overlaps of s tabernaemontani s maritimus and p australis were demonstrated within one estuarine river section fig 7c and for different estuarine systems fig 7d our model presumes that the number of plant zones increases with higher tidal fluvial stress as well as with higher exposure stress energized by the tidal fluvial fluxes furthermore the model suggests that hydrodynamic stress weakens the competitive hierarchy causing stress resistant species to become dominant that is why p australis excluded the other species s maritimus and s tabernaemontani 1 landwards at the benign end of the vertical stress gradient carus et al 2017a or 2 when the shoreline experiences less hydrodynamic stress and the zonation will consequently disappear figs 2b2 and 7b c this inference is in line with the trade off between stress resistance and competitive dominance found for the hydrodynamic gradient of coastal salt marshes as described by van wesenbeeck et al 2007 they acknowledged that dominant species are restricted by severe hydrodynamic forces therefore competitive exclusion occurs where hydrodynamic forces are low nevertheless the dominant species competitive ability does not change whereas the competitive strength of a c strategist decreases with increasing hydrodynamic stress cf emery et al 2001 engels 2010 our findings show that both tidal range and hydrodynamic forces affect the elevational responses of tidal marsh plants across dredged estuaries how tidal range and hydrodynamic forces directly affect the species competitive hierarchy and therefore the numbers of plant zones in these estuaries requires transplantation experiments on sheltered and exposed tidal flats 5 conclusion our study illustrates the different elevational responses of regularly flooded marsh plants in dredged estuaries our findings indicate that these differences result not only from contrasting tidal range but also from different hydrodynamics due to the history of dredging diversely shaped channel and bank morphologies as well as unequal vessel frequencies we show that tidal range in particular has an effect on the elevation of the marsh edge in these dynamic systems however unravelling the overlapping effects of two major determinants changing tidal range climate change and river deepening remains a challenge permanent maintenance measures such as dredging make this effort even more difficult our study also demonstrates that there is a clear difference between the elevation above mhw and the normalized elevation in this context it is important to use the normalized elevation when comparing sites with contrasting tidal ranges instead of using the elevation in relation to just one water level our results are useful when choosing suitable elevations when restoring tidal marshes with scirpus and phragmites species furthermore the findings might inspire biologists to reconsider the reference plant zonation when emergent macrophytes serve as biological quality elements in european estuaries cf directive 200 60 ec 2000 nlwkn 2015 scholle and jaklin 2014 the zonation is used as an additional criterion for

1132,many studies have illustrated the elevational gradient of plant zonation in estuarine marshes nevertheless little is known about the elevational patterns of plant zones and marsh edge existing along deepened navigation channels compared to their shallow anabranches our study analyzed the factors controlling these patterns this knowledge is required when restoring tidal marshes to compensate for anthropogenic impacts we determined the species elevation pattern in the navigable german elbe and weser estuaries using the key species scirpus tabernaemontani scirpus maritimus and phragmites australis we compared 1 marshes along navigation channels and anabranches and 2 their marsh edges 3 additionally we tested how tidal range affects the lowest elevation of marsh edges we analyzed data derived from digital vegetation maps and digital elevation models and then normalized the elevation data using the mean tidal range we determined the elevational distributions of plant zones on regularly flooded estuarine marshes and quantified the lowest elevation as an important niche boundary which reflects the resistance against physical stress our findings indicate that the patterns result not only from tidal range but also from hydrodynamics due to the dredging history diversely shaped channels bank morphologies and vessel frequencies the patterns found and the species specific elevations need to be considered when choosing suitable elevations when restoring tidal marshes in dredged estuaries the results might also inspire reconsidering the reference plants zonation while

introduction the elevational gradient is a well known indicator for explaining vegetation zonation in regularly flooded marshes e g coops et al 1999 keddy 2010 it indicates that inundation stress and hydrodynamic stress decreases when surface elevation increases coops and van der velde 1996 pennings and callaway 1992 sanchez et al 1996 therefore it is defined as an integrative proxy for tidal inundation and hydrodynamic forces bertness 2006 the relationship between the elevation of the marsh surface and local water level determines the frequency and duration of tidal inundation montalto and steenhuis 2004 thus this hydroperiod regime governs the creation of niches for different plant species foti et al 2012 they often form conspicuous plant zonation landwards of the marsh edge adams 1963 bockelmann et al 2002 engels and jensen 2010 which is characterized by an abrupt transition from low bare flats to higher elevation vegetated marshes wang and temmerman 2013 beside biotic determinants such as competition e g wilson and keddy 1986 the emergence of different habitat zones is determined by a hydrodynamic stress gradient silinski et al 2016a van wesenbeeck 2007 wang and temmerman 2013 regularly flooded marsh plants form monocultures where flow velocity is low bertness 1988 greiner la peyre et al 2001 van wesenbeeck et al 2007 phragmites australis for instance can dominate across the elevation zones so that plant zonation is absent e g coops and van der velde 1996 weak correlation between the elevational gradient and plant zonation exists on broader marshes and marsh plains kim 2014 where gradients of physical stress become inconsistent bockelmann et al 2002 costa et al 2003 silvestri et al 2005 nevertheless in regularly flooded marshes elevational zones of plants are closely related to inundation frequency bockelmann et al 2002 white and madsen 2016 and groundwater wilson et al 2015 tidal range can also directly affect the variability of plant zones orson et al 1985 exposed to higher tidal ranges low parts of tidal flats are inundated at a later point in time and become dry early in the same period of time as lower tidal ranges are acting upon vegetation there inundation stress is therefore diminished on these flats and plants are able to grow at lower elevations balke et al 2016 mckee and patrick 1988 that is why marshes exposed to higher tidal range are deemed to be more resilient to sea level rise than marshes affected by low tidal range kirwan and guntenspergen 2010 additionally a higher tidal range often triggers higher rates of vertical accretion provided that the sediment supply is sufficient kirwan et al 2016 rogers et al 2006 with the increasing tidal range the elevational range of the lowest marsh zones increases since other stress factors such as high hydrodynamic forces or salinity can still impede the expansion of the marsh edge to lower elevations carus et al 2017a the tidal fluvial gradient and the exposure gradient result from water motions that are triggered by tide gravity different water densities and wave inducing drivers such as wind and shipping movements the tidal fluvial gradient is formed by non linear interactions of tidal energy fluxes and fluvial energy fluxes jay et al 1990 while tidal energy fluxes are generated by the tides fluvial energy fluxes are created by the surface discharge decreasing toward the sea these fluxes determine the characteristic river geomorphology the tidal inundation and flow velocities moreover they affect the hydrodynamic forces resulting from shipping and cargo traffic at low tide for instance shipping induced waves have a lower impact on shorelines and marsh plants than at high tide the exposure gradient is determined by the magnitude of the tidal fluvial energy exposure is defined as the entire effect of waves on shorelines and vegetation keddy 1982 the mechanical wave energy and the resulting current velocities directly affect vegetation by removing biomass and uprooting seedlings coops et al 1991 keddy 1983 additionally the vegetation is indirectly influenced by erosion or sediment deposition keddy 1983 these effects are correlated with sediment characteristics as well as the inclination and length of the slope which affect wave and flow attenuation e g bouma et al 2009 marani et al 2013 möller and spencer 2002 for example vegetation along anabranches as well as along the main channel far away from shipping traffic and or with a long gentle slope is likely to suffer less from mechanical stress than exposed sites near navigation channels silinski et al 2015 and on steep slopes in navigable estuaries the tidal fluvial gradient and the exposure gradient have undergone enormous alterations over the last two centuries building embankments and taking land from estuaries for agriculture the intertidal and flooding areas diminished atwater et al 1979 doody 2004 temmerman et al 2013 the channels were dredged to provide a deeper and wider waterway for cargo vessels needed by an emerging industry blott et al 2006 pye and blott 2014 van der wal et al 2002 these human activities caused an increase of tidal prism water volume and a decrease of channel roughness which results in higher tidal fluvial energy and therefore accelerates the current velocities cox et al 2003 kerner 2007 velocities tend to be higher on flood than on ebb causing the tide to rise faster than it falls this tidal asymmetry is defined as flood dominated fortunato and oliveira 2005 ongoing deepening of the channel increases flood dominance of tidal currents and decreases the river s flushing capacity winterwerp and wang 2013 large amounts of fine sediments would accumulate in the inner estuary da silva and duck 2001 li et al 2014 townend et al 2011 in contrast dredged estuaries or parts of them can also be ebb dominant i e have short ebb duration but higher maximum ebb flow velocities lange et al 2008 van der wal et al 2002 in this case sediment is transported downstream and the risk of shore and marsh erosion is high substantial revetments lange et al 2008 and bank nourishment helped to prevent this erosion in the past bfg 2014 lange et al 2008 the tidal asymmetry can vary spatially and temporally depending on the amount of discharge guo et al 2014 and the extent of tidal flats fortunato and oliveira 2005 both feed back to the sedimentation erosion processes which therefore vary as well van maren and winterwerp 2013 marsh dynamics are the result of complex interactions among hydrodynamics sediment transport and biology townend et al 2011 the altered hydro and morphodynamics clearly impact the vegetation zonation on marshes cox et al 2003 low marshes with pioneer species are rare butzeck et al 2016 da silva and duck 2001 hartig et al 2002 because high tides reaching the edge of the fringing marshes increase the risk of erosion cox et al 2003 van der wal and pye 2004 marsh edges exposed to navigational channels clearly suffer higher erosion rates browne 2017 gain of marshes is also reported in areas where sedimentation has taken place e g in anabranches or on hydrological regulated tidal flats more sedimentation can also lead to steeper slopes causing marsh edges to become more exposed to waves coops et al 1999 as a consequence intertidal scirpus stands diminish whereas species of higher marshes such as phragmites australis expand butzeck et al 2016 coops et al 1999 petersen et al 2009 this forms part of vegetation succession from a low marsh pioneer vegetation toward a high marsh vegetation butzeck et al 2016 comparing marshes in navigable estuaries past studies have quantified changes in marsh morphology but have not considered elevation butzeck et al 2016 cox et al 2003 or species zonation wang and temmerman 2013 on a local scale though spatial patterns resulting from hydrodynamic stress were quantified carus et al 2017a silinski et al 2016a van wesenbeeck 2007 these investigations however cannot spatially transfer to other parts of the estuary moreover there are very few analyses that look at the ecosystem as a whole friess et al 2012 moffett et al 2015 although this is indispensable in the context of estuarine management to compensate for historical damage and negative impacts of human actions remaining estuarine natural structures and their functioning need to be maintained and promoted at the same time economic development should not be disturbed boerema and meire 2017 effectively restoring and thereby creating marsh habitats for sedimentation erosion dynamics means enlarging water storage and friction lowering inland storm surges and enhancing biodiversity temmerman et al 2013 therefore more extensive knowledge is needed on how plant zones respond to elevation in regularly flooded marshes after years of dredging estuarine channels the difference between the main channel and its anabranches became more significant since estuaries shift from a multi channel to a single channel system due to dredging stark et al 2017 we already know that plants zones differ in elevation relative to mean high water when comparing estuaries and deep navigation channels with shallow anabranches heuner et al 2016 however we still do not know if these differences are only due to a contrasting tidal range or if they can also be contributed to contrasting hydrodynamic forces the positioning of the marsh edge in relation to elevation also depends on hydrodynamic forces carus et al 2017a thus we expect that the elevational responses of marsh plants would also differ between the estuaries their deepened navigation channels and their shallow anabranches when we normalize the elevation by tidal range mean low water 0 mean high water 1 if so these differences need to be considered when restoring tidal marshes because restoration sites should be diligently selected on the basis of suitable elevations temmerman et al 2013 to verify these differences our objectives are 1 to determine how plant zones vary in normalized elevation across estuaries 2 how tidal range affects the lowest elevation of estuarine marsh edges and 3 how the marsh edge differs in normalized elevation and bank exposure between shallow anabranches and the deep main channels navigable for sea going vessels 2 material and methods 2 1 studied species tidal flats and marshes along the elbe and weser estuaries were lost due to embankment and damming of tributaries since the 19th century elbe 140 km² 25 weser 40 km² 9 butzeck et al 2016 hamer et al 2013 thus in the 21st century regularly flooded marshes are restricted to narrow ribbons along north sea estuaries often not broader than 200 500 m as a result vegetation zonation is less diverse and usually very distinct with few habitat shaping emergent macrophytes engels and jensen 2009 phragmites australis cav trin ex steud scirpus maritimus l palla and scirpus tabernaemontani c c gmel palla syn scirpus

they are also found below mean high water especially in freshwater marshes markus michalczyk et al 2014 markus michalczyk 2014 phragmites australis and both scirpus species are clonal grasses with horizontal rhizomes runners forming monospecific stands in estuarine marshes due to lateral expansion of the rhizomes cp silinski et al 2016a the hollow shoots of p australis reach a height of 1 4 m

estuaries elbe and weser discharge into the german bight of the north sea the pore water salinity ranged from freshwater to brackish water with salinity up to around 4 5 psu carus et al 2017a heuner et al 2012 since these waterways are used for international cargo transport the navigation channel of the two estuaries were widened and deepened several times the tidal range has doubled over the past two centuries appendix a variance and magnitude of the mean tidal range differ between the estuaries table 1 appendix b weser and elbe have been classified as upper meso to lower macro tidal estuaries kappenberg and grabemann 2001 masselink and hughes 2003 fig 1 in contrast to tidal range many other properties such as river discharge depth width volume and current velocities are weaker in the weser than in the elbe estuary table 1 these estuaries are notably affected not only by natural hydrodynamics such as wind induced waves anabranches and main channels fig 2a but also by wakes main channels only the elbe main channel witnessed higher transport frequencies vessel passages and vessels coming into port as well as bigger vessel sizes and drafts than the weser main channel table 1 however the maximum drawdown and the ship induced wave heights in both estuaries were similar as a consequence the river cross section vessel draft proportion for the weser main channel was smaller than for the elbe main channel thus the passage of a single vessel had a higher impact on the banks of the weser main channel this higher navigation effect on the banks was also reflected by a higher percentage of artificial bank reinforcement table 1 bare stone fillings on more steeply inclined bank slopes were the most predominant bank reinforcements but groynes and longitudinal structures such as breakwaters were also found between marsh edge and flood embankments the elbe estuary featured 57 km² of marshland 2009 while the weser estuary covered 48 km² 2008 thirty five percent of the weser marshes and 55 of the elbe marshes were in a natural state and not used as arable land or grassland the species s tabernaemontani s maritimus and p australis often zoned fig 2b1 covered 23 of the total weser marsh in 2008 and 26 of the total elbe marsh in 2009 they also formed the marsh edge in the study area of the elbe estuary it was 130 km long 30 s tabernaemontani 37 s maritimus 33 p australis the weser marsh edge was 90 km long 11 s tabernaemontani 15 s maritimus and 74 p australis phragmites australis is dominant along the marsh edge of the anabranches of the elbe as well as along the entire weser estuary fig 2b2 whereas s maritimus dominates the marsh edge of the main elbe river 2 3 study design and digital data because tidal and fluvial fluxes channel extents and navigation characteristics differ between the estuaries and between main channels and anabranches table 1 we have categorized four river classes elbe main channel elbe anabranches weser main channel weser anabranches to distinguish main channel and anabranches on each stream island fig 2a its area above mean low water was used to calculate a centerline fig 2c1 this divides the area into the classes main channel and anabranches each river class was split into the classes marsh and marsh edge the class marsh was created in order to analyze the elevations of the plant zones question 1 the class marsh edge was defined for the examination of the effect of tidal range on the elevation of the marsh edge question 2 and the elevational difference of the marsh edge question 3 depending on the exposure gradient each class comprised areas of s tabernaemontani s maritimus and p australis verified by digital vegetation maps petersen et al 2010 they were also used for data sampling the vegetation maps also including bare tidal flats were generated on the basis of aerial photographs with a ground resolution of 0 25 m these photos were geometrically corrected using the data of the global positioning system and the inertial navigation system of the aircraft gps ins the photos were ortho rectified based on of a digital elevation model dem including elevation data of bare tidal flats and streets petersen et al 2006 the orthophotos were automatically classified and revised manually on the screen by the vegetation experts who worked on the training areas in the field petersen et al 2010 they were thoroughly verified in the field particularly for areas with uncertainties during the revision the vegetation maps have a very high accuracy regarding geometrical locations less than 2 m boundary uncertainties and with regard to assignments of reeds and sedges correct classification rate approximately 99 verified by petersen et al 2010 the analyzed species areas representing monospecific stands amounted to almost 100 vegetation cover after the vegetation had been separated from tidal flats by the infrared signature vegetation pixels were merged by a multilevel raster based neighborhood filtering 5 5 9 9 pixels petersen et al 2010 every vegetation patch larger than 2 5 m² was classified as vegetation smaller than 2 5 m² as tidal flat due to the boundary uncertainty of less than 2 m the boundary of the marsh edge was compared visually with the aerial imagery and corrected where necessary for each river class we generated 70 random data points for the areas of each species belonging to the class marsh as well as to the class marsh edge these data points represent the presence of the species additionally we defined the following sample conditions fig 2c2 1 the minimum sampling distance was 50 m 2 the minimum distance between data points of the classes marsh and marsh edge was 2 m to avoid sampling bias due to modified hydrodynamic forces 3 the data points have a minimum distance of 10 m to groynes 4 and areas protected by breakwaters or ripraps were excluded from sampling in a geographical information system gis see table b 1 we extracted the elevation above mhw for each data point using a dem this included bathymetry echo sound data as well as gauge data from both elbe and weser estuaries the high resolution dem was produced on the basis of lidar light detection and ranging data recorded in winter 1 m grid 0 5 m position accuracy to validate the dem terrestrial data was sampled in transects every 200 m using a differential global positioning system dgps with high precision real time correction leuzinger and boehlich 2011 for determining the elevation accuracy in the vegetation we used these control points we calculated the mean differences between these values and the dem data lidar at the same position m sd gauge data were verified and corrected in the altitude according to weiß and sudau 2012 thus having a minimum error of less than 0 10 m the elevation data was normalized by tidal range based on the following equation n o r m a l i z e d e l e v a t i o n e l e v a t i o n m e a n l o w w a t e r t i d a l r a n g e in order to compare the elevations of the plant zones and marsh edge of sites affected by contrasting tidal range cf heuner et al 2016 ooms et al 2011 this dimensionless ratio represents mean low water as 0 and mean high water as 1 to examine the elevational differences of the marsh edges subjected to the exposure gradient we defined two proxies 1 the mean bank slope was calculated as the slope between the shallow water 2 m deeper than the mean low water and each data point using the elevations of the dem analysis of dems was conducted using arcgis 10 1 esri redlands ca usa extension 3d analyst 2 the distance from the thalweg was defined as the line with the lowest elevations and the highest current velocities in a water course it was computed as the euclidean distance from the thalweg to the marsh edge for the anabranches the thalweg was calculated using the river bathymetry toolkit a free extension for arcgis 10 1 lisenby et al 2014 mckean et al 2009 for main river channels the thalweg is congruent with the navigation channel axis which could be extracted from the digital charts of the federal waterways table b 1 because the water depth of the navigation channel 10 16 m in the elbe and weser estuaries is much smaller than half of the ship length 100 400 m gourlay 2012 waves induced by cargo vessels are usually shallow water waves and continually experience bottom friction thus the distance from navigation channel is a rough inverse proxy for the hydrodynamic impact by ship waves on vegetation ali et al 1999 2 4 statistical analyses for the marsh dataset we used the kruskal wallis rank sum test to evaluate the significance of elevational differences between plant zones we compared the elevational differences between i the species within each river class and ii the river classes for each species after detection of significant differences we ran a multiple comparison test α 0 05 using the kruskalmc algorithm giraudoux 2015 analyzing the elevational differences of the marsh edge between the elbe and weser estuary for each species and river class we used the wilcoxon signed rank test we performed this for the parameter elevation above mean high water mhw as well as for the normalized elevation to examine the effect of tidal range we presumed that the marsh edge in estuaries is often not equal to the lower limit of species occurrences governed by tidal range along the shoreline most of the marshes are young and have not yet fully expanded toward the water furthermore severe hydrodynamics locally occurring on river banks can inhibit the species reaching the lower limit in order to decrease the variation of these effects we defined the lowest elevation of species occurrence along the marsh edge as the 5th percentile of the elevational species distribution to test the relationship between tidal range and elevation kirwan and guntenspergen 2010 mckee and patrick 1988 we grouped the data points into classes of ten centimeter tidal range for each species along the elbe and weser marsh edge when a class had at least ten samples we calculated the 5th percentile of elevation in this class then we matched the linear regressions to the lowest elevation for each species using ordinary least squares for parameter estimation all analyses were performed using the r statistical computing platform version 3 3 0 r development core team 2016 3 results 3 1 elevation accuracy the elevation accuracy of the scirpus zones has a difference of 0 03 0 14 s tabernaemontani and 0 04 0 17 s maritimus the accuracy of the

obvious and significant plant zonation the zonation showed the same species formation for all river classes from the lowest to the highest elevation s tabernaemontani s maritimus p australis although s tabernaemontani and s maritimus were also significantly zoned in the marshes of the anabranches their zones overlap more than the zones on the main channels the zones on the weser main channel were significantly lower in normalized elevation fig 3b 3 3 marsh edge 3 3 1 the relationship between mean tidal range and elevation above mhw scirpus tabernaemontani s maritimus and p australis grow at lower elevation when mean tidal range increases in the target estuaries fig 4 3 3 2 the effect of tidal range on elevation comparing the elbe and weser main channel the scirpus edges differed significantly in the elevation above mhw fig 5a they were 0 5 m lower on the weser than on the elbe in contrast the scirpus edges do not differ in the elevation normalized by tidal range the phragmites edge on the elbe main channel is clearly higher than on the weser main channel which applies to both elevation parameters 3 3 3 the effect of tidal range on elevation comparing elbe and weser anabranches in comparison to the elbe anabranches only the marsh edge of s tabernaemontani along the weser anabranches was significantly lower in elevation above mhw fig 5b the normalized elevation showed that the marsh edge for all species found on the weser anabranches was significantly higher than on the elbe anabranches 3 3 4 effects of distance from the thalweg and mean bank slope on the main channels while the distance from the elbe thalweg to the shoreline was less than 300 m e g lühesand island 9 36 36 e 53 35 13 n or twielenflether sand 9 33 30 e 53 37 17 n marsh vegetation was only found 600 m 5th percentile 25th percentile 900 m from the thalweg and only when combined with a gentle bank slope the mean bank slope of phragmites edges was often more steeply inclined than the scirpus edges the marsh edge along the weser main channel was already formed at distances of 250 m 5th percentile 25th percentile 360 m from the thalweg 3 3 5 effects of distance from the thalweg and mean bank slope on the anabranches the marsh edge of the anabranches was very close to the thalweg particularly on the narrow weser anabranches cf table 1 here the marsh edges of all species were also located on more steeply inclined bank slopes 4 discussion many studies have illustrated plant zonation in response to the elevational gradient in marshes amsberry et al 2000 baldwin et al 2001 bertness and hacker 1994 castillo et al 2000a engels et al 2010 guo and pennings 2012 furthermore for navigable estuaries several studies exist which quantify the marsh extension e g castillo et al 2000b cox et al 2003 and elevation silinski et al 2016a wang and temmerman 2013 for restoration purposes knowledge of precise elevation and factors affecting the elevation is substantial and needs to be considered in estuarine management boerema and meire 2017 the findings support our expectation that both tidal range and hydrodynamic forces beside river morphology affect the elevational responses of tidal marsh plants across estuaries the detected differences in marsh elevation between elbe and weser main channels as well as between main channels and anabranches need to be considered for a successful restoration of tidal marshes 4 1 plant zones scirpus and phragmites zones are common plant zones in the freshwater and brackish parts of estuaries coops et al 1999 engels and jensen 2009 gordon et al 2011 theve 2014 wang et al 2009 zonneveld 1959 we compared the elevation zones of s tabernaemontani s maritimus and p australis between the weser and elbe estuaries fig 3 table 2 the three species exhibit the same vertical zonation fig 3a however all species zones were situated at a significantly higher normalized elevation along the elbe main channel than along the weser main channel and their anabranches when comparing the year of 1980 to the year of 2010 however low elbe marshes slowly morphed into high marshes especially in the anabranches butzeck et al 2016 this development of marsh accretion and succession is explained by the increased sediment transport due to dominance of flood flow velocity in the elbe system at the same time flow velocities in the anabranches are reduced however this argument does not elucidate the higher normalized marsh elevation along the elbe main channel we infer that the high flow velocities combined with higher frequency of vessel traffic table 1 clearly cause more exposed sites where hydrodynamics are too severe for tidal marshes on low elevations bertness 2006 carus et al 2017b the weser marshes respond to lower normalized elevations than the marshes on the elbe main channel which can be explained by the lower flood flow velocity table 1 however many banks along the inner weser main channel are protected with ripraps they prevent shore and marsh erosion which is caused by the dominance of ebb flow velocity transporting sediment downstream lange et al 2008 and are therefore not part of our analysis however the bank protections are a reason why in the inner weser estuary south west the area of scirpus and phragmites marshes have been more or less balanced since the 1990s after a strong decline after 1954 fig 37 in petersen et al 2009 steege 2007 although the hydrodynamic load caused by a single vessel passage is higher in the weser main channel due to its small channel width compared to the elbe channel peters et al 2013 this effect is negligible for the elevational response of the target species based on our findings fig 3b the plant zonation along the anabranches exhibits similar elevations these patterns indicate a comparable effect of low flow velocities on the response of plant zonation even though the flow velocities between elbe and weser anabranches clearly differ table 1 from the main channel flood dominated currents transported more sediments loosened by dredging activities into the anabranches which are characterized by lower flow velocities bfg 2014 butzeck et al 2016 küste und raum nlwkn 2012 here the sediment accretion increased resulting in marsh extension butzeck et al 2016 petersen et al 2009 an increase of s tabernaemontani was even observed on the weser anabranches petersen et al 2009 the zonation of s tabernaemontani and s maritimus along the elbe and weser anabranches exhibited a stronger overlap than along the main channels fig 3 even though the elevational gradient often shows clear plant zones niche overlap is also a common phenomenon in marshes e g moffett et al 2010 russell et al 1985 these patterns of niche overlap need to be researched further while taking into account hydrodynamic forces and biotic factors see mcintire and fajardo 2014 pielou and routledge 1976 xu et al 2007 4 2 marsh edge the elevational range of our gis data fig 5 is consistent with in situ data e g of the edge of s maritimus in the elbe carus and schröder 2014 and schelde estuary silinski et al 2016a comparing the elevation above mhw and the elevation normalized by tidal range our findings demonstrate that the tidal range has a considerable effect on the elevational variation of the marsh edge in the elbe and weser estuaries this is also supported by the lowest elevation of the species occurrence the higher the tidal range the lower the elevational threshold of species occurrence fig 4 this result is in line with the relationship found for spartina alterniflora along the atlantic and gulf coast found by mckee and patrick 1988 balke et al 2016 verified also for the german dutch coast that tidal range correlates negatively with the lowest elevation of pioneer vegetation however for the same tidal range of 3 m our estuarine species was settled 0 5 m lower in the tidal frame than the coastal species this could result from a decrease in porewater salinity in the estuaries compared to the coast in fact when porewater salinity is low marsh plants can settle on lower elevation in the elbe estuary and be inundated for a longer time carus et al 2017a the tidal range will rise along with the regional sea level slr in the near future 2030 2049 because mhw will increase at a greater rate than mlw hein et al 2014 in this case our results suggest that the regional slr will cause a slight lateral expansion in the two estuaries an increase of tidal range due to river deepening is often not only characterized by an increase of mhw but also by a decrease of mlw subsequently the area below the marsh edge is inundated later and dries up earlier the inundation stress is therefore diminished at these positions lowest possible elevation where pioneers are able to settle butzeck et al 2016 thus marsh vegetation with rhizomes can expand toward the water lateral expansion with the assumption that the hydrodynamic force will not increase the lateral expansion is often combined with vertical accretion orson et al 1985 particularly in more flood dominated estuaries than the elbe estuary which promotes the net import of sediment into the estuary friedrichs and perry 2001 seiffert and hesser 2014 however at exposed sites the relation between elevation and expansion rate is less strong due to wave impact silinski et al 2016a channel and bank morphology also affect the elevation of the marsh edge in contrast to the elbe main channel the more steeply inclined banks and lower marsh to channel thalweg distances along the weser main channel can be explained by the lower flow volumes relative to the channel cross sectional area and the transport frequency table 1 fig 6 although the edges of s maritimus did not differ in elevation between the weser and elbe main channel fig 5a they showed a contrasting slope pattern typical for sheltered versus exposed sites on the scheldt estuary at sheltered sites marshes are able to grow on more steeply inclined slopes than at exposed sites silinski et al 2016a the marsh edge of p australis along the main elbe channel was found at a significantly higher normalized elevation than along the other river classes this finding was supported by the positive relationship between the elevational distribution of p australis and the mean bank slope of the elbe main channel fig 6 which is comparable to other studies of p australis coops and van der velde 1996 keddy 1983 this species establishes in the high marsh and can expand via rhizomes into lower marshes amsberry et al 2000 thus p australis is able to create the marsh edge at low elevations figs 5 and 6 in case of either 1 low hydrodynamic stress on tidal flats cf weser main channel anabranches table 1 or 2 gently inclined long bank slopes reducing hydrodynamic stress if the slope is too steeply inclined e g due to erosion or due to a continuous sedimentation see introduction p australis will only form the marsh edge at high elevation where the hydrodynamic stress dissipates as described for the elbe main channel fig 6 as an ecosystem engineer p australis significantly increases the sediment accretion rates chambers et al 2003 and therefore controls the bank slope thus it is an active player in the sedimentation erosion loop on tidal banks regarding the elbe anabranches the marsh edge of all species expanded to lower elevations due to more gently inclined bank slopes figs 5b and 6 in contrast the higher marsh edge on the weser anabranches is linked to more steeply inclined banks and to the short distance from the thalweg this is probably due to a narrower and shallower shape as well as the significantly lower flow velocities than those on the elbe anabranches table 1 low flow velocities often result in the accretion of clay particles affecting the bank slope these different characteristics indicate that the interactions between shoreline morphology sediment characteristics elevational variation of marsh edge and hydrodynamics in anabranches are diverse 4 3 deriving a conceptual model we determined the elevational distributions of plant zones figs 2b1 and 3 on regularly flooded estuarine marshes and quantified the lowest elevation as an important niche boundary figs 4 6 which reflects the resistance against physical stress balke et al 2016 callaghan et al 2010 van wesenbeeck et al 2007 at the marsh edge where the stress is highest competition is often absent as only disturbance tolerant plants can establish while using a window of opportunity when physical stress is low balke et al 2014 silinski et al 2016b when inundation stress e g bockelmann and neuhaus 1999 morzaria luna and zedler 2014 or mechanical stress e g van wesenbeeck 2007 is constantly low plant competition increases in regularly flooded marshes this trade off between resistance against physical stress and the competitive ability of marsh plants can be explained by the conceptual competitive hierarchy model bertness and penning 2000 keddy 2001 malanson 1997 even though competitive hierarchy is usually investigated experimentally we should not lose sight of large scale patterns keddy 2003 being aware that the temporal scale strongly correlates with elevation driving competition and succession processes we set up a conceptual model of the realized niche spaces spanned by two hydrodynamic stress gradients on a spatial scale fig 7 the occurring niche overlaps of s tabernaemontani s maritimus and p australis were demonstrated within one estuarine river section fig 7c and for different estuarine systems fig 7d our model presumes that the number of plant zones increases with higher tidal fluvial stress as well as with higher exposure stress energized by the tidal fluvial fluxes furthermore the model suggests that hydrodynamic stress weakens the competitive hierarchy causing stress resistant species to become dominant that is why p australis excluded the other species s maritimus and s tabernaemontani 1 landwards at the benign end of the vertical stress gradient carus et al 2017a or 2 when the shoreline experiences less hydrodynamic stress and the zonation will consequently disappear figs 2b2 and 7b c this inference is in line with the trade off between stress resistance and competitive dominance found for the hydrodynamic gradient of coastal salt marshes as described by van wesenbeeck et al 2007 they acknowledged that dominant species are restricted by severe hydrodynamic forces therefore competitive exclusion occurs where hydrodynamic forces are low nevertheless the dominant species competitive ability does not change whereas the competitive strength of a c strategist decreases with increasing hydrodynamic stress cf emery et al 2001 engels 2010 our findings show that both tidal range and hydrodynamic forces affect the elevational responses of tidal marsh plants across dredged estuaries how tidal range and hydrodynamic forces directly affect the species competitive hierarchy and therefore the numbers of plant zones in these estuaries requires transplantation experiments on sheltered and exposed tidal flats 5 conclusion our study illustrates the different elevational responses of regularly flooded marsh plants in dredged estuaries our findings indicate that these differences result not only from contrasting tidal range but also from different hydrodynamics due to the history of dredging diversely shaped channel and bank morphologies as well as unequal vessel frequencies we show that tidal range in particular has an effect on the elevation of the marsh edge in these dynamic systems however unravelling the overlapping effects of two major determinants changing tidal range climate change and river deepening remains a challenge permanent maintenance measures such as dredging make this effort even more difficult our study also demonstrates that there is a clear difference between the elevation above mhw and the normalized elevation in this context it is important to use the normalized elevation when comparing sites with contrasting tidal ranges instead of using the elevation in relation to just one water level our results are useful when choosing suitable elevations when restoring tidal marshes with scirpus and phragmites species furthermore the findings might inspire biologists to reconsider the reference plant zonation when emergent macrophytes serve as biological quality elements in european estuaries cf directive 200 60 ec 2000 nlwkn 2015 scholle and jaklin 2014 the zonation is used as an additional criterion for evaluating tidal marshes in order to monitor the ecological potential of severely modified estuaries this would be an important step toward reaching a good ecological potential in these estuaries as

from the tay ninh river in vietnam the results show a low actual ammonium oxidation rate in the water column of the river the ammonium oxidation is completely inhibited at ph 5 while the nitrite oxidation is strongly inhibited at ph 8 5 in comparison to the ammonium oxidizers aob the nitrite oxidizers nob are rarely inhibited at low ph numerical simulation of the experiment delivered ammonium oxidation rates ka and nitrite oxidation rates kn for different ph values the ka for ph values lower than 6 is very low it increases rapidly as the ph increases from 6 to 6 5 we also found out that ph values of 7 5 and 7 are optimal for the activity of aob and nob respectively our results emphasize the importance of considering the effect of ph substrate and bacteria on the nitrification research in river basins in doing so nitrification can be simulated more realistically and sustainable water management can be carried out more successfully keywords nitrification rate bacterial growth nitrification simulation water quality modelling water management ph 1 introduction ammonium pollution of inland water due to wastewater discharge is rapidly increasing in densely populated watersheds brion and billen 2000 laanbroek and bollmann 2011 the nitrifying bacteria in lakes and rivers take advantage of the increasing amounts of ammonium to generate energy for growth and maintenance by means of the nitrification process laanbroek and bollmann 2011 whereby more oxidized forms of inorganic nitrogen such as nitrite and nitrate are produced simultaneously nitrification is a two step process of the biological oxidation carried out by two different chemolithotrophic bacteria the ammonium oxidizers aob and the nitrite oxidizers nob these bacteria are obligate autotrophic and use energy from nitrification to fix co2 the ammonium oxidation is comprised of two stages in which two different enzymes are involved in the first stage ammonium is converted to hydroxylamine hagopian and riley 1998 prosser 1990 wrage et al 2001 the next stage in ammonium oxidation is from nh2oh to no2 hydrogen ions are released when ammonium ions are oxidized to nitrite this release may lower the ph of lightly buffered waters the nob oxidize nitrite produced by the oxidation of ammonium directly to nitrate without intermediate products wrage et al 2001 due to the oxygen consumption by nitrification a river system can suffer from oxygen depletion which can affect the aquatic organisms negatively furthermore increasing ammonium pollution causes increasing concentrations of un ionized ammonia nh3 nh3 and no2 which can exist under unfavourable conditions during the nitrification process are toxic to fish at low concentrations hagopian and riley 1998 thus controlling ammonium inputs into a river system and ensuring a functional nitrification process are important to guarantee a good environment for the aquatic organisms as well as for the human community nitrification is affected by several parameters such as ph dissolved oxygen do water temperature substrate concentration and nitrifying bacteria population chen et al 2006 gujer 2010 rheinheimer et al 1988 among these parameters ph has a strong effect on the nitrification process because it not only affects the bacterial growth rates but also modifies the acid base equilibriums no2 hno2 and nh4 nh3 and hence affects the substrate availability for aob and nob jiménez et al 2011 this effect was studied by many authors such as grunditz and dalhammar 2001 van hulle et al 2007 bae et al 2001 and jiménez et al 2011 the results of these authors show the optimum ph for aob and nob in neutral and slightly alkaline conditions according to grunditz and dalhammar 2001 the optimal ph for aob is 8 1 and for nob 7 9 in the studies of bae et al 2001 and jiménez et al 2011 the optimal ph for aob as well as nob is about 8 6 grunditz and dalhammar 2001 and bae et al 2001 also found out that a temperature between 30 c and 40 c is optimal for the growth of nitrifying bacteria the results are in agreement with the results of hellinga et al 1999 and groeneweg et al 1994 although many researchers reported that lower do inhibits the growth of aob and nob the critical values of do recorded in the literature were different peng and zhu 2006 according to bansal 1976 the nitrifying bacteria cannot grow if the oxygen content falls below 0 5 mg l in stream waters wheaton et al 1994 suggested to maintain 2 mg l as the minimum oxygen level in aquaculture nitrification biofilters nitrification modelling as a part of water quality modelling is increasingly applied for sustainable water quality management at the catchment scale most of river basin water quality models simulate nitrification only in dependence of do and water temperature brunner 2008 chapra 1997 chapra et al 2012 cole and wells 2011 dhi 2003 müller 2001 neitsch et al 2011 the effect of ph in the modelling of freshwater systems is mostly neglected moreover these models consider nitrification as a one step process to simulate the nitrification process in detail and follow its natural behaviour the ph effect and the separate oxidation of ammonium and nitrite need to be taken into account in this study the ph effect on the ammonium and nitrite oxidation of inland water is examined the objectives of our work are to investigate the kinetics of the two step nitrification to simulate this process and to point out the importance of considering the effect of ph and bacteria population in the nitrification modelling of river basins our findings challenge the commonly accepted approaches used to simulate the nitrification in river basin management and restoration to do this nitrification kinetics of a tropical river the tay ninh river were investigated under different ph values through observations of in situ changes in concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate over time by means of a microcosm experiment this method was also applied by cavari 1977 cirello et al 1979 cooper 1986 mccutcheon 1987 pauer and auer 2000 sebilo et al 2006 xia et al 2004 and yongming 1988 in those studies in which the nitrification microcosm experiments were applied to fresh water systems the effect of ph on the nitrification process was almost neglected and it is unclear whether the ph was kept constant during the experiment or not moreover in many cases the water temperature was kept at 20 c at which the nitrification does not reach its maximum rate furthermore the existing studies examined the influence of ph water temperature and do on the nitrification process simultaneously in doing so the sole effect of ph on nitrification is overlaid by the effect of other factors some authors examined the sole influence of ph on nitrification but their studies focused only on sludge soils wastewater and pure cultures bae et al 2001 groeneweg et al 1994 jiménez et al 2011 concerning the separate observation of ammonium oxidation and nitrite oxidation for fresh water using a microcosm experiment only cavari 1977 xia et al 2004 and yongming 1988 investigated this aspect in their research in this study the ammonium oxidation and nitrite oxidation at various ph values was performed under optimum do and at optimum water temperature 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling site the study site for this work is the tay ninh river located in the northwest of ho chi minh city vietnam fig 1 the tay ninh river has been highly polluted for many years nitrogen contamination has become a serious problem which is mainly due to high concentrations of ammonium le et al 2017 the ammonium concentration has extreme temporal fluctuations resulting from the intermittent discharge of untreated industrial wastewater within the catchment there are 14 industrial companies producing tapioca starch and 3 rubber companies fig 1 on average a tapioca company in the catchment produces 100 t of tapioca starch per day and releases about 1500 m3 of wastewater highly loaded with organic compounds fettig et al 2013 fettig and pick 2013 le et al 2017 the concentrations of bod5 nh4 n and po4 p in tapioca wastewater have an average values of 6700 mg l 30 mg n l and 58 mg p l respectively fettig and pick 2013 this causes a huge amount of highly contaminated organic wastewater in the catchment this wastewater is also characterized by low ph around 4 5 the raw wastewater is discharged into a pond system without any technical measures to prevent infiltration into the groundwater and is further discharged irregularly into the tay ninh river when the storage capacity of the ponds is exceeded the uncontrolled release of untreated wastewater mainly from the tapioca production causes a severe deterioration of water quality and nitrogen pollution in the tay ninh river system le et al 2017 fig 2 presents the spatial variation of water quality parameters affecting nitrification water temperature ph do and nutrient species measured in 2009 2010 and 2013 at 10 stations in the catchment the locations of the stations are shown in fig 1 the average water temperature in the catchment is about 29 c and has only slight spatial and temporal fluctuation which results from the catchment s location in the tropics the river suffers from low ph and low buffer capacity due to the geological conditions and untreated wastewater discharge with low ph high concentrations of ammonium and organic substances le 2014 the soils in the catchment are dominated by ferralic acrisols 84 ferralic acrisols are strongly weathered acidic soils with low base saturation the ph values of the river range between 4 4 and 6 9 the mean ph of the river is 6 0 at which the nitrification does not reach its maximum rate the mean do concentrations range from 3 4 to 6 1 mg l whereby concentrations under 2 0 mg l were found frequently monitored ammonium concentrations range from 0 1 to 21 0 mg n l and the average is 1 7 mg n l compared to the high ammonium concentration the nitrite and nitrate concentrations are rather low with an average of 0 04 mg n l and 0 36 mg n l respectively this indicates an inhibition of the nitrification due to low ph and low do in this study the sampling site for the investigation of the nitrification is located at the station cau gio cg in the middle of the river fig 1 a water column sample was collected as a surface grab sample in the central point of this station on july 22nd 2013 this station has a mean discharge of 20 m3 s in the flood season from september to november of 5 m3 s in the dry season from december to august and an average depth of 1 6 m before this experiment took place a preliminary nitrification experiment with a water sample taken from the same site was performed on january 26th 2013 this preliminary experiment was recorded carefully in a protocol for a systematic investigation of the nitrification rate of the river later on 2 2 sample collection and experimental approach rates of ammonium and nitrite oxidation were measured by observing changes in concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate over time during the experiment at different ph values in order to do this 15 l of river water was collected from the cg station in the middle of the river as mentioned in section 2 1 the water sample was kept at 4 c transported to the laboratory and analysed immediately nh4 n no3 n no2 n total nitrogen tn and cod chemical oxygen demand were quantified spectrometrically nova 60 merck during the experiment analytical techniques are summarized in table 1 water temperature ph and do were measured using a wtw multi 340i instrument with a sentix 41 ph electrode and a cellox 3 oxygen sensor the original ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations of the sampled water are 1 0 0 06 and 0 94 mg n l respectively in order to unambiguously determine the changes of ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations during the experiment the initial ammonium concentration was increased to 8 1 mg n l by adding 420 ml from a stock solution of 1 0 g l nh4cl to the river water sample such an ammonium concentration is realistic for the tay ninh river and stays in the range of the monitored data in the nitrification experiments of pauer and auer 2000 cirello et al 1979 and hsiao et al 2014 ammonium chloride was also added to the water samples to achieve the desired ammonium concentration additionally because of the low buffer capacity of the river water as mentioned in section 2 1 nahco3 was added to the river water to raise its buffer capacity thus the alkalinity of the sample was increased from 0 59 to 2 65 mmol l this higher buffer capacity helps to prevent significant changes of the ph value during the experiment the water sample was aerated to increase the dissolved oxygen do to about 7 mg l before starting the experiment the whole water sample was then divided into 9 glass beakers the beakers were sterilized before the experiment each glass beaker received about 1 5 l of prepared river water to prevent nutrient assimilation by algae and inhibition of nitrification by light rheinheimer 1991 schön and engel 1962 the 9 glass beakers were incubated in the dark the water was then adjusted to different ph values ph 5 0 ph 5 3 ph 5 6 ph 6 0 ph 6 5 ph 7 0 ph 7 5 ph 8 0 ph 8 5 with either naoh 0 1n or h2so4 0 1n during the period in which the experiment was performed water temperature and do were controlled regularly the ph values of the glass beakers were monitored continuously and maintained at the defined ph by adding naoh 0 1n or h2so4 0 1n as needed during the experiment according to admiraal and botermans 1989 oxygen concentrations above approx 3 mg l are generally thought to saturate microbial nitrification stenstrom and poduska 1980 gave 0 3 mg l as the lowest do concentration at which nitrification can occur bansal 1976 reported that nitrifying bacteria cannot grow if do in stream water falls below 0 5 mg l therefore do was kept above 3 mg l during the experiment by aeration according to wetzel 2001 the nitrifying bacteria are mesophilic with a wide temperature tolerance ranging from 1 c to 37 c grunditz and dalhammar 2001 and bae et al 2001 proposed that nitrifying bacteria grow optimally in the temperature range between 30 c and 40 c during the experiment the temperature was kept between 30 c and 32 c to ensure the optimal temperature for nitrification since throughout the experiment do was always above 3 mg l and the water temperature was between 30 c and 32 c the effect of these two parameters on nitrification were negligible therefore only the effects of ph the nitrifying bacteria population and the substrate concentration had an influence here the glass beakers were incubated at optimal water temperature optimal do level and given ph values for about 8 days 190 h in the dark aliquots were removed from the microcosms and analysed for ammonium nitrite nitrate total nitrogen tn and cod based on the experience of the preliminary experiment section 2 1 nh4 n no3 n no2 n total nitrogen tn and cod of each beaker were measured in the first 4 days only 1 time per day at 8 am as during these 4 days a low nitrification rate was expected from the fifth day on the measurements took place twice per day around 8 am and 7 pm during the experiment cod was measured to estimate the effect of organic substances bod biochemical oxygen demand was not measured due to lack of equipment so that the concentration of biodegradable organic substance could not be quantified the cod concentration of the original water sample collected at the station cg at the beginning of the experiment was 11 mg l theoretically degradation of organic matter can be a source of ammonium as a natural result of ammonification however since nitrogen is only about 4 10 of the dry weight of organic substrate boyd 2000 and the cod concentrations of all beakers did not change significantly over the experiment the influence of organic substrate on the ammonium concentration was neglected moreover during the first 46 h there was no visible increase in the ammonium concentration in beaker 1 to beaker 7 beaker 8 and beaker 9 were not considered in this evaluation due to ammonia volatilisation into the air denitrification as a sink for nitrogen can be excluded in this study since the oxygen contents in the beakers were always kept above 3 mg l it is well known that denitrification as an anaerobic respiratory process does not occur in the presence of oxygen at concentrations higher than about 0 2 mg l sebilo et al 2006 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ph on the nitrification process in the beakers temporal changes in nh4 n no2 n and no3 n at different ph values over the experimental period of 190 h are presented in fig 3 the initial ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentration of all examined beakers were 8 1 0 06 and 0 94 mg n l respectively measuring the total nitrogen tn concentrations helps to quantify the ammonia loss due to ammonia volatilisation during the experiment in beaker with ph 8 5 ammonium and tn concentrations decreased significantly due to ammonia volatilisation into the air ammonium in fresh water acts as a weak base in a dynamic equilibrium between ammonia nh3 and ammonium nh4 the acid base equilibrium nh4 nh3 is dependent on ph and water temperature hagopian and riley 1998 pambrun et al 2006 at ph 8 5 and a water temperature of 30 c about 20 of the total ammonium concentration is present in nh3 form in the beakers with ph 8 0 and 8 5 the first apparent increase of nitrite concentration was observed after 46 h of incubation this indicates that the ammonium oxidation started after 46 h in contrast to the rapid increase of nitrite concentration after the start of the ammonium oxidation the nitrate concentration at ph 8 5 did not change significantly it can be concluded that the nob in contrast to the aob are strongly inhibited at ph 8 5 at ph 8 0 the nitrite oxidation is less inhibited at the end of the experiment the nitrate concentration at ph 8 0 had increased from 0 64 mg n l to 5 1 mg n l no change in the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate at ph 5 0 over the investigated period of 190 h is noticeable fig 3 this indicates a strong inhibition of the ammonium oxidation at ph 5 0 from the results of the experiment it could not be determined whether the nitrite oxidation at ph 5 0 is inhibited due to the sole effect of ph the reason for this is the substrate inadequacy for the activity of nob due to the inhibition of aob at ph 5 0 an inhibition of nob due to insufficient substrate availability could be possible at ph 5 3 7 5 the transformation of ammonium to nitrite and finally to nitrate did not take place in the first 23 h after starting the experiment after 46 h only a slight decrease of ammonium concentrations at ph 5 6 to ph 7 5 was detected at ph 5 3 the ammonium oxidation started after 70 h and remained at a very low level after 70 h the ammonium concentrations at ph 5 6 to ph 7 5 decreased rapidly and the nitrite concentrations started to increase significantly at ph 6 5 to ph 8 5 the maxima of nitrite concentrations were reached when the ammonium concentrations dropped nearly to zero fig 3 the nitrate concentrations at ph 5 3 to 6 5 and at ph 7 0 to 8 5 started to increase slowly after 95 h and 46 h respectively a rapid increase of nitrate was noticed after nitrite concentrations reached their maxima 3 2 estimation of the lag period the growth of bacteria is divided into 3 phases initial phase transition phase and exponential phase whereby the initial phase and transition phase are considered together as the lag period prats 2008 the lag period for nitrification has been observed in lake and river studies by some authors cavari 1977 pauer and auer 2000 xia et al 2004 yongming 1988 however their studies focused on water bodies located in the temperate zone pauer and auer 2000 and in the subtropics cavari 1977 xia et al 2004 yongming 1988 furthermore these authors did not consider the ph effect on ammonium oxidation as well as on nitrite oxidation in the study of yongming 1988 the nitrification of water from the toujiang river china was examined for 1 week under aeration whereby the water sample in the experiment was covered at the bottom with sediments the results showed a rapid ammonium and nitrite oxidation in the first day of the experiment nearly no lag period regarding the first step of the nitrification process pauer and auer 2000 studied the ammonium oxidation in the water column of the onondaga lake and the adjoining seneca river located in new york using microcosm experiments no change of ammonium was observed in the water column experiments over the first 3 4 days the lag period for ammonium oxidation was longer in the research of cavari 1977 with 7 and 29 days for water taken during the turnover period and the stratification period of lake kinneret in israel respectively xia et al 2004 found different lag periods in their experiments investigating the effects of suspended solids on nitrification in river water of the yellow river in china the lag periods for ammonium oxidation were 0 day and 5 days respectively for 2 different water samples without suspended solids regarding the second step of the nitrification process cavari 1977 proposed that the lag periods of the nitrite oxidation of water samples taken during the mixed period and the stratification period were 12 days and 0 day respectively xia et al 2004 reported different lag periods of the nitrite oxidation in water samples in one water sample the nitrite oxidation took place immediately and in the other water sample the lag period was 6 days based on the results of the experiment in this study the lag period of the ammonium oxidation for ph 5 3 8 5 can be 70 h 2 9 days whereby the initial phase is 46 h 1 9 days in the tay ninh river the ammonium oxidation is completely inhibited at ph 5 0 concerning the lag period of the nitrite oxidation it is divided into two lag periods the lag period for ph 5 3 6 5 can be 142 h 5 9 days and for ph 7 0 8 5 it can be 128 h 5 3 days the initial phases are 95 h 4 days for ph 5 3 6 5 and 46 h 1 9 days for ph 7 0 8 5 when assessing the lag period of the nitrite oxidation it is important to consider that the activity of nob at the beginning of the experiment in contrast to the aob was inhibited by a substrate inadequacy the nob received the maximum substrate availability only after the available ammonium was almost completely oxidized in this experiment the ammonium oxidation at the beginning was dependent on ph and concentrations of aob dissolved oxygen water temperature and substrate concentration ammonium were kept at their optima for aob in contrast to aob the activity of nob depended on the substrate concentration nitrite ph and temporal concentrations of nob 3 3 estimation of nitrification in the river pauer and auer 2000 and cavari 1977 concluded that the very low nitrification rate at the beginning of the experiment in the initial phase was related to the low initial nitrifier density this initial density depends on the number of nitrifying bacteria present in the river water at the time of sampling nitrifying bacteria concentration will change during the experiment in this study the ammonium oxidation rate and the nitrite oxidation rate for all ph values at the beginning of the experiment appeared to be zero the low ammonium oxidation rate is probably due to the low initial aob density the low nitrite oxidation rate is perhaps due to the low initial nob population or due to the substrate inadequacy at the beginning of the experiment these rates represent the actual ammonium oxidation rate and nitrite oxidation rate of the tay ninh river this conclusion is in agreement with the conclusion derived by pauer and auer 2000 and cavari 1977 the difference of this study compared to the studies of pauer and auer 2000 and cavari 1977 is only that the lag period of the ammonium oxidation is about 3 days for ph 5 6 to 8 5 and thus shorter in the tay ninh river the ammonium oxidation is completely inhibited at ph 5 0 3 4 simulation of the nitrification at different ph values since the nitrification is affected by water temperature dissolved oxygen ph substrate and bacteria population the balance for ammonium nitrite and nitrate can be simulated using the functions below chapra 1997 senzia et al

is the nitrite oxidation rate determined for each ph taking into account the effect of substrate nitrite and bacteria the oxidation of ammonium and nitrite is related with the growth of nitrifying bacteria the lag period lag time tl in the bacterial growth is followed by the logarithmic or the exponential phase baty and delignette muller 2004 zwietering et al 1990 eqs 4 6 do not consider the lag time and therefore can describe only the growth of nitrifying bacteria in the exponential phase some authors have dealt with the simulation of the bacterial growth and have proposed several models to simulate the bacterial growth annuar et al 2008 augustin and carlier 2000 buchanan et al 1997 mochizuki and hattori 1987 ocampo lópez et al 2015 pamment et al 1978 rosso et al 1996 zwietering et al 1990 although many efforts have been made these models are either too complicated too many parameters need to be estimated or do not consider the lag phase of the bacterial growth furthermore most of the empirical models contain mathematical parameters rather than parameters with biological meaning k tl zwietering et al 1990 deterministic models with parameters having biological meanings are easier to understand and to calibrate in order to simulate the changing of ammonium nitrite and nitrate for the entire nitrification experiment in this study taking into account of the lag period tl

simulation time tl a and tl b is the lag time for aob and nob and w is a shape parameter dimensionless for the simulation of the entire nitrification experiment in this study the differential eqs 7 9 were used and implemented in matlab the matlab procedures for solving differential equations are based on the runge kutta algorithm to solve eqs 7 9 function ode45 was applied the matlab procedure ode45 is a combination of a 4th order runge kutta method with a 5th order method the calibration parameter estimation was carried out with an optimization procedure and is done by the method of least root of mean square error rmse the root of mean square error obtained for each ph is calculated as follows 10 l θ i 1 n f t i θ g i 2 n where θ θ 1 θp parameters need to be calibrated optimized ka kn

calibration optimization of nitrite and nitrate was carried out after finishing the calibration optimization of ammonium for the optimization the method fminsearchbnd of matlab was chosen fminsearchbnd is a derivative free method it is used to optimize nonlinear functions with inequality constraints the matlab method fminsearchbnd uses the simplex method of nelder mead to solve the optimization problem the idea of the nelder mead method is to create a sequence of simplexes that will be ideally smaller and smaller in diameter to reach the desired minimum the oxidation rates ka and kn in eqs 7 9 represent the specific rates of the ammonium oxidation and the nitrite oxidation when aob and nob grow exponentially the simulated concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate using the proposed eqs 7 9 are shown in fig 4 as the unit of the oxidation rate is d 1 the time in the x axis was changed from hours to days for all ph values a good agreement between simulated and measured data was achieved this is confirmed by high coefficients of determination r2 and high nash sutcliffe coefficients of efficiency e the coefficients r 2 at ph 5 are 0 00 due to the measured values of ammonium nitrite and nitrate being constant over time also very low concentrations of nitrite 0 5 mg n l at ph 5 ph 5 3 and ph 5 6 cause low coefficients of r 2 and e in contrast to r 2 which evaluates the linear relationships between simulated and measured values nash sutcliffe coefficient e takes into account the differences in the measured and simulated values krause et al 2005 legates and mccabe 1999 it is thus more suitable in the model evaluation the model parameters in eqs 7 9 which were optimized during the simulation of the nitrification experiment are summarized in table 2 the ammonium oxidation rate ka and nitrite oxidation rate kn were estimated for each ph these values allow a first estimation of the influence of the ph value on the oxidation activity of aob and nob for ph 8 5 the sole ammonium oxidation rate could not be correctly estimated due to ammonium loss as a result of ammonia volatilisation the ka at ph 8 5 represents therefore the sum of ammonium oxidation and ammonia volatilisation table 2 shows that the highest activity of the aob and nob was found at ph 7 5 and ph 7 0 for the tay ninh river respectively for ph values lower than 6 0 the ka value is very low it increased strongly from 0 16 d 1 to 1 17 d 1 as the ph value increased from 6 0 to 6 5 and stayed increasing until ph 7 5 this indicates that aob of the tay ninh river are sensitive to ph lower than 6 0 in comparison to aob the oxidation of nob is rarely inhibited at low ph values the kn at ph 5 3 is almost high as the kn at ph 6 5 and only a bit lower than the kn at ph 7 0 at ph 8 5 nob in contrast to aob are almost completely inhibited the simulation results fit well to the interpretation in section 3 1 and indicate that eqs 7 9 can be used to simulate the nitrification in the experiment whereby only two biological parameters oxidation rate and lag time are considered for the simulation of ammonium oxidation and nitrite oxidation in detail and following the biological behaviour eqs 1 3 should be applied in these equations the effect of water temperature do ph substrate concentration and nitrifying bacteria population are taken into account in most of the existing inland water quality models the effects of water temperature and do are simulated using the popular modified arrhenius commonly called the theta approach and the michaelis menten approach bicknell et al 2005 chapra et al 2012 cole and wells 2017 deltares 2011 dhi 2003 hipsey et al 2006 martin and wool 2002 neitsch et al 2011 while the dependency of nitrification on water temperature and do has received intensive attention by the watershed modelling community the effect of substrate ph and bacteria on this process has been mostly neglected different oxidation rates for aob and nob at different ph values determined in this study emphasize the importance of taking into account the effect of ph in the nitrification modelling of river basins 4 conclusions a laboratory microcosm experiment was carried out to investigate the nitrification process in the water column of the tay ninh river at various ph values under optimum do and at optimum water temperature the results show that the actual ammonium oxidation rate of the tay ninh river are very low appear to be zero and that the ammonium oxidation is completely inhibited at ph 5 0 while the nitrite oxidation in contrast to the ammonium oxidation is strongly inhibited at ph 8 5 the actual nitrite oxidation rate in the water column of the river could not be examined in the experiment due to the substrate deficiency we also found out that the nob in the tay ninh river is insensitive to low ph and that ph values of 7 5 and 7 0 are optimal for the activity of aob and nob respectively using the temporal change in concentrations of ammonium and nitrate nitrification rates at different ph values of ammonium oxidation and nitrite oxidation were determined they are determining constants in the modelling of the nitrification process as part of water quality modelling for a sustainable water management nowadays existing water quality models which include the nitrification process are increasingly applied to simulate impacts of different treatment facilities on point sources and diffuse sources and to manage the water quality sustainably le et al 2012 in such models biochemical processes such as nitrification are mathematically represented and simulated many of them simplify the two step nitrification process as a one step process whereby ammonium is directly converted to nitrate the separate oxidation of ammonium to nitrite und further to nitrate is omitted the dependency of nitrification on the substrate availability the amount of bacteria as well as on the ph value is also not taken into account the results of our study emphasize the importance of considering the ph effect on nitrification modelling of river basins moreover the nitrifying bacteria population should be simultaneously simulated in doing so nitrification can be simulated realistically and sustainable water management can be carried out successfully acknowledgements this study is part of the german

1133,nitrification is simulated in existing water quality models by multiplying the rate with the attenuation factors for water temperature and dissolved oxygen the effect of ph substrates and bacteria is mostly neglected moreover the two step nitrification is simplified to a one step process the aim of this study is to investigate the kinetics of two step nitrification and to simulate this process consequently the importance of considering the effect of ph substrate and bacteria in nitrification modelling of river basins is emphasized for this an experiment was performed on water taken from the tay ninh river in vietnam the results show a low actual ammonium oxidation rate in the water column of the river the ammonium oxidation is completely inhibited at ph 5 while the nitrite oxidation is strongly inhibited at ph 8 5 in comparison to the ammonium oxidizers aob the nitrite oxidizers nob are rarely inhibited at low ph numerical simulation of the experiment delivered ammonium oxidation rates ka and nitrite oxidation rates kn for different ph values the ka for ph values lower than 6 is very low it increases rapidly as the ph increases from 6 to 6 5 we also found out that ph values of 7 5 and 7 are optimal for the activity of aob and nob respectively our results emphasize the importance of considering the effect of ph substrate and bacteria on the nitrification research in river basins in doing so nitrification can be simulated more realistically and sustainable water management can be carried out more successfully keywords nitrification rate bacterial growth nitrification simulation water quality modelling water management ph 1 introduction ammonium pollution of inland water due to wastewater discharge is rapidly increasing in densely populated watersheds brion and billen 2000 laanbroek and bollmann 2011 the nitrifying bacteria in lakes and rivers take advantage of the increasing amounts of ammonium to generate energy for growth and maintenance by means of the nitrification process laanbroek and bollmann 2011 whereby more oxidized forms of inorganic nitrogen such as nitrite and nitrate are produced simultaneously nitrification is a two step process of the biological oxidation carried out by two different chemolithotrophic bacteria the ammonium oxidizers aob and the nitrite oxidizers nob these bacteria are obligate autotrophic and use energy from nitrification to fix co2 the ammonium oxidation is comprised of two stages in which two different enzymes are involved in the first stage ammonium is converted to hydroxylamine hagopian and riley 1998 prosser 1990 wrage et al 2001 the next stage in ammonium oxidation is from nh2oh to no2 hydrogen ions are released when ammonium ions are oxidized to nitrite this release may lower the ph of lightly buffered waters the nob oxidize nitrite produced by the oxidation of ammonium directly to nitrate without intermediate products wrage et al 2001 due to the oxygen consumption by nitrification a river system can suffer from oxygen depletion which can affect the aquatic organisms negatively furthermore increasing ammonium pollution causes increasing concentrations of un ionized ammonia nh3 nh3 and no2 which can exist under unfavourable conditions during the nitrification process are toxic to fish at low concentrations hagopian and riley 1998 thus controlling ammonium inputs into a river system and ensuring a functional nitrification process are important to guarantee a good environment for the aquatic organisms as well as for the human community nitrification is affected by several parameters such as ph dissolved oxygen do water temperature substrate concentration and nitrifying bacteria population chen et al 2006 gujer 2010 rheinheimer et al 1988 among these parameters ph has a strong effect on the nitrification process because it not only affects the bacterial growth rates but also modifies the acid base equilibriums no2 hno2 and nh4 nh3 and hence affects the substrate availability for aob and nob jiménez et al 2011 this effect was studied by many authors such as grunditz and dalhammar 2001 van hulle et al 2007 bae et al 2001 and jiménez et al 2011 the results of these authors show the optimum ph for aob and nob in neutral and slightly alkaline conditions according to grunditz and dalhammar 2001 the optimal ph for aob is 8 1 and for nob 7 9 in the studies of bae et al 2001 and jiménez et al 2011 the optimal ph for aob as well as nob is about 8 6 grunditz and dalhammar 2001 and bae et al 2001 also found out that a temperature between 30 c and 40 c is optimal for the growth of nitrifying bacteria the results are in agreement with the results of hellinga et al 1999 and groeneweg et al 1994 although many researchers reported that lower do inhibits the growth of aob and nob the critical values of do recorded in the literature were different peng and zhu 2006 according to bansal 1976 the nitrifying bacteria cannot grow if the oxygen content falls below 0 5 mg l in stream waters wheaton et al 1994 suggested to maintain 2 mg l as the minimum oxygen level in aquaculture nitrification biofilters nitrification modelling as a part of water quality modelling is increasingly applied for sustainable water quality management at the catchment scale most of river basin water quality models simulate nitrification only in dependence of do and water temperature brunner 2008 chapra 1997 chapra et al 2012 cole and wells 2011 dhi 2003 müller 2001 neitsch et al 2011 the effect of ph in the modelling of freshwater systems is mostly neglected moreover these models consider nitrification as a one step process to simulate the nitrification process in detail and follow its natural behaviour the ph effect and the separate oxidation of ammonium and nitrite need to be taken into account in this study the ph effect on the ammonium and nitrite oxidation of inland water is examined the objectives of our work are to investigate the kinetics of the two step nitrification to simulate this process and to point out the importance of considering the effect of ph and bacteria population in the nitrification modelling of river basins our findings challenge the commonly accepted approaches used to simulate the nitrification in river basin management and restoration to do this nitrification kinetics of a tropical river the tay ninh river were investigated under different ph values through observations of in situ changes in concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate over time by means of a microcosm experiment this method was also applied by cavari 1977 cirello et al 1979 cooper 1986 mccutcheon 1987 pauer and auer 2000 sebilo et al 2006 xia et al 2004 and yongming 1988 in those studies in which the nitrification microcosm experiments were applied to fresh water systems the effect of ph on the nitrification process was almost neglected and it is unclear whether the ph was kept constant during the experiment or not moreover in many cases the water temperature was kept at 20 c at which the nitrification does not reach its maximum rate furthermore the existing studies examined the influence of ph water temperature and do on the nitrification process simultaneously in doing so the sole effect of ph on nitrification is overlaid by the effect of other factors some authors examined the sole influence of ph on nitrification but their studies focused only on sludge soils wastewater and pure cultures bae et al 2001 groeneweg et al 1994 jiménez et al 2011 concerning the separate observation of ammonium oxidation and nitrite oxidation for fresh water using a microcosm experiment only cavari 1977 xia et al 2004 and yongming 1988 investigated this aspect in their research in this study the ammonium oxidation and nitrite oxidation at various ph values was performed under optimum do and at optimum water temperature 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling site the study site for this work is the tay ninh river located in the northwest of ho chi minh city vietnam fig 1 the tay ninh river has been highly polluted for many years nitrogen contamination has become a serious problem which is mainly due to high concentrations of ammonium le et al 2017 the ammonium concentration has extreme temporal fluctuations resulting from the intermittent discharge of untreated industrial wastewater within the catchment there are 14 industrial companies producing tapioca starch and 3 rubber companies fig 1 on average a tapioca company in the catchment produces 100 t of tapioca starch per day and releases about 1500 m3 of wastewater highly loaded with organic compounds fettig et al 2013 fettig and pick 2013 le et al 2017 the concentrations of bod5 nh4 n and po4 p in tapioca wastewater have an average values of 6700 mg l 30 mg n l and 58 mg p l respectively fettig and pick 2013 this causes a huge amount of highly contaminated organic wastewater in the catchment this wastewater is also characterized by low ph around 4 5 the raw wastewater is discharged into a pond system without any technical measures to prevent infiltration into the groundwater and is further discharged irregularly into the tay ninh river when the storage capacity of the ponds is exceeded the uncontrolled release of untreated wastewater mainly from the tapioca production causes a severe deterioration of water quality and nitrogen pollution in the tay ninh river system le et al 2017 fig 2 presents the spatial variation of water quality parameters affecting nitrification water temperature ph do and nutrient species measured in 2009 2010 and 2013 at 10 stations in the catchment the locations of the stations are shown in fig 1 the average water temperature in the catchment is about 29 c and has only slight spatial and temporal fluctuation which results from the catchment s location in the tropics the river suffers from low ph and low buffer capacity due to the geological conditions and untreated wastewater discharge with low ph high concentrations of ammonium and organic substances le 2014 the soils in the catchment are dominated by ferralic acrisols 84 ferralic acrisols are strongly weathered acidic soils with low base saturation the ph values of the river range between 4 4 and 6 9 the mean ph of the river is 6 0 at which the nitrification does not reach its maximum rate the mean do concentrations range from 3 4 to 6 1 mg l whereby concentrations under 2 0 mg l were found frequently monitored ammonium concentrations range from 0 1 to 21 0 mg n l and the average is 1 7 mg n l compared to the high ammonium concentration the nitrite and nitrate concentrations are rather low with an average of 0 04 mg n l and 0 36 mg n l respectively this indicates an inhibition of the nitrification due to low ph and low do in this study the sampling site for the investigation of the nitrification is located at the station cau gio cg in the middle of the river fig 1 a water column sample was collected as a surface grab sample in the central point of this station on july 22nd 2013 this station has a mean discharge of 20 m3 s in the flood season from september to november of 5 m3 s in the dry season from december to august and an average depth of 1 6 m before this experiment took place a preliminary nitrification experiment with a water sample taken from the same site was performed on january 26th 2013 this preliminary experiment was recorded carefully in a protocol for a systematic investigation of the nitrification rate of the river later on 2 2 sample collection and experimental approach rates of ammonium and nitrite oxidation were measured by observing changes in concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate over time during the experiment at different ph values in order to do this 15 l of river water was collected from the cg station in the middle of the river as mentioned in section 2 1 the water sample was kept at 4 c transported to the laboratory and analysed immediately nh4 n no3 n no2 n total nitrogen tn and cod chemical oxygen demand were quantified spectrometrically nova 60 merck during the experiment analytical techniques are summarized in table 1 water temperature ph and do were measured using a wtw multi 340i instrument with a sentix 41 ph electrode and a cellox 3 oxygen sensor the original ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations of the sampled water are 1 0 0 06 and 0 94 mg n l respectively in order to unambiguously determine the changes of ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations during the experiment the initial ammonium concentration was increased to 8 1 mg n l by adding 420 ml from a stock solution of 1 0 g l nh4cl to the river water sample such an ammonium concentration is realistic for the tay ninh river and stays in the range of the monitored data in the nitrification experiments of pauer and auer 2000 cirello et al 1979 and hsiao et al 2014 ammonium chloride was also added to the water samples to achieve the desired ammonium concentration additionally because of the low buffer capacity of the river water as mentioned in section 2 1 nahco3 was added to the river water to raise its buffer capacity thus the alkalinity of the sample was increased from 0 59 to 2 65 mmol l this higher buffer capacity helps to prevent significant changes of the ph value during the experiment the water sample was aerated to increase the dissolved oxygen do to about 7 mg l before starting the experiment the whole water sample was then divided into 9 glass beakers the beakers were sterilized before the experiment each glass beaker received about 1 5 l of prepared river water to prevent nutrient assimilation by algae and inhibition of nitrification by light rheinheimer 1991 schön and engel 1962 the 9 glass beakers were incubated in the dark the water was then adjusted to different ph values ph 5 0 ph 5 3 ph 5 6 ph 6 0 ph 6 5 ph 7 0 ph 7 5 ph 8 0 ph 8 5 with either naoh 0 1n or h2so4 0 1n during the period in which the experiment was performed water temperature and do were controlled regularly the ph values of the glass beakers were monitored continuously and maintained at the defined ph by adding naoh 0 1n or h2so4 0 1n as needed during the experiment according to admiraal and botermans 1989 oxygen concentrations above approx 3 mg l are generally thought to saturate microbial nitrification stenstrom and poduska 1980 gave 0 3 mg l as the lowest do concentration at which nitrification can occur bansal 1976 reported that nitrifying bacteria cannot grow if do in stream water falls below 0 5 mg l therefore do was kept above 3 mg l during the experiment by aeration according to wetzel 2001 the nitrifying bacteria are mesophilic with a wide temperature tolerance ranging from 1 c to 37 c grunditz and dalhammar 2001 and bae et al 2001 proposed that nitrifying bacteria grow optimally in the temperature range between 30 c and 40 c during the experiment the temperature was kept between 30 c and 32 c to ensure the optimal temperature for nitrification since throughout the experiment do was always above 3 mg l and the water temperature was between 30 c and 32 c the effect of these two parameters on nitrification were negligible therefore only the effects of ph the nitrifying bacteria population and the substrate concentration had an influence here the glass beakers were incubated at optimal water temperature optimal do level and given ph values for about 8 days 190 h in the dark aliquots were removed from the microcosms and analysed for ammonium nitrite nitrate total nitrogen tn and cod based on the experience of the preliminary experiment section 2 1 nh4 n no3 n no2 n total nitrogen tn and cod of each beaker were measured in the first 4 days only 1 time per day at 8 am as during these 4 days a low nitrification rate was expected from the fifth day on the measurements took place twice per day around 8 am and 7 pm during the experiment cod was measured to estimate the effect of organic substances bod biochemical oxygen demand was not measured due to lack of equipment so that the concentration of biodegradable organic substance could not be quantified the cod concentration of the original water sample collected at the station cg at the beginning of the experiment was 11 mg l theoretically degradation of organic matter can be a source of ammonium as a natural result of ammonification however since nitrogen is only about 4 10 of the dry weight of organic substrate boyd 2000 and the cod concentrations of all beakers did not change significantly over the experiment the influence of organic substrate on the ammonium concentration was neglected moreover during the first 46 h there was no visible increase in the ammonium concentration in beaker 1 to beaker 7 beaker 8 and beaker 9 were not considered in this evaluation due to ammonia volatilisation into the air denitrification as a sink for nitrogen can be excluded in this study since the oxygen contents in the beakers were always kept above 3 mg l it is well known that denitrification as an anaerobic respiratory process does not occur in the presence of oxygen at concentrations higher than about 0 2 mg l sebilo et al 2006 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ph on the nitrification process in the beakers temporal changes in nh4 n no2 n and no3 n at different ph values over the experimental period of 190 h are presented in fig 3 the initial ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentration of all examined beakers were 8 1 0 06 and 0 94 mg n l respectively measuring the total nitrogen tn concentrations helps to quantify the ammonia loss due to ammonia volatilisation during the experiment in beaker with ph 8 5 ammonium and tn concentrations decreased significantly due to ammonia volatilisation into the air ammonium in fresh water acts as a weak base in a dynamic equilibrium between ammonia nh3 and ammonium nh4 the acid base equilibrium nh4 nh3 is dependent on ph and water temperature hagopian and riley 1998 pambrun et al 2006 at ph 8 5 and a water temperature of 30 c about 20 of the total ammonium concentration is present in nh3 form in the beakers with ph 8 0 and 8 5 the first apparent increase of nitrite concentration was observed after 46 h of incubation this indicates that the ammonium oxidation started after 46 h in contrast to the rapid increase of nitrite concentration after the start of the ammonium oxidation the nitrate concentration at ph 8 5 did not change significantly it can be concluded that the nob in contrast to the aob are strongly inhibited at ph 8 5 at ph 8 0 the nitrite oxidation is less inhibited at the end of the experiment the nitrate concentration at ph 8 0 had increased from 0 64 mg n l to 5 1 mg n l no change in the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate at ph 5 0 over the investigated period of 190 h is noticeable fig 3 this indicates a strong inhibition of the ammonium oxidation at ph 5 0 from the results of the experiment it could not be determined whether the nitrite oxidation at ph 5 0 is inhibited due to the sole effect of ph the reason for this is the substrate inadequacy for the activity of nob due to the inhibition of aob at ph 5 0 an inhibition of nob due to insufficient substrate availability could be possible at ph 5 3 7 5 the transformation of ammonium to nitrite and finally to nitrate did not take place in the first 23 h after starting the experiment after 46 h only a slight decrease of ammonium concentrations at ph 5 6 to ph 7 5 was detected at ph 5 3 the ammonium oxidation started after 70 h and remained at a very low level after 70 h the ammonium concentrations at ph 5 6 to ph 7 5 decreased rapidly and the nitrite concentrations started to increase significantly at ph 6 5 to ph 8 5 the maxima of nitrite concentrations were reached when the ammonium concentrations dropped nearly to zero fig 3 the nitrate concentrations at ph 5 3 to 6 5 and at ph 7 0 to 8 5 started to increase slowly after 95 h and 46 h respectively a rapid increase of nitrate was noticed after nitrite concentrations reached their maxima 3 2 estimation of the lag period the growth of bacteria is divided into 3 phases initial phase transition phase and exponential phase whereby the initial phase and transition phase are considered together as the lag period prats 2008 the lag period for nitrification has been observed in lake and river studies by some authors cavari 1977 pauer and auer 2000 xia et al 2004 yongming 1988 however their studies focused on water bodies located in the temperate zone pauer and auer 2000 and in the subtropics cavari 1977 xia et al 2004 yongming 1988 furthermore these authors did not consider the ph effect on ammonium oxidation as well as on nitrite oxidation in the study of yongming 1988 the nitrification of water from the toujiang river china was examined for 1 week under aeration whereby the water sample in the experiment was covered at the bottom with sediments the results showed a rapid ammonium and nitrite oxidation in the first day of the experiment nearly no lag period regarding the first step of the nitrification process pauer and auer 2000 studied the ammonium oxidation in the water column of the onondaga lake and the adjoining seneca river located in new york using microcosm experiments no change of ammonium was observed in the water column experiments over the first 3 4 days the lag period for ammonium oxidation was longer in the research of cavari 1977 with 7 and 29 days for water taken during the turnover period and the stratification period of lake kinneret in israel respectively xia et al 2004 found different lag periods in their experiments investigating the effects of suspended solids on nitrification in river water of the yellow river in china the lag periods for ammonium oxidation were 0 day and 5 days respectively for 2 different water samples without suspended solids regarding the second step of the nitrification process cavari 1977 proposed that the lag periods of the nitrite oxidation of water samples taken during the mixed period and the stratification period were 12 days and 0 day respectively xia et al 2004 reported different lag periods of the nitrite oxidation in water samples in one water sample the nitrite oxidation took place immediately and in the other water sample the lag period was 6 days based on the results of the experiment in this study the lag period of the ammonium oxidation for ph 5 3 8 5 can be 70 h 2 9 days whereby the initial phase is 46 h 1 9 days in the tay ninh river the ammonium oxidation is completely inhibited at ph 5 0 concerning the lag period of the nitrite oxidation it is divided into two lag periods the lag period for ph 5 3 6 5 can be 142 h 5 9 days and for ph 7 0 8 5 it can be 128 h 5 3 days the initial phases are 95 h 4 days for ph 5 3 6 5 and 46 h 1 9 days for ph 7 0 8 5 when assessing the lag period of the nitrite oxidation it is important to consider that the activity of nob at the beginning of the experiment in contrast to the aob was inhibited by a substrate inadequacy the nob received the maximum substrate availability only after the available ammonium was almost completely oxidized in this experiment the ammonium oxidation at the beginning was dependent on ph and concentrations of aob dissolved oxygen water temperature and substrate concentration ammonium were kept at their optima for aob in contrast to aob the activity of nob depended on the substrate concentration nitrite ph and temporal concentrations of nob 3 3 estimation of nitrification in the river pauer and auer 2000 and cavari 1977 concluded that the very low nitrification rate at the beginning of the experiment in the initial phase was related to the low initial nitrifier density this initial density depends on the number of nitrifying bacteria present in the river water at the time of sampling nitrifying bacteria concentration will change during the experiment in this study the ammonium oxidation rate and the nitrite oxidation rate for all ph values at the beginning of the experiment appeared to be zero the low ammonium oxidation rate is probably due to the low initial aob density the low nitrite oxidation rate is perhaps due to the low initial nob population or due to the substrate inadequacy at the beginning of the experiment these rates represent the actual ammonium oxidation rate and nitrite oxidation rate of the tay ninh river this conclusion is in agreement with the conclusion derived by pauer and auer 2000 and cavari 1977 the difference of this study compared to the studies of pauer and auer 2000 and cavari 1977 is only that the lag period of the ammonium oxidation is about 3 days for ph 5 6 to 8 5 and thus shorter in the tay ninh river the ammonium oxidation is completely inhibited at ph 5 0 3 4 simulation of the nitrification at different ph values since the nitrification is affected by water temperature dissolved oxygen ph substrate and bacteria population the balance for ammonium nitrite and nitrate can be simulated using the functions below chapra 1997 senzia et al

is the nitrite oxidation rate determined for each ph taking into account the effect of substrate nitrite and bacteria the oxidation of ammonium and nitrite is related with the growth of nitrifying bacteria the lag period lag time tl in the bacterial growth is followed by the logarithmic or the exponential phase baty and delignette muller 2004 zwietering et al 1990 eqs 4 6 do not consider the lag time and therefore can describe only the growth of nitrifying bacteria in the exponential phase some authors have dealt with the simulation of the bacterial growth and have proposed several models to simulate the bacterial growth annuar et al 2008 augustin and carlier 2000 buchanan et al 1997 mochizuki and hattori 1987 ocampo lópez et al 2015 pamment et al 1978 rosso et al 1996 zwietering et al 1990 although many efforts have been made these models are either too complicated too many parameters need to be estimated or do not consider the lag phase of the bacterial growth furthermore most of the empirical models contain mathematical parameters rather than parameters with biological meaning k tl zwietering et al 1990 deterministic models with parameters having biological meanings are easier to understand and to calibrate in order to simulate the changing of ammonium nitrite and nitrate for the entire nitrification experiment in this study taking into account of the lag period tl eqs 4 6 are modified as follows 7 d n h 4 d t k a n h 4 1 e x p t t l a w 8 d n o 2 d t k a n h 4 1 e x p t t l a w k n n o 2 1 e x p t t l b w 9 d n o 3 d t k n n o 2 1 e x p t t l b w where t is the simulation time tl a and tl b is the lag time for aob and nob and w is a shape parameter dimensionless for the simulation of the entire nitrification experiment in this study the differential eqs 7 9 were used and implemented in matlab the matlab procedures for solving differential equations are based on the runge kutta algorithm to solve eqs 7 9 function ode45 was applied the matlab procedure ode45 is a combination of a 4th order runge kutta method with a 5th order method the calibration parameter estimation was carried out with an optimization procedure and is done by the method of least root of mean square error rmse the root of mean square error obtained for each ph is calculated as follows 10 l θ i 1 n f t i θ g i 2 n where θ θ 1 θp parameters need to be calibrated optimized ka kn

data and all ph values were taken into account 11 y θ j 1 m i 1 n f t i p h j θ g i j 2 n where m is the number of the ph values m 9 for the optimization of ammonium eq 11 becomes 12 y θ j 1 m i 1 n f

calibration optimization of nitrite and nitrate was carried out after finishing the calibration optimization of ammonium for the optimization the method fminsearchbnd of matlab was chosen fminsearchbnd is a derivative free method it is used to optimize nonlinear functions with inequality constraints the matlab method fminsearchbnd uses the simplex method of nelder mead to solve the optimization problem the idea of the nelder mead method is to create a sequence of simplexes that will be ideally smaller and smaller in diameter to reach the desired minimum the oxidation rates ka and kn in eqs 7 9 represent the specific rates of the ammonium oxidation and the nitrite oxidation when aob and nob grow exponentially the simulated concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate using the proposed eqs 7 9 are shown in fig 4 as the unit of the oxidation rate is d 1 the time in the x axis was changed from hours to days for all ph values a good agreement between simulated and measured data was achieved this is confirmed by high coefficients of determination r2 and high nash sutcliffe coefficients of efficiency e the coefficients r 2 at ph 5 are 0 00 due to the measured values of ammonium nitrite and nitrate being constant over time also very low concentrations of nitrite 0 5 mg n l at ph 5 ph 5 3 and ph 5 6 cause low coefficients of r 2 and e in contrast to r 2 which evaluates the linear relationships between simulated and measured values nash sutcliffe coefficient e takes into account the differences in the measured and simulated values krause et al 2005 legates and mccabe 1999 it is thus more suitable in the model evaluation the model parameters in eqs 7 9 which were optimized during the simulation of the nitrification experiment are summarized in table 2 the ammonium oxidation rate ka and nitrite oxidation rate kn were estimated for each ph these values allow a first estimation of the influence of the ph value on the oxidation activity of aob and nob for ph 8 5 the sole ammonium oxidation rate could not be correctly estimated due to ammonium loss as a result of ammonia volatilisation the ka at ph 8 5 represents therefore the sum of ammonium oxidation and ammonia volatilisation table 2 shows that the highest activity of the aob and nob was found at ph 7 5 and ph 7 0 for the tay ninh river respectively for ph values lower than 6 0 the ka value is very low it increased strongly from 0 16 d 1 to 1 17 d 1 as the ph value increased from 6 0 to 6 5 and stayed increasing until ph 7 5 this indicates that aob of the tay ninh river are sensitive to ph lower than 6 0 in comparison to aob the oxidation of nob is rarely inhibited at low ph values the kn at ph 5 3 is almost high as the kn at ph 6 5 and only a bit lower than the kn at ph 7 0 at ph 8 5 nob in contrast to aob are almost completely inhibited the simulation results fit well to the interpretation in section 3 1 and indicate that eqs 7 9 can be used to simulate the nitrification in the experiment whereby only two biological parameters oxidation rate and lag time are considered for the simulation of ammonium oxidation and nitrite oxidation in detail and following the biological behaviour eqs 1 3 should be applied in these equations the effect of water temperature do ph substrate concentration and nitrifying bacteria population are taken into account in most of the existing inland water quality models the effects of water temperature and do are simulated using the popular modified arrhenius commonly called the theta approach and the michaelis menten approach bicknell et al 2005 chapra et al 2012 cole and wells 2017 deltares 2011 dhi 2003 hipsey et al 2006 martin and wool 2002 neitsch et al 2011 while the dependency of nitrification on water temperature and do has received intensive attention by the watershed modelling community the effect of substrate ph and bacteria on this process has been mostly neglected different oxidation rates for aob and nob at different ph values determined in this study emphasize the importance of taking into account the effect of ph in the nitrification modelling of river basins 4 conclusions a laboratory microcosm experiment was carried out to investigate the nitrification process in the water column of the tay ninh river at various ph values under optimum do and at optimum water temperature the results show that the actual ammonium oxidation rate of the tay ninh river are very low appear to be zero and that the ammonium oxidation is completely inhibited at ph 5 0 while the nitrite oxidation in contrast to the ammonium oxidation is strongly inhibited at ph 8 5 the actual nitrite oxidation rate in the water column of the river could not be examined in the experiment due to the substrate deficiency we also found out that the nob in the tay ninh river is insensitive to low ph and that ph values of 7 5 and 7 0 are optimal for the activity of aob and nob respectively using the temporal change in concentrations of ammonium and nitrate nitrification rates at different ph values of ammonium oxidation and nitrite oxidation were determined they are determining constants in the modelling of the nitrification process as part of water quality modelling for a sustainable water management nowadays existing water quality models which include the nitrification process are increasingly applied to simulate impacts of different treatment facilities on point sources and diffuse sources and to manage the water quality sustainably le et al 2012 in such models biochemical processes such as nitrification are mathematically represented and simulated many of them simplify the two step nitrification process as a one step process whereby ammonium is directly converted to nitrate the separate oxidation of ammonium to nitrite und further to nitrate is omitted the dependency of nitrification on the substrate availability the amount of bacteria as well as on the ph value is also not taken into account the results of our study emphasize the importance of considering the ph effect on nitrification modelling of river basins moreover the nitrifying bacteria population should be simultaneously simulated in doing so nitrification can be simulated realistically and sustainable water management can be carried out successfully acknowledgements this study is part of the german

influencing the bio concentration of metals karez et al 1994 zeng et al 2015 suspended matter is the most important pathway for the distribution and transport of metals the main part of the metal can be expected to be bound into sediments with smaller grain size which have relatively higher surface area onyari 1985 investigation under laboratory conditions have revealed that zn can strongly bond

being polluted by various heavy metals ganeshkumar et al 2018a rajaram et al 2017 hence the present study was made with the following objectives 1 to provide the detailed investigation on accumulation and translocation efficiency of essential zn and cu and non essential cd and pb elements in the mangrove species r mucronata collected from muthupet mangrove ecosystem by different seasons 2 to understand the accumulation and distribution of metals by calculating bioaccumulation factors baf and translocation factors tf 2 materials and methods the sediment associated with r mucronata was collected at a depth of 10cm with 7 5cm of internal diameter of 1m acid washed pvc pipes plant parts viz bark root stem leaves and branch were collected by cutting with stainless steel knife all the samples were washed with double distilled water and packed to the laboratory for further analysis plant samples were identified using the standard method banerjee et al 1989 and the specimens stored in the department of marine science bharathidasan university for future reference plant tissues were shade dried for 7 10 days depending on the tissue nature sediment samples were oven dried at 80 c until the moisture were removed the excessive plant roots present in the sediment samples were manually peeled off the dried samples were ground to normalize the size of 2mm powder through acid cleaned dry mortar and pestle and sieved sieved samples were weighed 1g and digested with 10ml of hno3 h2so4 and hclo4 acid mixture 5 2 1 ratio at 100 c the clear solution was obtained after 30min of proper digestion the additional few drops of hydrochloric acid 2moll 1 were added to obtain complete digested sample jonathan et al 2008 ganeshkumar et al 2018b milli q water was added to digested samples and made to 25ml filtered with a whatman no 1 filter paper likewise 0 5g of each plant sample was digested without the addition of 2m hydrochloric acid the solution was kept at room temperature for further analysis the concentration of heavy metals cu cd pb and zn in sediment and plant samples was analyzed using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer faas 7000 shimadzu during the instrumental analysis no traces of metals were observed however each batch of digestion was carried out with control acids without addition of sample the working wavelength for the heavy metals are 213 85nm for zn 324 75nm for cu 228 80nm for cd and 217 00nm for pb quality assurance and quality control table 1 testing was relied on the control of blanks and yield for chemical procedure 2 1 bioaccumulation and translocation factors bioaccumulation factor baf is a ratio of metal concentration in the surrounding environment and the specified tissues root shoot bark branch and leaf of studying plant mackay and fraser 2000 cui et al 2007 translocation is the ability of plant to uptake and distribute the various elements across the plant body it is estimated by calculating translocation factor both bioaccumulation factors baf and translocation factors tf can be used as indicators to estimate phyto remediation potential of plant yoon et al 2006 baf concentration in tissues concentration in rhizosphere sediment tf concentration in tissue leaf stem bark and branch concentration in root 2 2 statistical analysis two way analysis of variance anova was performed to identify the significant difference between the metal concentration in different plant tissues associated sediment of r mucronata and the different seasons of muthupet mangroves before performing the test the dataset was tested for their distribution and homogeneity mathivanan and rajaram 2013 eid and shaltout 2016 rajaram et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 heavy metal concentration in associated sediment of r mucronata the mean concentrations of heavy metals cu cd pb and zn in r mucronata tissues and the associated sediment from muthupet mangroves were studied in all the four seasons and presented in table 2 the higher concentration of zinc 38 37mg kg was found in summer and lower 7 80mg kg in pre monsoon in sediment the lower concentration of lead 0 43mg kg and copper 2 88mg kg were observed in pre monsoon and for cadmium 0 04mg kg in post monsoon season the higher concentration of lead 17 49mg kg copper 14 28mg kg and cadmium 0 84mg kg were present in summer monsoon and post monsoon respectively table 2 concentration of heavy metal in the study has the following order zn pb cu cd zinc is an essential element of living being for their active metabolism and it is usually present in the environment few of the previous studies has reported the elevation of zn in the sediment of same study area priya et al 2014 usha natesan et al 2014 balakrishnan et al 2015 ganeshkumar et al 2018a however several natural or manmade activities such as effluents from paint and pigment industries sludge dumping sites municipal waste processing sites mine tailing coal combustion and agriculture run off containing zinc traces from the pesticide and fertilizers might influence the increased concentration of zinc in the study area bostick et al 2001 described the seasonal flooding influences zinc speciation the occurrence of zinc found either as hydroxide phases or associated with sulfides and carbonates in dry oxidized soil and flooding system respectively during the course of time some of the zn reminds with hydroxide phases which may influence the elevated level metals during the summer season the higher concentration of pb in the study area was presented by rajaram et al 2017 and in cuddalore coast mathivanan and rajaram 2013 due to extended anthropogenic activities including the release of fuel additives applying of antifouling paints etc elevated level of metals during the post monsoon may be attributed to the heavy rainfall monsoon carrying heavy metal load from the industrial area via subsequent river runoff rajaram et al 2013 agriculture aquaculture and idol immersion activities in muthupet mangroves ganeshkumar et al 2018a rajaram et al 2017 moreover the concentrations of heavy metal in the study area was several folds lesser than the other mangrove ecosystem in the world such as futian mangrove south china r li et al 2015 nansha mangrove china q h wu et al 2014 hong kong mangrove swamps tam and wong 2000 pearl river south china bai et al 2011 also it exceeds several folds than upper continental earth crust level taylor and mclennan 1985 fig 1 3 2 concentration of heavy metals in mangrove species among the metals studied in the tissues of r mucronata the heavy metal concentrations were low during monsoon season and higher during post monsoon and summer season the average concentration of cu was 2 53mg kg ranged between 0 76 and 14 35mg kg in tissues of r mucronata and elevated level reaches up to 14 35mg kg in bark tissue during post monsoon season whereas lowest value 0 76mg kg during monsoon table 2 the results of linear model regression indicated that the concentration of metals in rhizosphere sediment of r mucronata was statistically insignificant with the concentration of metals in all of the plant tissue the strong positive correlation was observed for leaf whereas strong negative correlation was found in branch stem bark and root fig 2 cu is an essential metal and distributed all over the plant tissues and it is widespread because of industrial and agricultural usages unlike other heavy metal it affects less to mammals and other organisms the excess content adversely affects the biochemical properties seedling growth reduce the biomass leaf growth oxygen intake and also alter the anatomy of the root cells till its cellular level and inhibits the oxygen uptake fernandes and henriques 1991 cheng et al 2012 the elevated level of cd concentration was observed in the bark 0 62mg kg of r mucronata during the summer season the obtained values were slightly higher than the concentration of cd in sediment and several folds lesser than the concentration present in the other plant tissues by performing regression model analysis a strong negative relationship was found in the concentration of cd in sediment and the bark however the cd concentration in sediment was strongly associated with stem p 0 05 r 2 0 93 and branch p 0 05 r 2 0 83 followed by other plant tissues fig 2 cd is a non essential toxic metal inhibiting the plant biomass reproduction and its higher accumulation in soil may lead to the translocation and bioaccumulation on plant tissues the concentration of pb in tissues of r mucronata ranged between 6 20 and 26 57mg kg in leaf and bark when the pb concentration is compared with all the seasons the post monsoon season concentration was higher than the pre monsoon and summer during the monsoon season the level of metal was relatively lesser in all the plant tissues table 2 there is no strong relationship found between pb concentration in sediment and other plant tissues in the regression analysis p 0 05 lead is one of the widely distributed metals which is toxic to all biotic organisms so their uptake on plants is very limited zheng et al 1996 macfarlane 2002 the accumulation of lead in muthupet mangrove ecosystem increased because of the aquaculture wastage priya et al 2014 thilagavathi et al 2011 higher concentration of zn was recorded from the bark samples of r mucronata 61 67mg kg during summer while lower concentration was in leaf tissue during the monsoon season the elongation rate of r mucronata leaves was higher and faster during the summer season with low salinity farooqui and siddiqui 2014 values recorded from the plant tissues ranged between 1 75 and 61 67mg kg accumulated metal concentrations in sediment had a strong positive influence on metal concentrations in plant tissues such as bark root and branch and the correlations reached 99 of significance the moderate positive correlation was observed in plant tissues like the leaf r 0 72 p 0 05 and stem r 0 69 p 0 05 one way anova results suggest that there was a non significant difference found between metal concentrations of the plant tissues at 0 05 level p 0 05 cu 0 20 cd 0 51 pb 0 94 and zn 0 56 table 3 r mucronata showed a unique type of translocation for non essential elements thus facilitates reabsorption of these elements in the aerial parts in contrast differences in metal concentration among the plant tissues were not statistically significant pahalawattaarachchi et al 2009 the root samples had a high concentration of heavy metal accumulation followed by bark and leaves in all the three seasons and the monsoon season showed the maximum concentration of all the metals followed by post monsoon and pre monsoon seasons chakraborty et al 2013 during the growth and development of the new leaves plant rapidly intakes the nutrients and water from the surrounding environment farooqui and siddiqui 2014 this mechanism was proved by saenger and mcconchie 2004 in avicennia marina which tends to accumulate more cu and zn in young leaves than in old leaves it has been suggested that salt marsh plants transfer oxygen from aerial roots and may release it to roots into the anoxic sediment silva et al 1990 showed higher availability of zn mn and cu concentrations in fine roots of rhizophora mangle surrounding sediments worldwide reports were available on the heavy metal concentrations in different plants among them arabidopsis halleri and noccaea caerulescens were defined as hyper accumulators of cd and zn in addition baker and brooks 1989 suggested that potential metal hyper accumulators have both baf and tf values more than one wei et al 2004 3 3 bioaccumulation factor table 4 represents the bioaccumulation baf and translocation factors tf of the r mucronata collected from muthupet mangroves among the studied four metals r mucronata tend to accumulate more pb baf 1 from the environment in all the plant tissues while other metals like cu cd and zn show the baf value below 1 the higher degree of bioaccumulation was observed in bark tissue when concerning baf of r mucronata it seems that the other elements like cu and zn were relatively lesser accumulation rate than the non essential elements like cd and pb by comparing all the plant tissues the bark has the tendency to accumulate more heavy metal by processing unique bioaccumulation rate table 4 limited mobility was observed for cd and zn while other elements have greater mobility from root to other parts especially all the elements were rapidly mobilized towards bark tissues the above results were contradictory to pahalawattaarachchi et al 2009 moreover the above results suggest that r mucronata has the potency to accumulate heavy metals in their parts through the active transportation mechanism and it was supported by m s li et al 2007 in plants like c aromatica d sanguinalis o fordii from mineland in guangxi south china has increased baf for cd while the baf values were comparatively less than one this could be the unique excluder mechanism of that plants 3 4 translocation factor the ability of compartmentalization of heavy metals like cu cd pb and zn by r mucronata was evaluated by translocation factor tf in the present study the tf of metals in plant tissues was 0 49 2 37 in branch and bark tissues table 4 significant variations were observed in the tf of metals in plant tissues from 0 49 2 37 in branch and bark tissues table 4 higher percentage of root to bark and leaf translocation of cu indicates that r mucronata have unique characteristics to be used for extraction translocation and accumulation of these metals ghosh and singh 2005 addition of chelating agents edta may enhance the absorption and translocation rate of non essential elements like cd and pb in higher plants hovsepyan and greipsson 2005 the translocation ratio of non essential element like cd and pb in root to above ground parts was higher also translocation ratio of cd and pb was three times higher for root to bark pahalawattaarachchi et al 2009 the essential and non essential metals such as cu and pb have opposite direction of translocation pattern in forest tree picea mariana pb shows increased concentration in plant tissues with respect to number of years while cu was less in their concentration during the growth phase the non essential element was rapidly translocated to above ground part of the tree through passive foliar accumulation but not for the essential element cu aznar et al 2009 our results also suggested that elevated level of pb was observed during post monsoon while summer season recorded as their growth phase likewise yoon et al 2006 and mullai et al 2014 observed that several plant species and r mucronata has baf and tf values lesser than one for essential element like cu and zn but the behaviour was not observed during study period for non essential element pb pahalawattaarachchi et al 2009 observed that the baf and tf values of r mucronata was 1 for essential metals whereas it was 1 for non essential element reduced translocation and bioaccumulation was observed for zn by r mucronata since it was an essential nutrient for plant system pahalawattaarachchi et al 2009 thomas and eong 1984 in the present study no statistical significance was found between heavy metal concentration in associated sediment and the concentration present in the plant tissues likely to be reported by several authors peterson et al 1979 silva et al 1990 lacerda et al 1993 de lacerda 1998 proposed that mangroves are poor accumulators of trace metals they have lesser concentration factor inability to accumulate because of the specific exclusion mechanism other than this sulfides precipitation complexation with organic matters of mangrove sediment and barriers at the root endodermis tend to have a lesser bioavailability of trace metals in several mangrove plants de lacerda 1998 peterson et al 1979 the field study by de lacerda et al 1986 in avicennia schaueriana showed that zinc was more mobile metal than cu by showing significant positive correlation with sediment and leaf components whereas the non essential element pb was found to be immobile in a schaueriana leaf tissue the present values in plant tissues were several folds higher than the who recommended values for plant protection but the concentrations recorded in the sediment samples were many fold lesser than the sediment quality guidelines table 5 but positive correlation of metal concentration in sediment with metal concentration in plant tissues indicated that r mucronata could be a good option for pollution monitoring 4 conclusion the studied species was found to accumulate and translocate both essential and non essential elements from the surrounding environment at different levels with tissue concentrations equal or greater than the surrounding medium the results are based on the field observations and metal analysis through faas technique the metal concentrations were shown in the following order zn pb cu cd this study concluded that r mucronata was found to be highly tolerant to elevated levels of the essential and non essential metals and no greater impact was observed in contrast the uptake of the non essential element pb was highest translocated into branch and bark likewise cu showed enhanced partitioning in all the plant parts with the lowest accumulation rate controversially cd and zn exhibited limited accumulation cd 0 51 0 63 zn 0 32 0 89 and minimal mobility cd 0 81 1 03 zn 0 49 1 35 mangrove areas are subjected to extensive environmental stress due to the manmade activities like urbanization and industrialization which feebly affect the ecosystem in this critical situation this study gives information about the mangrove ecosystem heath status however lack of field based observation appropriate regulation and awareness of the local peoples are the major concern the phyto remediation potency of the mangrove species was influenced by several factors including plant age growth biomass production and different season bioaccumulation and translocation of metals by r mucronata was limited but the results indicates that r mucronata could be used as phyto stabilizer of essential elements and it will be used as bioindicator for elevated levels of non essential elements like pb in muthupet as reported in other mangrove ecosystems in different parts of the world conflict of

in the department of marine science bharathidasan university for future reference plant tissues were shade dried for 7 10 days depending on the tissue nature sediment samples were oven dried at 80 c until the moisture were removed the excessive plant roots present in the sediment samples were manually peeled off the dried samples were ground to normalize the size of 2mm powder through acid cleaned dry mortar and pestle and sieved sieved samples were weighed 1g and digested with 10ml of hno3 h2so4 and hclo4 acid mixture 5 2 1 ratio at 100 c the clear solution was obtained after 30min of proper digestion the additional few drops of hydrochloric acid 2moll 1 were added to obtain complete digested sample jonathan et al 2008 ganeshkumar et al 2018b milli q water was added to digested samples and made to 25ml filtered with a whatman no 1 filter paper likewise 0 5g of each plant sample was digested without the addition of 2m hydrochloric acid the solution was kept at room temperature for further analysis the concentration of heavy metals cu cd pb and zn in sediment and plant samples was analyzed using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer faas 7000 shimadzu during the instrumental analysis no traces of metals were observed however each batch of digestion was carried out with control acids without addition of sample the working wavelength for the heavy metals are 213 85nm for zn 324 75nm for cu 228 80nm for cd and 217 00nm for pb quality assurance and quality control table 1 testing was relied on the control of blanks and yield for chemical procedure 2 1 bioaccumulation and translocation factors bioaccumulation factor baf is a ratio of metal concentration in the surrounding environment and the specified tissues root shoot bark branch and leaf of studying plant mackay and fraser 2000 cui et al 2007 translocation is the ability of plant to uptake and distribute the various elements across the plant body it is estimated by calculating translocation factor both bioaccumulation factors baf and translocation factors tf can be used as indicators to estimate phyto remediation potential of plant yoon et al 2006 baf concentration in tissues concentration in rhizosphere sediment tf concentration in tissue leaf stem bark and branch concentration in root 2 2 statistical analysis two way analysis of variance anova was performed to identify the significant difference between the metal concentration in different plant tissues associated sediment of r mucronata and the different seasons of muthupet mangroves before performing the test the dataset was tested for their distribution and homogeneity mathivanan and rajaram 2013 eid and shaltout 2016 rajaram et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 heavy metal concentration in associated sediment of r mucronata the mean concentrations of heavy metals cu cd pb and zn in r mucronata tissues and the associated sediment from muthupet mangroves were studied in all the four seasons and presented in table 2 the higher concentration of zinc 38 37mg kg was found in summer and lower 7 80mg kg in pre monsoon in sediment the lower concentration of lead 0 43mg kg and copper 2 88mg kg were observed in pre monsoon and for cadmium 0 04mg kg in post monsoon season the higher concentration of lead 17 49mg kg copper 14 28mg kg and cadmium 0 84mg kg were present in summer monsoon and post monsoon respectively table 2 concentration of heavy metal in the study has the following order zn pb cu cd zinc is an essential element of living being for their active metabolism and it is usually present in the environment few of the previous studies has reported the elevation of zn in the sediment of same study area priya et al 2014 usha natesan et al 2014 balakrishnan et al 2015 ganeshkumar et al 2018a however several natural or manmade activities such as effluents from paint and pigment industries sludge dumping sites municipal waste processing sites mine tailing coal combustion and agriculture run off containing zinc traces from the pesticide and fertilizers might influence the increased concentration of zinc in the study area bostick et al 2001 described the seasonal flooding influences zinc speciation the occurrence of zinc found either as hydroxide phases or associated with sulfides and carbonates in dry oxidized soil and flooding system respectively during the course of time some of the zn reminds with hydroxide phases which may influence the elevated level metals during the summer season the higher concentration of pb in the study area was presented by rajaram et al 2017 and in cuddalore coast mathivanan and rajaram 2013 due to extended anthropogenic activities including the release of fuel additives applying of antifouling paints etc elevated level of metals during the post monsoon may be attributed to the heavy rainfall monsoon carrying heavy metal load from the industrial area via subsequent river runoff rajaram et al 2013 agriculture aquaculture and idol immersion activities in muthupet mangroves ganeshkumar et al 2018a rajaram et al 2017 moreover the concentrations of heavy metal in the study area was several folds lesser than the other mangrove ecosystem in the world such as futian mangrove south china r li et al 2015 nansha mangrove china q h wu et al 2014 hong kong mangrove swamps tam and wong 2000 pearl river south china bai et al 2011 also it exceeds several folds than upper continental earth crust level taylor and mclennan 1985 fig 1 3 2 concentration of heavy metals in mangrove species among the metals studied in the tissues of r mucronata the heavy metal concentrations were low during monsoon season and higher during post monsoon and summer season the average concentration of cu was 2 53mg kg ranged between 0 76 and 14 35mg kg in tissues of r mucronata and elevated level reaches up to 14 35mg kg in bark tissue during post monsoon season whereas lowest value 0 76mg kg during monsoon table 2 the results of linear model regression indicated that the concentration of metals in rhizosphere sediment of r mucronata was statistically insignificant with the concentration of metals in all of the plant tissue the strong positive correlation was observed for leaf whereas strong negative correlation was found in branch stem bark and root fig 2 cu is an essential metal and distributed all over the plant tissues and it is widespread because of industrial and agricultural usages unlike other heavy metal it affects less to mammals and other organisms the excess content adversely affects the biochemical properties seedling growth reduce the biomass leaf growth oxygen intake and also alter the anatomy of the root cells till its cellular level and inhibits the oxygen uptake fernandes and henriques 1991 cheng et al 2012 the elevated level of cd concentration was observed in the bark 0 62mg kg of r mucronata during the summer season the obtained values were slightly higher than the concentration of cd in sediment and several folds lesser than the concentration present in the other plant tissues by performing regression model analysis a strong negative relationship was found in the concentration of cd in sediment and the bark however the cd concentration in sediment was strongly associated with stem p 0 05 r 2 0 93 and branch p 0 05 r 2 0 83 followed by other plant tissues fig 2 cd is a non essential toxic metal inhibiting the plant biomass reproduction and its higher accumulation in soil may lead to the translocation and bioaccumulation on plant tissues the concentration of pb in tissues of r mucronata ranged between 6 20 and 26 57mg kg in leaf and bark when the pb concentration is compared with all the seasons the post monsoon season concentration was higher than the pre monsoon and summer during the monsoon season the level of metal was relatively lesser in all the plant tissues table 2 there is no strong relationship found between pb concentration in sediment and other plant tissues in the regression analysis p 0 05 lead is one of the widely distributed metals which is toxic to all biotic organisms so their uptake on plants is very limited zheng et al 1996 macfarlane 2002 the accumulation of lead in muthupet mangrove ecosystem increased because of the aquaculture wastage priya et al 2014 thilagavathi et al 2011 higher concentration of zn was recorded from the bark samples of r mucronata 61 67mg kg during summer while lower concentration was in leaf tissue during the monsoon season the elongation rate of r mucronata leaves was higher and faster during the summer season with low salinity farooqui and siddiqui 2014 values recorded from the plant tissues ranged between 1 75 and 61 67mg kg accumulated metal concentrations in sediment had a strong positive influence on metal concentrations in plant tissues such as bark root and branch and the correlations reached 99 of significance the moderate positive correlation was observed in plant tissues like the leaf r 0 72 p 0 05 and stem r 0 69 p 0 05 one way anova results suggest that there was a non significant difference found between metal concentrations of the plant tissues at 0 05 level p 0 05 cu 0 20 cd 0 51 pb 0 94 and zn 0 56 table 3 r mucronata showed a unique type of translocation for non essential elements thus facilitates reabsorption of these elements in the aerial parts in contrast differences in metal concentration among the plant tissues were not statistically significant pahalawattaarachchi et al 2009 the root samples had a high concentration of heavy metal accumulation followed by bark and leaves in all the three seasons and the monsoon season showed the maximum concentration of all the metals followed by post monsoon and pre monsoon seasons chakraborty et al 2013 during the growth and development of the new leaves plant rapidly intakes the nutrients and water from the surrounding environment farooqui and siddiqui 2014 this mechanism was proved by saenger and mcconchie 2004 in avicennia marina which tends to accumulate more cu and zn in young leaves than in old leaves it has been suggested that salt marsh plants transfer oxygen from aerial roots and may release it to roots into the anoxic sediment silva et al 1990 showed higher availability of zn mn and cu concentrations in fine roots of rhizophora mangle surrounding sediments worldwide reports were available on the heavy metal concentrations in different plants among them arabidopsis halleri and noccaea caerulescens were defined as hyper accumulators of cd and zn in addition baker and brooks 1989 suggested that potential metal hyper accumulators have both baf and tf values more than one wei et al 2004 3 3 bioaccumulation factor table 4 represents the bioaccumulation baf and translocation factors tf of the r mucronata collected from muthupet mangroves among the studied four metals r mucronata tend to accumulate more pb baf 1 from the environment in all the plant tissues while other metals like cu cd and zn show the baf value below 1 the higher degree of bioaccumulation was observed in bark tissue when concerning baf of r mucronata it seems that the other elements like cu and zn were relatively lesser accumulation rate than the non essential elements like cd and pb by comparing all the plant tissues the bark has the tendency to accumulate more heavy metal by processing unique bioaccumulation rate table 4 limited mobility was observed for cd and zn while other elements have greater mobility from root to other parts especially all the elements were rapidly mobilized towards bark tissues the above results were contradictory to pahalawattaarachchi et al 2009 moreover the above results suggest that r mucronata has the potency to accumulate heavy metals in their parts through the active transportation mechanism and it was supported by m s li et al 2007 in plants like c aromatica d sanguinalis o fordii from mineland in guangxi south china has increased baf for cd while the baf values were comparatively less than one this could be the unique excluder mechanism of that plants 3 4 translocation factor the ability of compartmentalization of heavy metals like cu cd pb and zn by r mucronata was evaluated by translocation factor tf in the present study the tf of metals in plant tissues was 0 49 2 37 in branch and bark tissues table 4 significant variations were observed in the tf of metals in plant tissues from 0 49 2 37 in branch and bark tissues table 4 higher percentage of root to bark and leaf translocation of cu indicates that r mucronata have unique characteristics to be used for extraction translocation and accumulation of these metals ghosh and singh 2005 addition of chelating agents edta may enhance the absorption and translocation rate of non essential elements like cd and pb in higher plants hovsepyan and greipsson 2005 the translocation ratio of non essential element like cd and pb in root to above ground parts was higher also translocation ratio of cd and pb was three times higher for root to bark pahalawattaarachchi et al 2009 the essential and non essential metals such as cu and pb have opposite direction of translocation pattern in forest tree picea mariana pb shows increased concentration in plant tissues with respect to number of years while cu was less in their concentration during the growth phase the non essential element was rapidly translocated to above ground part of the tree through passive foliar accumulation but not for the essential element cu aznar et al 2009 our results also suggested that elevated level of pb was observed during post monsoon while summer season recorded as their growth phase likewise yoon et al 2006 and mullai et al 2014 observed that several plant species and r mucronata has baf and tf values lesser than one for essential element like cu and zn but the behaviour was not observed during study period for non essential element pb pahalawattaarachchi et al 2009 observed that the baf and tf values of r mucronata was 1 for essential metals whereas it was 1 for non essential element reduced translocation and bioaccumulation was observed for zn by r mucronata since it was an essential nutrient for plant system pahalawattaarachchi et al 2009 thomas and eong 1984 in the present study no statistical significance was found between heavy metal concentration in associated sediment and the concentration present in the plant tissues likely to be reported by several authors peterson et al 1979 silva et al 1990 lacerda et al 1993 de lacerda 1998 proposed that mangroves are poor accumulators of trace metals they have lesser concentration factor inability to accumulate because of the specific exclusion mechanism other than this sulfides precipitation complexation with organic matters of mangrove sediment and barriers at the root endodermis tend to have a lesser bioavailability of trace metals in several mangrove plants de lacerda 1998 peterson et al 1979 the field study by de lacerda et al 1986 in avicennia schaueriana showed that zinc was more mobile metal than cu by showing significant positive correlation with sediment and leaf components whereas the non essential element pb was found to be immobile in a schaueriana leaf tissue the present values in plant tissues were several folds higher than the who recommended values for plant protection but the concentrations recorded in the sediment samples were many fold lesser than the sediment quality guidelines table 5 but positive correlation of metal concentration in sediment with metal concentration in plant tissues indicated that r mucronata could be a good option for pollution monitoring 4 conclusion the studied species was found to accumulate and translocate both essential and non essential elements from the surrounding environment at different levels with tissue concentrations equal or greater than the surrounding medium the results are based on the field observations and metal analysis through faas technique the metal concentrations were shown in the following order zn pb cu cd this study concluded that r mucronata was found to be highly tolerant to elevated levels of the essential and non essential metals and no greater impact was observed in contrast the uptake of the non essential element pb was highest translocated into branch and bark likewise cu showed enhanced partitioning in all the plant parts with the lowest accumulation rate controversially cd and zn exhibited limited accumulation cd 0 51 0 63 zn 0 32 0 89 and minimal mobility cd 0 81 1 03 zn 0 49 1 35 mangrove areas are subjected to extensive environmental stress due to the manmade activities like urbanization and industrialization which feebly affect the ecosystem in this critical situation this study gives information about the mangrove ecosystem heath status however lack of field based observation appropriate regulation and awareness of the local peoples are the major concern the phyto remediation potency of the mangrove species was influenced by several factors including plant age growth biomass production and different season bioaccumulation and translocation of metals by r mucronata was limited but the results indicates that r mucronata could be used as phyto stabilizer of essential elements and it will be used as bioindicator for elevated levels of non essential elements like pb in muthupet as reported in other mangrove ecosystems in different parts of the world conflict of
