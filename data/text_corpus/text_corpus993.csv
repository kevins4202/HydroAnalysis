4965,extreme floods pose a threat to life and property and accurate and reliable flood forecasts are required to mitigate the consequences of these events in this paper we propose a novel monte carlo based framework that utilizes an ensemble based short term flood forecasting model an event based rainfall runoff model is selected due to its simplicity and wide use by industry practitioners however a challenge with event models is that they are unable to account for the initial condition of the catchment wetness at the commencement of a particular rainfall event to address this issue we used independent catchment average estimates of soil moisture to estimate catchment losses at the commencement and over the duration of the event the adopted framework enables uncertainty in catchment losses and rainfall depth and patterns to be quantified and incorporated in forecasts the accuracy and reliability of stochastic components of this framework are evaluated using ensemble verification measures later these measures are used to evaluate four scenarios based on different combinations of deterministic and stochastic conditions in the stochastic scenarios the uncertainty of the flood forecasts is reliably quantified 88 reliability on average the results show that operationally available estimates of catchment wetness can be used to account for uncertainty from event based loss parameters and that the uncertainty from average forecast rainfall depth is considerably more important than the uncertainty from forecast losses and the spatio temporal patterns of the rainfall this study has shown that event based models have the potential to be applied within a probabilistic framework to operationally generate probabilistic flood forecasts keywords probabilistic flood forecasts event based rainfall runoff model ensemble initial loss ensemble rainfall monte carlo simulation 1 introduction extreme floods are becoming more frequent and pose a threat to life as well as causing severe damage to property and infrastructure adams and pagano 2016 kauffeldt et al 2016 wmo 2013 flood warnings are issued to provide the general public and agencies with information about impending floods to minimize the possible negative impacts the provision of flood warnings may be deemed effective when the endangered communities are provided with an understanding of potential flood risks in a timely manner however when forecasts are required for active flood management e g the operation of flood gates to control water flows there is an increased need to quantify uncertainty in both the timing and magnitude of the forecasts so that decision makers can evaluate management options often in the face of strong asymmetry in the consequences of over or under estimates demeritt et al 2007 for example if the magnitude of a flood is under estimated then operators of a dam are less likely to take pre emptive action and this increases the likelihood that the dam may be overtopped and fail catastrophically conversely if the forecasts are over estimated then operators may release more floodwater than necessary and this may incrementally increase the consequences of downstream flooding the trade offs involved in balancing the benefits of pre emptive warnings with the costs of false negatives represent a duality of errors demeritt et al 2007 and reinforces the importance of explicitly including uncertainty in forecast products krzysztofowicz 2001 montanari and grossi 2008 zhao et al 2015 and in decision making dietrich et al 2009 two major sources of uncertainty of crucial importance to the provision of flood forecasts are meteorological inputs and initial catchment wetness silvestro and rebora 2014 with regard to the first source of uncertainty forecast precipitation is assumed to represent the largest source of uncertainty cloke and pappenberger 2009 where the quantitative precipitation forecasts qpfs from numerical weather prediction nwp based models or radar precipitation are used for flood forecasting ran et al 2018 zappa et al 2011a catchment response to rainfall is highly non linear and hence errors in forecast rainfalls are amplified when propagated through to runoff estimates for long 48 h komma et al 2007 and short lead times xuan et al 2009 accordingly considerable attention has been given to the uncertainties associated with numerical weather predictions and their incorporation in ensemble prediction systems cloke and pappenberger 2009 cuo et al 2011 with regard to the second major source of uncertainty catchment wetness prior to and during a rainfall event has a material impact on the peak and volume of a flood event berthet et al 2009 chifflard et al 2018 the methods available to consider the propagation of uncertainty due to antecedent catchment wetness depend heavily on the nature of the selected hydrologic model continuous simulation models explicitly account for catchment wetness prior to large rainfalls and over the last decade several studies have explored the use of satellite observations of soil moisture to update model state variables in order to improve streamflow prediction alvarez garreton et al 2015 laiolo et al 2016 meng et al 2017 in contrast event based models require external specification of the catchment wetness condition often by externally specifying loss characteristics applicable to the specific event coustau et al 2012 this is both a challenge in using event based models tramblay et al 2010 but also gives flexibility to operational flood forecasters when simulating a live event the uncertainty related to specifying initial soil moisture conditions is one of the main reasons why most published literature has focused on the use of continuous simulation models for flood forecasting although it is acknowledged that event based models are still often preferred in real time applications berthet et al 2009 tramblay et al 2012 the reason that event based models remain popular with practitioners is that they require few parameters and have a structure that is specifically designed to mimic the flood response of a catchment nathan and ling 2016 their simple structure facilitates inter operability with other systems and in view of the inaccuracies inherent in hydrologic data and lack of knowledge of actual runoff processes it may be difficult to justify the use of more complex procedures pilgrim and cordery 1993 event based models are readily calibrated and easily implemented have low computational overheads and they do not require long historical data for evaluation or testing berthet et al 2009 sunwoo and choi 2017 berthet et al 2009 evaluated the performance of three different schemes for specifying initial conditions in an event based model and compared their performance to results obtained using a continuous simulation model on a data set of 178 catchments in france the authors concluded that the differences in performance between the models were not significant and that if an efficient assimilation scheme can be devised then event based models could provide a practical alternative to continuous simulation models various authors have assessed the viability of using external schemes for initialising event based models and provided comment on their potential for use in operational flood forecasting the probability distributed moisture pdm model norbiato et al 2008 the antecedent precipitation index api and soil moisture accounting sma models tramblay et al 2012 and a regression based model based on point soil moisture data chifflard et al 2018 schemes have also been developed to estimate initial losses for design purposes using metrics based on 5 day antecedent catchment wetness gamage et al 2015 and using regionalised catchment properties hill et al 2015 the use of continuous simulation models is justified on the basis that they obviate the need to explicitly consider initial catchment wetness though it is recognised that the importance of antecedent conditions is less important than that associated with forecast rainfall yatheendradas et al 2008 zappa et al 2011b at least when long lead times are considered thiboult et al 2016 yatheendradas et al 2008 used a complex physically based event orientated model in a semi arid environment where it might be expected that uncertainty from losses might dominate but the other studies used continuous simulation models no published papers could be found that considered the relative importance of event based losses on forecast performance using the simpler event models that are widely used by practitioners for estimating flood risks for planning and design purposes while it perhaps makes intuitive sense that event based models are not well suited to forecasting because they do not implicitly account for soil moisture little formal evidence has been presented in the literature to support this view however if the uncertainty from estimating event based losses adds little to the overall forecast uncertainty then this opens up the considerable opportunity to use the same flood models that have been developed for planning and management purposes in flood forecasting applications the simpler model structure of event based models would also facilitate the development of data assimilation schemes for parameter updating coustau et al 2013 the advent of operational soil moisture products e g the ascat soil moisture product of global coverage wagner et al 2007 and the awra l model in australia vaze et al 2013 represents an opportunity for external information to be used to inform parameterisation of the catchment wetness for event based models for flood forecasting if the uncertainty associated with using such products is small compared to the uncertainty of forecast rainfalls then this reduces the perceived impediment of using event based models for operational flood forecasting and offers the advantage of using parsimonious models that have long been used for design purposes the relative sources of uncertainty in event based models has received little attention in the published literature and thus in this study we aim to 1 devise a simple scheme to estimate event based loss parameters using operational estimates of soil moisture and 2 compare the relative importance of this source of uncertainty to that associated with rainfall forecasts for this purpose a monte carlo framework is used to derive forecast flow ensembles that represent the uncertainty due to both the depths and spatio temporal patterns of forecast rainfall and to loss estimates the study catchment and data used to investigate the performance of the forecast scheme are described in the next section and this is followed by a description of the simulation framework results are then presented using a range of probabilistic and deterministic evaluation measures that represent the accuracy success rate and reliability of the forecasts the adopted approach makes use of existing models where attention is focused on the estimation of event based losses prior to a flood response being observed in the catchment this approach is adopted as it relates to forecasts with long lead times that are undertaken prior to the catchment response to rainfall this represents a period where uncertainty in loss parameters is at its greatest as there is no information available to allow the loss parameters to be updated via data assimilation 2 study catchment and datasets the study catchment used to investigate the treatment of antecedent conditions is gregor s creek which is located in southeast queensland australia the catchment drains an area of 3876 km2 and forms the upper reaches of the brisbane river which provides inflows to two large gated dams these are dual purpose dams which provide both water supply and flood mitigation primarily for the benefit of the downstream city of brisbane the brisbane river catchment experiences a humid subtropical climate with dry and wet seasons peel and steen 2007 and has mean annual precipitation of approximately 800 mm the land use of the catchment is predominately rural and includes forest and grazing lands a comprehensive range of high quality observed and modelled information is available for this catchment gridded information on daily rainfalls at a spatial resolution of 0 05 about 5 km is available for the past 100 years from the australian water availability project awap jones et al 2009 and hourly rainfalls from three pluviographs located within the catchment are available from 1960 to 2016 as discussed later in the paper section 3 the pluviograph data was used to downscale the daily gridded rainfalls to provide hourly time series of areal rainfalls for three separate sub areas of the catchment six years of deterministic rainfall forecasts are also available from july 2010 these forecasts are issued twice daily by the australian bureau of meteorology and provide forecasts at lead times from 1 to 8 days the forecasts combine the rainfall predictions of eight numerical weather prediction models from around the world and provide estimates of daily rainfall at a spatial resolution of 0 5 about 50 km ebert 2001 the estimates of the numerical weather prediction models are combined using the probability matched ensemble or poor man s ensemble pme as developed and described by ebert 2001 a streamflow gauge is located at the outlet of the study catchment which has 20 years of hourly recorded streamflow data lastly daily information on catchment wetness was obtained from the australian water resource assessment landscape awra l model developed by the bureau of meteorology renzullo et al 2014 van dijk and warren 2010 awra l is a distributed water balance model that provides operational estimates of catchment behaviour at a spatial resolution of 0 05 about 5 km across australia model estimates are updated daily and simulation results are available for the past 100 years of historic climate 3 methodology we develop a novel ensemble based framework to accommodate the use of an event based model for operational flood forecasting in which the uncertainty in forecast rainfall and catchment losses is explicitly considered we focus on the propagation of errors associated with the use of independent information on catchment wetness to estimate initial and ongoing losses for event based prediction of forecast streamflows and we assess the relative importance of these errors to the uncertainty associated with rainfall forecasts considerable effort is expended on improving the performance of rainfall forecast products and one of the consequences of this is that it can be difficult to find long periods over which their performance can be considered consistent for the purposes of evaluation mascaro et al 2010 the six years of available pme rainfall forecasts provide a reasonable range of small and large rainfall events for assessing forecast uncertainty but it provides only a limited number of suitable flood events around 15 events to evaluate the loss initialisation scheme this is insufficient for evaluating a probabilistic forecast or for evaluating forecast uncertainty accordingly we devise a scheme that emulates the behaviour and uncertainty of pme forecasts over a 20 year period concurrent with the observed streamflow record these synthetic forecasts in combination with observed rainfalls gauged streamflows and simulated soil moisture provide a wide range of historic conditions with which to evaluate the performance of the event based ensemble streamflow forecasts the overall view of our framework for deriving event based ensemble forecasts is shown in fig 1 a monte carlo approach is used to reproduce uncertainty in antecedent conditions and forecast rainfall that propagate through to the predicted flood response uncertainty in rainfall and antecedent conditions are predominately aleatory in nature and the distributions that quantify them may be readily obtained from recorded observations it is acknowledged that the influence of epistemic uncertainty on other factors such as routing parameters and observation errors is not considered here uncertainty in catchment losses is represented by the stochastic sampling of errors in a relationship derived between model loss parameters and estimates of soil moisture obtained from the operational awra l continuous simulation model box a fig 1 the behaviour and uncertainty in the synthetic rainfall forecasts is represented by a two step process first we stochastically generate an ensemble of synthetic forecasts using an error model developed from a short period of observed rainfalls and actual forecasts box b fig 1 for each of 31 events selected from 20 years of historic record second we characterize the uncertainty in the average depth of forecast rainfall and its spatio temporal distribution by generating a 100 member ensemble that uses information on storm patterns obtained from similar historical events outside the forecast period of interest box c fig 1 the generated ensemble rainfall and loss parameters yellow boxes in fig 1 are sampled and are input to the rainfall runoff model to calculate rainfall excess that contribute to runoff production and simulation of the flood hydrograph green boxes in fig 1 rainfall runoff modelling is undertaken with rorb laurenson et al 2010 an event based storage routing model that has been used for flood modelling throughout australia over the past 40 years mein et al 1974 the rorb model is selected for convenience and in terms of meeting the objectives of this study it would have been equally valid to select any of the commonly used event based models that require event losses to be specified such as the hec hms us army corps of engineers 2018 the refh model kjeldsen 2007 or scs cn model us department of agriculture 1986 such models only differ in the details of the loss modelling and routing schemes they all represent a similar degree of model complexity and have an equivalent need for external specification of event based loss parameters the model is run 100 times with stochastically sampled rainfall forcing and loss parameters to produce an ensemble of hydrological forecasts pink box in fig 1 further details on the key components of the adopted approach are described below for illustration purposes the analyses have been undertaken using 3 day rainfall events as this duration is typical of the events that yield a maximum flood response in the catchment following that our evaluation procedure is then explained 3 1 rainfall runoff model the rorb flood event model is comprised of two main components a simple two parameter loss model that computes the net rainfall contributing to catchment runoff over the duration of the rainfall event and a catchment storage model which routes the catchment runoff in hourly timesteps through a node link network of overland and channel pathways to the catchment outlet the loss model adopted for this study is the commonly used initial loss continuing loss il cl model in which net rainfall is calculated by subtracting the initial catchment loss from the total rainfall depth and then deducting a fixed continuing loss from the hourly rainfall the initial loss il is the depth of rainfall which must be satisfied before run off commences and the continuing loss cl is a constant rate which is continuously subtracted from rainfall after the initial loss has been satisfied these two loss rates are estimated at the commencement of each individual event to represent the depth of rainfall that infiltratres into the ground and does not reach the stream until after the event has completed with regard to the catchment storage model the catchment is subdivided into a number of sub areas to capture the spatial variability in rainfall losses and catchment routing characteristics the form of the storage discharge equation used in the model is 1 s k c q m where s is the storage in m 3 q is the discharge from storage in m 3 s m is the dimensionless exponent that represents non linearity of catchment and kc is the empirical routing parameter mein et al 1974 3 2 uncertainty in synthetic rainfall forecasts variability in rainfall depth and spatio temporal patterns is known to be the dominant source of uncertainty introduced in streamflow forecasting kobold and sušelj 2005 mascaro et al 2010 yu et al 2016 where it has been shown that the use of an ensemble approach is a useful means of accommodating the uncertainty involved mascaro et al 2010 uncertainty in the simulated rainfall forecasts is accommodated by separately considering the uncertainty in average catchment rainfall depth based on sampling the errors in a fitted relationship between awap gridded rainfall data and pme forecasts and its distribution in both space and time over the 3 day forecast period using an ensemble of historical spatio temporal patterns derived from pluviograph data these two components of uncertainty are discussed in further detail below 3 2 1 uncertainty in rainfall depth ensembles of the synthetic rainfall forecasts are generated in a two step process that first involves the generation of a single simulated pme forecast depth for each event and then the generation of rainfall ensembles that characterise the uncertainty in the simulated pme forecast since the simulated pme forecast exhibits the same degree of bias as actual forecast depths the ensembles are generated to account for both systematic and random components of uncertainty in order to generate a synthetic forecast with the same statistical attributes as the actual pme forecast a linear regression is established between the gridded awap observed rainfalls and the corresponding available pme forecasts using the 34 largest 3 day rainfall events in the available 6 years of records based on this regression it is possible to emulate pme forecasts corresponding to all large rainfall events over a 20 year historic period using observed awap rainfalls as a predictor before fitting the regression the observed and forecast rainfalls are transformed using the box cox transformation box and cox 1964 to ensure that the model residuals are reasonably gaussian and homoscedastic the adopted linear regression model is 2 p a α 0 α 1 p o ε 1 where p a and p o are the transformed actual pme rainfall forecasts and awap observations respectively the regression coefficients α0 and α1 are estimated by least squares the error term ε 1 represents a gaussian random error with a zero mean and standard deviation of σ1 this relationship is used to generate a single synthetic forecast denoted ps that emulates a transformed pme forecast corresponding to each selected historical event to create an ensemble of rainfall depths that characterize the uncertainty in the simulated pme forecast ps a linear regression is derived in which the transformed actual pme forecast pa is the independent variable and simulated pme forecasts ps are the dependent variable the adopted linear regression model is 3 p s β 0 β 1 p a ε 2 where β 0 and β 1 are regression coefficients and ε 2 is a gaussian random error term with a zero mean and standard deviation of σ2 where the simulated pme forecast ps is transformed using a box cox transformation to satisfy the least squares assumptions involved the error term in this regression equation ε 2 provides information with which to emulate the skill in the actual pme forecasts a 100 member ensemble of 3 day transformed rainfall forecasts is obtained by stochastically sampling from the distribution of the error term in eq 3 where the systematic bias in the forecasts is represented by the coefficients β 0 and β 1 and the error term is randomly drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and standard deviation of ε 2 n 0 σ2 this procedure including eqs 2 and 3 was used to emulate a set of pme forecasts that correspond to the largest 31 rainfall events that have occurred over a 20 year historic period the simulated pme forecasts exhibit the same degree of systematic bias as occurs in the actual pme forecasts the degree of systematic bias increases with the magnitude of the forecast rainfall and this is quantified and used to correct the derived ensembles after removing remaining bias the ensemble of synthetic forecasts is transformed back into the original domain by the inverse of the adopted box cox transform 3 2 2 uncertainty in temporal and spatial patterns the ensemble forecasts represent the distribution of average rainfall depth across the catchment the forecast rainfall depths need to be distributed in time and space across the forecast period and catchment for input to the flood model the uncertainty associated with these spatio temporal patterns is based on the variability in the behaviour of historical events which have a similar 3 day pattern to the observed daily pattern of rainfalls over the selected forecast period the similar patterns of hourly rainfalls are obtained from three pluviometer gauges located within the catchment the events used to derive the required hourly spatio temporal patterns are selected by searching a database of historical events collected from the 20 years of available record excluding the rainfalls observed over the selected forecast period the similarity of the historic rainfall events is assessed by calculating the absolute sum of differences asd between the proportional depths of daily rainfall 4 asd i 1 3 pd i h pd i o where pd i h and pd i o are the proportional depth of rainfalls daily depth to 3 day total depth over the historical and observed periods respectively for each 3 day forecast period a total of 15 similar events are selected from the historic record the hourly temporal patterns from the three available pluviometers are then used to disaggregate the forecast rainfall depth into hourly patterns over three different sub areas of the catchment the 15 available patterns are sampled uniformly in the monte carlo simulation and used to disaggregate the stochastic sample of synthetic forecast depths 3 3 uncertainty in loss rates the catchment hydrological response to rainfall events is heavily dependant on the initial wetness of the catchment the approach used to estimate uncertainty in the event based catchment loss parameters is based on a stochastic sampling of the error term in the fitted relationship between calibrated loss rates and estimates of the previous day s soil moisture simulated by the operational awra l water balance model the two loss rates are estimated once at the beginning of each individual event and not at any subsequent timestep while it would be possible to develop a more catchment specific estimate of soil moisture using a model developed and calibrated for catchment the awra l model uses on a global parameter set relevant to the whole of australia this approach was adopted because awra l estimates are operationally available on a daily basis and this emulates some of the real world constraints of the problem of interest to this study the fitted loss rates were obtained by calibrating the event based model to 31 historical events the calibration events were selected on the basis of rainfall not flood magnitude so that the derived parameters were not biased towards wet catchment conditions the form of the regression equation used to relate the initial loss to awra l is 5 il c ζ 0 ζ 1 s m ε 3 where ilc denotes the calibrated initial loss sm is the corresponding awra l estimate of upper soil moisture shallow depth from the day preceding the event ζ 0 and ζ 1 are regression coefficients and ε 3 is the error term uncertainty in the initial loss estimate at the commencement of the event is represented by an ensemble of loss values obtained by stochastically sampling the error term in the fitted regression equation where the error term is randomly drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and standard deviation of ε 3 n 0 σ3 an identical approach is adopted to generate ensembles of continuing loss for each individual forecast event the uncertainty estimates were obtained from the relationship fitted to all events fig 3 b c without developing separate error models based on leave one out samples for use with individual forecasts this approach was adopted for convenience as the difference in error terms between leave one out samples and the whole data set was minimal less than 2 difference 3 4 ensemble based monte carlo framework the losses and forecast rainfalls are sampled using a monte carlo framework to generate an ensemble of 100 flood forecasts for each event where each member of the ensemble is derived from a different stochastic combination of losses and spatio temporally distributed forecast rainfalls the ensemble of streamflow forecasts thus represents the propagation of uncertainties from the forecast rainfalls and losses in our study four simulation scenarios are adopted to evaluate the relative importance of the different sources of uncertainty on forecast uncertainty in the first scenario deterministic simulations are undertaken using observed rainfall and calibrated loss parameters these estimates are derived with full hindsight and thus they represent best possible estimates of the predicted streamflows in the second scenario monte carlo simulations are used to represent uncertainty in the simulated rainfall forecasts where loss parameters are held constant at the values obtained by calibration to each selected event in the third scenario the catchment losses are sampled stochastically to represent their uncertainty and observed rainfalls are used instead of the simulated forecasts in the fourth scenario monte carlo simulations are used to represent the combined uncertainty from both rainfall and losses additionally simulations with fixed calibrated catchment losses and rainfall forecasts are undertaken to separately consider the propagation of uncertainty from the depth and the spatio temporal distribution of the simulated forecast to individually investigate the impact of uncertainty from different sources 3 5 ensemble verification measures the streamflow forecasts are evaluated using assessment measures relevant to the accuracy success rate and reliability of the forecast flood peaks by reliability we are referring to how well the forecast uncertainty is captured by the uncertainty estimate a combined measure of the timing volume and peak of the forecast flood might be more relevant in situations where active decision making is required such as for spillway gate operations but for convenience here we concentrate on flood peaks only as it is a measure commonly considered in operational forecasts seibert et al 2014 the measure used to assess forecast accuracy is the nash and sutcliffe 1970 efficiency nse which evaluates the ensemble mean of forecast peaks q f i with the observed peaks q o i 6 nse i 1 i 1 n q o i q f i 2 i 1 n q o i q o i 2 where q o i is mean of observed peak flows a contingency table wilks 2011 is used to assess the success rate of the forecasts a contingency table is a two dimensional matrix which shows the frequency of the joint distribution of forecasts and observation quantiles this measure helps to discriminate between successful forecasts hits and unsuccessful forecasts misses criteria which are most appropriate where the operational decisions are binary e g yes no for the construction of this table see table 1 the range of observed flow peaks is categorized into terciles if the median of ensemble forecasts falls in the same category as corresponding observations it is counted as a successful forecast hit otherwise it is considered as biased forecast which underestimates or overestimates the flood attribute miss the frequency of hits for each category can be identified on the main diagonal of the table the measure used to assess reliability is the probability integral transform pit the assessment considers the rank of the observed value within the range of ensemble members which provides a measure of the degree to which the distribution of the forecast ensemble is consistent with the observed peak flow the reliability of the forecasts is estimated as follows 7 pit i f cdf i q obs i 1 n where f cdf i is the cumulative distribution function of ensemble and qobs is the corresponding observation if the statistical distribution of the ensemble accurately represents the forecast uncertainty for each event i e a reliable ensemble f cdf i will follow a uniform distribution in practice if a plot of the pit values for the selected verification events against a california plotting position cunnane 1978 falls near the 1 1 line they are deemed to be reliable laio and tamea 2006 the magnitude of the deviations from the 1 1 line indicates the degree of bias in the forecast uncertainty the reliability score of ensemble forecasts α renard et al 2010 is estimated based on the area between the pit curve and the 1 1 line as follows 8 a 1 n i 1 n pit i p i 9 α 1 2 a where p i is the california plotting position associated with piti and n is the number of events the α score is defined within 01 where a value of α close to 1 denotes a reliable forecast 4 results the following describes the results obtained by applying the adopted forecast framework to the study catchment results are presented for key steps in the analysis and include a brief mention of the flood model calibration along with the verification tests undertaken for the synthetic rainfall forecasts loss distributions and the flood forecast ensembles 4 1 calibration of rainfall runoff rorb model the gregors creek catchment was divided into five sub catchments fig 2 the rorb model parameters were calibrated with the objective of reproducing the peak and volume of the flood events the catchment specific routing parameters m kc control the overall shape of the hydrograph and are held fixed throughout all simulations as the degree of lag and attenuation of catchment runoff is assumed invariant with catchment wetness but varies non linearly with flow in contrast the event specific loss parameters il and cl control the proportion of rainfall that appears as runoff while they vary from one event to the next they do not vary within an event the model routing parameters were fitted to a small number of large events with good quality data see example calibration hydrograph in fig 2 and catchment loss parameters il and cl were fitted to 31 large rainfall events the overall performance of model calibration across the events based on the nse is 0 95 4 2 generation of ensemble rainfall forecasts the regression equations used to develop the synthetic pme forecasts eq 2 and the resulting forecast rainfall ensembles eq 3 were derived using a total of 34 events these events were the highest observed 3 day rainfalls recorded over the six year period for which actual pme forecasts were available eq 2 is used to generate single synthetic rainfall forecasts correspond to 31 verification events selected over a 20 year period then the eq 3 is used to generate the 100 member ensemble rainfall forecasts where the parameters are derived by fitting the sample of 31 stochastic synthetic forecasts to the corresponding observed awap data the regression parameters and fit statistics are summarised in table 2 and the scatter plot of the actual pme forecasts versus observed rainfalls is shown in the fig 3 a the efficacy of the synthetic rainfall forecasts generated using the two step scheme is illustrated in fig 4 this figure shows the synthetic forecasts generated for 31 events ranked from largest to smallest by observed rainfall to obtain these results a single pme forecast is generated using eq 2 and then the associated ensembles used to characterise the uncertainty about this synthetic forecast are generated using 100 samples from the error term in eq 3 it is seen that the median of the forecast ensembles falls equally above and below the observed rainfalls and that most observed rainfalls are located inside the 95 range of rainfall ensembles the relatively long whiskers of the box plots i e wide spread of outliers particularly in the larger events indicates considerable uncertainty in the forecast rainfalls the synthetic ensemble rainfall depth is disaggregated in time and space based on the hourly patterns obtained from events with a similar distribution of daily rainfall totals each ensemble is comprised of patterns obtained from the 15 most similar historical events three examples of ensembles represented as cumulative hourly depths derived for a single sub area within the catchment are shown in the upper panels of fig 5 where it is seen that the cumulative patterns exhibit considerable variability about the observed rainfall pattern 4 3 generation of ensemble losses the regression equations used to generate the ensemble of loss parameters were derived using a sample of loss parameters obtained from calibration of the rorb model to 31 events the calibration events were selected on the basis of rainfall magnitude to avoid the introduction of bias in the loss estimates when used with forecast rainfalls scatter plots for both initial and continuing loss rates against awra l soil moisture from the preceding day are shown in the fig 3 b and c the scatter around the fitted line indicates that there is considerable uncertainty in the estimation of losses from awra l soil moisture though it is seen the proportion of variance in initial loss explained by soil moisture is greater than that for continuing loss 4 4 stochastic flood simulation the lower panels of fig 5 show some examples of spaghetti plots of ensemble flood forecasts obtained using monte carlo simulation in which the catchment losses and forecast rainfall are both considered as stochastic variables these plots illustrate the hydrograph response over the course of the event and the dispersion of ensemble members thereby representing how uncertainty from the forecast rainfall and loss estimates propagates through the simulation process to capture the uncertainty in the predicted streamflows the three events shown in fig 5 illustrate the large uncertainty involved using three example events which were selected to represent a diverse range of antecedent catchment conditions and rainfall intensity the simulations in fig 5 represent a large rainfall event on a dry catchment event 1 a large rainfall event on a wet catchment event 2 and a small rainfall event on a wet catchment event 3 4 5 verification of rainfall and loss ensembles diagnostic information on the reliability and accuracy of the rainfall and loss ensembles for 31 selected events is presented using the pit plot in fig 6 if the uncertainty in the forecast is well represented by the forecast ensemble the observations should fall near the 1 1 line thyer et al 2009 it is seen that the distribution of rainfall depths and initial losses is consistent with the observed values and that the deviation of ranks from the uniform distribution lies well within the expected 95 confidence limits the reliability score of the rainfall forecast ensembles is 92 and the corresponding value for initial loss is 95 the distribution of continuing losses is less well represented with the points falling within the 95 confidence interval but there is some tendency for the continuing loss ensembles to over estimate the observations the observation pit values tend to fall in the lower part of the ensemble and the reliability score is 82 this bias is due to the fact that continuing losses are bounded by zero and that the errors in the regression model are not well represented by the normal distribution 4 6 verification of flood ensembles verification results for the ensemble flood forecasts under various scenarios are shown in fig 7 each panel provides results for verification measures which include the pit plot and reliability score the contingency table and associated success metric hit rate and the nse in the first scenario fig 7a the model is forced with the observed rainfall and calibrated loss parameters il and cl these results represent the best estimate of peak flows for all 31 events and as such provide a useful comparison benchmark for the subsequent forecast scenarios considered based on the verification results from the contingency table the success rate of simulated peak flows relevant to this scenario is 100 and the accuracy of simulated peak flows is indicated by an nse value of 0 95 reliability measures based on the pit plot are not provided as the results are based on deterministic not ensemble simulations the second scenario fig 7b represents the results obtained when uncertainty from the depth and spatio temporal distribution of the rainfall forecasts is considered and the loss parameters are held constant at the values obtained from calibration the observations as determined from the pit plot lie within the confidence limits and yield a reliability score of 82 although the forecasts fall within the confidence interval the pit values indicate that the forecast flow ensembles tend to over estimate the observed flow the corresponding contingency table shows that only 48 of events are successfully forecasted and the nse metric is 10 5 although it has been demonstrated that the forcing ensemble rainfalls are reliable a close examination of fig 6a shows that the rainfalls are slightly over estimated this leads to a positive bias in the flow ensemble in the third scenario fig 7c the model is forced by an ensemble of catchment losses and observed rainfalls the pit plot yields a reliability score of 92 the success rate of the forecasts is 61 and the performance of forecasts as indicated by nse coefficient is 0 45 the fourth scenario fig 7d includes uncertainty from both forecast rainfalls and losses the pit values associated with this scenario lie within the 95 confidence interval and the reliability is 91 it is seen that the high bias due to rainfalls fig 7b is now partially offset by the high bias in losses leading to underestimated flows fig 7c the contingency table analysis indicates that the accuracy of the forecasts when uncertainty from losses and rainfalls is considered reduces to 54 due to the low skill of stochastically generated forecasts and this is also represented by the low nse coefficient of 11 7 the results shown in fig 7b and d are based on the consideration of uncertainty from both the average rainfall depth and the spatio temporal patterns of the rainfall forecasts given the sensitivity of the simulations to uncertainties in the input rainfall it is of interest to assess the relative importance of uncertainties in the average depth of rainfall and its spatio temporal distribution to assess the relative importance of the different inputs we show the impact of uncertainty due to losses rainfall spatio temporal patterns and rainfall depth for three different scenarios separately in fig 8 b d the best estimates of the model as represented by the deterministic forecasts based on observed rainfall and calibrated loss parameters is also shown in fig 8a as a benchmark to evaluate the influence of the aforementioned sources of uncertainty comparing the median and spread of ensemble forecasts in fig 8b and 8c indicates that the impact of the uncertainty from losses is similar to that from the spatio temporal patterns of rainfall which appears to be consistent over the whole range of events there is a tendency for the larger flood events to be over estimated compared with the best deterministic forecasts fig 8a fig 8d shows that overall and particularly for large floods considering uncertainty from only catchment average forecast rainfall depth provides results in a considerably larger spread of the ensemble forecasts around the median than that resulting from rainfall patterns fig 8b and c therefore it can be inferred that the impact of uncertainty propagated through in the flow forecasts due to forecast rainfall depth is materially larger than that due to the uncertainty from losses and spatio temporal patterns and losses over the whole range of rainfall flow conditions 5 discussion the different simulation scenarios were formulated to assess the impact of different sources of uncertainty on forecasts derived using an event based model as the first scenario relies solely on the use of observed data it provides a useful benchmark to evaluate the impact of uncertainty due to forecast uncertainty while our primary focus is on the uncertainty introduced by the need to estimate catchment losses in an event based model the use of a scheme to derive synthetic forecasts allows us to consider events over a longer period 20 years than is available from operational forecasts 6 years this longer period of evaluation represents a wider range of hydro meteorological conditions than otherwise possible and these emulated forecasts thus provide us with a useful means to investigate the propagation of different sources of uncertainty the evaluation metrics of these synthetic forecasts figs 4 and 6a indicate that the scheme provides forecasts with a similar degree of uncertainty as the actual pme forecasts on which they were based the difference in results obtained for the four scenarios shown in fig 7 demonstrates the relative impacts of uncertainty due to forecast rainfalls and losses a comparison of the difference in results obtained when uncertainty is separately considered in the depth and spatio temporal distribution of rainfall forecasts fig 7b and in the event losses fig 7c provides an indication of the relative importance of these two sources of uncertainty the difference in results suggest that in this catchment at least the uncertainty from losses is less important than the uncertainty from the depth and spatio temporal distribution of rainfall forecasts evidence for this is provided in fig 7 where the accuracy of the forecasts that consider uncertainty from losses alone is higher than those that consider uncertainty from rainfalls 61 versus 48 accuracy 0 45 versus 10 5 nse these forecasts are also more reliable 92 versus 82 reliability scores it is also interesting to note that when uncertainty from both losses and rainfalls are considered jointly fig 7d the positive bias associated with forecast rainfalls evident from the degree of departure of the points from the 1 1 line in fig 7b is offset by the small negative bias in flow resulting from positively biased losses fig 7c that is the small degree of opposing bias in the ensembles of rainfalls and losses combine to yield an unbiased ensemble of streamflows overall this result is consistent with the finding of mascaro et al 2010 who found that allowing for uncertainty from inputs with opposing biases improves the accuracy and reliability of streamflow forecasts moreover comparison of the boxplots in fig 8 indicates that the impact of uncertainty from average catchment rainfall depth has a considerably greater impact on forecast uncertainty than that due to the either loss or spatio temporal patterns and this uncertainty has a material impact over the whole range of events these results are consistent with observations made by other authors that rainfall is the dominant source of uncertainty in forecasts cuo et al 2011 zappa et al 2011b these authors observed that uncertainty from antecedent conditions and the rainfall depth are also of importance but to our knowledge this is the first analysis which separately explores the relative uncertainty from losses spatio temporal patterns and average catchment rainfalls importantly the results show that uncertainty in antecedent conditions can be accommodated in an event based model by utilising external information on catchment wetness status compared to the use of observed data the uncertainty from losses reduces the accuracy of the forecasts by 39 and still provides 92 reliability the utility of independent information on soil moisture to help inform the initialisation of event based models has been noted by previous authors berthet et al 2009 coustau et al 2012 javelle et al 2010 norbiato et al 2008 tramblay et al 2012 while these authors suggested that such relationships could be used in operational forecasting these results demonstrate that it is quite feasible to incorporate uncertainty in loss estimates using an external tool together with an event based model the results presented here do not consider the value of using observations of discharge to update the loss estimates given there is a very direct link between the value of initial loss and the timing of hydrograph rise and between the value of continuing loss and the resulting flood volume it might be expected that additional improvements in forecasts could be gained by developing an updating scheme based on streamflow observations it is acknowledged that the absolute estimates of uncertainty obtained using monte carlo simulation are likely to underestimate the true uncertainty involved in the forecasts as a proportion of the events used to develop the stochastic schemes were also used in the evaluation simulations however our focus here is on assessing the relative sources of uncertainty and the feasibility of using an exogenous model to inform the loss parameters these different components are all informed by the same sample of events and the assessment is based on a benchmark that is based on the best possible deterministic set of simulations as such conclusions drawn are held to be a useful indication for the value of using event based models for operational forecasting 6 conclusion short term ensemble flood forecasts that reliably quantify forecast uncertainty are required for active management of flood risk many practitioners use simple and parsimonious event based models to evaluate flood risks associated with large rainfall events while event based models are unable to directly account for the antecedent condition of the catchment it has been shown that they can perform as well as continuous models when they are coupled with an effective initialization strategy berthet et al 2009 the scheme presented in this paper demonstrates that it is possible to use operational information on catchment wetness to derive streamflow forecasts that represent the uncertainty associated with antecedent conditions while a storage routing model rorb was used in this investigation the results are notionally relevant to other similarly parsimonious event based models eg the hec hms us army corps of engineers 2018 and refh kjeldsen 2007 and the need to specify antecedent catchment wetness is a common requirement for all such models we evaluated the performance of ensemble loss and ensemble rainfall forecasts in forecasting event peak streamflow using 31 large rainfall events selected from the past 20 years of historic records to overcome the limited period of actual forecasts for verification purpose we developed synthetic rainfall forecasts that exhibited similar error characteristics to current operational forecasts the use of synthetic rainfall forecasts is a convenience that circumvents the typical limitations associated with short periods of available operational data and merely provides the means to test the loss model component and assess forecast uncertainty estimation over a wider range of conditions than might otherwise be available obviously the synthetic rainfall forecasts are not required in operational procedures as the actual forecast ensembles are available though the loss model ensemble generator developed in this test environment would be directly applicable to operational conditions overall the key conclusion of this study is that independent information on catchment wetness can be used to inform the estimate of event based losses the adopted framework demonstrates how this information can be used to characterise the propagation of uncertainty due to antecedent conditions in operational forecasts it is expected that the reliability of the ensemble flood forecasts can be improved over the course of the forecast period as more observation data rainfall and streamflow becomes available given the simplicity of event based models the direct link between catchment response and a small number of model parameters further development of this approach has the potential to benefit practitioners who favour event based models for active decision making the results also provide insights about the relative importance of uncertainty from forecast rainfalls and losses on streamflow predictions in this catchment we found that the uncertainty from forecast average catchment rainfall depth is dominant the impact of uncertainty from antecedent conditions is of a similar magnitude to the impact of uncertainty from spatio temporal patterns of rainfall but overall these sources of uncertainty are of modest importance compared to forecast average depth this is an important outcome of the study as it lowers the impediment to using event based models for forecasting while continuous simulation models do avoid the need to explicitly consider antecedent conditions event based models have operational advantages in terms of simplicity computational burden ease of use inter operability with other systems and a wide user base of practitioners who use such models for planning and design purposes these factors potentially offer considerable advantages over continuous simulation models but the extent to which these outweigh the disadvantages of explicit initialisation is a matter for further research credit authorship

4965,extreme floods pose a threat to life and property and accurate and reliable flood forecasts are required to mitigate the consequences of these events in this paper we propose a novel monte carlo based framework that utilizes an ensemble based short term flood forecasting model an event based rainfall runoff model is selected due to its simplicity and wide use by industry practitioners however a challenge with event models is that they are unable to account for the initial condition of the catchment wetness at the commencement of a particular rainfall event to address this issue we used independent catchment average estimates of soil moisture to estimate catchment losses at the commencement and over the duration of the event the adopted framework enables uncertainty in catchment losses and rainfall depth and patterns to be quantified and incorporated in forecasts the accuracy and reliability of stochastic components of this framework are evaluated using ensemble verification measures later these measures are used to evaluate four scenarios based on different combinations of deterministic and stochastic conditions in the stochastic scenarios the uncertainty of the flood forecasts is reliably quantified 88 reliability on average the results show that operationally available estimates of catchment wetness can be used to account for uncertainty from event based loss parameters and that the uncertainty from average forecast rainfall depth is considerably more important than the uncertainty from forecast losses and the spatio temporal patterns of the rainfall this study has shown that event based models have the potential to be applied within a probabilistic framework to operationally generate probabilistic flood forecasts keywords probabilistic flood forecasts event based rainfall runoff model ensemble initial loss ensemble rainfall monte carlo simulation 1 introduction extreme floods are becoming more frequent and pose a threat to life as well as causing severe damage to property and infrastructure adams and pagano 2016 kauffeldt et al 2016 wmo 2013 flood warnings are issued to provide the general public and agencies with information about impending floods to minimize the possible negative impacts the provision of flood warnings may be deemed effective when the endangered communities are provided with an understanding of potential flood risks in a timely manner however when forecasts are required for active flood management e g the operation of flood gates to control water flows there is an increased need to quantify uncertainty in both the timing and magnitude of the forecasts so that decision makers can evaluate management options often in the face of strong asymmetry in the consequences of over or under estimates demeritt et al 2007 for example if the magnitude of a flood is under estimated then operators of a dam are less likely to take pre emptive action and this increases the likelihood that the dam may be overtopped and fail catastrophically conversely if the forecasts are over estimated then operators may release more floodwater than necessary and this may incrementally increase the consequences of downstream flooding the trade offs involved in balancing the benefits of pre emptive warnings with the costs of false negatives represent a duality of errors demeritt et al 2007 and reinforces the importance of explicitly including uncertainty in forecast products krzysztofowicz 2001 montanari and grossi 2008 zhao et al 2015 and in decision making dietrich et al 2009 two major sources of uncertainty of crucial importance to the provision of flood forecasts are meteorological inputs and initial catchment wetness silvestro and rebora 2014 with regard to the first source of uncertainty forecast precipitation is assumed to represent the largest source of uncertainty cloke and pappenberger 2009 where the quantitative precipitation forecasts qpfs from numerical weather prediction nwp based models or radar precipitation are used for flood forecasting ran et al 2018 zappa et al 2011a catchment response to rainfall is highly non linear and hence errors in forecast rainfalls are amplified when propagated through to runoff estimates for long 48 h komma et al 2007 and short lead times xuan et al 2009 accordingly considerable attention has been given to the uncertainties associated with numerical weather predictions and their incorporation in ensemble prediction systems cloke and pappenberger 2009 cuo et al 2011 with regard to the second major source of uncertainty catchment wetness prior to and during a rainfall event has a material impact on the peak and volume of a flood event berthet et al 2009 chifflard et al 2018 the methods available to consider the propagation of uncertainty due to antecedent catchment wetness depend heavily on the nature of the selected hydrologic model continuous simulation models explicitly account for catchment wetness prior to large rainfalls and over the last decade several studies have explored the use of satellite observations of soil moisture to update model state variables in order to improve streamflow prediction alvarez garreton et al 2015 laiolo et al 2016 meng et al 2017 in contrast event based models require external specification of the catchment wetness condition often by externally specifying loss characteristics applicable to the specific event coustau et al 2012 this is both a challenge in using event based models tramblay et al 2010 but also gives flexibility to operational flood forecasters when simulating a live event the uncertainty related to specifying initial soil moisture conditions is one of the main reasons why most published literature has focused on the use of continuous simulation models for flood forecasting although it is acknowledged that event based models are still often preferred in real time applications berthet et al 2009 tramblay et al 2012 the reason that event based models remain popular with practitioners is that they require few parameters and have a structure that is specifically designed to mimic the flood response of a catchment nathan and ling 2016 their simple structure facilitates inter operability with other systems and in view of the inaccuracies inherent in hydrologic data and lack of knowledge of actual runoff processes it may be difficult to justify the use of more complex procedures pilgrim and cordery 1993 event based models are readily calibrated and easily implemented have low computational overheads and they do not require long historical data for evaluation or testing berthet et al 2009 sunwoo and choi 2017 berthet et al 2009 evaluated the performance of three different schemes for specifying initial conditions in an event based model and compared their performance to results obtained using a continuous simulation model on a data set of 178 catchments in france the authors concluded that the differences in performance between the models were not significant and that if an efficient assimilation scheme can be devised then event based models could provide a practical alternative to continuous simulation models various authors have assessed the viability of using external schemes for initialising event based models and provided comment on their potential for use in operational flood forecasting the probability distributed moisture pdm model norbiato et al 2008 the antecedent precipitation index api and soil moisture accounting sma models tramblay et al 2012 and a regression based model based on point soil moisture data chifflard et al 2018 schemes have also been developed to estimate initial losses for design purposes using metrics based on 5 day antecedent catchment wetness gamage et al 2015 and using regionalised catchment properties hill et al 2015 the use of continuous simulation models is justified on the basis that they obviate the need to explicitly consider initial catchment wetness though it is recognised that the importance of antecedent conditions is less important than that associated with forecast rainfall yatheendradas et al 2008 zappa et al 2011b at least when long lead times are considered thiboult et al 2016 yatheendradas et al 2008 used a complex physically based event orientated model in a semi arid environment where it might be expected that uncertainty from losses might dominate but the other studies used continuous simulation models no published papers could be found that considered the relative importance of event based losses on forecast performance using the simpler event models that are widely used by practitioners for estimating flood risks for planning and design purposes while it perhaps makes intuitive sense that event based models are not well suited to forecasting because they do not implicitly account for soil moisture little formal evidence has been presented in the literature to support this view however if the uncertainty from estimating event based losses adds little to the overall forecast uncertainty then this opens up the considerable opportunity to use the same flood models that have been developed for planning and management purposes in flood forecasting applications the simpler model structure of event based models would also facilitate the development of data assimilation schemes for parameter updating coustau et al 2013 the advent of operational soil moisture products e g the ascat soil moisture product of global coverage wagner et al 2007 and the awra l model in australia vaze et al 2013 represents an opportunity for external information to be used to inform parameterisation of the catchment wetness for event based models for flood forecasting if the uncertainty associated with using such products is small compared to the uncertainty of forecast rainfalls then this reduces the perceived impediment of using event based models for operational flood forecasting and offers the advantage of using parsimonious models that have long been used for design purposes the relative sources of uncertainty in event based models has received little attention in the published literature and thus in this study we aim to 1 devise a simple scheme to estimate event based loss parameters using operational estimates of soil moisture and 2 compare the relative importance of this source of uncertainty to that associated with rainfall forecasts for this purpose a monte carlo framework is used to derive forecast flow ensembles that represent the uncertainty due to both the depths and spatio temporal patterns of forecast rainfall and to loss estimates the study catchment and data used to investigate the performance of the forecast scheme are described in the next section and this is followed by a description of the simulation framework results are then presented using a range of probabilistic and deterministic evaluation measures that represent the accuracy success rate and reliability of the forecasts the adopted approach makes use of existing models where attention is focused on the estimation of event based losses prior to a flood response being observed in the catchment this approach is adopted as it relates to forecasts with long lead times that are undertaken prior to the catchment response to rainfall this represents a period where uncertainty in loss parameters is at its greatest as there is no information available to allow the loss parameters to be updated via data assimilation 2 study catchment and datasets the study catchment used to investigate the treatment of antecedent conditions is gregor s creek which is located in southeast queensland australia the catchment drains an area of 3876 km2 and forms the upper reaches of the brisbane river which provides inflows to two large gated dams these are dual purpose dams which provide both water supply and flood mitigation primarily for the benefit of the downstream city of brisbane the brisbane river catchment experiences a humid subtropical climate with dry and wet seasons peel and steen 2007 and has mean annual precipitation of approximately 800 mm the land use of the catchment is predominately rural and includes forest and grazing lands a comprehensive range of high quality observed and modelled information is available for this catchment gridded information on daily rainfalls at a spatial resolution of 0 05 about 5 km is available for the past 100 years from the australian water availability project awap jones et al 2009 and hourly rainfalls from three pluviographs located within the catchment are available from 1960 to 2016 as discussed later in the paper section 3 the pluviograph data was used to downscale the daily gridded rainfalls to provide hourly time series of areal rainfalls for three separate sub areas of the catchment six years of deterministic rainfall forecasts are also available from july 2010 these forecasts are issued twice daily by the australian bureau of meteorology and provide forecasts at lead times from 1 to 8 days the forecasts combine the rainfall predictions of eight numerical weather prediction models from around the world and provide estimates of daily rainfall at a spatial resolution of 0 5 about 50 km ebert 2001 the estimates of the numerical weather prediction models are combined using the probability matched ensemble or poor man s ensemble pme as developed and described by ebert 2001 a streamflow gauge is located at the outlet of the study catchment which has 20 years of hourly recorded streamflow data lastly daily information on catchment wetness was obtained from the australian water resource assessment landscape awra l model developed by the bureau of meteorology renzullo et al 2014 van dijk and warren 2010 awra l is a distributed water balance model that provides operational estimates of catchment behaviour at a spatial resolution of 0 05 about 5 km across australia model estimates are updated daily and simulation results are available for the past 100 years of historic climate 3 methodology we develop a novel ensemble based framework to accommodate the use of an event based model for operational flood forecasting in which the uncertainty in forecast rainfall and catchment losses is explicitly considered we focus on the propagation of errors associated with the use of independent information on catchment wetness to estimate initial and ongoing losses for event based prediction of forecast streamflows and we assess the relative importance of these errors to the uncertainty associated with rainfall forecasts considerable effort is expended on improving the performance of rainfall forecast products and one of the consequences of this is that it can be difficult to find long periods over which their performance can be considered consistent for the purposes of evaluation mascaro et al 2010 the six years of available pme rainfall forecasts provide a reasonable range of small and large rainfall events for assessing forecast uncertainty but it provides only a limited number of suitable flood events around 15 events to evaluate the loss initialisation scheme this is insufficient for evaluating a probabilistic forecast or for evaluating forecast uncertainty accordingly we devise a scheme that emulates the behaviour and uncertainty of pme forecasts over a 20 year period concurrent with the observed streamflow record these synthetic forecasts in combination with observed rainfalls gauged streamflows and simulated soil moisture provide a wide range of historic conditions with which to evaluate the performance of the event based ensemble streamflow forecasts the overall view of our framework for deriving event based ensemble forecasts is shown in fig 1 a monte carlo approach is used to reproduce uncertainty in antecedent conditions and forecast rainfall that propagate through to the predicted flood response uncertainty in rainfall and antecedent conditions are predominately aleatory in nature and the distributions that quantify them may be readily obtained from recorded observations it is acknowledged that the influence of epistemic uncertainty on other factors such as routing parameters and observation errors is not considered here uncertainty in catchment losses is represented by the stochastic sampling of errors in a relationship derived between model loss parameters and estimates of soil moisture obtained from the operational awra l continuous simulation model box a fig 1 the behaviour and uncertainty in the synthetic rainfall forecasts is represented by a two step process first we stochastically generate an ensemble of synthetic forecasts using an error model developed from a short period of observed rainfalls and actual forecasts box b fig 1 for each of 31 events selected from 20 years of historic record second we characterize the uncertainty in the average depth of forecast rainfall and its spatio temporal distribution by generating a 100 member ensemble that uses information on storm patterns obtained from similar historical events outside the forecast period of interest box c fig 1 the generated ensemble rainfall and loss parameters yellow boxes in fig 1 are sampled and are input to the rainfall runoff model to calculate rainfall excess that contribute to runoff production and simulation of the flood hydrograph green boxes in fig 1 rainfall runoff modelling is undertaken with rorb laurenson et al 2010 an event based storage routing model that has been used for flood modelling throughout australia over the past 40 years mein et al 1974 the rorb model is selected for convenience and in terms of meeting the objectives of this study it would have been equally valid to select any of the commonly used event based models that require event losses to be specified such as the hec hms us army corps of engineers 2018 the refh model kjeldsen 2007 or scs cn model us department of agriculture 1986 such models only differ in the details of the loss modelling and routing schemes they all represent a similar degree of model complexity and have an equivalent need for external specification of event based loss parameters the model is run 100 times with stochastically sampled rainfall forcing and loss parameters to produce an ensemble of hydrological forecasts pink box in fig 1 further details on the key components of the adopted approach are described below for illustration purposes the analyses have been undertaken using 3 day rainfall events as this duration is typical of the events that yield a maximum flood response in the catchment following that our evaluation procedure is then explained 3 1 rainfall runoff model the rorb flood event model is comprised of two main components a simple two parameter loss model that computes the net rainfall contributing to catchment runoff over the duration of the rainfall event and a catchment storage model which routes the catchment runoff in hourly timesteps through a node link network of overland and channel pathways to the catchment outlet the loss model adopted for this study is the commonly used initial loss continuing loss il cl model in which net rainfall is calculated by subtracting the initial catchment loss from the total rainfall depth and then deducting a fixed continuing loss from the hourly rainfall the initial loss il is the depth of rainfall which must be satisfied before run off commences and the continuing loss cl is a constant rate which is continuously subtracted from rainfall after the initial loss has been satisfied these two loss rates are estimated at the commencement of each individual event to represent the depth of rainfall that infiltratres into the ground and does not reach the stream until after the event has completed with regard to the catchment storage model the catchment is subdivided into a number of sub areas to capture the spatial variability in rainfall losses and catchment routing characteristics the form of the storage discharge equation used in the model is 1 s k c q m where s is the storage in m 3 q is the discharge from storage in m 3 s m is the dimensionless exponent that represents non linearity of catchment and kc is the empirical routing parameter mein et al 1974 3 2 uncertainty in synthetic rainfall forecasts variability in rainfall depth and spatio temporal patterns is known to be the dominant source of uncertainty introduced in streamflow forecasting kobold and sušelj 2005 mascaro et al 2010 yu et al 2016 where it has been shown that the use of an ensemble approach is a useful means of accommodating the uncertainty involved mascaro et al 2010 uncertainty in the simulated rainfall forecasts is accommodated by separately considering the uncertainty in average catchment rainfall depth based on sampling the errors in a fitted relationship between awap gridded rainfall data and pme forecasts and its distribution in both space and time over the 3 day forecast period using an ensemble of historical spatio temporal patterns derived from pluviograph data these two components of uncertainty are discussed in further detail below 3 2 1 uncertainty in rainfall depth ensembles of the synthetic rainfall forecasts are generated in a two step process that first involves the generation of a single simulated pme forecast depth for each event and then the generation of rainfall ensembles that characterise the uncertainty in the simulated pme forecast since the simulated pme forecast exhibits the same degree of bias as actual forecast depths the ensembles are generated to account for both systematic and random components of uncertainty in order to generate a synthetic forecast with the same statistical attributes as the actual pme forecast a linear regression is established between the gridded awap observed rainfalls and the corresponding available pme forecasts using the 34 largest 3 day rainfall events in the available 6 years of records based on this regression it is possible to emulate pme forecasts corresponding to all large rainfall events over a 20 year historic period using observed awap rainfalls as a predictor before fitting the regression the observed and forecast rainfalls are transformed using the box cox transformation box and cox 1964 to ensure that the model residuals are reasonably gaussian and homoscedastic the adopted linear regression model is 2 p a α 0 α 1 p o ε 1 where p a and p o are the transformed actual pme rainfall forecasts and awap observations respectively the regression coefficients α0 and α1 are estimated by least squares the error term ε 1 represents a gaussian random error with a zero mean and standard deviation of σ1 this relationship is used to generate a single synthetic forecast denoted ps that emulates a transformed pme forecast corresponding to each selected historical event to create an ensemble of rainfall depths that characterize the uncertainty in the simulated pme forecast ps a linear regression is derived in which the transformed actual pme forecast pa is the independent variable and simulated pme forecasts ps are the dependent variable the adopted linear regression model is 3 p s β 0 β 1 p a ε 2 where β 0 and β 1 are regression coefficients and ε 2 is a gaussian random error term with a zero mean and standard deviation of σ2 where the simulated pme forecast ps is transformed using a box cox transformation to satisfy the least squares assumptions involved the error term in this regression equation ε 2 provides information with which to emulate the skill in the actual pme forecasts a 100 member ensemble of 3 day transformed rainfall forecasts is obtained by stochastically sampling from the distribution of the error term in eq 3 where the systematic bias in the forecasts is represented by the coefficients β 0 and β 1 and the error term is randomly drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and standard deviation of ε 2 n 0 σ2 this procedure including eqs 2 and 3 was used to emulate a set of pme forecasts that correspond to the largest 31 rainfall events that have occurred over a 20 year historic period the simulated pme forecasts exhibit the same degree of systematic bias as occurs in the actual pme forecasts the degree of systematic bias increases with the magnitude of the forecast rainfall and this is quantified and used to correct the derived ensembles after removing remaining bias the ensemble of synthetic forecasts is transformed back into the original domain by the inverse of the adopted box cox transform 3 2 2 uncertainty in temporal and spatial patterns the ensemble forecasts represent the distribution of average rainfall depth across the catchment the forecast rainfall depths need to be distributed in time and space across the forecast period and catchment for input to the flood model the uncertainty associated with these spatio temporal patterns is based on the variability in the behaviour of historical events which have a similar 3 day pattern to the observed daily pattern of rainfalls over the selected forecast period the similar patterns of hourly rainfalls are obtained from three pluviometer gauges located within the catchment the events used to derive the required hourly spatio temporal patterns are selected by searching a database of historical events collected from the 20 years of available record excluding the rainfalls observed over the selected forecast period the similarity of the historic rainfall events is assessed by calculating the absolute sum of differences asd between the proportional depths of daily rainfall 4 asd i 1 3 pd i h pd i o where pd i h and pd i o are the proportional depth of rainfalls daily depth to 3 day total depth over the historical and observed periods respectively for each 3 day forecast period a total of 15 similar events are selected from the historic record the hourly temporal patterns from the three available pluviometers are then used to disaggregate the forecast rainfall depth into hourly patterns over three different sub areas of the catchment the 15 available patterns are sampled uniformly in the monte carlo simulation and used to disaggregate the stochastic sample of synthetic forecast depths 3 3 uncertainty in loss rates the catchment hydrological response to rainfall events is heavily dependant on the initial wetness of the catchment the approach used to estimate uncertainty in the event based catchment loss parameters is based on a stochastic sampling of the error term in the fitted relationship between calibrated loss rates and estimates of the previous day s soil moisture simulated by the operational awra l water balance model the two loss rates are estimated once at the beginning of each individual event and not at any subsequent timestep while it would be possible to develop a more catchment specific estimate of soil moisture using a model developed and calibrated for catchment the awra l model uses on a global parameter set relevant to the whole of australia this approach was adopted because awra l estimates are operationally available on a daily basis and this emulates some of the real world constraints of the problem of interest to this study the fitted loss rates were obtained by calibrating the event based model to 31 historical events the calibration events were selected on the basis of rainfall not flood magnitude so that the derived parameters were not biased towards wet catchment conditions the form of the regression equation used to relate the initial loss to awra l is 5 il c ζ 0 ζ 1 s m ε 3 where ilc denotes the calibrated initial loss sm is the corresponding awra l estimate of upper soil moisture shallow depth from the day preceding the event ζ 0 and ζ 1 are regression coefficients and ε 3 is the error term uncertainty in the initial loss estimate at the commencement of the event is represented by an ensemble of loss values obtained by stochastically sampling the error term in the fitted regression equation where the error term is randomly drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and standard deviation of ε 3 n 0 σ3 an identical approach is adopted to generate ensembles of continuing loss for each individual forecast event the uncertainty estimates were obtained from the relationship fitted to all events fig 3 b c without developing separate error models based on leave one out samples for use with individual forecasts this approach was adopted for convenience as the difference in error terms between leave one out samples and the whole data set was minimal less than 2 difference 3 4 ensemble based monte carlo framework the losses and forecast rainfalls are sampled using a monte carlo framework to generate an ensemble of 100 flood forecasts for each event where each member of the ensemble is derived from a different stochastic combination of losses and spatio temporally distributed forecast rainfalls the ensemble of streamflow forecasts thus represents the propagation of uncertainties from the forecast rainfalls and losses in our study four simulation scenarios are adopted to evaluate the relative importance of the different sources of uncertainty on forecast uncertainty in the first scenario deterministic simulations are undertaken using observed rainfall and calibrated loss parameters these estimates are derived with full hindsight and thus they represent best possible estimates of the predicted streamflows in the second scenario monte carlo simulations are used to represent uncertainty in the simulated rainfall forecasts where loss parameters are held constant at the values obtained by calibration to each selected event in the third scenario the catchment losses are sampled stochastically to represent their uncertainty and observed rainfalls are used instead of the simulated forecasts in the fourth scenario monte carlo simulations are used to represent the combined uncertainty from both rainfall and losses additionally simulations with fixed calibrated catchment losses and rainfall forecasts are undertaken to separately consider the propagation of uncertainty from the depth and the spatio temporal distribution of the simulated forecast to individually investigate the impact of uncertainty from different sources 3 5 ensemble verification measures the streamflow forecasts are evaluated using assessment measures relevant to the accuracy success rate and reliability of the forecast flood peaks by reliability we are referring to how well the forecast uncertainty is captured by the uncertainty estimate a combined measure of the timing volume and peak of the forecast flood might be more relevant in situations where active decision making is required such as for spillway gate operations but for convenience here we concentrate on flood peaks only as it is a measure commonly considered in operational forecasts seibert et al 2014 the measure used to assess forecast accuracy is the nash and sutcliffe 1970 efficiency nse which evaluates the ensemble mean of forecast peaks q f i with the observed peaks q o i 6 nse i 1 i 1 n q o i q f i 2 i 1 n q o i q o i 2 where q o i is mean of observed peak flows a contingency table wilks 2011 is used to assess the success rate of the forecasts a contingency table is a two dimensional matrix which shows the frequency of the joint distribution of forecasts and observation quantiles this measure helps to discriminate between successful forecasts hits and unsuccessful forecasts misses criteria which are most appropriate where the operational decisions are binary e g yes no for the construction of this table see table 1 the range of observed flow peaks is categorized into terciles if the median of ensemble forecasts falls in the same category as corresponding observations it is counted as a successful forecast hit otherwise it is considered as biased forecast which underestimates or overestimates the flood attribute miss the frequency of hits for each category can be identified on the main diagonal of the table the measure used to assess reliability is the probability integral transform pit the assessment considers the rank of the observed value within the range of ensemble members which provides a measure of the degree to which the distribution of the forecast ensemble is consistent with the observed peak flow the reliability of the forecasts is estimated as follows 7 pit i f cdf i q obs i 1 n where f cdf i is the cumulative distribution function of ensemble and qobs is the corresponding observation if the statistical distribution of the ensemble accurately represents the forecast uncertainty for each event i e a reliable ensemble f cdf i will follow a uniform distribution in practice if a plot of the pit values for the selected verification events against a california plotting position cunnane 1978 falls near the 1 1 line they are deemed to be reliable laio and tamea 2006 the magnitude of the deviations from the 1 1 line indicates the degree of bias in the forecast uncertainty the reliability score of ensemble forecasts α renard et al 2010 is estimated based on the area between the pit curve and the 1 1 line as follows 8 a 1 n i 1 n pit i p i 9 α 1 2 a where p i is the california plotting position associated with piti and n is the number of events the α score is defined within 01 where a value of α close to 1 denotes a reliable forecast 4 results the following describes the results obtained by applying the adopted forecast framework to the study catchment results are presented for key steps in the analysis and include a brief mention of the flood model calibration along with the verification tests undertaken for the synthetic rainfall forecasts loss distributions and the flood forecast ensembles 4 1 calibration of rainfall runoff rorb model the gregors creek catchment was divided into five sub catchments fig 2 the rorb model parameters were calibrated with the objective of reproducing the peak and volume of the flood events the catchment specific routing parameters m kc control the overall shape of the hydrograph and are held fixed throughout all simulations as the degree of lag and attenuation of catchment runoff is assumed invariant with catchment wetness but varies non linearly with flow in contrast the event specific loss parameters il and cl control the proportion of rainfall that appears as runoff while they vary from one event to the next they do not vary within an event the model routing parameters were fitted to a small number of large events with good quality data see example calibration hydrograph in fig 2 and catchment loss parameters il and cl were fitted to 31 large rainfall events the overall performance of model calibration across the events based on the nse is 0 95 4 2 generation of ensemble rainfall forecasts the regression equations used to develop the synthetic pme forecasts eq 2 and the resulting forecast rainfall ensembles eq 3 were derived using a total of 34 events these events were the highest observed 3 day rainfalls recorded over the six year period for which actual pme forecasts were available eq 2 is used to generate single synthetic rainfall forecasts correspond to 31 verification events selected over a 20 year period then the eq 3 is used to generate the 100 member ensemble rainfall forecasts where the parameters are derived by fitting the sample of 31 stochastic synthetic forecasts to the corresponding observed awap data the regression parameters and fit statistics are summarised in table 2 and the scatter plot of the actual pme forecasts versus observed rainfalls is shown in the fig 3 a the efficacy of the synthetic rainfall forecasts generated using the two step scheme is illustrated in fig 4 this figure shows the synthetic forecasts generated for 31 events ranked from largest to smallest by observed rainfall to obtain these results a single pme forecast is generated using eq 2 and then the associated ensembles used to characterise the uncertainty about this synthetic forecast are generated using 100 samples from the error term in eq 3 it is seen that the median of the forecast ensembles falls equally above and below the observed rainfalls and that most observed rainfalls are located inside the 95 range of rainfall ensembles the relatively long whiskers of the box plots i e wide spread of outliers particularly in the larger events indicates considerable uncertainty in the forecast rainfalls the synthetic ensemble rainfall depth is disaggregated in time and space based on the hourly patterns obtained from events with a similar distribution of daily rainfall totals each ensemble is comprised of patterns obtained from the 15 most similar historical events three examples of ensembles represented as cumulative hourly depths derived for a single sub area within the catchment are shown in the upper panels of fig 5 where it is seen that the cumulative patterns exhibit considerable variability about the observed rainfall pattern 4 3 generation of ensemble losses the regression equations used to generate the ensemble of loss parameters were derived using a sample of loss parameters obtained from calibration of the rorb model to 31 events the calibration events were selected on the basis of rainfall magnitude to avoid the introduction of bias in the loss estimates when used with forecast rainfalls scatter plots for both initial and continuing loss rates against awra l soil moisture from the preceding day are shown in the fig 3 b and c the scatter around the fitted line indicates that there is considerable uncertainty in the estimation of losses from awra l soil moisture though it is seen the proportion of variance in initial loss explained by soil moisture is greater than that for continuing loss 4 4 stochastic flood simulation the lower panels of fig 5 show some examples of spaghetti plots of ensemble flood forecasts obtained using monte carlo simulation in which the catchment losses and forecast rainfall are both considered as stochastic variables these plots illustrate the hydrograph response over the course of the event and the dispersion of ensemble members thereby representing how uncertainty from the forecast rainfall and loss estimates propagates through the simulation process to capture the uncertainty in the predicted streamflows the three events shown in fig 5 illustrate the large uncertainty involved using three example events which were selected to represent a diverse range of antecedent catchment conditions and rainfall intensity the simulations in fig 5 represent a large rainfall event on a dry catchment event 1 a large rainfall event on a wet catchment event 2 and a small rainfall event on a wet catchment event 3 4 5 verification of rainfall and loss ensembles diagnostic information on the reliability and accuracy of the rainfall and loss ensembles for 31 selected events is presented using the pit plot in fig 6 if the uncertainty in the forecast is well represented by the forecast ensemble the observations should fall near the 1 1 line thyer et al 2009 it is seen that the distribution of rainfall depths and initial losses is consistent with the observed values and that the deviation of ranks from the uniform distribution lies well within the expected 95 confidence limits the reliability score of the rainfall forecast ensembles is 92 and the corresponding value for initial loss is 95 the distribution of continuing losses is less well represented with the points falling within the 95 confidence interval but there is some tendency for the continuing loss ensembles to over estimate the observations the observation pit values tend to fall in the lower part of the ensemble and the reliability score is 82 this bias is due to the fact that continuing losses are bounded by zero and that the errors in the regression model are not well represented by the normal distribution 4 6 verification of flood ensembles verification results for the ensemble flood forecasts under various scenarios are shown in fig 7 each panel provides results for verification measures which include the pit plot and reliability score the contingency table and associated success metric hit rate and the nse in the first scenario fig 7a the model is forced with the observed rainfall and calibrated loss parameters il and cl these results represent the best estimate of peak flows for all 31 events and as such provide a useful comparison benchmark for the subsequent forecast scenarios considered based on the verification results from the contingency table the success rate of simulated peak flows relevant to this scenario is 100 and the accuracy of simulated peak flows is indicated by an nse value of 0 95 reliability measures based on the pit plot are not provided as the results are based on deterministic not ensemble simulations the second scenario fig 7b represents the results obtained when uncertainty from the depth and spatio temporal distribution of the rainfall forecasts is considered and the loss parameters are held constant at the values obtained from calibration the observations as determined from the pit plot lie within the confidence limits and yield a reliability score of 82 although the forecasts fall within the confidence interval the pit values indicate that the forecast flow ensembles tend to over estimate the observed flow the corresponding contingency table shows that only 48 of events are successfully forecasted and the nse metric is 10 5 although it has been demonstrated that the forcing ensemble rainfalls are reliable a close examination of fig 6a shows that the rainfalls are slightly over estimated this leads to a positive bias in the flow ensemble in the third scenario fig 7c the model is forced by an ensemble of catchment losses and observed rainfalls the pit plot yields a reliability score of 92 the success rate of the forecasts is 61 and the performance of forecasts as indicated by nse coefficient is 0 45 the fourth scenario fig 7d includes uncertainty from both forecast rainfalls and losses the pit values associated with this scenario lie within the 95 confidence interval and the reliability is 91 it is seen that the high bias due to rainfalls fig 7b is now partially offset by the high bias in losses leading to underestimated flows fig 7c the contingency table analysis indicates that the accuracy of the forecasts when uncertainty from losses and rainfalls is considered reduces to 54 due to the low skill of stochastically generated forecasts and this is also represented by the low nse coefficient of 11 7 the results shown in fig 7b and d are based on the consideration of uncertainty from both the average rainfall depth and the spatio temporal patterns of the rainfall forecasts given the sensitivity of the simulations to uncertainties in the input rainfall it is of interest to assess the relative importance of uncertainties in the average depth of rainfall and its spatio temporal distribution to assess the relative importance of the different inputs we show the impact of uncertainty due to losses rainfall spatio temporal patterns and rainfall depth for three different scenarios separately in fig 8 b d the best estimates of the model as represented by the deterministic forecasts based on observed rainfall and calibrated loss parameters is also shown in fig 8a as a benchmark to evaluate the influence of the aforementioned sources of uncertainty comparing the median and spread of ensemble forecasts in fig 8b and 8c indicates that the impact of the uncertainty from losses is similar to that from the spatio temporal patterns of rainfall which appears to be consistent over the whole range of events there is a tendency for the larger flood events to be over estimated compared with the best deterministic forecasts fig 8a fig 8d shows that overall and particularly for large floods considering uncertainty from only catchment average forecast rainfall depth provides results in a considerably larger spread of the ensemble forecasts around the median than that resulting from rainfall patterns fig 8b and c therefore it can be inferred that the impact of uncertainty propagated through in the flow forecasts due to forecast rainfall depth is materially larger than that due to the uncertainty from losses and spatio temporal patterns and losses over the whole range of rainfall flow conditions 5 discussion the different simulation scenarios were formulated to assess the impact of different sources of uncertainty on forecasts derived using an event based model as the first scenario relies solely on the use of observed data it provides a useful benchmark to evaluate the impact of uncertainty due to forecast uncertainty while our primary focus is on the uncertainty introduced by the need to estimate catchment losses in an event based model the use of a scheme to derive synthetic forecasts allows us to consider events over a longer period 20 years than is available from operational forecasts 6 years this longer period of evaluation represents a wider range of hydro meteorological conditions than otherwise possible and these emulated forecasts thus provide us with a useful means to investigate the propagation of different sources of uncertainty the evaluation metrics of these synthetic forecasts figs 4 and 6a indicate that the scheme provides forecasts with a similar degree of uncertainty as the actual pme forecasts on which they were based the difference in results obtained for the four scenarios shown in fig 7 demonstrates the relative impacts of uncertainty due to forecast rainfalls and losses a comparison of the difference in results obtained when uncertainty is separately considered in the depth and spatio temporal distribution of rainfall forecasts fig 7b and in the event losses fig 7c provides an indication of the relative importance of these two sources of uncertainty the difference in results suggest that in this catchment at least the uncertainty from losses is less important than the uncertainty from the depth and spatio temporal distribution of rainfall forecasts evidence for this is provided in fig 7 where the accuracy of the forecasts that consider uncertainty from losses alone is higher than those that consider uncertainty from rainfalls 61 versus 48 accuracy 0 45 versus 10 5 nse these forecasts are also more reliable 92 versus 82 reliability scores it is also interesting to note that when uncertainty from both losses and rainfalls are considered jointly fig 7d the positive bias associated with forecast rainfalls evident from the degree of departure of the points from the 1 1 line in fig 7b is offset by the small negative bias in flow resulting from positively biased losses fig 7c that is the small degree of opposing bias in the ensembles of rainfalls and losses combine to yield an unbiased ensemble of streamflows overall this result is consistent with the finding of mascaro et al 2010 who found that allowing for uncertainty from inputs with opposing biases improves the accuracy and reliability of streamflow forecasts moreover comparison of the boxplots in fig 8 indicates that the impact of uncertainty from average catchment rainfall depth has a considerably greater impact on forecast uncertainty than that due to the either loss or spatio temporal patterns and this uncertainty has a material impact over the whole range of events these results are consistent with observations made by other authors that rainfall is the dominant source of uncertainty in forecasts cuo et al 2011 zappa et al 2011b these authors observed that uncertainty from antecedent conditions and the rainfall depth are also of importance but to our knowledge this is the first analysis which separately explores the relative uncertainty from losses spatio temporal patterns and average catchment rainfalls importantly the results show that uncertainty in antecedent conditions can be accommodated in an event based model by utilising external information on catchment wetness status compared to the use of observed data the uncertainty from losses reduces the accuracy of the forecasts by 39 and still provides 92 reliability the utility of independent information on soil moisture to help inform the initialisation of event based models has been noted by previous authors berthet et al 2009 coustau et al 2012 javelle et al 2010 norbiato et al 2008 tramblay et al 2012 while these authors suggested that such relationships could be used in operational forecasting these results demonstrate that it is quite feasible to incorporate uncertainty in loss estimates using an external tool together with an event based model the results presented here do not consider the value of using observations of discharge to update the loss estimates given there is a very direct link between the value of initial loss and the timing of hydrograph rise and between the value of continuing loss and the resulting flood volume it might be expected that additional improvements in forecasts could be gained by developing an updating scheme based on streamflow observations it is acknowledged that the absolute estimates of uncertainty obtained using monte carlo simulation are likely to underestimate the true uncertainty involved in the forecasts as a proportion of the events used to develop the stochastic schemes were also used in the evaluation simulations however our focus here is on assessing the relative sources of uncertainty and the feasibility of using an exogenous model to inform the loss parameters these different components are all informed by the same sample of events and the assessment is based on a benchmark that is based on the best possible deterministic set of simulations as such conclusions drawn are held to be a useful indication for the value of using event based models for operational forecasting 6 conclusion short term ensemble flood forecasts that reliably quantify forecast uncertainty are required for active management of flood risk many practitioners use simple and parsimonious event based models to evaluate flood risks associated with large rainfall events while event based models are unable to directly account for the antecedent condition of the catchment it has been shown that they can perform as well as continuous models when they are coupled with an effective initialization strategy berthet et al 2009 the scheme presented in this paper demonstrates that it is possible to use operational information on catchment wetness to derive streamflow forecasts that represent the uncertainty associated with antecedent conditions while a storage routing model rorb was used in this investigation the results are notionally relevant to other similarly parsimonious event based models eg the hec hms us army corps of engineers 2018 and refh kjeldsen 2007 and the need to specify antecedent catchment wetness is a common requirement for all such models we evaluated the performance of ensemble loss and ensemble rainfall forecasts in forecasting event peak streamflow using 31 large rainfall events selected from the past 20 years of historic records to overcome the limited period of actual forecasts for verification purpose we developed synthetic rainfall forecasts that exhibited similar error characteristics to current operational forecasts the use of synthetic rainfall forecasts is a convenience that circumvents the typical limitations associated with short periods of available operational data and merely provides the means to test the loss model component and assess forecast uncertainty estimation over a wider range of conditions than might otherwise be available obviously the synthetic rainfall forecasts are not required in operational procedures as the actual forecast ensembles are available though the loss model ensemble generator developed in this test environment would be directly applicable to operational conditions overall the key conclusion of this study is that independent information on catchment wetness can be used to inform the estimate of event based losses the adopted framework demonstrates how this information can be used to characterise the propagation of uncertainty due to antecedent conditions in operational forecasts it is expected that the reliability of the ensemble flood forecasts can be improved over the course of the forecast period as more observation data rainfall and streamflow becomes available given the simplicity of event based models the direct link between catchment response and a small number of model parameters further development of this approach has the potential to benefit practitioners who favour event based models for active decision making the results also provide insights about the relative importance of uncertainty from forecast rainfalls and losses on streamflow predictions in this catchment we found that the uncertainty from forecast average catchment rainfall depth is dominant the impact of uncertainty from antecedent conditions is of a similar magnitude to the impact of uncertainty from spatio temporal patterns of rainfall but overall these sources of uncertainty are of modest importance compared to forecast average depth this is an important outcome of the study as it lowers the impediment to using event based models for forecasting while continuous simulation models do avoid the need to explicitly consider antecedent conditions event based models have operational advantages in terms of simplicity computational burden ease of use inter operability with other systems and a wide user base of practitioners who use such models for planning and design purposes these factors potentially offer considerable advantages over continuous simulation models but the extent to which these outweigh the disadvantages of explicit initialisation is a matter for further research credit authorship

are exposed in the coastal areas of southern china and the thermal groundwaters are mostly low salinity and bicarbonate type mao et al 2015 the mineralization that occurs in thermal groundwater is significantly related to geological structures and occurs nearby heat sources such as magma líndal 1992 hou et al 2019 abdelali et al 2020 chiocchini et al 2010 the chemical composition of thermal groundwater is also dominated by water rock interactions occurring in the geothermal reservoirs at high temperatures kacandes and grandstaff 1989 saibi and ehara 2010 it is technically and economically difficult to directly find out the hydrogeochemical characteristics in the geothermal reservoir geothermal information can be easily interpreted from the thermal groundwater in hot springs or boreholes blasco et al 2018 however water rock interactions and other physicochemical processes such as dilution by shallow groundwater and steam losses affect the salinity of the ascending

different geothermometers may indicate that these assumptions are reliable when there is agreement between the estimated temperatures however calculated temperatures by several geothermometers show discrepancies and the primary assumptions should be revisited multicomponent mineral equilibrium geothermometry allows determining the reservoir temperature by assessing the saturation indices of a

this paper we focus on the hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of high salinity deep geothermal waters and shallow groundwater in the xinzhou geothermal field of guangdong province south china we put forward a new view on the formation of high salinity groundwater in the geothermal field there is a weak signal of seawater intrusion in the xinzhou geothermal field and the salty rock dissolution is the main reason for the formation of high salinity groundwater rather than the conventional water rock interaction in the granite region chemical geothermometers and multicomponent

and north north west directions the magma intrusion earthquake and new tectonic activity are continuously intense in the geological history in the long geological history period it has experienced many violent tectonic movements and magma multi stage invasion resulting in the major deep faults and the nearby secondary faults or rock fractures fractured bedrocks and deep faults play a critical role in the recharge and discharge of geothermal waters as infiltration and runoff channels fault zones are hosts to geothermal springs as they connect the deep crust to the surface and provide the

to 5 20 respectively according to the measured results of δd and δ18o the discrepancy still can be observed between thermal groundwater and non thermal groundwater d and 18o are more depleted in thermal wells with the average values of 43 6 and 6 54 the average values of δd and δ18o in the thermal springs are 42 4 and 6 36 respectively but the springs are enriched in d and 18o with the average values of 39 9 and 6 21 5 discussion 5 1 hydrochemical characteristics of thermal groundwater completely different from the bicarbonate type of non thermal groundwater in the springs all the thermal groundwaters are cl na type in thermal wells and thermal springs table 1 the hydrochemical characteristics of all the thermal groundwater samples are almost consistent fig 2 however the types of water chemistry are slightly different for non thermal groundwaters in the springs s1 and s6 belong to hco3 ca type while s2 and s5 are hco3 cl ca type for containing more cl and s3 and s4 are hco3 na ca and hco3 na types respectively for both thermal and non thermal groundwaters tds has a good correlation with the measured temperatures of the samples fig 3 except for hco3 tds has linear relationship with main anions cl and so4 2 and cations na and ca2 it indicates that water rock interaction at high temperature may be the dominant source of the chemical components of thermal groundwaters stelling et al 2016 based on the local thermal geology and hydrogeology the non thermal groundwaters from the springs represent shallow groundwaters additionally according to the differences of water types and chemical concentrations the thermal groundwaters from the thermal wells mostly represents deep geothermal fluids but the thermal groundwater from the thermal springs are possibly a mixture of deep geothermal fluids and shallow groundwaters the silica content of thermal groundwaters in granite hosted hydrothermal system is generally high but high contents of li and sr are mostly related to deep seated magmatic waters stelling et al 2016 lu et al 2017 wang et al 2018b sio2 has higher content in the thermal groundwaters and higher relationship with tds for all groundwater samples fig 4 li and sr have lower contents in the thermal groundwater and non thermal groundwater than those in the deep seated magmatic waters still are closely related to tds fig 4 therefore the deep seated magmatic waters have minor influence on water chemistry of the thermal and non thermal groundwater contrary to all other ionic content of the waters that were higher in thermal waters than in shallow groundwaters bicarbonate content of the shallow groundwaters was higher than that of all thermal well and thermal spring waters this suggests that the water mineral contents originated from water rocks reactions and for the shallow groundwaters high bicarbonate content can be attributed to carbonate dissolution by carbonic acid and or sulfuric acid from gypsum dissolution chen et al 2016 dotsika et al 2006 thermal springs higher bicarbonate contents compared to thermal wells but lower compared to normal temperature springs suggests that thermal springs have been diluted by hco3 rich shallow groundwater during their ascent to surface according to the hydrochemical characteristics of the thermal groundwaters it is speculated that the water rock interaction at high temperature controls the formation of water chemical components but has little to do with the mixing of magmatic fluids additionally shallow groundwaters may be mixed in the thermal springs with minor proportion because the water chemistry of thermal springs is much similar to that of thermal wells 5 2 estimation of circulation temperature and depth for thermal groundwater chemical geothermometers silica and cations used in this study to calculate the reservoirs temperature of the sampled thermal waters resulted in substantially different temperatures table 2 depending on various silica mineral phases silica geothermometers produced different temperatures as follows 1 quartz no steam loss and quartz with maximum steam loss fournier 1977 resulted in temperatures ranging from 155 5 c to 189 7 c and 127 1 c to 154 c respectively 2 chalcedony and chalcedony with maximum steam loss arnórsson et al 1983 yielded temperatures ranging from 79 8 c to 112 5 c and 102 2 c to 135 2 c respectively 3 a modified silica geothermometer verma and santoyo 1977 calculates reservoir temperatures is between 132 0 c and 166 9 c a range of unsuitable temperatures was obtained using different cation geothermometers 1 temperature calculated by na k mg geothermometer nieva and nieva 1987 ranges from 230 5 c to 229 8 c 2 calculated temperature with na k ca mg geothermometer nieva and nieva 1987 is between 101 4 c and 115 0 c 3 na k geothermometrical method arnórsson et al 1983 calculated temperatures varied from 16 0 c to 25 4 c 4 k mg geothermometer giggenbach et al 1983 temperatures ranged from 52 9 c to 57 6 c 5 na k ca geothermometer fournier and truesdell 1973 produced temperatures varying from 148 8 c to 158 3 c the sio2 concentration of geothermal waters is indicative of the reservoir temperature fournier and truesdell 1970 in general the more concentrated in silica the water sample is the higher the reservoir temperature tian et al 2018 canil and lacourse 2020 thermal wells and thermal spring waters show higher sio2 concentrations compared to shallow groundwaters as affirmed by the good linear correlation between the measured temperature and dissolved silica fig 3 and fig 4 combining this evidence to the observed high salinity of thermal groundwaters that increased with increasing measured temperature it is inferred that the elemental composition of the study area is highly influenced by water rock reactions at high temperature additionally the estimated sio2 temperatures are higher than the measured outlet temperatures of thermal wells and thermal springs it may possibly represent the thermal reservoir temperature in xinzhou geothermal field thecalculatedtemperatureofthe na k mggeothermometer vary from 230 5 c to 229 8 c ismuchlowerthanthemeasuredtemperature which is unsuitable for the natural conditions giggenbach 1988 provide the na k ca mg geothermometer to assess the attainment degree of fluid rock equilibrium the temperature evaluated by na k ca mg geothermometer is between 101 4 c and 115 0 c which may be reasonable and mayexcludetheinfluenceofthemixingprocess na k geothermometer temperatures were lower than the measured temperature this geothermometrical method relies on the na k ratios controlled by the dissolution equilibrium between albite and k feldspar minerals in the high temperature geothermal system generally na k geothermometer results are consistent when the estimated reservoir temperature is 150 c verma and santoyo 1997 abdelali et al 2020 high salinity geothermal waters with high so4 2 and ca2 contents resulted in unreliable na k calculated temperature calculated temperature deviations observed when na k geothermometer is applied to low to medium geothermal systems are attributed to the absence of equilibrium between albite and potassium feldspar minerals in the geothermal reservoir ellis 1979 hou et al 2019 li et al 2019b na k geothermometer calculated temperatures are not suitable for all thermal wells and thermal springs of the xinzhou geothermal field this observation suggests that higher na concentrations in the thermal waters may have originated from minerals other than the above mentioned aluminosilicates it can also be inferred that the na k ratio of the thermal waters is controlled by salty dissolution rather than mineral water chemical equilibrium tijani 2004 boschetti et al 2017 k mg temperatures are less than the field measured temperatures for most of thermal wells and therefore do not represent the equilibrium temperature in the reservoir this geothermometer generally applies to both high and low temperature geothermal systems and failure to reflect the deep reservoir conditions has been linked to faster re equilibration rates of mg bearing minerals guo et al 2017 li et al 2019a the k mg estimated temperature is not reliable and suggests that equilibrium among muscovite chlorite k feldspar and geofluids has not been achieved contrary to na k and k mg geothermometers the na k ca geothermometer is not related to equilibrium with any specific minerals in the geothermal reservoir arnórsson 1985 li et al 2019b fournier and truesdell 1973 derived the na k ca geothermometer to overcome temperature over estimations with na k geothermometer especially in ca rich geothermal water samples the performance in temperature estimation by na k ca geothermometer is associated with the k2 ca and na2 ca ratios used for this geothermometer which is sensitive to co2 degassing that may trigger calcite precipitation reactions ellis 1979 marini et al 1986 hou et al 2019 in this study na k ca temperatures are higher than the measured temperature and may be reliable silica geothermometrical methods are based on steady state ion exchange reactions between geothermal fluids and various silica phases in the deep reservoir rocks i e amorphous silica chalcedony quartz at equilibrium conditions tobler et al 2008 wishart 2015 different silica phases may react differently in a given hydrothermal system and their reaction rates are temperature pressure and fluid acidity dependent d amore et al 1987 other silica species under the lower temperatures such as chalcedony may control dissolved silica and the chalcedony geothermometer is suitable for low temperature under 110 c geothermal systems therefore the calculated temperature through the chalcedony geothermometer with maximum steam loss is not suitable for the real groundwater thermal reservoir temperature consequently the dissolved silica contents of hydrothermal fluid samples with nearly neutral ph between 5 and 7 relates to the equilibrium with stable silica phases at reservoir temperatures palandri and reed 2001 assuming that fluid samples collection was conducted following quick upflow movement of the fluid to the discharge point marini et al 1986 quartz geothermometer with maximum steam loss calculated temperatures for thermal wells are in a good agreement with the temperatures estimated by multicomponent mineral equilibrium temperature simulated using phreeqc software see text below from quartz geothermometer with maximum steam loss results it is inferred that the deep faults of the xinzhou geothermal field serve as a fast flow path for hydrothermal fluids from the deep reservoir to the discharge zone lu et al 2017 excellent prediction of reservoir temperature can be achieved by applying computed multicomponent mineral equilibria in geothermal waters palmer et al 2014 spycher et al 2014 king et al 2016 it consists of simulating progressive increments in temperature of hydrothermal fluids and observing changes in saturation states of different minerals assumed to be present in the reservoir equilibrium conditions it is considered as the equilibrium reservoir temperature a point of temperature at which a group of minerals simultaneously converges blasco et al 2018 the mineralogy of the aquifer formation combined with available literature previously published lu et al 2017 wang et al 2018a has been used to infer the minerals presumably present in xinzhou hydrothermal reservoir and hence considered in the modeling multicomponent mineral equilibrium temperature for five thermal well samples and six thermal spring samples with the highest measured temperature were inferred using phreeqci geochemical code and lnll thermodynamic database distributed with the code to achieve this the minerals presumably present in the reservoir and therefore considered in the modeling were selected on basis of previously published work lu et al 2017 and the mineralogy of the aquifer formation the fixal method were used to alleviate problems associated with erroneous al analyses in the waters or waters lacking al analyses requires to force the thermal water samples to be in equilibrium with an al bearing mineral k feldspar has been selected as a suitable al mineral phase to force equilibrium in system with ph value from 5 5 to 9 pang and reed 1998 the simulated temperatures with the fixal method use al to constrain and converge the convergence point of the simulated aluminosilicate minerals is the most likely equilibrium temperature value and the fluctuation range of simulated temperature does not exceed 5 c the simulation results displayed in fig 5 predict a reservoir temperature between 121 c and 154 c the predicted temperature reinforces the efficiency of quartz geothermometer with maximum steam loss results as the thermal water sample calculated temperatures are close to the results of the simulation while thermal well waters mineral clustering fall exactly in the equilibrium line at equilibrium temperature the thermal spring waters converged nearly at the same equilibrium temperature but the convergence point fell below the equilibrium in fig 5 considering the higher content of ca2 and so4 in thermal wells and thermal springs the anhydrite fitting temperature is also placed in fig 5 all anhydrite lines are located below the convergence fixal point indicating anhydrite does not reach the dissolution equilibrium at the convergence temperature which is most likely related to the mixing of shallow non geothermal groundwater the fact that both the thermal well waters and the thermal spring water converged at the same equilibrium temperature indicates that they originated from the same deep reservoir thermal spring waters converging below the equilibrium line is an additional sign of dilution at shallow levels by non thermal groundwater for thermal wells the anhydrite lines below but close to the convergence point indicate that the influence of shallow non geothermal groundwater mixing is minor but for thermal springs the anhydrite lines below but far from the convergence point indicate that the influence of shallow non geothermal groundwater mixing is significant this is consistent with the local hydrogeological conditions according to quartz estimated temperatures table 2 we calculated the circulation depth of the geothermal fluids using local annual average temperature of 22 5 c constant temperature zone at 13 m and geothermal gradient 3 04 c 100 m the average value of in situ measured in an 1 800 meter borehole in the xinzhou geothermal field geothermal water circulation depths can be estimated as follows mao et al 2015 lu et al 2017 d t t 0 g z 0 d is the fluid circulation maximum depth m t is the estimated reservoir equilibrium temperature c t0 is the local annual temperature c g is the thermal gradient c 100 m and z0 is the thickness of the constant temperature zone m the maximal circulation depth of the studied thermal groundwater is 4 34 km and the average circulation depth is 3 79 km table 2 5 3 circulation of high salinity thermal groundwater although the chemical characteristics are different between thermal and non thermal groundwaters the springs with normal temperatures represented as shallow groundwaters are hydrogeologically of a meteoric origin similarly to thermal wells and thermal springs according to fig 6 both thermal and non thermal groundwaters are close to the global meteoric water line gmwl of δd 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 and the local meteoric water line lmwl of δd 8 1δ18o 11 4 mao et al 2015 these results suggest that the recharge water is of meteoric origin with minor isotope exchange during groundwater circulation additionally the δ18o and δd values fall in the same range with other geothermal systems such as the onikobe geothermal system in japan δ18o from 7 4 to 4 4 δd from 57 5 to 48 4 truesdell and nakanishi 2005 the western anatolia geothermal field of turkey δ18o from 13 1 to 4 0 δd from 89 9 to 23 0 mutlu et al 2008 and the chios geothermal system of greece δ18o 7 4 to 1 6 δd from 46 0 to 6 0 dotsika et al 2006 these thermal groundwaters have experienced rapid cycling in hydrothermal systems after precipitation recharging with almost no isotope fractionation however the samples of tw3 and ts4 are located below gmwl and lmwl indicating significant oxygen drift this may be resulted from evaporation or oxygen isotope exchange between minerals and thermal groundwaters the strong water rock interaction at high temperature causes oxygen containing minerals to dissolve into the groundwater and form water chemical components isotope exchange occurs between dissolved mineral oxygen and groundwater oxygen resulting in groundwater oxygen drift deuterium excess has a possible indication to the source of groundwater salinization krishan et al 2020 then the temperature and tds of thermal groundwater may be related to the stable isotope composition of groundwater thereby revealing the source of groundwater additional information can be observed in fig 6 based on the average results of temperature tds and isotopes thermal well waters have highest temperature arverage 93 9 c compared with thermal spring waters arverage 83 c and spring water arverage 28 75 c but their isotopic composition value is the lowest thermal well waters have highest tds arverage 2741 mg l compared with thermal spring waters arverage 1952 mg l and spring water arverage 148 46 mg l but their isotopic composition value is the lowest these indicate that temperature and tds may have minor influence on the isotopic compositions of the thermal groundwater and thermal spring water seems to be the mixture of thermal well water and spring water because it is located between the latter two based upon the altitude effect of the meteoric hydrogen and oxygen isotopes the recharge altitude is determined and used to identify groundwater recharge area the recharge altitude of groundwater can be calculated as follows 2 h δ g δ p k h h is the recharge altitude m δg is the measured δd or δ18o values of the sampled groundwaters δp is the δd or δ18o values of atmospheric precipitation near the sampled point k is the isotope height gradient δ 100 m h is the sampled point elevation in the studied area the oxygen isotope exchange between groundwater and surrounding rocks may affect the values of oxygen isotope and the hydrogen bearing minerals have little effect on the composition of groundwater so choosing the measured δd values of the sampled groundwaters is suitable in table 1 the springs s1 s2 s5 s6 are recharged by shallow groundwater which can represent the annual average values of atmospheric precipitation isotope compositions therefore the average δd value 37 1 of the spring samples is identified as δp the k value is 2 100 m which is the δd height gradient value of studied area wang et al 2018a the calculation results of recharge altitude are listed in table 3 the recharge altitudes of thermal well and thermal spring groundwater is ranging from 101 m to 513 m and the average recharge altitude is 301 m according to recharge altitudes of thermal groundwater and hydrogeological conditions of the study area the zilou mountain area is considered to be recharge area in the southeast of the studied area which is 9000 m away from the studied area after groundwater receives atmospheric precipitation infiltration from the recharge area the circulation time of the runoff to a certain position in the groundwater system is called the groundwater age which is one of the important parameters to descript the circulation of groundwater migration based on radioactive isotope decay law many dating techniques are used to determine the age of groundwater and the radiocarbon 14c is the most widely used dating technique in the study of regional aquifers partially because of its range of groundwater dating from 102 to 3 4 104 yrs many corrections have been developed due to the diversity of carbon in groundwater and the complexity of water rock interactions during groundwater transport han and plummer 2016 thermal groundwater thermal wells and thermal springs and non thermal groundwater springs have the same meteoric origin but they have different average δ13c values thermal wells 10 02 thermal springs 13 87 springs 17 82 considering the additional dead carbon from mineral thermal alteration mao et al 2018 a modified δ13c mixing model is proposed to calibrate the 14c ages for the thermal groundwater all the carbon isotopes and 14c calibrated ages are listed and discussed in details in another prepared paper the ages of thermal well water range from 3 27 ka to 7 59 ka table 3 but the ages of thermal spring water range from 11 85 ka to 18 99 ka except for the age of ts1 is 5 85 ka the thermal wells are located at the local fault in the geothermal field and dominantly recharged by thermal groundwater in the local fault while the thermal springs are mainly recharged by thermal groundwater in the local fault accompanied by the mixing of different amounts of shallow non thermal groundwater the local faults have better permeability and the circulation of groundwater among them is faster therefore the thermal well water is young while the thermal spring water gets old due to mixing with shallow non thermal groundwater the groundwater ages recharge distances and reservoir depth can be used to characterize the circulation of hydrothermal system the horizontal and vertical circulation rates of thermal groundwater can be approximately evaluated as follows r h d 1 t r v 2 d 2 t where rh and rv represent the horizontal circulation rate and the vertical circulation rate respectively d1 and d2 represent recharge distance and reservoir depth respectively and t is the groundwater age the horizontal circulation rates of thermal groundwater range from 1 3 to 7 5 10 3 m d and the average horizontal circulation rate is 3 4 10 3 m d the vertical circulation rates of thermal groundwater range from 1 0 to 6 9 10 3 m d and the average vertical circulation rate is 3 0 10 3 m d phreeqci can calculate the mineral saturation index according to water chemistry parkhurst and appelo 2013 this software is widely used in the simulation of geochemical parameters of different hydrothermal systems tole et al 1993 asta et al 2012 battistel et al 2014 the saturation index si of the sampled waters in the study area simulated by phreeqci are shown in table 4 and suggests that thermal groundwater and shallow groundwater are of different hydrogeological backgrounds some minerals of all the sampled waters listed in table 4 are supersaturated such as anhydrite celestite fluorite gypsum halite huntite natrolite and sylvite and other minerals in thermal well and thermal spring sampled waters reach the equilibrium at sampling temperature but those of spring sampled waters do not it can be argued that various chemical processes of water rock interaction led to non thermal groundwater chemical composition gonfiantini and zuppi 2003 elango and kannan 2007 according to the chemistry table 1 and si table 4 anhydrite celestite fluorite gypsum halite huntite natrolite and sylvite minerals may be the major sources of chemical components dissolved in the thermal groundwater however the chemical components in the shallow groundwaters spring waters are possibly derived from the minerals of surrounding rocks due to water rock interactions the na 1000 k 100 mg1 2 triangle plot proposed by giggenbach 1988 was used to infer the equilibrium states of the thermal groundwater fig 7 and to assess the suitability of geothermal groundwater for the application of various cations geothermometrical methods the diagram shows that all thermal wells and thermal springs of the studied area are partially equilibrated waters suggesting that full chemical equilibrium of the geofluids has not been attained probably due to a lesser extent of water rock reactions or dilution process wang et al 2018a this indicates that water rock interactions mostly dominate the formation of chemical components in the thermal groundwaters but the fluids do not reach a complete chemical equilibrium state with the minerals additionally the springs representing shallow groundwaters are uniformly located in the area of immature waters fig 7 which is consistent with the hydrochemical characteristics of shallow groundwaters thermal wells and thermal springs of the xinzhou geothermal field are cl na water type as mentioned earlier their chemical composition is distinctively different from that of the shallow groundwater which may suggest that thermal waters are from a different aquifer to that of the shallow groundwaters silicate weathering carbonate weathering gypsum and halite dissolution and precipitation processes are major chemical contributing reactions in different aquifers marini et al 1986 fowler et al 2018 following the calculated saturation index and water type of the sampled thermal groundwater halite dissolution is the prime contributor in this case as to non thermal groundwaters water rock interactions dominate the formation of chemical components and halite probably provides a small contribution for relatively higher contents of na in s3 and s4 fig 8 the chemical composition of the thermal waters is governed by the dissolution of evaporated salty minerals as can be seen from fig 8 water rock interaction processes are considered to be a dominant factor that controls elemental contents of geothermal fluids of different hydrothermal systems with respect to other contributions such as seawater intrusions a careful study of major ions and trace elements of geothermal water especially conservative elements such as cl is frequently used to assess different geochemical processes occurring in the deep reservoir chen et al 2016 hou et al 2019 ion ratios showed in table 5 such as na cl cl br ca sr mg ca so4 cl and so4 mg are good chemical indicators to study the causes of groundwater the na cl value of sea water is about 0 87 less than this value means it may be affected by the mixing of sea water the ratios of na cl in thermal wells and thermal springs are about 0 5 and 0 4 which may suggest that sea water intrusions have been reported to contribute to the chemical composition of geothermal waters in the coastal area of guangdong province lu et al 2017 li et al 2018 the cl br as an important factor in sea water is about 300 and the cl br values of thermal wells and thermal springs are from 243 32 to 474 57 it seems to the mixing between sea water and thermal groundwater have fluence on groundwater chemical composition however according to the relationship between molar ratio of na br and cl br in fig 9 thermal groundwater samples are far from the point of sea this indicates that seawater intrusion has minor influence on the thermal groundwater thermal wells are much close to the halite dissolution line while thermal springs are above and away from this line fig 9 the ca sr and mg ca values are often used to calculate the impact of seawater intrusion and the ratios of ca sr and mg ca in sea water are 33 and 5 5 respectively the ca sr ratios of thermal wells and thermal springs are higher than 33 and the mg ca ratios of thermal wells and thermal springs are lower than 5 5 which reveals that sea water intrusions do not occur in the xinzhou geothermal field according to mao et al 2015 a layer of salty rock formed by evaporation generally exists within 200 m depth in west guangdong then it is proposed that salty rock dissolution provides the main components for thermal groundwater and thermal springs which may be also slightly mixed with shallow groundwater the geological settings of xinzhou geothermal field combined with isotopic and chemical characteristics of the thermal and non thermal groundwaters reveal the theoretical circulation model of the high salinity geothermal fluids in coastal eastern guangdong china fig 10 the stable isotopes showed that both thermal and non thermal water samples are of meteoric origin the fractured bedrocks facilitate the infiltration of meteoric waters that descends through the faults zone as the waters go deep below the surface area the temperature and pressure increase and lead to the decrease in density of the recharging waters the high temperature non solidifiedgranite is the most significant heat source in the south china block and the high heat conductions caused the groundwater to be heated zhou et al 2020 xie et al 2018 provided a detailed insight into the formation of the thermal anomaly beneath the guangdong province using a gravity study and the high anomalies in xinzhou geothermal field exist on the 3rd order detail which corresponds to the approximate depth about 15 km the maximum estimated depth the recharging waters may reach is about 4 34 km in the deep reservoir high temperature triggers the water rock interactions which enrich the waters in dissolved minerals the reservoir equilibrium temperature is in a range of 127 1 c to 154 0 c according to multicomponent minerals equilibrium and agrees with the quartz geothermometer temperatures with maximum steam loss the deep faults act as flow channels and the deep circulating geothermal fluids and heat transfer transport at the average 3 4 10 3 m d horizontal circulation rate and the average 3 0 10 3 m d vertical circulation rate after the geothermal fluids are heated at high temperatures of the reservoir rock they become less dense and ascend to the discharge zone driven by thermodynamic buoyancy water rock interactions dominate the formation of chemical components in both thermal and shallow groundwaters but the cause of the formation of high salinity groundwater is not only conventional water rock interactions and sea water intrusions do not occur in the geothermal system the salty rock about 200 m thickness dissolution provides the main components for thermal groundwater and a little shallow groundwater is mixed in the thermal springs when thermal groundwater flows out of the surface 6 conclusions the water chemistry and stable isotopes were employed to interpret the circulation of high salinity thermal groundwaters in xinzhou geothermal field south china the water chemical results show that thermal groundwaters are nearly neutral and cl na types with higher salinity tds 1700 mg l while the shallow groundwaters have various chemical types including hco3 na hco3 na ca hco3 ca and hco3 cl ca with lower salinity tds less than 180 mg l stable isotopes data indicate that the recharging waters are all meteoric in origin multicomponent mineral equilibrium and quartz geothermometers with maximum steam loss successfully assessed the deep reservoir temperature which was estimated to be in a range of 127 1 c to 154 0 c at a maximum circulation depth of 4 34 km on the other hand cation geothermometers results were unreliable due to the lack of equilibrium between geofluids and concerned minerals according to the saturation indices and the relationship between major ions with salinity tds it can be suggested that the high salinity in the thermal groundwaters is associated with salty rock dissolution the multicomponent mineral equilibrium and relationship of na br and cl br revealed that thermal spring waters suffered slight dilution effects by shallow groundwater compared to thermal well waters a conceptual circulation model of high salinity thermal groundwater in xinzhou geothermal field is finally proposed the geothermal fluids and heat transfer in the deep faults as flow channels have the circulation rates at the horizontal average 3 4 10 3 m d and the average vertical 3 0 10 3 m d water rock interactions dominate the formation of chemical components in both thermal and shallow groundwaters the salty rock dissolution provides the main components for thermal groundwater but sea water intrusions do not occur in the geothermal system the implication of the model is that reservoir temperature is poorly constrained by cation geothermometers applied to xinzhou thermal wells and spring compositions for dominated salty rock dissolution the model also suggests that the ascending movement of the geofluids is driven by thermodynamic buoyancy credit authorship contribution

4966,the high salinity geothermal water in the coastal zone is naturally considered to be formed by seawater intrusion however this is not all the case water chemistry and stable isotopes of thermal and non thermal groundwaters are used to investigate the hydrothermal circulation in xinzhou geothermal field located near the coast of south china thermal groundwaters are uniformly cl na type with higher salinity tds 1700 mg l but non thermal groundwaters regarded as shallow groundwater have various chemical types with lower salinity tds 180 mg l the waters are presumably of meteoric origin according to δd and δ18o cation geothermometers na k mg na k ca mg na k k mg na k ca and sio2 chalcedony geothermometers failed to predict the suitable reservoir temperature according to sio2 quartz geothermometer with maximum steam loss and multicomponent chemical equilibrium the maximum temperature in the reservoir is estimated to be in the range of 127 1 c to 154 0 c at a maximum circulation depth of 4 34 km the saturation index si simulated by phreeqci and na 1000 k 100 mg1 2 triangle plot suggests that the chemical components in the thermal groundwater are possibly derived from water rock interactions at high temperature as suggested by the ion ratios these interactions may be dominated by salty rock dissolution which is mostly related to the layer of salty rock formed by evaporation generally existing within 200 m depth in west guangdong the thermal groundwater flow in the deep faults at the average horizontal 3 4 10 3 m d and the average vertical 3 0 10 3 m d the

2009 magri et al 2012 wang and jiao 2012 awaleh et al 2015 identifying the circulation process especially the source of chemical components is of great significance for the utilization of high salinity thermal groundwater many research works have been published about the natural origin of the salinity of thermal groundwater in coastal areas which include fossil water tijani 2004 wang and jiao 2012 modern seawater intrusions triggered by excessive groundwater pumping ghabayen et al 2006 farid et al 2015 and dissolution of soluble salts vengosh et al 1994 a large number of hot springs are exposed in the coastal areas of southern china and the thermal groundwaters are mostly low salinity and bicarbonate type mao et al 2015 the mineralization that occurs in thermal groundwater is significantly related to geological structures and occurs nearby heat sources such as magma líndal 1992 hou et al 2019 abdelali et al 2020 chiocchini et al 2010 the chemical composition of thermal groundwater is also dominated by water rock interactions occurring in the geothermal reservoirs at high temperatures kacandes and grandstaff 1989 saibi and ehara 2010 it is technically and economically difficult to directly find out the hydrogeochemical characteristics in the geothermal reservoir geothermal information can be easily interpreted from the thermal groundwater in hot springs or boreholes blasco et al 2018 however water rock interactions and other physicochemical processes such as dilution by shallow groundwater and steam losses affect the salinity of the ascending geofluids peralta arnold et al 2017 setiawan et al 2020 understanding the formation mechanisms and circulation of high salinity geothermal fluids in coastal geothermal systems need to be clarified the circulation model of geofluids in a geothermal system can be revealed based on chemical geothermometers estimations which rely upon variations in elemental contents as a function of temperature water chemical geothermometers e g quartz chalcedony na k mg na k ca mg na k k mg and na k ca were employed to estimate the temperature of thermal groundwater in the deep reservoir fournier 1977 giggenbach 1988 fowler et al 2018 these geothermometrical relations are based on assumptions that 1 concentrations of chemical species reflect the reservoir fluid mineral equilibrium at the maximum underground temperature 2 there is no fluid re equilibration during the ascent to the discharge point 3 there was no mixing with fluids that are chemically different from the ascending fluid fowler et al 2018 different geothermometers may indicate that these assumptions are reliable when there is agreement between the estimated temperatures however calculated temperatures by several geothermometers show discrepancies and the primary assumptions should be revisited multicomponent mineral equilibrium geothermometry allows determining the reservoir temperature by assessing the saturation indices of a number minerals plausible to be in equilibrium with the fluid in the reservoir reed and spycher 1984 pang and reed 1998 spycher et al 2014 this method may also reveal secondary processes such as degassing mixing or mineral re equilibration that could affect the chemical composition of the ascending fluid palandri and reed 2001 all these geothermometrical methods in combination with chemical and isotopic data are key to a better understanding of the subsurface processes and reactions affecting the ascending fluid in a given geothermal system and thereafter revealing the sources of the salinity in coastal thermal groundwater the xinzhou geothermal field located in guangdong province south china were found near the beach with the high salinity hot springs and their chemical composition was discussed lu et al 2017 wang et al 2018a li et al 2018 considered the mixing with seawater causes high concentrations of the main ions na k ca mg and cl in the xinzhou geothermal field a proposed circulation model of thermal groundwater in the coastal xinzhou geothermal field wasbroughtup and the mixing process with seawater for thermal water samples might be related to seawater in loose sediments of the coastal area and widespread deep faults in granite rocks wang et al 2018a hu et al 2018 provided a 3 d geological model which is constructed to simulate the shape of hydrothermal reservoir hot saline brine and alteration zone in this research they reckoned thermal water originates as sea waters heated by deep circulation and moving in fractures and faults into shallow aquifer conceptual model for solid tides on geothermal flows in the xinzhou geothermal field was putforward and seawater intrusions were considered to affect the xinzhou field lu et al 2017 in this paper we focus on the hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of high salinity deep geothermal waters and shallow groundwater in the xinzhou geothermal field of guangdong province south china we put forward a new view on the formation of high salinity groundwater in the geothermal field there is a weak signal of seawater intrusion in the xinzhou geothermal field and the salty rock dissolution is the main reason for the formation of high salinity groundwater rather than the conventional water rock interaction in the granite region chemical geothermometers and multicomponent mineral equilibrium were used to assess the deep reservoir conditions and equilibrium temperature simulations by phreeqci also contributed to a better comprehension of the fluid mineral interactions finally a synthesis of our results into a conceptual circulation model of the geothermal fluid was proposed 2 hydrogeological and geothermal setting xinzhou geothermal field is located at xinzhou town yangjiang city guangdong province china the geographical location of the study area lies on the north shore of the south china sea between 112 15 26 north latitudes and 21 53 33 east longitudes xinzhou geothermal field is geologically affected by the combined action of eurasian plate pacific plate and philippine sea plate a series of faults were developed in guangdong with north north east and north north west directions the magma intrusion earthquake and new tectonic activity are continuously intense in the geological history in the long geological history period it has experienced many violent tectonic movements and magma multi stage invasion resulting in the major deep faults and the nearby secondary faults or rock fractures fractured bedrocks and deep faults play a critical role in the recharge and discharge of geothermal waters as infiltration and runoff channels fault zones are hosts to geothermal springs as they connect the deep crust to the surface and provide the fast flow paths to the recharging or discharging fluids the terrain where the xinzhou geothermal field is located looks like a basin which is called xinzhou basin topographically high in the west the xinzhou basin gradually decreases in elevation from north to south mountainous region and high lands terraces extend into the south china sea the region has a climate of southern subtropical monsoon

spring with the highest measured temperature 98 c in guangdong province wang et al 2018a the study area covers 212 km2 of which exposed granite rock body area is about 72 km2 and the area of the quaternary sediment of 140 km2 in the geological history period there have been several sub magma intrusions in xinzhou rock body indicating that there may still be hot granite not completely solidified in the deep underground lu et al 2017 almost all of the recharges for geothermal systems are meteoric waters and to a small extent geogenic water geothermal water is mainly discharged as hot springs 3 sampling and analysis methods thermal springs and normal temperature springs are distributed in the xinzhou geothermal field at the same time accompanied by several geothermal boreholes

dissolved inorganic carbon dic in the thermal groundwater samples were precipitated into baco3 at the sampling site by the addition of a saturated bacl2 solution these baco3 precipitation were sealed with no headspace and preserved at a low temperature with no air pollution after vacuum freezing and drying under the temperature of 50 c the purified baco3 powder was prepared for the 13c and 14c

temperatures as high as 38 c therefore the groundwaters with temperatures above and below 35 care respectively defined as the thermal and non thermal groundwaters in this paper the measured temperatures of thermal and non thermal groundwaters varied from 67 0 c to 98 0 c and from 26 2 c to 32 6 c respectively all the thermal groundwaters are nearly neutral with the ph ranging from 6 86

to 5 20 respectively according to the measured results of δd and δ18o the discrepancy still can be observed between thermal groundwater and non thermal groundwater d and 18o are more depleted in thermal wells with the average values of 43 6 and 6 54 the average values of δd and δ18o in the thermal springs are 42 4 and 6 36 respectively but the springs are enriched in d and 18o with the average values of 39 9 and 6 21 5 discussion 5 1 hydrochemical characteristics of thermal groundwater completely different from the bicarbonate type of non thermal groundwater in the springs all the thermal groundwaters are cl na type in thermal wells and thermal springs table 1 the hydrochemical characteristics of all the thermal groundwater samples are almost consistent fig 2 however the types of water chemistry are slightly different for non thermal groundwaters in the springs s1 and s6 belong to hco3 ca type while s2 and s5 are hco3 cl ca type for containing more cl and s3 and s4 are hco3 na ca and hco3 na types respectively for both thermal and non thermal groundwaters tds has a good correlation with the measured temperatures of the samples fig 3 except for hco3 tds has linear relationship with main anions cl and so4 2 and cations na and ca2 it indicates that water rock interaction at high temperature may be the dominant source of the chemical components of thermal groundwaters stelling et al 2016 based on the local thermal geology and hydrogeology the non thermal groundwaters from the springs represent shallow groundwaters additionally according to the differences of water types and chemical concentrations the thermal groundwaters from the thermal wells mostly represents deep geothermal fluids but the thermal groundwater from the thermal springs are possibly a mixture of deep geothermal fluids and shallow groundwaters the silica content of thermal groundwaters in granite hosted hydrothermal system is generally high but high contents of li and sr are mostly related to deep seated magmatic waters stelling et al 2016 lu et al 2017 wang et al 2018b sio2 has higher content in the thermal groundwaters and higher relationship with tds for all groundwater samples fig 4 li and sr have lower contents in the thermal groundwater and non thermal groundwater than those in the deep seated magmatic waters still are closely related to tds fig 4 therefore the deep seated magmatic waters have minor influence on water chemistry of the thermal and non thermal groundwater contrary to all other ionic content of the waters that were higher in thermal waters than in shallow groundwaters bicarbonate content of the shallow groundwaters was higher than that of all thermal well and thermal spring waters this suggests that the water mineral contents originated from water rocks reactions and for the shallow groundwaters high bicarbonate content can be attributed to carbonate dissolution by carbonic acid and or sulfuric acid from gypsum dissolution chen et al 2016 dotsika et al 2006 thermal springs higher bicarbonate contents compared to thermal wells but lower compared to normal temperature springs suggests that thermal springs have been diluted by hco3 rich shallow groundwater during their ascent to surface according to the hydrochemical characteristics of the thermal groundwaters it is speculated that the water rock interaction at high temperature controls the formation of water chemical components but has little to do with the mixing of magmatic fluids additionally shallow groundwaters may be mixed in the thermal springs with minor proportion because the water chemistry of thermal springs is much similar to that of thermal wells 5 2 estimation of circulation temperature and depth for thermal groundwater chemical geothermometers silica and cations used in this study to calculate the reservoirs temperature of the sampled thermal waters resulted in substantially different temperatures table 2 depending on various silica mineral phases silica geothermometers produced different temperatures as follows 1 quartz no steam loss and quartz with maximum steam loss fournier 1977 resulted in temperatures ranging from 155 5 c to 189 7 c and 127 1 c to 154 c respectively 2 chalcedony and chalcedony with maximum steam loss arnórsson et al 1983 yielded temperatures ranging from 79 8 c to 112 5 c and 102 2 c to 135 2 c respectively 3 a modified silica geothermometer verma and santoyo 1977 calculates reservoir temperatures is between 132 0 c and 166 9 c a range of unsuitable temperatures was obtained using different cation geothermometers 1 temperature calculated by na k mg geothermometer nieva and nieva 1987 ranges from 230 5 c to 229 8 c 2 calculated temperature with na k ca mg geothermometer nieva and nieva 1987 is between 101 4 c and 115 0 c 3 na k geothermometrical method arnórsson et al 1983 calculated temperatures varied from 16 0 c to 25 4 c 4 k mg geothermometer giggenbach et al 1983 temperatures ranged from 52 9 c to 57 6 c 5 na k ca geothermometer fournier and truesdell 1973 produced temperatures varying from 148 8 c to 158 3 c the sio2 concentration of geothermal waters is indicative of the reservoir temperature fournier and truesdell 1970 in general the more concentrated in silica the water sample is the higher the reservoir temperature tian et al 2018 canil and lacourse 2020 thermal wells and thermal spring waters show higher sio2 concentrations compared to shallow groundwaters as affirmed by the good linear correlation between the measured temperature and dissolved silica fig 3 and fig 4 combining this evidence to the observed high salinity of thermal groundwaters that increased with increasing measured temperature it is inferred that the elemental composition of the study area is highly influenced by water rock reactions at high temperature additionally the estimated sio2 temperatures are higher than the measured outlet temperatures of thermal wells and thermal springs it may possibly represent the thermal reservoir temperature in xinzhou geothermal field thecalculatedtemperatureofthe na k mggeothermometer vary from 230 5 c to 229 8 c ismuchlowerthanthemeasuredtemperature which is unsuitable for the natural conditions giggenbach 1988 provide the na k ca mg geothermometer to assess the attainment degree of fluid rock equilibrium the temperature evaluated by na k ca mg geothermometer is between 101 4 c and 115 0 c which may be reasonable and mayexcludetheinfluenceofthemixingprocess na k geothermometer temperatures were lower than the measured temperature this geothermometrical method relies on the na k ratios controlled by the dissolution equilibrium between albite and k feldspar minerals in the high temperature geothermal system generally na k geothermometer results are consistent when the estimated reservoir temperature is 150 c verma and santoyo 1997 abdelali et al 2020 high salinity geothermal waters with high so4 2 and ca2 contents resulted in unreliable na k calculated temperature calculated temperature deviations observed when na k geothermometer is applied to low to medium geothermal systems are attributed to the absence of equilibrium between albite and potassium feldspar minerals in the geothermal reservoir ellis 1979 hou et al 2019 li et al 2019b na k geothermometer calculated temperatures are not suitable for all thermal wells and thermal springs of the xinzhou geothermal field this observation suggests that higher na concentrations in the thermal waters may have originated from minerals other than the above mentioned aluminosilicates it can also be inferred that the na k ratio of the thermal waters is controlled by salty dissolution rather than mineral water chemical equilibrium tijani 2004 boschetti et al 2017 k mg temperatures are less than the field measured temperatures for most of thermal wells and therefore do not represent the equilibrium temperature in the reservoir this geothermometer generally applies to both high and low temperature geothermal systems and failure to reflect the deep reservoir conditions has been linked to faster re equilibration rates of mg bearing minerals guo et al 2017 li et al 2019a the k mg estimated temperature is not reliable and suggests that equilibrium among muscovite chlorite k feldspar and geofluids has not been achieved contrary to na k and k mg geothermometers the na k ca geothermometer is not related to equilibrium with any specific minerals in the geothermal reservoir arnórsson 1985 li et al 2019b fournier and truesdell 1973 derived the na k ca geothermometer to overcome temperature over estimations with na k geothermometer especially in ca rich geothermal water samples the performance in temperature estimation by na k ca geothermometer is associated with the k2 ca and na2 ca ratios used for this geothermometer which is sensitive to co2 degassing that may trigger calcite precipitation reactions ellis 1979 marini et al 1986 hou et al 2019 in this study na k ca temperatures are higher than the measured temperature and may be reliable silica geothermometrical methods are based on steady state ion exchange reactions between geothermal fluids and various silica phases in the deep reservoir rocks i e amorphous silica chalcedony quartz at equilibrium conditions tobler et al 2008 wishart 2015 different silica phases may react differently in a given hydrothermal system and their reaction rates are temperature pressure and fluid acidity dependent d amore et al 1987 other silica species under the lower temperatures such as chalcedony may control dissolved silica and the chalcedony geothermometer is suitable for low temperature under 110 c geothermal systems therefore the calculated temperature through the chalcedony geothermometer with maximum steam loss is not suitable for the real groundwater thermal reservoir temperature consequently the dissolved silica contents of hydrothermal fluid samples with nearly neutral ph between 5 and 7 relates to the equilibrium with stable silica phases at reservoir temperatures palandri and reed 2001 assuming that fluid samples collection was conducted following quick upflow movement of the fluid to the discharge point marini et al 1986 quartz geothermometer with maximum steam loss calculated temperatures for thermal wells are in a good agreement with the temperatures estimated by multicomponent mineral equilibrium temperature simulated using phreeqc software see text below from quartz geothermometer with maximum steam loss results it is inferred that the deep faults of the xinzhou geothermal field serve as a fast flow path for hydrothermal fluids from the deep reservoir to the discharge zone lu et al 2017 excellent prediction of reservoir temperature can be achieved by applying computed multicomponent mineral equilibria in geothermal waters palmer et al 2014 spycher et al 2014 king et al 2016 it consists of simulating progressive increments in temperature of hydrothermal fluids and observing changes in saturation states of different minerals assumed to be present in the reservoir equilibrium conditions it is considered as the equilibrium reservoir temperature a point of temperature at which a group of minerals simultaneously converges blasco et al 2018 the mineralogy of the aquifer formation combined with available literature previously published lu et al 2017 wang et al 2018a has been used to infer the minerals presumably present in xinzhou hydrothermal reservoir and hence considered in the modeling multicomponent mineral equilibrium temperature for five thermal well samples and six thermal spring samples with the highest measured temperature were inferred using phreeqci geochemical code and lnll thermodynamic database distributed with the code to achieve this the minerals presumably present in the reservoir and therefore considered in the modeling were selected on basis of previously published work lu et al 2017 and the mineralogy of the aquifer formation the fixal method were used to alleviate problems associated with erroneous al analyses in the waters or waters lacking al analyses requires to force the thermal water samples to be in equilibrium with an al bearing mineral k feldspar has been selected as a suitable al mineral phase to force equilibrium in system with ph value from 5 5 to 9 pang and reed 1998 the simulated temperatures with the fixal method use al to constrain and converge the convergence point of the simulated aluminosilicate minerals is the most likely equilibrium temperature value and the fluctuation range of simulated temperature does not exceed 5 c the simulation results displayed in fig 5 predict a reservoir temperature between 121 c and 154 c the predicted temperature reinforces the efficiency of quartz geothermometer with maximum steam loss results as the thermal water sample calculated temperatures are close to the results of the simulation while thermal well waters mineral clustering fall exactly in the equilibrium line at equilibrium temperature the thermal spring waters converged nearly at the same equilibrium temperature but the convergence point fell below the equilibrium in fig 5 considering the higher content of ca2 and so4 in thermal wells and thermal springs the anhydrite fitting temperature is also placed in fig 5 all anhydrite lines are located below the convergence fixal point indicating anhydrite does not reach the dissolution equilibrium at the convergence temperature which is most likely related to the mixing of shallow non geothermal groundwater the fact that both the thermal well waters and the thermal spring water converged at the same equilibrium temperature indicates that they originated from the same deep reservoir thermal spring waters converging below the equilibrium line is an additional sign of dilution at shallow levels by non thermal groundwater for thermal wells the anhydrite lines below but close to the convergence point indicate that the influence of shallow non geothermal groundwater mixing is minor but for thermal springs the anhydrite lines below but far from the convergence point indicate that the influence of shallow non geothermal groundwater mixing is significant this is consistent with the local hydrogeological conditions according to quartz estimated temperatures table 2 we calculated the circulation depth of the geothermal fluids using local annual average temperature of 22 5 c constant temperature zone at 13 m and geothermal gradient 3 04 c 100 m the average value of in situ measured in an 1 800 meter borehole in the xinzhou geothermal field geothermal water circulation depths can be estimated as follows mao et al 2015 lu et al 2017 d t t 0 g z 0 d is the fluid circulation maximum depth m t is the estimated reservoir equilibrium temperature c t0 is the local annual temperature c g is the thermal gradient c 100 m and z0 is the thickness of the constant temperature zone m the maximal circulation depth of the studied thermal groundwater is 4 34 km and the average circulation depth is 3 79 km table 2 5 3 circulation of high salinity thermal groundwater although the chemical characteristics are different between thermal and non thermal groundwaters the springs with normal temperatures represented as shallow groundwaters are hydrogeologically of a meteoric origin similarly to thermal wells and thermal springs according to fig 6 both thermal and non thermal groundwaters are close to the global meteoric water line gmwl of δd 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 and the local meteoric water line lmwl of δd 8 1δ18o 11 4 mao et al 2015 these results suggest that the recharge water is of meteoric origin with minor isotope exchange during groundwater circulation additionally the δ18o and δd values fall in the same range with other geothermal systems such as the onikobe geothermal system in japan δ18o from 7 4 to 4 4 δd from 57 5 to 48 4 truesdell and nakanishi 2005 the western anatolia geothermal field of turkey δ18o from 13 1 to 4 0 δd from 89 9 to 23 0 mutlu et al 2008 and the chios geothermal system of greece δ18o 7 4 to 1 6 δd from 46 0 to 6 0 dotsika et al 2006 these thermal groundwaters have experienced rapid cycling in hydrothermal systems after precipitation recharging with almost no isotope fractionation however the samples of tw3 and ts4 are located below gmwl and lmwl indicating significant oxygen drift this may be resulted from evaporation or oxygen isotope exchange between minerals and thermal groundwaters the strong water rock interaction at high temperature causes oxygen containing minerals to dissolve into the groundwater and form water chemical components isotope exchange occurs between dissolved mineral oxygen and groundwater oxygen resulting in groundwater oxygen drift deuterium excess has a possible indication to the source of groundwater salinization krishan et al 2020 then the temperature and tds of thermal groundwater may be related to the stable isotope composition of groundwater thereby revealing the source of groundwater additional information can be observed in fig 6 based on the average results of temperature tds and isotopes thermal well waters have highest temperature arverage 93 9 c compared with thermal spring waters arverage 83 c and spring water arverage 28 75 c but their isotopic composition value is the lowest thermal well waters have highest tds arverage 2741 mg l compared with thermal spring waters arverage 1952 mg l and spring water arverage 148 46 mg l but their isotopic composition value is the lowest these indicate that temperature and tds may have minor influence on the isotopic compositions of the thermal groundwater and thermal spring water seems to be the mixture of thermal well water and spring water because it is located between the latter two based upon the altitude effect of the meteoric hydrogen and oxygen isotopes the recharge altitude is determined and used to identify groundwater recharge area the recharge altitude of groundwater can be calculated as follows 2 h δ g δ p k h h is the recharge altitude m δg is the measured δd or δ18o values of the sampled groundwaters δp is the δd or δ18o values of atmospheric precipitation near the sampled point k is the isotope height gradient δ 100 m h is the sampled point elevation in the studied area the oxygen isotope exchange between groundwater and surrounding rocks may affect the values of oxygen isotope and the hydrogen bearing minerals have little effect on the composition of groundwater so choosing the measured δd values of the sampled groundwaters is suitable in table 1 the springs s1 s2 s5 s6 are recharged by shallow groundwater which can represent the annual average values of atmospheric precipitation isotope compositions therefore the average δd value 37 1 of the spring samples is identified as δp the k value is 2 100 m which is the δd height gradient value of studied area wang et al 2018a the calculation results of recharge altitude are listed in table 3 the recharge altitudes of thermal well and thermal spring groundwater is ranging from 101 m to 513 m and the average recharge altitude is 301 m according to recharge altitudes of thermal groundwater and hydrogeological conditions of the study area the zilou mountain area is considered to be recharge area in the southeast of the studied area which is 9000 m away from the studied area after groundwater receives atmospheric precipitation infiltration from the recharge area the circulation time of the runoff to a certain position in the groundwater system is called the groundwater age which is one of the important parameters to descript the circulation of groundwater migration based on radioactive isotope decay law many dating techniques are used to determine the age of groundwater and the radiocarbon 14c is the most widely used dating technique in the study of regional aquifers partially because of its range of groundwater dating from 102 to 3 4 104 yrs many corrections have been developed due to the diversity of carbon in groundwater and the complexity of water rock interactions during groundwater transport han and plummer 2016 thermal groundwater thermal wells and thermal springs and non thermal groundwater springs have the same meteoric origin but they have different average δ13c values thermal wells 10 02 thermal springs 13 87 springs 17 82 considering the additional dead carbon from mineral thermal alteration mao et al 2018 a modified δ13c mixing model is proposed to calibrate the 14c ages for the thermal groundwater all the carbon isotopes and 14c calibrated ages are listed and discussed in details in another prepared paper the ages of thermal well water range from 3 27 ka to 7 59 ka table 3 but the ages of thermal spring water range from 11 85 ka to 18 99 ka except for the age of ts1 is 5 85 ka the thermal wells are located at the local fault in the geothermal field and dominantly recharged by thermal groundwater in the local fault while the thermal springs are mainly recharged by thermal groundwater in the local fault accompanied by the mixing of different amounts of shallow non thermal groundwater the local faults have better permeability and the circulation of groundwater among them is faster therefore the thermal well water is young while the thermal spring water gets old due to mixing with shallow non thermal groundwater the groundwater ages recharge distances and reservoir depth can be used to characterize the circulation of hydrothermal system the horizontal and vertical circulation rates of thermal groundwater can be approximately evaluated as follows r h d 1 t r v 2 d 2 t where rh and rv represent the horizontal circulation rate and the vertical circulation rate respectively d1 and d2 represent recharge distance and reservoir depth respectively and t is the groundwater age the horizontal circulation rates of thermal groundwater range from 1 3 to 7 5 10 3 m d and the average horizontal circulation rate is 3 4 10 3 m d the vertical circulation rates of thermal groundwater range from 1 0 to 6 9 10 3 m d and the average vertical circulation rate is 3 0 10 3 m d phreeqci can calculate the mineral saturation index according to water chemistry parkhurst and appelo 2013 this software is widely used in the simulation of geochemical parameters of different hydrothermal systems tole et al 1993 asta et al 2012 battistel et al 2014 the saturation index si of the sampled waters in the study area simulated by phreeqci are shown in table 4 and suggests that thermal groundwater and shallow groundwater are of different hydrogeological backgrounds some minerals of all the sampled waters listed in table 4 are supersaturated such as anhydrite celestite fluorite gypsum halite huntite natrolite and sylvite and other minerals in thermal well and thermal spring sampled waters reach the equilibrium at sampling temperature but those of spring sampled waters do not it can be argued that various chemical processes of water rock interaction led to non thermal groundwater chemical composition gonfiantini and zuppi 2003 elango and kannan 2007 according to the chemistry table 1 and si table 4 anhydrite celestite fluorite gypsum halite huntite natrolite and sylvite minerals may be the major sources of chemical components dissolved in the thermal groundwater however the chemical components in the shallow groundwaters spring waters are possibly derived from the minerals of surrounding rocks due to water rock interactions the na 1000 k 100 mg1 2 triangle plot proposed by giggenbach 1988 was used to infer the equilibrium states of the thermal groundwater fig 7 and to assess the suitability of geothermal groundwater for the application of various cations geothermometrical methods the diagram shows that all thermal wells and thermal springs of the studied area are partially equilibrated waters suggesting that full chemical equilibrium of the geofluids has not been attained probably due to a lesser extent of water rock reactions or dilution process wang et al 2018a this indicates that water rock interactions mostly dominate the formation of chemical components in the thermal groundwaters but the fluids do not reach a complete chemical equilibrium state with the minerals additionally the springs representing shallow groundwaters are uniformly located in the area of immature waters fig 7 which is consistent with the hydrochemical characteristics of shallow groundwaters thermal wells and thermal springs of the xinzhou geothermal field are cl na water type as mentioned earlier their chemical composition is distinctively different from that of the shallow groundwater which may suggest that thermal waters are from a different aquifer to that of the shallow groundwaters silicate weathering carbonate weathering gypsum and halite dissolution and precipitation processes are major chemical contributing reactions in different aquifers marini et al 1986 fowler et al 2018 following the calculated saturation index and water type of the sampled thermal groundwater halite dissolution is the prime contributor in this case as to non thermal groundwaters water rock interactions dominate the formation of chemical components and halite probably provides a small contribution for relatively higher contents of na in s3 and s4 fig 8 the chemical composition of the thermal waters is governed by the dissolution of evaporated salty minerals as can be seen from fig 8 water rock interaction processes are considered to be a dominant factor that controls elemental contents of geothermal fluids of different hydrothermal systems with respect to other contributions such as seawater intrusions a careful study of major ions and trace elements of geothermal water especially conservative elements such as cl is frequently used to assess different geochemical processes occurring in the deep reservoir chen et al 2016 hou et al 2019 ion ratios showed in table 5 such as na cl cl br ca sr mg ca so4 cl and so4 mg are good chemical indicators to study the causes of groundwater the na cl value of sea water is about 0 87 less than this value means it may be affected by the mixing of sea water the ratios of na cl in thermal wells and thermal springs are about 0 5 and 0 4 which may suggest that sea water intrusions have been reported to contribute to the chemical composition of geothermal waters in the coastal area of guangdong province lu et al 2017 li et al 2018 the cl br as an important factor in sea water is about 300 and the cl br values of thermal wells and thermal springs are from 243 32 to 474 57 it seems to the mixing between sea water and thermal groundwater have fluence on groundwater chemical composition however according to the relationship between molar ratio of na br and cl br in fig 9 thermal groundwater samples are far from the point of sea this indicates that seawater intrusion has minor influence on the thermal groundwater thermal wells are much close to the halite dissolution line while thermal springs are above and away from this line fig 9 the ca sr and mg ca values are often used to calculate the impact of seawater intrusion and the ratios of ca sr and mg ca in sea water are 33 and 5 5 respectively the ca sr ratios of thermal wells and thermal springs are higher than 33 and the mg ca ratios of thermal wells and thermal springs are lower than 5 5 which reveals that sea water intrusions do not occur in the xinzhou geothermal field according to mao et al 2015 a layer of salty rock formed by evaporation generally exists within 200 m depth in west guangdong then it is proposed that salty rock dissolution provides the main components for thermal groundwater and thermal springs which may be also slightly mixed with shallow groundwater the geological settings of xinzhou geothermal field combined with isotopic and chemical characteristics of the thermal and non thermal groundwaters reveal the theoretical circulation model of the high salinity geothermal fluids in coastal eastern guangdong china fig 10 the stable isotopes showed that both thermal and non thermal water samples are of meteoric origin the fractured bedrocks facilitate the infiltration of meteoric waters that descends through the faults zone as the waters go deep below the surface area the temperature and pressure increase and lead to the decrease in density of the recharging waters the high temperature non solidifiedgranite is the most significant heat source in the south china block and the high heat conductions caused the groundwater to be heated zhou et al 2020 xie et al 2018 provided a detailed insight into the formation of the thermal anomaly beneath the guangdong province using a gravity study and the high anomalies in xinzhou geothermal field exist on the 3rd order detail which corresponds to the approximate depth about 15 km the maximum estimated depth the recharging waters may reach is about 4 34 km in the deep reservoir high temperature triggers the water rock interactions which enrich the waters in dissolved minerals the reservoir equilibrium temperature is in a range of 127 1 c to 154 0 c according to multicomponent minerals equilibrium and agrees with the quartz geothermometer temperatures with maximum steam loss the deep faults act as flow channels and the deep circulating geothermal fluids and heat transfer transport at the average 3 4 10 3 m d horizontal circulation rate and the average 3 0 10 3 m d vertical circulation rate after the geothermal fluids are heated at high temperatures of the reservoir rock they become less dense and ascend to the discharge zone driven by thermodynamic buoyancy water rock interactions dominate the formation of chemical components in both thermal and shallow groundwaters but the cause of the formation of high salinity groundwater is not only conventional water rock interactions and sea water intrusions do not occur in the geothermal system the salty rock about 200 m thickness dissolution provides the main components for thermal groundwater and a little shallow groundwater is mixed in the thermal springs when thermal groundwater flows out of the surface 6 conclusions the water chemistry and stable isotopes were employed to interpret the circulation of high salinity thermal groundwaters in xinzhou geothermal field south china the water chemical results show that thermal groundwaters are nearly neutral and cl na types with higher salinity tds 1700 mg l while the shallow groundwaters have various chemical types including hco3 na hco3 na ca hco3 ca and hco3 cl ca with lower salinity tds less than 180 mg l stable isotopes data indicate that the recharging waters are all meteoric in origin multicomponent mineral equilibrium and quartz geothermometers with maximum steam loss successfully assessed the deep reservoir temperature which was estimated to be in a range of 127 1 c to 154 0 c at a maximum circulation depth of 4 34 km on the other hand cation geothermometers results were unreliable due to the lack of equilibrium between geofluids and concerned minerals according to the saturation indices and the relationship between major ions with salinity tds it can be suggested that the high salinity in the thermal groundwaters is associated with salty rock dissolution the multicomponent mineral equilibrium and relationship of na br and cl br revealed that thermal spring waters suffered slight dilution effects by shallow groundwater compared to thermal well waters a conceptual circulation model of high salinity thermal groundwater in xinzhou geothermal field is finally proposed the geothermal fluids and heat transfer in the deep faults as flow channels have the circulation rates at the horizontal average 3 4 10 3 m d and the average vertical 3 0 10 3 m d water rock interactions dominate the formation of chemical components in both thermal and shallow groundwaters the salty rock dissolution provides the main components for thermal groundwater but sea water intrusions do not occur in the geothermal system the implication of the model is that reservoir temperature is poorly constrained by cation geothermometers applied to xinzhou thermal wells and spring compositions for dominated salty rock dissolution the model also suggests that the ascending movement of the geofluids is driven by thermodynamic buoyancy credit authorship contribution

4967,soil structure is an indicator of soil quality and its alterations following cropping system conversion or fertilization change evolve slowly how such alterations vary with scale remains elusive we investigated this based on the rothamsted long term wheat experiment since 1843 in the uk triplicate cores 7 cm high and 10 cm in diameter were taken from plots that have been under different fertilizations or returned to natural woodland for more than one century for imaging using x ray computed tomography with the voxel size being 40 µm we then broke each core and sampled three aggregates from it to scan with the voxel size being 1 5 µm for each core and aggregate sample we calculated its pore size distribution permeability and tortuosity the results showed that the fertilization change 170 years ago reshaped the soil structure differently between the core scale and the aggregate scale macro porosity of the pores 40 µm in the cores unfertilized or fertilized with inorganic fertilizers was low and the pores were poorly connected in the top 10 cm of soil compared to those given farmyard manure or in the woodland in all treatments the pores in the core images were hydraulically anisotropic with their permeability in the horizontal direction being higher than that in the vertical direction whereas the aggregates were comparatively isotropic the fertilization affected image porosity and permeability at core scale more significantly than at aggregate scale and the aggregates fertilized with farmyard manure and in the woodland were more permeable than the aggregates in other treatments it was also found that compared to no fertilization or fertilization with complete fertilizers fertilizing without phosphorus over the past 20 years increased the porosity and permeability of the aggregates but not of the cores fertilization with inorganic fertilizers increased the tortuosity of the macropores in the cores but not of the intra aggregate pores compared to no fertilization porosity permeability relationship for aggregates unfertilized or fertilized with inorganic fertilisers followed a power law with r 2 0 8 in contrast the permeability of the aggregates in farmyard manure and in the woodland trended differently as their porosity increased the results also revealed that the transport ability of the aggregates and cores responded differently to carbon in that with soil carbon increasing the permeability of the aggregates increased asymptotically while the permeability of the cores especially its horizontal component increased exponentially keywords rothamsted long term experiment hierarchical soil structural change pore scale simulations x ray computed tomography 1 introduction most soils in natural and managed terrestrial ecosystems are hierarchically structured with their pores ranging from less than one micron to several millimetres in diameter young and crawford 2004 such structures are a result of the interplay of a multitude of abiotic and biotic processes operating over a wide range of scales and are the foundation of all life in terrestrial ecosystems as they keep the soil moist and oxygenated young et al 2008b macropores in soil are formed mainly by actions of plant roots earthworms aggregations as well as swelling and shrinkage bronick and lal 2005 providing preferential pathways for water and nutrients to flow beven and germann 2013 in contrast micropores formed biotically and abiotically function as storage to retain water and nutrients feeney et al 2006 kallenbach et al 2016 totsche et al 2018 microorganisms play a critical role in soil genesis and their feedback reactions with soil structure are mediated by organic matter in complex ways young et al 2008a however it is generally accepted that boosting microbial activities increases soil porosity due to the enhanced soil aggregation for example crawford et al 2012 found that incubating a repacked fine textured soil for three weeks resulted in a 17 increase in porosity the importance of soil structure in physical and biogeochemical processes is fairly understood in addition to its well documented role in controlling water flow and solute transport soil structure also plays a critical role in other soil functions kravchenko and guber 2017 as recent findings revealed that enzymatic activities were strongly associated with a specific range of pores implying that carbon and nutrient cycling in soil is also pore dependant kravchenko et al 2019 soil reorganizes its structure following agronomic practice changes caplan et al 2017 tillage and root growth could instantly reshape soil structure while the change induced by microbial activities could be a slow process crawford et al 2012 kallenbach et al 2016 for example bacq labreuil et al 2020 recently found that following conversion from a fallowed land to arable and grassland the change in intra aggregate structure did not reach equilibrium 10 years after the conversion the rothamsted long term wheat experiment also revealed that soil carbon took approximately one century to stabilize after changing fertilization to farmyard manure poulton et al 2018 as the dynamics of soil carbon is determined by its accessibility to microbes dungait et al 2012 which in turn is modulated by soil structure it is rational to conjecture that the change in soil structure following the fertilization change could not reach equilibrium before soil carbon stabilized this is also corroborated by recent findings that soil physical properties affected soil carbon and nitrogen more than soil enzymes and microbial communities li et al 2020 understanding the multiscale soil structural alteration instigated by agricultural practice change is hence important as pores at different scales play different roles in hydrological and biogeochemical functions wang et al 2019 yudina and kuzyakov 2019 most macroscopic phenomena measured in soil emerge from biogeochemical and physical processes occurring at the microscopic scale baveye et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 and it has been increasingly recognized that it is impossible to reliably predict physical and biochemical processes by studying the bulk soils alone wilpiszeski et al 2019 as such there has been a surge in study of soil structure and its impact on water and solute transport over the past two decades largely due to the development in x ray computed tomography ct and its application in soil science helliwell et al 2013 huang et al 2015 schlüter et al 2014 one application of x ray ct is to quantify soil structural change induced by agronomic management lucas et al 2019 piccoli et al 2019 soto gomez et al 2020 as well as its consequence for hydrological process armenise et al 2018 baveye et al 2018 gharedaghloo et al 2018 luo et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 modelling water flow and solute transport in hierarchically structured soils often separates their macropores and micropores into two hydraulically linked domains with flow and transport in each domain represented by a set of equations and the mass exchange between the two domains described by empirical formulae gerke and van genuchten 1993 larsson and jarvis 1999 simunek et al 2003 vogel et al 2000 separating the pores into two domains improves the model but it also increases the numbers of parameters which have to be determined empirically by calibration against observed data frey et al 2016 haas et al 2020 lamy et al 2009 the x ray ct has potential to plug this gap but needs to scan the soil at multiscale so as to characterize the inter aggregate pore geometry at a macro scale and the intra aggregates pore geometry at a micro scale li et al 2018b zhang et al 2016 linking soil hydraulic conductivity to pore geometry obtained from x ray images is available but most them integrated the macropores and micropores koestel et al 2018 pohlitz et al 2019 schlüter et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 there are also studies on geometrical change in both intra aggregate pores and macropores borges et al 2019 galdos et al 2019 koestel and schluter 2019 pires et al 2019 schlüter et al 2018 as well as their temporal evolution under different managements lucas et al 2019 schlüter et al 2011 while a change in agronomical practices could lead to an instant change in pore geometries it might take decades or even century for the pore geometries to reach a new statistically equilibrium state on average across the field following fertilization change or land conversion lohse and dietrich 2005 lucas et al 2019 neal et al 2020a therefore for experiments using repacked soils that did not last long enough crawford et al 2012 kallenbach et al 2016 menon et al 2020 rabbi et al 2018 the observed soil structural change might be a just temporary transition rather than what the soil would ultimately evolve to the hierarchical soil structure is formed by a multitude of biotic and abiotic processes operating at different scales and how this multiscale structure responds to management practice change is poorly understood apart from this another issue that has been overlooked is hydraulic anisotropy soil anisotropy is important not only in hillslope hydrology for lateral water flow but also in plant uptake of water as vertically dominant roots drive water to flow mainly in the horizontal direction towards the roots zhang et al 2020 this paper aims to investigate the impact of long term fertilizations on soil structural change and the associated hydraulic properties at different scales based on the rothamsted long term experiment in the uk that has been in operation since 1843 soil samples taken from plots under different fertilizations for more than a century were scanned using x ray ct at multiple scales and the impact of the long term fertilizations on soil structure was analysed based on the physical parameters calculated from these multiscale images 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the rothamsted long term experiment at broadbalk latitude 51 48 34 44 n longitude 0 21 22 76 w started in 1843 to test the effects of various combinations of inorganic fertilizers n p k and mg and organic manure on the yield of winter wheat with a unfertilized strip as the control the mean annual temperature and rainfall on the site is 10 1 c and 701 mm respectively http www era rothamsted ac uk the soil on the site is predominantly clay loam classified as chromic luvisol fao classification the plough layer 0 23 cm contains 25 of sand 25 of silt and 50 of clay with an average particle density of 2 56 g cm3 gregory et al 2010 the ph is maintained at 7 7 5 by liming since its inception the experiment was made a few changes aimed to make it representative to the changes in farming in the uk detailed description of the experiment is available online http www era rothamsted ac uk and in the literature blair et al 2006 watts et al 2006 we provide in the supplementary information the fertilization history and layout of the experimental site in short the site consists of 19 strips each associated with a specific fertilization ranging from farmyard manure to different combinations of nitrogen phosphorus potassium and magnesium minerals initially all 19 strips were for continuous wheat and they all were made into 10 sections later aimed to compare the impact of other agronomic managements under the same fertilization including a straw incorporation since1986 in 1882 a part on the west edge of the site was withdrawn from cultivation leading to development of a small area of woodland colonised by various grass species and trees mostly ash fraxinus excelsior sycamore acer pseudoplatanus and hawthorn craetagus monogyna poulton et al 2003 2 2 acquisition of soil images triplicate cores 7 cm high and 10 cm in diameter were taken in october 2015 from each of the following four plots marked in the supplementary information that have been under different fertilizations since 1843 an unfertilized plot referred to as ck a plot given farmyard manure referred to as fym and two other plots that have been fertilized with different combinations of inorganic minerals there were some changes in fertilization after its inception and the details are given in the supplementary information in what follows we will refer the plot that is currently receiving 144 kg of n 90 kg of k and 35 kg of p and 12 kg of mg as n3 and the plot that has not received p since 2001 as no p as a comparison triplicate cores were also taken from the woodland each sample was taken by gently hammering a pvc core into the topsoil with the core top 1 2 cm below the soil surface we then dug the core out after removing the soil surrounding the core using a trowel loose soil and extra soil at the two ends of the core were peeled off using a sharp knife before tightly wrapping it with plastic films prior to x ray imaging all cores were scanned using x ray ct and details of the procedure were given in previous work bacq labreuil et al 2018 in short we used the phoenix v tome x m scanner ge measurement and control solution wunstorf germany at the hounsfield facility of university of nottingham to scan the cores under 160 kv and 180μa at a pixel resolution of 40 μm after the scanning each core was manually broken to pass through a series of sieves of 4 2 and 0 71 mm by horizontally shaking at 300 rotations min for 3 min and three aggregates retained in the sieves of 2 mm and 0 71 mm were randomly selected and scanned using a phoenix nanotom ge measurement and control solution wunstorf germany under 90 kv and 65μa at a pixel resolution of 1 51 μm the sizes of all aggregates were thus approximately 0 8 mm to 4 mm the scanned images were reconstructed using the software provided by the manufacturer with an optimisation to correct any possible sample movement during the scanning process to avoid internal collapse of the cores all cores were scanned at prevailing water content approximately the field capacity while the aggregates were scanned after an overnight of air drying we first analysed the images using image j with a region of interest roi cropped out from each image for ease of analysis the rois of the core images 1000x1000x1000 were positioned centrally to exclude the gaps between the soil and the pvc wall while for the irregular aggregates we cropped a cuboid roi 640x480x400 out of each image the cropped rois were greyscale and they were segmented using the bin bi level threshold method presented in vogel and kretzschmar 1996 details of the segmentation method were given previously bacq labreuil et al 2018 in short 20 slices were randomly selected from each stack and each slice had a single threshold value that was calculated from the li threshold algorithm in image j the values of the two thresholds used in the bin bi level method for segmenting the stack were calculated from the extreme values obtained from the 20 slices prior to pore geometry analysis and pore scale simulation all hydraulically isolated void voxels were removed and replaced by solid voxels 2 3 permeability the permeability of all cores and aggregates was calculated from pore scale simulation of water flow in their pore space using the lattice boltzmann lb model we developed previously zhang et al 2010 most early lb models used for pore scale simulation were based on the single relaxation time srt approach qian et al 1992 but it was later found that the commonly used bounce back method associated with the srt model was erroneous for solving the fluid wall boundary pan et al 2006 the multiple relaxation time mrt lb method can resolve this problem d humières et al 2002 and was used in this paper details of the method and its implementation are given in the supplementary information water flow in each sample was driven by a pressure gradient in a direction generated by imposing a high pressure on one side and a low pressure on the opposite side of the sample other four sides were treated as periodic boundaries we selected three pressure gradients to ensure that water flow was laminar and that the average flow rate was proportional to the pressure gradient in all simulations the initial velocity was zero and the flow was simulated to steady state deemed to have reached when the relative difference in the average flow rate at two moments spanning 100 time steps was less than 10 7 we then sampled the velocity and pressure at all voxels and volumetrically averaged them over each cross section perpendicular to the pressure gradient direction to calculate the permeability we sampled the pressure aimed to check pore homogeneity as our previous work showed that the average pressure distribution could become nonlinear in highly heterogeneous soils li et al 2018a to test hydraulic anisotropy we calculated the permeability in the three directions of each sample for simulation under each pressure gradient the volumetric average water flow was assumed to follow the darcy s law taking the pressure gradient generated in the z direction as an example that means 1 q z z k ρ u p z where qz z is the average flow rate over the cross section perpendicular to the z direction cm s k is permeability cm2 u is kinematic viscosity of water cm s p is the averaged pressure over the cross section kpa and ρ is water density g cm3 the average water flow rate and pressure were calculated from pore scale simulation as follows 2 q z z i 1 n zw u z x i y i z n z p z i 1 n zw p x i y i z n zw where nz and nzw are the number of all voxels and the number of water filled voxels in the cross section located at z respectively p x i y i z and u z x i y i z are water pressure and water velocity component in the z direction at voxel centred on x i y i z respectively at steady state q z z is independent of z because of the mass balance constraint and the permeability of the sample was hence calculated from 3 k ρ u q z l p 1 p 0 where l cm is the length of the sample in the z direction once the permeability k was calculated its associated hydraulic conductivity k can be calculated from k kg μ with g being the gravitational acceleration cm s2 since water density and viscosity depend on temperature and chemical composition of the water the hydraulic conductivity is not constant but varies with soil environment in what follows we hence use permeability rather than convert it to hydraulic conductivity 2 4 pore size distribution and tortuosity we calculated the pore size distribution for both aggregates and cores using the plug in ct image analysis manipulation scamp houston et al 2017 and bone j in image j respectively finding that the difference between the two was less than 5 in what follows we only present the results obtained from bone j we expressed the pore size distribution as volumetric fraction of pores of different sizes tortuosity is a parameter widely used to characterize porous materials but it could be calculated based on a specific transport process ghanbarian et al 2013 or geometrical connection of the pores roque and costa 2020 different methods could give different results since the focus of this paper is viscous fluid flow following koponen et al 1996 we calculated it as the ratio of the sum of the absolute bulk fluid velocity in all voxels to the sum of the velocity component in the pressure gradient direction as soil permeability depends predominantly on hydraulically connected larger pores for each sample we also calculated its critical pore diameter similar to that used in our previous work neal et al 2020b in brief each pore mapped out by the bone j comprised a group of void voxels starting from the pores with the largest diameter we calculated if the void voxels in these pores could form a cluster s stretching from the inlet to the outlet faces if they could not we reduced the pore diameter sequentially until we found a diameter that the void voxels in pores with diameter equal to or larger than it formed a cluster s linking the inlet and the outlet faces 3 results fig 1 shows the greyscale images of the cores taken from the five treatments to visually illustrate their difference fig 2 compares the greyscale images of the aggregates and their associated segmentation to show the impact of the treatments as well as the accuracy of the segmentation method the sizes of the aggregates taken from the sieves varied but no noticeable correlation was found between aggregate size and the parameters we calculated in what follows we hence pool the results calculated from the aggregates taken from the same treatment 3 1 pore geometries table 1 and fig 3 a compare the porosity and pore size distribution of the aggregates taken from soils under different treatments respectively overall fertilizing with farmyard manure and the woodland increased the aggregate porosity especially the proportion of pores 10 μm which was increased at the expense of pores smaller than10μm the pores 17 5 μm were significantly higher in the woodland than in other treatments fig 3b reveals that the porosity was negatively correlated to the tortuosity with the tortuosity of the aggregates unfertilized or fertilized with inorganic fertilizers being close to each other but higher than that of the aggregates taken from the woodland and farmyard manure plots the aggregates in the woodland and the farmyard manure plots also had much bigger critical pore diameters 12 μm and 14 μm respectively than that taken from other plots approximately 8 μm table 2 and fig 4 a compare the porosity and pore size distribution for the cores taken from different treatments respectively similar to their impact on aggregates fertilization with farmyard manure and the woodland also simultaneously increased the porosity pores 40 μm of the cores farmyard manure fertilization and the woodland increased proportions of the pores 0 5 mm at the expense of the pores smaller than 0 5 mm in the cores compared to fertilization with inorganic fertilizers however contrary to the aggregates the cores taken from the unfertilized plot had higher porosity than those fertilized with inorganic fertilizer and they also had higher proportions of pores 0 8 mm than other treatments overall fertilization with inorganic fertilizers appeared to have affected the pores in the cores more significantly than the intra aggregate pores similar as in the aggregates fig 4b shows that the porosity and tortuosity in the cores were also negatively correlated fig 4c compares the critical pore diameter in both vertical and horizontal directions for all treatments with no exception the critical pore diameter in the horizontal direction is bigger than that in the vertical direction especially for the farmyard manure treatment 3 2 permeability of the aggregates the three permeability components calculated from each aggregate differed from each other with their difference depending on aggregates and treatments for all aggregates the difference between the highest and lowest permeability components varied between 5 and 25 as it was impossible to keep the orientation of the aggregates in what follows we take the average of the three components of each sample as its permeability table 1 compares the average permeability of the aggregates for the five treatments compared to the ck fertilization with inorganic fertilizers did not result in a significant change in permeability while fertilization with farmyard manure made the aggregates as permeable as returning the soil to natural woodland for more than one century on average increasing carbon input to the soil through farmyard manure application or perennial vegetation coverage as in the woodland improved aggregate permeability approximately fivefold from about 0 10 μm2 for treatments without exogenous carbon input to approximately 0 59 μm2 due to the increase in porosity and volumetric fraction of the intra aggregate pores 10 25 μm fig 3a as well as the reduced tortuosity fig 3b while the woodland treatment had more 17 5 μm pores than other treatments these pores were pore bodies linked by pore throats they are important in retaining water but have limited contribution to soil permeability as proven in the pore network models blunt et al 2013 applying n p k and mg fertilizers did not appear to have altered the aggregate permeability noticeably compared to no fertilization because of their comparable pore size distribution porosity tortuosity and critical pore diameter table 1 fig 3a 3c the permeability varied with aggregates taken from the same treatment and fig 3d compares the change in permeability with porosity for all aggregates the porosity permeability relationship for aggregates taken from plots unfertilized or fertilized with inorganic fertilizers follows approximately the same power law with r 2 0 8 fig 3d in contrast the permeability of the aggregates taken from farmyard manure and the woodland plots trends differently with their porosity fig 3d because of their difference in pore size distribution and tortuosity fig 3a b table 1 compares the coefficient of variation cv of the permeability defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean the woodland aggregates were most homogenous with the least cv overall the cv for the aggregates unfertilized or fertilized with inorganic fertilizer was higher than that for the aggregates taken from the farmyard manure and the woodland plots compared to no fertilization and fertilization with n k p and mg fertilization without p since 2001 appeared to have made the aggregates more heterogeneous with its cvs being 1 149 and larger than cv for all other treatments 3 3 permeability of the cores table 2 compares the average permeability components in both vertical and horizontal directions for all cores taken from the five treatments we did not keep the horizontal orientation of the cores and the horizontal permeability component in all tables and figures are the average of the two horizontal components calculated for each core the permeability components in both vertical and horizontal directions of the cores taken from the farmyard manure and woodland plots were two to three orders of magnitude higher than that of other cores the tortuosity of the aggregates unfertilized and fertilized with inorganic fertilizations was comparable fig 3b while the tortuosity of the cores under inorganic fertilizations was substantially higher than that in other treatments fig 4b due to the reduced porosity and the increased volumetric fraction of pores smaller than 0 4 mm fig 4a fertilization without p since 2001 reduced the permeability of the cores compared to those unfertilized or fertilized with n k p and mg table 2 and the permeability of the cores taken from the woodland plot was much higher than that of the cores fertilized with farmyard manure all cores were hydraulically anisotropic with their permeability in the horizontal direction higher than that in the vertical direction although the difference varied between treatments table 2 the cores in the woodland were most hydraulically homogeneous and isotropic with the horizontal to vertical ratio being 1 3 while fertilization with farmyard manure made the soil most hydraulically anisotropic with the horizontal to vertical ratio increased by almost fivefold table 2 reveals that no fertilization or fertilization with inorganic fertilizers made soil more hydraulically heterogenous at core scale with their cvs being much higher than that in other treatments fig 5 shows the porosity permeability relationship in both vertical and horizontal directions for the cores taken from all five treatments although they both followed approximately a power law their r 2 was smaller than that for the aggregates fig 3d as there were only three replicates for each treatment we did not separately fit the core results for each treatment as we did for the aggregates while the porosity and permeability of the cores taken from the cropped plots scattered around the power law curves the results of the woodland departed from the curves for both vertical and horizontal directions 4 discussion the results obtained from the rothamsted long term experiment revealed that different fertilizations operating for 175 years had reshaped the soil structure differently and that the structural change varied with scales in all but the fertilization without p since 2001 the permeability of the cores was one to three orders of magnitude higher than that of the aggregates the ability of the soils to infiltrate water at saturation following rainfalls was thus dominated by the pores 40 μm as found at this experimental site in 1882 beven and germann 1982 which was also corroborated by results obtained from x ray images of other soils katuwal et al 2015 paradelo et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 4 1 the cores the permeability of the cores varied significantly between the treatments due to their difference in porosity the number of hydraulically connected large macropores table 2 fig 4a and the tortuosity fig 4b as expected the permeability of the cores in the farmyard manure and the woodland plots was much higher than that in other plots because the exogenous carbon input enhanced soil aggregation and increased the proportion of pores 0 5 mm fig 4a this is consistent with work reported by others dal ferro et al 2013 yang et al 2018 for the woodland non tillage is another mechanism underlying the increased core porosity and permeability as non tillage kept the macropores generated by roots and soil fauna intact borges et al 2019 galdos et al 2019 especially the pores 1 2 mm fig 4a it was unexpected that non fertilization increased the porosity and volumetric fraction of pores 0 75 mm at the expense of the pores smaller than 0 7 mm thereby increasing soil permeability compared to fertilization with inorganic fertilizers it is unclear that this unexpected result was due to the limited replicated samples which were insufficient to be representative to the heterogeneous field soil or that this was indeed the structural change in the field increasing soil samples could resolve this uncertainty but there was a trade off between costs and accuracy as three replicates are the minimum requirement for the results to be statistically meaningful and have been widely adopted in experimental design dal ferro et al 2013 notwithstanding that as the critical diameter of the unfertilized cores was only 0 4 mm in the vertical direction and 0 8 mm in the horizontal direction most large pores were pore bodies linked by small pore throats and played only a limited role in conducting water therefore its permeability was still much smaller than that of the farmyard manure and woodland cores the permeability of the cores fertilized without p since 2001 was the lowest in both vertical and horizontal directions table 2 and fig 5 this was due to the combined impact of the reduced porosity table 2 and the increased tortuosity rather than the change in proportion of different pores as the pore size distributions of the cores fertilized with and without p were comparable fig 4a a decrease in hydraulically connected large pores could reduce soil permeability substantially as the permeability increases with pore diameter parabolically despite the cores fertilized with and without p having comparable tortuosity and pore size distribution fig 4a b the critical pore diameter of the former 0 057 mm was much smaller than that of the latter 0 34 mm fig 4c which along with their difference in porosity was the key reason behind the reduced permeability of soil without p application as the average permeability of a series of connected pores in a hydraulic conduit is the geometric mean of the permeability of these pores the contribution of large pore bodies linked by smaller pore throats to soil permeability is minor although they increase the ability of soil to hold water li et al 2018a cropping appeared to have made the cores hydraulically anisotropic with their horizontal permeability component much higher than their vertical component although the level of the anisotropy varied with treatments table 2 there is no consensus in the literature about how cropping systems impact soil anisotropy with some showing isotropy while others showing anisotropy however it is generally accepted that peat soils are more homogenous than arable soils gharedaghloo et al 2018 which is consistent with our result although the underlying mechanisms remain obscure the woodland on the experimental site has grown naturally since 1882 and it could be because of the accrual of rooting activities and other biotic and abiotic processes that had made the cores relatively isotropic and homogeneous table 2 the cropping field is ploughed annually after harvest with a mouldboard plow and the crop husbandry was the same in all treatments therefore the hydraulic anisotropy was likely to be caused by fertilization induced abiotic and biotic processes among which earthworm burrowing could be an important one field surveys since 1922 have consistently shown that the number of earthworms in the plots continuously receiving farmyard manure was significantly higher than those in other treatments for example a 2014 survey found that the total earthworm biomass in plots given farmyard manure was 109 g m2 compared to 6 g m2 in the plots never receiving farmyard manure sizmur et al 2017 in all treatments the endogeic earthworm was found to be the dominant species sizmur et al 2017 which is known to make horizontal burrows le couteulx et al 2015 proliferating in topsoil schlüter et al 2018 this was reflected in pore geometry as fig 4c shows that the more hydraulically anisotropic the cores are the more their critical pore diameters in the vertical and horizontal directions differ from each other as an illustration fig 6 shows the locations of all pores in a farmyard manure core where large pores are more abundant in the top topsoil than in the bottom subsoil the pores in the cores are not only hydrologically important for providing quick pathways for fluid to flow through they are also biologically critical for modulating nutrient cycling as well as root growth atkinson et al 2020 an increase in porosity and permeability of the cores could lead to a rise in yield due to the increase in nitrification and root penetration as our previous work based on the rothamsted long term experiments showed that more porous and permeable soils were positively related to abundance of nitrification related genes neal et al 2020b the average yield of the plots given farmyard manure inorganic fertilizer and the ck was 11 t ha 5 5 t ha and 1 2 t ha respectively the yield is hence positively related to the porosity and permeability of the cores table 2 except the ck due to the lack of nutrients input 4 2 the aggregates soil aggregates are formed largely through binding of soil particles by fungus and decomposed organic matter and its life expectancy is much longer than the macropores rabot et al 2018 the comparatively isotropic aggregates suggested that the genesis of the aggregate structure was impacted less directly by root than by microbially mediated processes powered by rhizodeposits and other organic matter adding carbon boosts microbial activities thereby enhancing soil aggregation and increasing porosity of fine textured soil helliwell et al 2014 but the increase varied with pore size for the farmyard manure aggregates it was the pores in 10 μm 20 μm that increased most while for the woodland aggregates the pores 12 5 μm were relatively more abundant fig 3a the experimental site was rich in fungus and the total bacterial community in the woodland was twofold that in the arable soil hargreaves et al 2003 these could be an important mechanism underlying the increased porosity fig 3a and permeability table 1 of the aggregates in the farmyard manure and the woodland plots crawford et al 2012 the tortuosity of the pores in the aggregates was lower than that of the cores subjected to the same treatment indicating that the pores in the former were less tortuous for water to flow than in the latter in general pore connectivity increases with porosity and our results revealed that the aggregates are more porously connected than the cores this is contrary to the results of dal ferro et al 2013 who found that their long term fertilizations since 1962 made pores in cores more connected than the intra aggregate pores in a field cropped with maize while it cannot be ruled out that different crops could have different impacts on multiscale soil structure the difference in duration between the experiments might also play a role also the low image resolution 6 25 μm used by dal ferro 2013 could be a reason as it was not high enough to capture the dominant pores to make the images representative to the real aggregates this manifests the importance of imaging resolution in interpreting how soil structure evolves after a management change there is a subtle difference in how permeability of the aggregates varied with their porosity between the treatments fig 3c the porosity permeability relationship for the aggregates unfertilized or fertilized with inorganic fertilizers followed approximately the same trend alluding that the pore geometries in these aggregates were statistically similar and that the impact of the crop on aggregate structure might have overridden the impact of the fertilizations in contrast the permeability of the aggregates in the farmyard manure and the woodland plots increased with their porosity in a different trend indicating that the pore geometries in their aggregates were statistically different from that in others and that the farmyard manure impacted the intra aggregate structure more than the crop did this is corroborated by the pore size distribution in fig 3a where the proportion of pores 10 μm in the farmyard manure and its associated critical pore diameter fig 3d are much higher than those in other fertilization treatments 4 3 impact of soil carbon soil structural change is affected by many abiotic and biotic factors including root growth and macro and meso fauna increasing carbon input usually leads to an increase in porosity and ability of the soil to hold and to transport water and it is thus interesting to see how permeability of the aggregates and cores responded to soil carbon change the total carbon in the top 23 cm of soil in the plots given farmyard manure has increased from 30 t ha in1843 to 75 t ha while in the woodland it has increased to 160 t ha in contrast the carbon in the plots fertilized only with mineral fertilizers remained almost unchanged while the carbon in the top 23 cm of soil not receiving any inputs reduced to 25 t ha fig 7 a shows that with soil carbon increasing the permeability of the aggregates increased asymptotically plateauing when the carbon exceeded 75 t ha while the permeability of the cores especially its vertical component increased exponentially fig 7b such increases in permeability with carbon at both scales were due to the increase in total porosity and the volumetric fraction of hydraulically connected large pores pores 12 μm for aggregates fig 3a and pores 0 8 mm for the cores fig 4a these combined to reduce the tortuosity and the resistance for water to flow because of the increase in critical pore diameter at both scales figs 3 4 fig 7 indicates that as soil carbon increased the impact of carbon on pores 40 μm in the cores was more significant than on the intra aggregate pores consistent with recent findings that soil enzymatic activities which modulate soil carbon distribution are not randomly distributed but closely associated with pores in a specific range kravchenko et al 2019 given the increasing interest in sequestering carbon into soil understanding how soil at different scales hydraulically responds to carbon input is important but appears to have been overlooked poulton et al 2018 5 conclusions multiscale x ray imaging combined with lattice boltzmann simulation reveals that different fertilizations operating continuously for more than one century have reshaped the soil structure differently and the soil structural change and its relationship with soil carbon vary with scales increasing carbon input to soil via farmyard manure application has increased porosity and permeability at both aggregate and core scales and the hydraulic properties of their aggregates are very close to that of the aggregates in the woodland that has been returned to nature since 1882 in all treatments the aggregates are approximately hydraulically isotropic while the cores are anisotropic with their permeability component in the horizontal direction being higher than that in the vertical direction although the level of the anisotropy varies between treatments the porosity permeability relationships are similar for aggregates in soils unfertilized or fertilized with inorganic fertilizers indicating that the crop might overweight the fertilization in their impact on aggregate structure in contrast the permeability of the aggregates in the farmyard manure and the woodland plots trends differently with their porosity an increase in carbon input to soil via farmyard application or perennial vegetation has made the soil more porous and permeable but the change in hydraulic properties with soil carbon varies with scale as soil carbon increases the permeability of the cores especially its vertical component increases exponentially while the permeability of the aggregates increases asymptotically peaking when the carbon reaches a critical value we also found a positive correlation between soil permeability and crop yield credit authorship contribution

4967,soil structure is an indicator of soil quality and its alterations following cropping system conversion or fertilization change evolve slowly how such alterations vary with scale remains elusive we investigated this based on the rothamsted long term wheat experiment since 1843 in the uk triplicate cores 7 cm high and 10 cm in diameter were taken from plots that have been under different fertilizations or returned to natural woodland for more than one century for imaging using x ray computed tomography with the voxel size being 40 µm we then broke each core and sampled three aggregates from it to scan with the voxel size being 1 5 µm for each core and aggregate sample we calculated its pore size distribution permeability and tortuosity the results showed that the fertilization change 170 years ago reshaped the soil structure differently between the core scale and the aggregate scale macro porosity of the pores 40 µm in the cores unfertilized or fertilized with inorganic fertilizers was low and the pores were poorly connected in the top 10 cm of soil compared to those given farmyard manure or in the woodland in all treatments the pores in the core images were hydraulically anisotropic with their permeability in the horizontal direction being higher than that in the vertical direction whereas the aggregates were comparatively isotropic the fertilization affected image porosity and permeability at core scale more significantly than at aggregate scale and the aggregates fertilized with farmyard manure and in the woodland were more permeable than the aggregates in other treatments it was also found that compared to no fertilization or fertilization with complete fertilizers fertilizing without phosphorus over the past 20 years increased the porosity and permeability of the aggregates but not of the cores fertilization with inorganic fertilizers increased the tortuosity of the macropores in the cores but not of the intra aggregate pores compared to no fertilization porosity permeability relationship for aggregates unfertilized or fertilized with inorganic fertilisers followed a power law with r 2 0 8 in contrast the permeability of the aggregates in farmyard manure and in the woodland trended differently as their porosity increased the results also revealed that the transport ability of the aggregates and cores responded differently to carbon in that with soil carbon increasing the permeability of the aggregates increased asymptotically while the permeability of the cores especially its horizontal component increased exponentially keywords rothamsted long term experiment hierarchical soil structural change pore scale simulations x ray computed tomography 1 introduction most soils in natural and managed terrestrial ecosystems are hierarchically structured with their pores ranging from less than one micron to several millimetres in diameter young and crawford 2004 such structures are a result of the interplay of a multitude of abiotic and biotic processes operating over a wide range of scales and are the foundation of all life in terrestrial ecosystems as they keep the soil moist and oxygenated young et al 2008b macropores in soil are formed mainly by actions of plant roots earthworms aggregations as well as swelling and shrinkage bronick and lal 2005 providing preferential pathways for water and nutrients to flow beven and germann 2013 in contrast micropores formed biotically and abiotically function as storage to retain water and nutrients feeney et al 2006 kallenbach et al 2016 totsche et al 2018 microorganisms play a critical role in soil genesis and their feedback reactions with soil structure are mediated by organic matter in complex ways young et al 2008a however it is generally accepted that boosting microbial activities increases soil porosity due to the enhanced soil aggregation for example crawford et al 2012 found that incubating a repacked fine textured soil for three weeks resulted in a 17 increase in porosity the importance of soil structure in physical and biogeochemical processes is fairly understood in addition to its well documented role in controlling water flow and solute transport soil structure also plays a critical role in other soil functions kravchenko and guber 2017 as recent findings revealed that enzymatic activities were strongly associated with a specific range of pores implying that carbon and nutrient cycling in soil is also pore dependant kravchenko et al 2019 soil reorganizes its structure following agronomic practice changes caplan et al 2017 tillage and root growth could instantly reshape soil structure while the change induced by microbial activities could be a slow process crawford et al 2012 kallenbach et al 2016 for example bacq labreuil et al 2020 recently found that following conversion from a fallowed land to arable and grassland the change in intra aggregate structure did not reach equilibrium 10 years after the conversion the rothamsted long term wheat experiment also revealed that soil carbon took approximately one century to stabilize after changing fertilization to farmyard manure poulton et al 2018 as the dynamics of soil carbon is determined by its accessibility to microbes dungait et al 2012 which in turn is modulated by soil structure it is rational to conjecture that the change in soil structure following the fertilization change could not reach equilibrium before soil carbon stabilized this is also corroborated by recent findings that soil physical properties affected soil carbon and nitrogen more than soil enzymes and microbial communities li et al 2020 understanding the multiscale soil structural alteration instigated by agricultural practice change is hence important as pores at different scales play different roles in hydrological and biogeochemical functions wang et al 2019 yudina and kuzyakov 2019 most macroscopic phenomena measured in soil emerge from biogeochemical and physical processes occurring at the microscopic scale baveye et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 and it has been increasingly recognized that it is impossible to reliably predict physical and biochemical processes by studying the bulk soils alone wilpiszeski et al 2019 as such there has been a surge in study of soil structure and its impact on water and solute transport over the past two decades largely due to the development in x ray computed tomography ct and its application in soil science helliwell et al 2013 huang et al 2015 schlüter et al 2014 one application of x ray ct is to quantify soil structural change induced by agronomic management lucas et al 2019 piccoli et al 2019 soto gomez et al 2020 as well as its consequence for hydrological process armenise et al 2018 baveye et al 2018 gharedaghloo et al 2018 luo et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 modelling water flow and solute transport in hierarchically structured soils often separates their macropores and micropores into two hydraulically linked domains with flow and transport in each domain represented by a set of equations and the mass exchange between the two domains described by empirical formulae gerke and van genuchten 1993 larsson and jarvis 1999 simunek et al 2003 vogel et al 2000 separating the pores into two domains improves the model but it also increases the numbers of parameters which have to be determined empirically by calibration against observed data frey et al 2016 haas et al 2020 lamy et al 2009 the x ray ct has potential to plug this gap but needs to scan the soil at multiscale so as to characterize the inter aggregate pore geometry at a macro scale and the intra aggregates pore geometry at a micro scale li et al 2018b zhang et al 2016 linking soil hydraulic conductivity to pore geometry obtained from x ray images is available but most them integrated the macropores and micropores koestel et al 2018 pohlitz et al 2019 schlüter et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 there are also studies on geometrical change in both intra aggregate pores and macropores borges et al 2019 galdos et al 2019 koestel and schluter 2019 pires et al 2019 schlüter et al 2018 as well as their temporal evolution under different managements lucas et al 2019 schlüter et al 2011 while a change in agronomical practices could lead to an instant change in pore geometries it might take decades or even century for the pore geometries to reach a new statistically equilibrium state on average across the field following fertilization change or land conversion lohse and dietrich 2005 lucas et al 2019 neal et al 2020a therefore for experiments using repacked soils that did not last long enough crawford et al 2012 kallenbach et al 2016 menon et al 2020 rabbi et al 2018 the observed soil structural change might be a just temporary transition rather than what the soil would ultimately evolve to the hierarchical soil structure is formed by a multitude of biotic and abiotic processes operating at different scales and how this multiscale structure responds to management practice change is poorly understood apart from this another issue that has been overlooked is hydraulic anisotropy soil anisotropy is important not only in hillslope hydrology for lateral water flow but also in plant uptake of water as vertically dominant roots drive water to flow mainly in the horizontal direction towards the roots zhang et al 2020 this paper aims to investigate the impact of long term fertilizations on soil structural change and the associated hydraulic properties at different scales based on the rothamsted long term experiment in the uk that has been in operation since 1843 soil samples taken from plots under different fertilizations for more than a century were scanned using x ray ct at multiple scales and the impact of the long term fertilizations on soil structure was analysed based on the physical parameters calculated from these multiscale images 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the rothamsted long term experiment at broadbalk latitude 51 48 34 44 n longitude 0 21 22 76 w started in 1843 to test the effects of various combinations of inorganic fertilizers n p k and mg and organic manure on the yield of winter wheat with a unfertilized strip as the control the mean annual temperature and rainfall on the site is 10 1 c and 701 mm respectively http www era rothamsted ac uk the soil on the site is predominantly clay loam classified as chromic luvisol fao classification the plough layer 0 23 cm contains 25 of sand 25 of silt and 50 of clay with an average particle density of 2 56 g cm3 gregory et al 2010 the ph is maintained at 7 7 5 by liming since its inception the experiment was made a few changes aimed to make it representative to the changes in farming in the uk detailed description of the experiment is available online http www era rothamsted ac uk and in the literature blair et al 2006 watts et al 2006 we provide in the supplementary information the fertilization history and layout of the experimental site in short the site consists of 19 strips each associated with a specific fertilization ranging from farmyard manure to different combinations of nitrogen phosphorus potassium and magnesium minerals initially all 19 strips were for continuous wheat and they all were made into 10 sections later aimed to compare the impact of other agronomic managements under the same fertilization including a straw incorporation since1986 in 1882 a part on the west edge of the site was withdrawn from cultivation leading to development of a small area of woodland colonised by various grass species and trees mostly ash fraxinus excelsior sycamore acer pseudoplatanus and hawthorn craetagus monogyna poulton et al 2003 2 2 acquisition of soil images triplicate cores 7 cm high and 10 cm in diameter were taken in october 2015 from each of the following four plots marked in the supplementary information that have been under different fertilizations since 1843 an unfertilized plot referred to as ck a plot given farmyard manure referred to as fym and two other plots that have been fertilized with different combinations of inorganic minerals there were some changes in fertilization after its inception and the details are given in the supplementary information in what follows we will refer the plot that is currently receiving 144 kg of n 90 kg of k and 35 kg of p and 12 kg of mg as n3 and the plot that has not received p since 2001 as no p as a comparison triplicate cores were also taken from the woodland each sample was taken by gently hammering a pvc core into the topsoil with the core top 1 2 cm below the soil surface we then dug the core out after removing the soil surrounding the core using a trowel loose soil and extra soil at the two ends of the core were peeled off using a sharp knife before tightly wrapping it with plastic films prior to x ray imaging all cores were scanned using x ray ct and details of the procedure were given in previous work bacq labreuil et al 2018 in short we used the phoenix v tome x m scanner ge measurement and control solution wunstorf germany at the hounsfield facility of university of nottingham to scan the cores under 160 kv and 180μa at a pixel resolution of 40 μm after the scanning each core was manually broken to pass through a series of sieves of 4 2 and 0 71 mm by horizontally shaking at 300 rotations min for 3 min and three aggregates retained in the sieves of 2 mm and 0 71 mm were randomly selected and scanned using a phoenix nanotom ge measurement and control solution wunstorf germany under 90 kv and 65μa at a pixel resolution of 1 51 μm the sizes of all aggregates were thus approximately 0 8 mm to 4 mm the scanned images were reconstructed using the software provided by the manufacturer with an optimisation to correct any possible sample movement during the scanning process to avoid internal collapse of the cores all cores were scanned at prevailing water content approximately the field capacity while the aggregates were scanned after an overnight of air drying we first analysed the images using image j with a region of interest roi cropped out from each image for ease of analysis the rois of the core images 1000x1000x1000 were positioned centrally to exclude the gaps between the soil and the pvc wall while for the irregular aggregates we cropped a cuboid roi 640x480x400 out of each image the cropped rois were greyscale and they were segmented using the bin bi level threshold method presented in vogel and kretzschmar 1996 details of the segmentation method were given previously bacq labreuil et al 2018 in short 20 slices were randomly selected from each stack and each slice had a single threshold value that was calculated from the li threshold algorithm in image j the values of the two thresholds used in the bin bi level method for segmenting the stack were calculated from the extreme values obtained from the 20 slices prior to pore geometry analysis and pore scale simulation all hydraulically isolated void voxels were removed and replaced by solid voxels 2 3 permeability the permeability of all cores and aggregates was calculated from pore scale simulation of water flow in their pore space using the lattice boltzmann lb model we developed previously zhang et al 2010 most early lb models used for pore scale simulation were based on the single relaxation time srt approach qian et al 1992 but it was later found that the commonly used bounce back method associated with the srt model was erroneous for solving the fluid wall boundary pan et al 2006 the multiple relaxation time mrt lb method can resolve this problem d humières et al 2002 and was used in this paper details of the method and its implementation are given in the supplementary information water flow in each sample was driven by a pressure gradient in a direction generated by imposing a high pressure on one side and a low pressure on the opposite side of the sample other four sides were treated as periodic boundaries we selected three pressure gradients to ensure that water flow was laminar and that the average flow rate was proportional to the pressure gradient in all simulations the initial velocity was zero and the flow was simulated to steady state deemed to have reached when the relative difference in the average flow rate at two moments spanning 100 time steps was less than 10 7 we then sampled the velocity and pressure at all voxels and volumetrically averaged them over each cross section perpendicular to the pressure gradient direction to calculate the permeability we sampled the pressure aimed to check pore homogeneity as our previous work showed that the average pressure distribution could become nonlinear in highly heterogeneous soils li et al 2018a to test hydraulic anisotropy we calculated the permeability in the three directions of each sample for simulation under each pressure gradient the volumetric average water flow was assumed to follow the darcy s law taking the pressure gradient generated in the z direction as an example that means 1 q z z k ρ u p z where qz z is the average flow rate over the cross section perpendicular to the z direction cm s k is permeability cm2 u is kinematic viscosity of water cm s p is the averaged pressure over the cross section kpa and ρ is water density g cm3 the average water flow rate and pressure were calculated from pore scale simulation as follows 2 q z z i 1 n zw u z x i y i z n z p z i 1 n zw p x i y i z n zw where nz and nzw are the number of all voxels and the number of water filled voxels in the cross section located at z respectively p x i y i z and u z x i y i z are water pressure and water velocity component in the z direction at voxel centred on x i y i z respectively at steady state q z z is independent of z because of the mass balance constraint and the permeability of the sample was hence calculated from 3 k ρ u q z l p 1 p 0 where l cm is the length of the sample in the z direction once the permeability k was calculated its associated hydraulic conductivity k can be calculated from k kg μ with g being the gravitational acceleration cm s2 since water density and viscosity depend on temperature and chemical composition of the water the hydraulic conductivity is not constant but varies with soil environment in what follows we hence use permeability rather than convert it to hydraulic conductivity 2 4 pore size distribution and tortuosity we calculated the pore size distribution for both aggregates and cores using the plug in ct image analysis manipulation scamp houston et al 2017 and bone j in image j respectively finding that the difference between the two was less than 5 in what follows we only present the results obtained from bone j we expressed the pore size distribution as volumetric fraction of pores of different sizes tortuosity is a parameter widely used to characterize porous materials but it could be calculated based on a specific transport process ghanbarian et al 2013 or geometrical connection of the pores roque and costa 2020 different methods could give different results since the focus of this paper is viscous fluid flow following koponen et al 1996 we calculated it as the ratio of the sum of the absolute bulk fluid velocity in all voxels to the sum of the velocity component in the pressure gradient direction as soil permeability depends predominantly on hydraulically connected larger pores for each sample we also calculated its critical pore diameter similar to that used in our previous work neal et al 2020b in brief each pore mapped out by the bone j comprised a group of void voxels starting from the pores with the largest diameter we calculated if the void voxels in these pores could form a cluster s stretching from the inlet to the outlet faces if they could not we reduced the pore diameter sequentially until we found a diameter that the void voxels in pores with diameter equal to or larger than it formed a cluster s linking the inlet and the outlet faces 3 results fig 1 shows the greyscale images of the cores taken from the five treatments to visually illustrate their difference fig 2 compares the greyscale images of the aggregates and their associated segmentation to show the impact of the treatments as well as the accuracy of the segmentation method the sizes of the aggregates taken from the sieves varied but no noticeable correlation was found between aggregate size and the parameters we calculated in what follows we hence pool the results calculated from the aggregates taken from the same treatment 3 1 pore geometries table 1 and fig 3 a compare the porosity and pore size distribution of the aggregates taken from soils under different treatments respectively overall fertilizing with farmyard manure and the woodland increased the aggregate porosity especially the proportion of pores 10 μm which was increased at the expense of pores smaller than10μm the pores 17 5 μm were significantly higher in the woodland than in other treatments fig 3b reveals that the porosity was negatively correlated to the tortuosity with the tortuosity of the aggregates unfertilized or fertilized with inorganic fertilizers being close to each other but higher than that of the aggregates taken from the woodland and farmyard manure plots the aggregates in the woodland and the farmyard manure plots also had much bigger critical pore diameters 12 μm and 14 μm respectively than that taken from other plots approximately 8 μm table 2 and fig 4 a compare the porosity and pore size distribution for the cores taken from different treatments respectively similar to their impact on aggregates fertilization with farmyard manure and the woodland also simultaneously increased the porosity pores 40 μm of the cores farmyard manure fertilization and the woodland increased proportions of the pores 0 5 mm at the expense of the pores smaller than 0 5 mm in the cores compared to fertilization with inorganic fertilizers however contrary to the aggregates the cores taken from the unfertilized plot had higher porosity than those fertilized with inorganic fertilizer and they also had higher proportions of pores 0 8 mm than other treatments overall fertilization with inorganic fertilizers appeared to have affected the pores in the cores more significantly than the intra aggregate pores similar as in the aggregates fig 4b shows that the porosity and tortuosity in the cores were also negatively correlated fig 4c compares the critical pore diameter in both vertical and horizontal directions for all treatments with no exception the critical pore diameter in the horizontal direction is bigger than that in the vertical direction especially for the farmyard manure treatment 3 2 permeability of the aggregates the three permeability components calculated from each aggregate differed from each other with their difference depending on aggregates and treatments for all aggregates the difference between the highest and lowest permeability components varied between 5 and 25 as it was impossible to keep the orientation of the aggregates in what follows we take the average of the three components of each sample as its permeability table 1 compares the average permeability of the aggregates for the five treatments compared to the ck fertilization with inorganic fertilizers did not result in a significant change in permeability while fertilization with farmyard manure made the aggregates as permeable as returning the soil to natural woodland for more than one century on average increasing carbon input to the soil through farmyard manure application or perennial vegetation coverage as in the woodland improved aggregate permeability approximately fivefold from about 0 10 μm2 for treatments without exogenous carbon input to approximately 0 59 μm2 due to the increase in porosity and volumetric fraction of the intra aggregate pores 10 25 μm fig 3a as well as the reduced tortuosity fig 3b while the woodland treatment had more 17 5 μm pores than other treatments these pores were pore bodies linked by pore throats they are important in retaining water but have limited contribution to soil permeability as proven in the pore network models blunt et al 2013 applying n p k and mg fertilizers did not appear to have altered the aggregate permeability noticeably compared to no fertilization because of their comparable pore size distribution porosity tortuosity and critical pore diameter table 1 fig 3a 3c the permeability varied with aggregates taken from the same treatment and fig 3d compares the change in permeability with porosity for all aggregates the porosity permeability relationship for aggregates taken from plots unfertilized or fertilized with inorganic fertilizers follows approximately the same power law with r 2 0 8 fig 3d in contrast the permeability of the aggregates taken from farmyard manure and the woodland plots trends differently with their porosity fig 3d because of their difference in pore size distribution and tortuosity fig 3a b table 1 compares the coefficient of variation cv of the permeability defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean the woodland aggregates were most homogenous with the least cv overall the cv for the aggregates unfertilized or fertilized with inorganic fertilizer was higher than that for the aggregates taken from the farmyard manure and the woodland plots compared to no fertilization and fertilization with n k p and mg fertilization without p since 2001 appeared to have made the aggregates more heterogeneous with its cvs being 1 149 and larger than cv for all other treatments 3 3 permeability of the cores table 2 compares the average permeability components in both vertical and horizontal directions for all cores taken from the five treatments we did not keep the horizontal orientation of the cores and the horizontal permeability component in all tables and figures are the average of the two horizontal components calculated for each core the permeability components in both vertical and horizontal directions of the cores taken from the farmyard manure and woodland plots were two to three orders of magnitude higher than that of other cores the tortuosity of the aggregates unfertilized and fertilized with inorganic fertilizations was comparable fig 3b while the tortuosity of the cores under inorganic fertilizations was substantially higher than that in other treatments fig 4b due to the reduced porosity and the increased volumetric fraction of pores smaller than 0 4 mm fig 4a fertilization without p since 2001 reduced the permeability of the cores compared to those unfertilized or fertilized with n k p and mg table 2 and the permeability of the cores taken from the woodland plot was much higher than that of the cores fertilized with farmyard manure all cores were hydraulically anisotropic with their permeability in the horizontal direction higher than that in the vertical direction although the difference varied between treatments table 2 the cores in the woodland were most hydraulically homogeneous and isotropic with the horizontal to vertical ratio being 1 3 while fertilization with farmyard manure made the soil most hydraulically anisotropic with the horizontal to vertical ratio increased by almost fivefold table 2 reveals that no fertilization or fertilization with inorganic fertilizers made soil more hydraulically heterogenous at core scale with their cvs being much higher than that in other treatments fig 5 shows the porosity permeability relationship in both vertical and horizontal directions for the cores taken from all five treatments although they both followed approximately a power law their r 2 was smaller than that for the aggregates fig 3d as there were only three replicates for each treatment we did not separately fit the core results for each treatment as we did for the aggregates while the porosity and permeability of the cores taken from the cropped plots scattered around the power law curves the results of the woodland departed from the curves for both vertical and horizontal directions 4 discussion the results obtained from the rothamsted long term experiment revealed that different fertilizations operating for 175 years had reshaped the soil structure differently and that the structural change varied with scales in all but the fertilization without p since 2001 the permeability of the cores was one to three orders of magnitude higher than that of the aggregates the ability of the soils to infiltrate water at saturation following rainfalls was thus dominated by the pores 40 μm as found at this experimental site in 1882 beven and germann 1982 which was also corroborated by results obtained from x ray images of other soils katuwal et al 2015 paradelo et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 4 1 the cores the permeability of the cores varied significantly between the treatments due to their difference in porosity the number of hydraulically connected large macropores table 2 fig 4a and the tortuosity fig 4b as expected the permeability of the cores in the farmyard manure and the woodland plots was much higher than that in other plots because the exogenous carbon input enhanced soil aggregation and increased the proportion of pores 0 5 mm fig 4a this is consistent with work reported by others dal ferro et al 2013 yang et al 2018 for the woodland non tillage is another mechanism underlying the increased core porosity and permeability as non tillage kept the macropores generated by roots and soil fauna intact borges et al 2019 galdos et al 2019 especially the pores 1 2 mm fig 4a it was unexpected that non fertilization increased the porosity and volumetric fraction of pores 0 75 mm at the expense of the pores smaller than 0 7 mm thereby increasing soil permeability compared to fertilization with inorganic fertilizers it is unclear that this unexpected result was due to the limited replicated samples which were insufficient to be representative to the heterogeneous field soil or that this was indeed the structural change in the field increasing soil samples could resolve this uncertainty but there was a trade off between costs and accuracy as three replicates are the minimum requirement for the results to be statistically meaningful and have been widely adopted in experimental design dal ferro et al 2013 notwithstanding that as the critical diameter of the unfertilized cores was only 0 4 mm in the vertical direction and 0 8 mm in the horizontal direction most large pores were pore bodies linked by small pore throats and played only a limited role in conducting water therefore its permeability was still much smaller than that of the farmyard manure and woodland cores the permeability of the cores fertilized without p since 2001 was the lowest in both vertical and horizontal directions table 2 and fig 5 this was due to the combined impact of the reduced porosity table 2 and the increased tortuosity rather than the change in proportion of different pores as the pore size distributions of the cores fertilized with and without p were comparable fig 4a a decrease in hydraulically connected large pores could reduce soil permeability substantially as the permeability increases with pore diameter parabolically despite the cores fertilized with and without p having comparable tortuosity and pore size distribution fig 4a b the critical pore diameter of the former 0 057 mm was much smaller than that of the latter 0 34 mm fig 4c which along with their difference in porosity was the key reason behind the reduced permeability of soil without p application as the average permeability of a series of connected pores in a hydraulic conduit is the geometric mean of the permeability of these pores the contribution of large pore bodies linked by smaller pore throats to soil permeability is minor although they increase the ability of soil to hold water li et al 2018a cropping appeared to have made the cores hydraulically anisotropic with their horizontal permeability component much higher than their vertical component although the level of the anisotropy varied with treatments table 2 there is no consensus in the literature about how cropping systems impact soil anisotropy with some showing isotropy while others showing anisotropy however it is generally accepted that peat soils are more homogenous than arable soils gharedaghloo et al 2018 which is consistent with our result although the underlying mechanisms remain obscure the woodland on the experimental site has grown naturally since 1882 and it could be because of the accrual of rooting activities and other biotic and abiotic processes that had made the cores relatively isotropic and homogeneous table 2 the cropping field is ploughed annually after harvest with a mouldboard plow and the crop husbandry was the same in all treatments therefore the hydraulic anisotropy was likely to be caused by fertilization induced abiotic and biotic processes among which earthworm burrowing could be an important one field surveys since 1922 have consistently shown that the number of earthworms in the plots continuously receiving farmyard manure was significantly higher than those in other treatments for example a 2014 survey found that the total earthworm biomass in plots given farmyard manure was 109 g m2 compared to 6 g m2 in the plots never receiving farmyard manure sizmur et al 2017 in all treatments the endogeic earthworm was found to be the dominant species sizmur et al 2017 which is known to make horizontal burrows le couteulx et al 2015 proliferating in topsoil schlüter et al 2018 this was reflected in pore geometry as fig 4c shows that the more hydraulically anisotropic the cores are the more their critical pore diameters in the vertical and horizontal directions differ from each other as an illustration fig 6 shows the locations of all pores in a farmyard manure core where large pores are more abundant in the top topsoil than in the bottom subsoil the pores in the cores are not only hydrologically important for providing quick pathways for fluid to flow through they are also biologically critical for modulating nutrient cycling as well as root growth atkinson et al 2020 an increase in porosity and permeability of the cores could lead to a rise in yield due to the increase in nitrification and root penetration as our previous work based on the rothamsted long term experiments showed that more porous and permeable soils were positively related to abundance of nitrification related genes neal et al 2020b the average yield of the plots given farmyard manure inorganic fertilizer and the ck was 11 t ha 5 5 t ha and 1 2 t ha respectively the yield is hence positively related to the porosity and permeability of the cores table 2 except the ck due to the lack of nutrients input 4 2 the aggregates soil aggregates are formed largely through binding of soil particles by fungus and decomposed organic matter and its life expectancy is much longer than the macropores rabot et al 2018 the comparatively isotropic aggregates suggested that the genesis of the aggregate structure was impacted less directly by root than by microbially mediated processes powered by rhizodeposits and other organic matter adding carbon boosts microbial activities thereby enhancing soil aggregation and increasing porosity of fine textured soil helliwell et al 2014 but the increase varied with pore size for the farmyard manure aggregates it was the pores in 10 μm 20 μm that increased most while for the woodland aggregates the pores 12 5 μm were relatively more abundant fig 3a the experimental site was rich in fungus and the total bacterial community in the woodland was twofold that in the arable soil hargreaves et al 2003 these could be an important mechanism underlying the increased porosity fig 3a and permeability table 1 of the aggregates in the farmyard manure and the woodland plots crawford et al 2012 the tortuosity of the pores in the aggregates was lower than that of the cores subjected to the same treatment indicating that the pores in the former were less tortuous for water to flow than in the latter in general pore connectivity increases with porosity and our results revealed that the aggregates are more porously connected than the cores this is contrary to the results of dal ferro et al 2013 who found that their long term fertilizations since 1962 made pores in cores more connected than the intra aggregate pores in a field cropped with maize while it cannot be ruled out that different crops could have different impacts on multiscale soil structure the difference in duration between the experiments might also play a role also the low image resolution 6 25 μm used by dal ferro 2013 could be a reason as it was not high enough to capture the dominant pores to make the images representative to the real aggregates this manifests the importance of imaging resolution in interpreting how soil structure evolves after a management change there is a subtle difference in how permeability of the aggregates varied with their porosity between the treatments fig 3c the porosity permeability relationship for the aggregates unfertilized or fertilized with inorganic fertilizers followed approximately the same trend alluding that the pore geometries in these aggregates were statistically similar and that the impact of the crop on aggregate structure might have overridden the impact of the fertilizations in contrast the permeability of the aggregates in the farmyard manure and the woodland plots increased with their porosity in a different trend indicating that the pore geometries in their aggregates were statistically different from that in others and that the farmyard manure impacted the intra aggregate structure more than the crop did this is corroborated by the pore size distribution in fig 3a where the proportion of pores 10 μm in the farmyard manure and its associated critical pore diameter fig 3d are much higher than those in other fertilization treatments 4 3 impact of soil carbon soil structural change is affected by many abiotic and biotic factors including root growth and macro and meso fauna increasing carbon input usually leads to an increase in porosity and ability of the soil to hold and to transport water and it is thus interesting to see how permeability of the aggregates and cores responded to soil carbon change the total carbon in the top 23 cm of soil in the plots given farmyard manure has increased from 30 t ha in1843 to 75 t ha while in the woodland it has increased to 160 t ha in contrast the carbon in the plots fertilized only with mineral fertilizers remained almost unchanged while the carbon in the top 23 cm of soil not receiving any inputs reduced to 25 t ha fig 7 a shows that with soil carbon increasing the permeability of the aggregates increased asymptotically plateauing when the carbon exceeded 75 t ha while the permeability of the cores especially its vertical component increased exponentially fig 7b such increases in permeability with carbon at both scales were due to the increase in total porosity and the volumetric fraction of hydraulically connected large pores pores 12 μm for aggregates fig 3a and pores 0 8 mm for the cores fig 4a these combined to reduce the tortuosity and the resistance for water to flow because of the increase in critical pore diameter at both scales figs 3 4 fig 7 indicates that as soil carbon increased the impact of carbon on pores 40 μm in the cores was more significant than on the intra aggregate pores consistent with recent findings that soil enzymatic activities which modulate soil carbon distribution are not randomly distributed but closely associated with pores in a specific range kravchenko et al 2019 given the increasing interest in sequestering carbon into soil understanding how soil at different scales hydraulically responds to carbon input is important but appears to have been overlooked poulton et al 2018 5 conclusions multiscale x ray imaging combined with lattice boltzmann simulation reveals that different fertilizations operating continuously for more than one century have reshaped the soil structure differently and the soil structural change and its relationship with soil carbon vary with scales increasing carbon input to soil via farmyard manure application has increased porosity and permeability at both aggregate and core scales and the hydraulic properties of their aggregates are very close to that of the aggregates in the woodland that has been returned to nature since 1882 in all treatments the aggregates are approximately hydraulically isotropic while the cores are anisotropic with their permeability component in the horizontal direction being higher than that in the vertical direction although the level of the anisotropy varies between treatments the porosity permeability relationships are similar for aggregates in soils unfertilized or fertilized with inorganic fertilizers indicating that the crop might overweight the fertilization in their impact on aggregate structure in contrast the permeability of the aggregates in the farmyard manure and the woodland plots trends differently with their porosity an increase in carbon input to soil via farmyard application or perennial vegetation has made the soil more porous and permeable but the change in hydraulic properties with soil carbon varies with scale as soil carbon increases the permeability of the cores especially its vertical component increases exponentially while the permeability of the aggregates increases asymptotically peaking when the carbon reaches a critical value we also found a positive correlation between soil permeability and crop yield credit authorship contribution

4968,in recent decades population growth agricultural development and climate change have caused environmental problems in the world especially in the arid and semi arid regions such as iran urmia lake one of the unique biosphere reserves of the world has suffered from these problems in the last 20 years although many studies conducted to the negative impacts of human induced activities especially agricultural expansion on the lake few studies focused on providing restoration plans for that this study uses a system dynamics method for modelling the restorations scenarios of urmia lake based on the prey predator approach this method is helpful to simplify the complicated feedbacks and interactions among human environment the monte carlo simulation is used to explore the effect of uncertain parameters on the lake level based on the results of this study the agricultural water consumption as predator has the most significant effect on reducing the lake volume prey the results indicated that decreasing the area of irrigated lands by 40 improving irrigation efficiency reducing the lake area itself and inter basin water transfer will lead to increase in the lake water level by 2 54 m 2 04 m 1 19 m and 1 19 m respectively by applying all the suggested scenarios the lake water level will reach to its ecological level 1274 msl in 2023 the recent positive restoration signals of the lake have coincidence with the findings of current research and bring more hope to the future of the lake keywords urmia lake restoration scenarios prey predator system dynamics water food nexus human environment interactions 1 introduction the rapid development of agricultural lands without using innovative tools has caused environmental problems worldwide some studies have investigated the impacts of human induced activities and misguided land water resources management on the natural pattern of water dynamics over large scales carpenter et al 2011 halpern et al 2008 meybeck 2003 newbold et al 2016 nilsson et al 2005 vitousek et al 1997 vörösmarty et al 2010 the exploitation of surface and groundwater resources using the construction of dams and increasing the number of wells is one of the common ways for developing irrigated lands and then food security these activities have led to a threefold increase in water exploitation from rivers in the last half century gebremicael et al 2013 narsimlu et al 2013 yan et al 2018 developing sustainable water resources management systems under different climatic conditions is one of the most critical environmental challenges especially in the arid and semi arid regions such as iran urmia lake the largest hypersaline lake in the western asia has lost most of its water surface area due to human induced activates and partially climate change over the past two decades abbaspour et al 2012 hassanzadeh et al 2012 unep geas 2012 madani 2014 tourian et al 2015 fathian et al 2016 fazel et al 2017 although some researches emphasized on the negative impacts of climate change on the lake water level most of the recent studies indicated that the role of anthropogenic factors in the dryness of the lake is more significant than climatic factors hassanzadeh et al 2012 jalili et al 2016 shadkam et al 2016 alizadeh govarchin ghale et al 2018 haghighi et al 2018 indicated that releasing water from dams into the lake is one of the most effective ways to revitalize the lake based on their results the agricultural sector accounts for about 80 of water consumption in the basin and dams play an essential role in irrigation chaudhari et al 2018 used a hydrological model higw mat and landsat satellite data to investigate the impacts of anthropogenic and climatic factors in the shrinkage of the lake from 1987 to 2016 they found 98 and 180 increases in agricultural lands and urban areas respectively with a corresponding shrinkage in the lake area by 86 the annual environmental demand of the lake was calculated by alborzi et al 2018 according to the results of their study the yearly required environmental inflows range from 2900 million cubic meters per year mcm yr during dry conditions to 5400 mcm yr during wet periods the results of saemian et al 2020 indicated a definite increase in the lake water level by 14 5 cm yr from 2016 to 2019 this issue showed the stability of the lake in the short term as a result of increased inflow from rivers and rainfall however in long term studies it cannot be claimed that the lake has stabilized recently schulz et al 2020 investigated the impacts of climate change and agricultural development on the lake according to their results climate change and agricultural development in the basin have had negative impacts on the water level fluctuations of urmia lake in the current climatic conditions changes in the agricultural water consumption may lead to significant changes in the lake volume and it may stabilize the lake or lead to complete dryness urmia lake restoration program was formed in 2014 to revive the lake and improve the water resources management system in the northwestern iran this organization contributed to the restoration of the lake by improving irrigations systems and water resources management in the basin according to the recent reports of ulrp ulrp 2019 an increase of about 1 m in lake level in 2019 and 2020 has led to the reduction of dust in the region this positive change has affected the health indicator of the local people salinization desertification and air pollution as a result of drying up of the lake can affect the local economy people s life tourism and the environment as well the purpose of this research is providing the effective systematic solutions for the restoration of the lake using a system dynamics model system dynamics sd provides a useful tool to simulate the complex environmental problems such as urmia lake sd models are tools for understanding the archetypes and then the interactions between interconnected stockholders and sub systems that drive the dynamic behavior of the more extensive system forrester 1968 however the model s ability to provide proper solutions against the consequences of system perturbation depends on the effective identification of the fundamental constituents and feedback loops between these parameters gohari et al 2013 the results derived by sd models have the potential to describe the interaction between agricultural lands and the urmia lake ecosystem zarghami and amirrahmani 2017 designed a sd model with hydrological demands and percolation sub models to increase the water level of urmia lake in continuation of this study ebrahimi and zarghami 2018 developed a sd model to investigate the effects of different restoration scenarios on water level fluctuations of urmia lake according to their results the restoration of the lake without considering the best practice in the agricultural section would be impossible alizadeh govarchin ghale et al 2019 indicated that there is an inverse relationship between increasing the area of irrigated lands and decreasing the water surface area of urmia lake in other words increasing the area of agricultural lands like a predator will lead to reducing the area of the lake like a prey increasing the agricultural activities in the basin will cause local tensions between farmers and the government therefore balancing the water food nexus is necessary for the restoration of urmia lake the prey predator model creates a point of equilibrium between two interacting factors with different values of parameters in this study the prey predator model was innovatively used to analyze the impacts of agricultural development on water level fluctuations of urmia lake in total four restorations scenarios including decreasing the area of irrigated lands by 40 improving irrigation efficiency reducing the lake area and inter basin water transfer from zab were investigated to understand the best water resources management strategies in the basin this study used a nonlinear polynomial relationship between agricultural development in the basin and water surface area changes of urmia lake the results of this study can help the government and decision makers to have a clear view of the advantages and disadvantages of different restoration scenarios in the basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area urmia lake is located in the northwestern iran n 37 5 e 45 5 between west azerbaijan and east azerbaijan provinces it is the largest inland lake of iran with a maximum surface area of 6000 km2 eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 the lake has 102 islands and it is an internationally registered protected area and a unesco biosphere reserve nouri et al 2017 these islands are home to different species of animals like birds amphibians reptiles and mammals artemia urmiana which is a unique species of artemia lives in the saltwater of urmia lake unep 2012 the lake is divided into north and south parts by a 15 km causeway that has a 1500 m long bridge allows limited water exchange between these parts eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 and rezvantalab and amrollahi 2011 sima et al 2013 urmia lake basin ulb with an area of 52000 km2 covers 3 of the entire area of iran the basin contains 21 permanent and 39 episodic rivers which provide the main water

the basin and the lake plays a significant role in the economy of the region irrigated lands comprise about 10 of the basin but consume more than 80 of the renewable water resources in the region fazel et al 2017 the surrounding mountains affect the continental climate of the area the temperature usually ranges between 20 c and 0 c in winter and up to 40 c in summer the average annual precipitation in the basin ranges between 200 mm and 300 mm eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 system dynamics modeling of the ecosystems sd modeling is one of the simulation methods which helps to understand the behavior and performance of a system using the primary mechanisms significant parts and key relationships between different parts of the system forrester 1968 in this approach a causal loop diagram is used to illustrate the influence of different factors on each other and their interaction these diagrams help to illustrate the relationships between interactive sub systems and it can be considered as a conceptual modeling step this study used sd to simulate the water resource system and present solutions for water resources management in the ulb the differential eq 1 which represents the continuity of the whole system can be written based on the causal loop diagram for the present study fig 2 indicates the causal loop diagram of the prey predator model for urmia lake 1 s t t 0 t n g w t r t i t e t d t v t 0 where s t is the amount of water in a lake g w t is the water flows from groundwater resources to the lake r t is the input water from direct rainfall over the lake i t is input water from rivers to the lake e t is the output water from the lake and v t0 is initial lake volume all at monthly periods of t in this study vensim software was used to investigate the impacts of various restoration plans vensim also provides an infrastructure to apply monte carlo simulation on the model to examine its behavior under uncertainty the monte carlo method is a tool to sample a set of numbers between bounded domains and then present their uncertainty on calculating specific study variable s kasperska et al 2013 2 2 2 prey and predator volterra and then lotka introduced the prey predator modeling in the 1920s this model was used in various branches of science lotka 1925 volterra 1926 the model for a system consisting of prey and a predator can be written with a system of ordinary differential equations wang 2004 2 da dt a β c dc dt c γ δ a where a prey assumed the water level of the urmia lake and c predator assumed agricultural development in ulb γ δ and β are the parameters of the interactions of prey and predators as follows is representative of the parameters that affect the water pray entering the lake β is a representative of the parameter that affects the water entering the lake according to the amount of agricultural lands predator γ is a representative of the parameters that affect agricultural lands predator δ is a representative of the parameter that affects agricultural lands according to the amount of water entering the lake pray these parameters are used with the following assumptions the prey population always has enough food the food needed by the predator population still depends on the prey population the rate of population changes depends on the community 2 2 3 key variables to develop sd model the hydrometric data of 17 stations located over the main rivers were used to determine the value of surface runoff fig 3 a this value is approximately equal to the amount of water which agricultural water has not been deducted the hydrometric stations located along the rivers cover about 82 of the basin based on the monthly rainfall depth and surface flow coefficient the remaining marginal surface inflow which is about 18 of the total runoff is calculated from eq 3 3 a m 13830 a l where a m represents the margin area of the lake and a l represents the area of urmia lake which is a function of the lake s water level the unmeasured surface inflow equation eq 4 was calculated based on the monthly surface runoff r in mcm surface area coefficient which c equals to 0 21 and rainfall p in millimeter samadzadeh et al 2018 4 r 0 001 c p 5 p 5 2 a m the data of 10 synoptic stations in the basin was used to calculate the rainfall in the lake fig 3b the red line in fig 3 indicates the mean value of each variable samadzadeh et al 2018 indicated that the amount of groundwater entering the lake is negligible and its inflow is equal to 1 of surface runoff in order to calculate the corresponding evaporation in the basin the data of 10 stations and thiessen polygon approach were used finally the evaporation of the basin was multiplied by the area of urmia lake to obtain monthly total output evaporation in terms of million cubic meter mcm to convert the evaporation height from pan to salt water two coefficients including coefficient of evaporation from fresh water to salt water and coefficient of evaporation from pan to surface water in this study 0 925 and 0 930 were selected as pan and salt coefficients respectively the study period was determined between 1985 and 2019 and time steps were taken monthly fig 3c the study period was determined between 1985 and 2019 and time steps were taken monthly then the validated model is used to forecast the effect of designed scenarios from 2020 to 2030 the measured and unmeasured surface runoff precipitation and groundwater inflow were considered as input to the lake and evaporation from the lake was considered as output from the lake about 70 of the area of ulb is devoted to croplands and 30 of the basin is devoted to horticultural lands ministry of energy of iran 2012 the average irrigation efficiency is calculated by 37 and 45 for horticultural and croplands respectively the net irrigation water demand in the basin was determined by netwat software ebrahimi and zarghami 2018 fig 3d indicates the irrigation water demand from 1985 to 2019 according to this figure july 2011 accounts for the maximum amount of irrigation water 1778 mcm in the study period the agricultural development in the basin was extracted from the results of alizadeh govarchin ghale et al 2019 their result indicated a polynomial relationship between agricultural development in the basin and water level fluctuations of urmia lake fig 4 shows the decadal land cover changes in urmia lake and agricultural development in the basin from 1975 to 2019 according to this figure the idea of prey and predator modeling for ulb is visible by increasing the area of irrigated lands over the past decades the water surface has gradually decreased to its minimum value in 2014 and 2015 the area of irrigated lands has decreased since 2014 and as a result the water surface area of the lake has increased in recent years alizadeh govarchin ghale et al 2019 emphasized on the improvement of climatic conditions and the positive role of ulrp in the lake recovery 2 2 4 model verification the model structure in terms of performance and appearance must be in line with the actual system the model structure testing should begin at the same time as the modeling process begins and keeps its structure until the end of modeling three tests including behavior reproduction boundary adequacy and extreme condition were performed to be ensure about the accuracy and validity of the model here brief explanation of these tests are provided 2 2 4 1 behavior reproduction test in checking the accuracy of the model the water level fluctuations of urmia lake were predicted modeled and the primary results were validated using the observed measured data the root mean square error rmse r2 coefficient values were calculated for the calibration 1985 2010 and validation 2011 2019 periods 2 2 4 2 boundary adequacy test the model was designed for the boundaries of ulb and it is not applicable to other basins boundary adequacy test examines the appropriateness of the boundaries to validated outputs in sd model this test is successfully performed by determining the exogenous data and relationships entered by the modeler and the endogenous defined data and parameters for the model that are generated by running the model variables 2 2 4 3 extreme condition test the extreme condition test shows the consistent performance of the model under extreme conditions and it evaluates the relationships between the variables 3 results 3 1 sd model verification validation and sensitivity analysis table 1 indicates the results of the behavior reproduction test and fig 5 shows the results of observed and estimated water level changes of urmia lake in the study period in meters above mean sea level msl according to this figure there is a good match between the observed and modeled water level fluctuations of urmia lake in order to test the extreme conditions the inflow to the lake was considered zero fig 6 a then the input was considered an unusually large number fig 6b this process was repeated for the groundwater stock too fig 6c and fig 6d fig 7 a shows the stock flow model of urmia lake designed by the sd approach the developed prey predator model is available in fig 7b this figure indicates the negative impacts of increasing irrigated lands on the water level the results of applied tests to verify the sd model were acceptable and this model was used to simulate the management strategies to restore the urmia lake in addition to the mentioned tests the monto carlo simulation was used to run sensitivity analysis in the designed sd model there are several uncertain parameters still the most critical parameter that can be checked for uncertainty is the amount of agricultural water abstraction from surface water this value equals to 0 59 according to the studies iran ministry of energy 2012 the range of 0 30 to 0 80 was used for this parameter to clarify the results in detail other uncertain parameters and their intervals are presented in table 4 the uniform interval distribution functions are assumed for these uncertain parameters the results of running sd monte carlo simulation for the final variable of the lake level are presented in the fig 8 based on the results obtained from the sensitivity analysis fig 8 it is clear these uncertain data have enormous effect on the lake level prediction and then it is strongly suggested for ulrp to start a comprehensive filed tests and also establish monitoring system to obtain the precise values for the uncertain parameters 3 2 the results of implementing the restoration scenarios in total four restoration scenarios were modeled and the impacts of each scenario on the rehabilitation of the urmia lake were simulated the excessive agricultural water consumption in the basin and its negative impacts on the lake were the main reasons for choosing the selected scenarios increased evaporation in the basin was another reason for selecting the scenarios increasing the number of farmers and expanding the agricultural lands in the basin are the main concerns related to water resources management in northwestern iran on the other hand the segregation of agricultural lands increasing the biodiversity of crops and the cultivation of high water use crops increased water consumption in the past years therefore integrating the small lands reducing the variety of products and cultivation of low water use crops can be effective ways to improve the water resource management system in the basin according to the results of moghadasi et al 2015 reducing the agricultural activities in the basin especially in the years with water deficit could be the most effective and favorable solution to reduce water stress in the basin furthermore reducing the number of farmers training the local people by best water saving methods empowering the farmers by alternative less water dependent jobs and integrating the small lands can reduce the irrigated areas by 40 approximately 180 000 ha these policies may be accompanied by the replacement of jobs in the service like tourism and sports handicrafts and industry like mining and transportation sectors the cultivation of the herbal plants and greenhouse planting can be other alternative jobs as a result of this scenario reducing the area of irrigated lands the water level of the lake will increase by about 2 5 m from 2020 to 2030 in addition to the scenario of a 40 reduction in agricultural lands the impacts of 10 20 30 and 50 reduction in agricultural lands on the lake were investigated decreasing the area of irrigated lands by 10 20 30 and 50 will lead to an increase in the lake level by 0 8 1 4 2 1 and 3 5 m respectively the most crucial reason behind the increasing water consumption in the agricultural sector is the low efficiency of the irrigation system the rate of irrigation efficiency in iran is about 33 37 while the rate of irrigation efficiency is about 45 and 60 in some developing and developed countries respectively keshavarz et al 2003 poor quality of agricultural machinery low tariffs of consumed water and lack of agricultural knowledge affect the irrigation efficiency in the basin ghassemi et al 1995 moreover improper crop pattern has led to an increase in water consumption based on the results of isanezhad et al 2015 crop pattern change may lead to reducing water consumption by 21 about 990 mcm cultivation of high cost and low water use crops such as pistachio almond and saffron is recommended to improve the irrigation efficiency in this basin upgrading irrigation methods and irrigation tools will significantly affect water saving in the basin by applying this scenario the inflow to the lake will increase to an acceptable level and the lake level will increase by about 2 m in the period of 2020 to 2030 increasing evaporation in the basin climatic factor reduces the water level of the lake decreasing the area of the lake by 20 is another scenario to reduce the evaporation from the lake and save the lake the results of this study indicated that by decreasing the area of the lake the water level will increase about 2 26 m in the coming ten years the rocking method may be used to reduce the area of the lake low risk chemicals spraying white monolithic floating plates and empty concrete plates can be used to reduce the evaporation from the lake too improving land cover land use lclu policies and proper watershed management can lead to reduce the evaporation in the basin for example surface water can be directed to the ground to eliminate the gradual evaporation this method will minimize erosion and then prevents sediment disposal in the river mouths inter basin water transfer from adjacent rivers such as the zab river was another restoration scenario used in this study ulrp claimed that by transferring annually 650 mcm water from zab river to the lake the water level could increase by 1 19 m in the coming decade based on the study of the ghanavati et al 2016 transfer from the zab would have negative consequences in the origin which need more attention to keep the river ecology simultaneous application of the selected scenarios will lead to an increase in the water level of urmia lake by about 6 m this way the lake will reach to its ecological level 1274 msl in less than 3 years table 5 and fig 9 show the impacts of restoration scenarios on water level fluctuations of urmia lake climatic conditions also have a significant effect on the recovery of the lake increasing atmospheric downpours as well as lowering temperatures and consequently reducing evaporation will make the lake recovery easier cloud seeding can be a new and effective way to accelerate the revitalization of the lake zarghami and amirrahmani 2017 4 discussion the results of the previous studies such as chaudhari et al 2018 and alizadeh govarchin ghale et al 2019 indicated that human induced activities and droughts have had already negative impacts on the urmia lake the results of this study showed an interaction between water level fluctuations of urmia lake and agricultural development in the basin the scenarios used in this study were based on the reducing agricultural water consumption and reducing evaporation from the lake these scenarios are in line with the goals of ulrp there is a good match between the results of this study and the findings of zarghami and amirrahmani 2017 and ebrahimi and zarghami 2018 the main differences between the current study and the mentioned studies are related to the methodology study period and agricultural information in the present study agricultural lands have been carefully analyzed and a long term study period from 1985 to 2030 was selected in addition the prey predator simulation method was developed to understand the impacts of each restoration scenario on the water level fluctuations of urmia lake individually in this study the negative impacts of the causeway have been ignored according to the results of samadzadeh et al 2018 during ten years of constructing process including the construction of a dike and blockage of the causeway the lake had been divided into northern and southern parts the future study can focus on using the regional and global climate models to project the climatic conditions in the next decades and improve the quality of the model according to the climate condition in the next future the practical and effective plans of ulrp based on the reduction of agricultural water consumption and improving climatic conditions in the recent years have caused significant increase in the lake water level it is hoped that by implementing the scenarios presented in this study the lake could reach historical mean level 1276 msl in 2030 it should be noted that drought and failure to pursue rehabilitation plans could lead to a further decline in the lake level again reducing agricultural water consumption and improving the irrigation system will undoubtedly be one of the best ways to improve the condition 5 conclusion urmia lake the largest hypersaline lake in the western asia has lost most of its water surface area over the past two decades due to human induced activates and climate change salinization desertification and air pollution as a result of drying up of the lake may affect the local economy people s life and the environment as well this study contributes to urmia lake restoration by using a prey predator method for modeling the restorations scenarios dynamically in total four restoration scenarios including reducing the area of agricultural lands improving the irrigation system reducing the area of the lake and inter basin water transfer were investigated to quantify the impacts of each scenario on the rehabilitation of the lake the results of this study indicated that reducing the agricultural lands in the basin is the most effective and favorable way to revitalize the lake as a result of this scenario reducing the area of irrigated lands by 40 the water level of urmia lake will increase by about 2 54 m from 2020 to 2030 by increasing the irrigation efficiency controlling the predator the inflow to the lake as prey will increase to an acceptable level and the lake level will increase by about 2 04 m based on the results of this study by decreasing the area of the lake and controlling evaporation the water level of urmia lake will increase about 1 19 m in the coming 10 years also by annual transfer of 650 mcm water from the zab river the level of the lake will increase by about 1 19 m by applying all suggested scenarios the lake water level will reach to its ecological value 1274 m msl in 2023 the recent positive restoration signals of the lake have coincidence with the findings of current research and there is more and more hope for the revitalization of the lake in addition the study presented the value of balancing the nexus between water management and food security in the urmia lake basin otherwise both the lake and farmers interaction will be in burden in long term credit authorship

4968,in recent decades population growth agricultural development and climate change have caused environmental problems in the world especially in the arid and semi arid regions such as iran urmia lake one of the unique biosphere reserves of the world has suffered from these problems in the last 20 years although many studies conducted to the negative impacts of human induced activities especially agricultural expansion on the lake few studies focused on providing restoration plans for that this study uses a system dynamics method for modelling the restorations scenarios of urmia lake based on the prey predator approach this method is helpful to simplify the complicated feedbacks and interactions among human environment the monte carlo simulation is used to explore the effect of uncertain parameters on the lake level based on the results of this study the agricultural water consumption as predator has the most significant effect on reducing the lake volume prey the results indicated that decreasing the area of irrigated lands by 40 improving irrigation efficiency reducing the lake area itself and inter basin water transfer will lead to increase in the lake water level by 2 54 m 2 04 m 1 19 m and 1 19 m respectively by applying all the suggested scenarios the lake water level will reach to its ecological level 1274 msl in 2023 the recent positive restoration signals of the lake have coincidence with the findings of current research and bring more hope to the future of the lake keywords urmia lake restoration scenarios prey predator system dynamics water food nexus human environment interactions 1 introduction the rapid development of agricultural lands without using innovative tools has caused environmental problems worldwide some studies have investigated the impacts of human induced activities and misguided land water resources management on the natural pattern of water dynamics over large scales carpenter et al 2011 halpern et al 2008 meybeck 2003 newbold et al 2016 nilsson et al 2005 vitousek et al 1997 vörösmarty et al 2010 the exploitation of surface and groundwater resources using the construction of dams and increasing the number of wells is one of the common ways for developing irrigated lands and then food security these activities have led to a threefold increase in water exploitation from rivers in the last half century gebremicael et al 2013 narsimlu et al 2013 yan et al 2018 developing sustainable water resources management systems under different climatic conditions is one of the most critical environmental challenges especially in the arid and semi arid regions such as iran urmia lake the largest hypersaline lake in the western asia has lost most of its water surface area due to human induced activates and partially climate change over the past two decades abbaspour et al 2012 hassanzadeh et al 2012 unep geas 2012 madani 2014 tourian et al 2015 fathian et al 2016 fazel et al 2017 although some researches emphasized on the negative impacts of climate change on the lake water level most of the recent studies indicated that the role of anthropogenic factors in the dryness of the lake is more significant than climatic factors hassanzadeh et al 2012 jalili et al 2016 shadkam et al 2016 alizadeh govarchin ghale et al 2018 haghighi et al 2018 indicated that releasing water from dams into the lake is one of the most effective ways to revitalize the lake based on their results the agricultural sector accounts for about 80 of water consumption in the basin and dams play an essential role in irrigation chaudhari et al 2018 used a hydrological model higw mat and landsat satellite data to investigate the impacts of anthropogenic and climatic factors in the shrinkage of the lake from 1987 to 2016 they found 98 and 180 increases in agricultural lands and urban areas respectively with a corresponding shrinkage in the lake area by 86 the annual environmental demand of the lake was calculated by alborzi et al 2018 according to the results of their study the yearly required environmental inflows range from 2900 million cubic meters per year mcm yr during dry conditions to 5400 mcm yr during wet periods the results of saemian et al 2020 indicated a definite increase in the lake water level by 14 5 cm yr from 2016 to 2019 this issue showed the stability of the lake in the short term as a result of increased inflow from rivers and rainfall however in long term studies it cannot be claimed that the lake has stabilized recently schulz et al 2020 investigated the impacts of climate change and agricultural development on the lake according to their results climate change and agricultural development in the basin have had negative impacts on the water level fluctuations of urmia lake in the current climatic conditions changes in the agricultural water consumption may lead to significant changes in the lake volume and it may stabilize the lake or lead to complete dryness urmia lake restoration program was formed in 2014 to revive the lake and improve the water resources management system in the northwestern iran this organization contributed to the restoration of the lake by improving irrigations systems and water resources management in the basin according to the recent reports of ulrp ulrp 2019 an increase of about 1 m in lake level in 2019 and 2020 has led to the reduction of dust in the region this positive change has affected the health indicator of the local people salinization desertification and air pollution as a result of drying up of the lake can affect the local economy people s life tourism and the environment as well the purpose of this research is providing the effective systematic solutions for the restoration of the lake using a system dynamics model system dynamics sd provides a useful tool to simulate the complex environmental problems such as urmia lake sd models are tools for understanding the archetypes and then the interactions between interconnected stockholders and sub systems that drive the dynamic behavior of the more extensive system forrester 1968 however the model s ability to provide proper solutions against the consequences of system perturbation depends on the effective identification of the fundamental constituents and feedback loops between these parameters gohari et al 2013 the results derived by sd models have the potential to describe the interaction between agricultural lands and the urmia lake ecosystem zarghami and amirrahmani 2017 designed a sd model with hydrological demands and percolation sub models to increase the water level of urmia lake in continuation of this study ebrahimi and zarghami 2018 developed a sd model to investigate the effects of different restoration scenarios on water level fluctuations of urmia lake according to their results the restoration of the lake without considering the best practice in the agricultural section would be impossible alizadeh govarchin ghale et al 2019 indicated that there is an inverse relationship between increasing the area of irrigated lands and decreasing the water surface area of urmia lake in other words increasing the area of agricultural lands like a predator will lead to reducing the area of the lake like a prey increasing the agricultural activities in the basin will cause local tensions between farmers and the government therefore balancing the water food nexus is necessary for the restoration of urmia lake the prey predator model creates a point of equilibrium between two interacting factors with different values of parameters in this study the prey predator model was innovatively used to analyze the impacts of agricultural development on water level fluctuations of urmia lake in total four restorations scenarios including decreasing the area of irrigated lands by 40 improving irrigation efficiency reducing the lake area and inter basin water transfer from zab were investigated to understand the best water resources management strategies in the basin this study used a nonlinear polynomial relationship between agricultural development in the basin and water surface area changes of urmia lake the results of this study can help the government and decision makers to have a clear view of the advantages and disadvantages of different restoration scenarios in the basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area urmia lake is located in the northwestern iran n 37 5 e 45 5 between west azerbaijan and east azerbaijan provinces it is the largest inland lake of iran with a maximum surface area of 6000 km2 eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 the lake has 102 islands and it is an internationally registered protected area and a unesco biosphere reserve nouri et al 2017 these islands are home to different species of animals like birds amphibians reptiles and mammals artemia urmiana which is a unique species of artemia lives in the saltwater of urmia lake unep 2012 the lake is divided into north and south parts by a 15 km causeway that has a 1500 m long bridge allows limited water exchange between these parts eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 and rezvantalab and amrollahi 2011 sima et al 2013 urmia lake basin ulb with an area of 52000 km2 covers 3 of the entire area of iran the basin contains 21 permanent and 39 episodic rivers which provide the main water for agricultural activities in the basin ghaheri et al 1999 fig 1 indicates the main watersheds of iran and the location of urmia lake and its basin in the country more than 5 million people live in the basin and the lake plays a significant role in the economy of the region irrigated lands comprise about 10 of the basin but consume more than 80 of the renewable water resources in the region fazel et al 2017 the surrounding mountains affect the continental climate of the area the temperature usually ranges between 20 c and 0 c in winter and up to 40 c in summer the average annual precipitation in the basin ranges between 200 mm and 300 mm eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 system dynamics modeling of the ecosystems sd modeling is one of the simulation methods which helps to understand the behavior and performance of a system using the primary mechanisms significant parts and key relationships between different parts of the system forrester 1968 in this approach a causal loop diagram is used to illustrate the influence of different factors on each other and their interaction these diagrams help to illustrate the relationships between interactive sub systems and it can be considered as a conceptual modeling step this study used sd to simulate the water resource system and present solutions for water resources management in the ulb the differential eq 1 which represents the continuity of the whole system can be written based on the causal loop diagram for the present study fig 2 indicates the causal loop diagram of the prey predator model for urmia lake 1 s t t 0 t n g w t r t i t e t d t v t 0 where s t is the amount of water in a lake g w t is the water flows from groundwater resources to the lake r t is the input water from direct rainfall over the lake i t is input water from rivers to the lake e t is the output water from the lake and v t0 is initial lake volume all at monthly periods of t in this study vensim software was used to investigate the impacts of various restoration plans vensim also provides an infrastructure to apply monte carlo simulation on the model to examine its behavior under uncertainty the monte carlo method is a tool to sample a set of numbers between bounded domains and then present their uncertainty on calculating specific study variable s kasperska et al 2013 2 2 2 prey and predator volterra and then lotka introduced the prey predator modeling in the 1920s this model was used in various branches of science lotka 1925 volterra 1926 the model for a system consisting of prey and a predator can be written with a system of ordinary differential equations wang 2004 2 da dt a β c dc dt c γ δ a where a prey assumed the water level of the urmia lake and c predator assumed agricultural development in ulb γ δ and β are the parameters of the interactions of prey and predators as follows is representative of the parameters that affect the water pray entering the lake β is a representative of the parameter that affects the water entering the lake according to the amount of agricultural lands predator γ is a representative of the parameters that affect agricultural lands predator δ is a representative of the parameter that affects agricultural lands according to the amount of water entering the lake pray these parameters are used with the following assumptions the prey population always has enough food the food needed by the predator population still depends on the prey population the rate of population changes depends on the community 2 2 3 key variables to develop sd model the hydrometric data of 17 stations located over the main rivers were used to determine the value of surface runoff fig 3 a this value is approximately equal to the amount of water which agricultural water has not been deducted the hydrometric stations located along the rivers cover about 82 of the basin based on the monthly rainfall depth and surface flow coefficient the remaining marginal surface inflow which is about 18 of the total runoff is calculated from eq 3 3 a m 13830 a l where a m represents the margin area of the lake and a l represents the area of urmia lake which is a function of the lake s water level the unmeasured surface inflow equation eq 4 was calculated based on the monthly surface runoff r in mcm surface area coefficient which c equals to 0 21 and rainfall p in millimeter samadzadeh et al 2018 4 r 0 001 c p 5 p 5 2 a m the data of 10 synoptic stations in the basin was used to calculate the rainfall in the lake fig 3b the red line in fig 3 indicates the mean value of each variable samadzadeh et al 2018 indicated that the amount of groundwater entering the lake is negligible and its inflow is equal to 1 of surface runoff in order to calculate the corresponding evaporation in the basin the data of 10 stations and thiessen polygon approach were used finally the evaporation of the basin was multiplied by the area of urmia lake to obtain monthly total output evaporation in terms of million cubic meter mcm to convert the evaporation height from pan to salt water two coefficients including coefficient of evaporation from fresh water to salt water and coefficient of evaporation from pan to surface water in this study 0 925 and 0 930 were selected as pan and salt coefficients respectively the study period was determined between 1985 and 2019 and time steps were taken monthly fig 3c the study period was determined between 1985 and 2019 and time steps were taken monthly then the validated model is used to forecast the effect of designed scenarios from 2020 to 2030 the measured and unmeasured surface runoff precipitation and groundwater inflow were considered as input to the lake and evaporation from the lake was considered as output from the lake about 70 of the area of ulb is devoted to croplands and 30 of the basin is devoted to horticultural lands ministry of energy of iran 2012 the average irrigation efficiency is calculated by 37 and 45 for horticultural and croplands respectively the net irrigation water demand in the basin was determined by netwat software ebrahimi and zarghami 2018 fig 3d indicates the irrigation water demand from 1985 to 2019 according to this figure july 2011 accounts for the maximum amount of irrigation water 1778 mcm in the study period the agricultural development in the basin was extracted from the results of alizadeh govarchin ghale et al 2019 their result indicated a polynomial relationship between agricultural development in the basin and water level fluctuations of urmia lake fig 4 shows the decadal land cover changes in urmia lake and agricultural development in the basin from 1975 to 2019 according to this figure the idea of prey and predator modeling for ulb is visible by increasing the area of irrigated lands over the past decades the water surface has gradually decreased to its minimum value in 2014 and 2015 the area of irrigated lands has decreased since 2014 and as a result the water surface area of the lake has increased in recent years alizadeh govarchin ghale et al 2019 emphasized on the improvement of climatic conditions and the positive role of ulrp in the lake recovery 2 2 4 model verification the model structure in terms of performance and appearance must be in line with the actual system the model structure testing

area of irrigated lands the water level of the lake will increase by about 2 5 m from 2020 to 2030 in addition to the scenario of a 40 reduction in agricultural lands the impacts of 10 20 30 and 50 reduction in agricultural lands on the lake were investigated decreasing the area of irrigated lands by 10 20 30 and 50 will lead to an increase in the lake level by 0 8 1 4 2 1 and 3 5 m respectively the most crucial reason behind the increasing water consumption in the agricultural sector is the low efficiency of the irrigation system the rate of irrigation efficiency in iran is about 33 37 while the rate of irrigation efficiency is about 45 and 60 in some developing and developed countries respectively keshavarz et al 2003 poor quality of agricultural machinery low tariffs of consumed water and lack of agricultural knowledge affect the irrigation efficiency in the basin ghassemi et al 1995 moreover improper crop pattern has led to an increase in water consumption based on the results of isanezhad et al 2015 crop pattern change may lead to reducing water consumption by 21 about 990 mcm cultivation of high cost and low water use crops such as pistachio almond and saffron is recommended to improve the irrigation efficiency in this basin upgrading irrigation methods and irrigation tools will significantly affect water saving in the basin by applying this scenario the inflow to the lake will increase to an acceptable level and the lake level will increase by about 2 m in the period of 2020 to 2030 increasing evaporation in the basin climatic factor reduces the water level of the lake decreasing the area of the lake by 20 is another scenario to reduce the evaporation from the lake and save the lake the results of this study indicated that by decreasing the area of the lake the water level will increase about 2 26 m in the coming ten years the rocking method may be used to reduce the area of the lake low risk chemicals spraying white monolithic floating plates and empty concrete plates can be used to reduce the evaporation from the lake too improving land cover land use lclu policies and proper watershed management can lead to reduce the evaporation in the basin for example surface water can be directed to the ground to eliminate the gradual evaporation this method will minimize erosion and then prevents sediment disposal in the river mouths inter basin water transfer from adjacent rivers such as the zab river was another restoration scenario used in this study ulrp claimed that by transferring annually 650 mcm water from zab river to the lake the water level could increase by 1 19 m in the coming decade based on the study of the ghanavati et al 2016 transfer from the zab would have negative consequences in the origin which need more attention to keep the river ecology simultaneous application of the selected scenarios will lead to an increase in the water level of urmia lake by about 6 m this way the lake will reach to its ecological level 1274 msl in less than 3 years table 5 and fig 9 show the impacts of restoration scenarios on water level fluctuations of urmia lake climatic conditions also have a significant effect on the recovery of the lake increasing atmospheric downpours as well as lowering temperatures and consequently reducing evaporation will make the lake recovery easier cloud seeding can be a new and effective way to accelerate the revitalization of the lake zarghami and amirrahmani 2017 4 discussion the results of the previous studies such as chaudhari et al 2018 and alizadeh govarchin ghale et al 2019 indicated that human induced activities and droughts have had already negative impacts on the urmia lake the results of this study showed an interaction between water level fluctuations of urmia lake and agricultural development in the basin the scenarios used in this study were based on the reducing agricultural water consumption and reducing evaporation from the lake these scenarios are in line with the goals of ulrp there is a good match between the results of this study and the findings of zarghami and amirrahmani 2017 and ebrahimi and zarghami 2018 the main differences between the current study and the mentioned studies are related to the methodology study period and agricultural information in the present study agricultural lands have been carefully analyzed and a long term study period from 1985 to 2030 was selected in addition the prey predator simulation method was developed to understand the impacts of each restoration scenario on the water level fluctuations of urmia lake individually in this study the negative impacts of the causeway have been ignored according to the results of samadzadeh et al 2018 during ten years of constructing process including the construction of a dike and blockage of the causeway the lake had been divided into northern and southern parts the future study can focus on using the regional and global climate models to project the climatic conditions in the next decades and improve the quality of the model according to the climate condition in the next future the practical and effective plans of ulrp based on the reduction of agricultural water consumption and improving climatic conditions in the recent years have caused significant increase in the lake water level it is hoped that by implementing the scenarios presented in this study the lake could reach historical mean level 1276 msl in 2030 it should be noted that drought and failure to pursue rehabilitation plans could lead to a further decline in the lake level again reducing agricultural water consumption and improving the irrigation system will undoubtedly be one of the best ways to improve the condition 5 conclusion urmia lake the largest hypersaline lake in the western asia has lost most of its water surface area over the past two decades due to human induced activates and climate change salinization desertification and air pollution as a result of drying up of the lake may affect the local economy people s life and the environment as well this study contributes to urmia lake restoration by using a prey predator method for modeling the restorations scenarios dynamically in total four restoration scenarios including reducing the area of agricultural lands improving the irrigation system reducing the area of the lake and inter basin water transfer were investigated to quantify the impacts of each scenario on the rehabilitation of the lake the results of this study indicated that reducing the agricultural lands in the basin is the most effective and favorable way to revitalize the lake as a result of this scenario reducing the area of irrigated lands by 40 the water level of urmia lake will increase by about 2 54 m from 2020 to 2030 by increasing the irrigation efficiency controlling the predator the inflow to the lake as prey will increase to an acceptable level and the lake level will increase by about 2 04 m based on the results of this study by decreasing the area of the lake and controlling evaporation the water level of urmia lake will increase about 1 19 m in the coming 10 years also by annual transfer of 650 mcm water from the zab river the level of the lake will increase by about 1 19 m by applying all suggested scenarios the lake water level will reach to its ecological value 1274 m msl in 2023 the recent positive restoration signals of the lake have coincidence with the findings of current research and there is more and more hope for the revitalization of the lake in addition the study presented the value of balancing the nexus between water management and food security in the urmia lake basin otherwise both the lake and farmers interaction will be in burden in long term credit authorship

4969,to study hydrological events such as floods and droughts frequency analysis fa techniques are commonly employed fa relies on some assumptions especially the stationarity of the data series however the stationarity assumption is not always fulfilled for a variety of reasons such as climate change and human activities thus it is essential to check the stationarity or we should develop models that take into account the non stationarity in a new risk assessment framework on the other hand a majority of hydrological phenomena are described by a number of correlated characteristics to model the dependence structure between these hydrological variables copulas are the most employed tool generally in the literature the multivariate model is assumed to be the same over time even though multivariate stationarity is required considering the non stationarity in the dependence structure is important because when the copula parameter changes the multivariate quantile curve changes accordingly different scenarios can be considered when choosing a multivariate non stationary model since several variables and a dependence structure are involved the objective of the present study is to construct a model that integrates simultaneously multivariate and non stationarity aspects along with hypothesis testing for the copula part we consider versions called dynamic copulas and series of association measures are obtained through rolling windows of the corresponding series adapted versions of the aic criterion are employed to select the final model margins and copula the procedure is applied to a flood volume and peak dataset from iran the obtained model constitutes of a lognormal distribution for the margins with linear trend in the peak series stationary for the volume series and a quadratic trend in the logistic gumbel copula parameter for the dependence structure keywords copula flood multivariate frequency analysis nonstationarity and trend risk hydrology dunamic copula multivariate trend test 1 introduction frequency analysis fa techniques are common tools employed to study hydrological events such as floods and droughts rao and hamed 2000 however fa relies on some assumptions especially the stationarity of the data series in a simple formulation a series is stationarity if it exhibits no significant changes over time the statistical distribution of the series adjusted for the design of hydraulic structures has to be valid on their expected life however the stationarity assumption is not always fulfilled because of a number of reasons such as deforestation urbanisation and climate change e g jain and lall 2001 wang et al 2014 thus it is essential to question whether the fa assumptions in particular stationarity of the data series are valid or whether we should adapt the model to take into account non stationarity situations e g el adlouni et al 2007 gilroy and mccuen 2012 ouarda and charron 2019 khaliq et al 2006 concluded that non stationarity considerations should be incorporated into new risk assessment frameworks therefore non stationary models are introduced and developed recently e g strupczewski et al 2001 el adlouni et al 2007 a majority of hydrological phenomena are described by more than one correlated characteristics for instance floods are described mainly through their peak volume and duration multivariate fa takes into account the dependence structure between these features to model the dependence structure between hydrological variables several studies employed copulas e g chebana and ouarda 2011 dupuis 2007 genest and chebana 2017 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 li et al 2019 shiau et al 2006 zhang and singh 2006 zhu et al 2019 copulas are the link between the margins and the multivariate distribution function sklar 1959 in addition copulas are completely independent of the marginal distributions and the margins need not to be from the same family which gives more flexibility to the model since the hydrological risk is closely related to the quantile notion chebana and ouarda 2011 considered the multivariate quantiles where they showed that taking into account several variables simultaneously to assess multivariate quantiles is more flexible more realistic and improves the accuracy of the results in the previous studies the multivariate model is assumed to be the same over time or any other covariate however the multivariate fa still relies on the stationarity of the data sets a preliminary and important step consists in testing the non stationarity assumption with univariate and multivariate tests to this end chebana et al 2013 presented a number of multivariate tests which are extensions of the well known mann kendall and spearman tests considering the non stationarity in the dependence structure is important because when the copula parameter changes the quantile curve changes accordingly therefore the estimation of the multivariate quantiles will be more accurate and reflecting the reality this type of non stationarity in the dependence is studied for instance in the economic framework by patton 2006 in finance by van den goorbergh et al 2005 and in tourism by arslanturk et al 2010 multivariate non stationarity modeling is an emerging topic in statistical hydrology as well with a limited but growing number of recent studies including bender et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 kwon and lall 2016 sarhadi et al 2016 a comparison of three bivariate non stationary models has been conducted by zhang et al 2019 different scenarios can be considered when choosing a multivariate non stationary model that is which variable e g volume peak or both is affected which model features are concerned e g location scale or dependence and how they are changing e g linear or quadratic the objective of the present study is to construct a model that integrates simultaneously both the multivariate and non stationarity aspects it takes into account the dependence between variables and the evolving character of the hydrological phenomenon in the margins and in the copula non stationarity in the margins is relatively well treated in the hydrological literature and the developed methodology can be employed here for the copula part we consider versions of copulas where the parameters are not constant and known as dynamic copula e g van den goorbergh et al 2005 different association measures related to several copula parameters are considered to exhibit how the dependence is evolving series of these association measures are obtained through rolling windows for corresponding series in order to show the evolution of the dependence structure adapted versions of the aic criterion are employed to select the final model margins and copula the paper is organized as follows the methodology in section 2 gives the general outlines of the multivariate non stationarity and the main steps of the theoretical study as well as the required background elements section 3 presents adaptation and particular choices for flood context a case study application of the approach is given in section 4 for the ramsar station in iran finally the conclusion is reported in section 5 2 methodology let x and y be two random variables we consider samples of x y with n elements denoted by x 1 y 1 x n y n let f be the joint distribution function of x y and f x and f y be the marginal distribution functions respectively of x and y the series υ υ 1 υ 2 υ n represents the covariate which could be the time or a low frequency climate oscillation index 2 1 background in this part we briefly present required multivariate elements that do not involve non stationarity copulas have recently received increasing attention in various science fields including hydrology e g genest and chebana 2017 joe 2014 independently of the marginal distributions a copula is at the same time a description and a model of the dependence structure between the two random variables one of the most important results related to copulas is sklar s 1959 theorem it provides the link between copulas and bivariate distributions in general multivariate testing the basic assumptions is almost neglected in the hydrological literature even though it is important and could guide model selection especially when the assumptions are not fellfield regarding non stationarity testing chebana et al 2013 presented a review of number of multivariate tests along with comparisons of their performances from the literature these tests are extensions of the well known mann kendall and spearman tests the extension of the quantile notion to the multivariate context was the object of several studies the reader is referred to serfling 2002 for a review and a classification of some of these multivariate quantile versions recently belzunce et al 2007 defined a bivariate vector valued quantile version which is adapted and shown to be appropriate for hydrological application by chebana and ouarda 2011 for p in 0 1 the pth bivariate quantile for the event x x y y is given by 1 q x y p x y r 2 where x f x 1 u y f y 1 v u v 0 1 c γ u v p this definition leads to an infinity of solutions x y called combinations these combinations constitute the corresponding quantile curve for more details see chebana and ouarda 2011 the dependence can usually be measured by three types of coefficients pearson s rho correlation ρ p kendall s tau τ k and spearman s rho ρ s these coefficients are the most known and employed as association measures joe 2014 nelsen 2006 song and singh 2009 it is important to notice that the simple correlation measure ρ p is the widely used in practice but it is not always the appropriate tool since it is closely related to gaussian distribution and linearity embrechts et al 2002 however τ k and ρ s indicate whether there is an association with respect to the ranks of the observations of the series e g joe 2014 nelsen 2006 salvadori et al 2007 table 1 summarizes these relations for a number of known copulas see also salvadori et al 2007 these relations are established explicitly or through numerical approximations for a number of well known copulas 2 2 general description of the procedure the purpose of this study is to model x y with a joint distribution using a parametric model in the margins as well as in the copula therefore we consider the evolution of the distribution according to the variation of a covariate through the parameters of the copula and the margin as f x θ x υ f y θ y υ and c θ c υ where the covariate υ is assumed to belong to a subset λ from r with the same length as the data series the parameters θ x υ θ y υ and θ c υ represent respectively the parameter vectors for each component of the whole distribution which according to sklar s result can be written as 2 f θ ν x y c θ c ν f x θ x ν x f y θ y ν y x y r and ν λ with θ υ θ x υ θ y υ θ c υ the evolution of the parameters through the covariate can be simultaneously for all or a part of the components margins and copula usually the marginal parameters are composed as a vector of the location scale and shape whereas the copula parameter is a real valued the copula parameter summarizes the dependence and it can be expressed in terms of the well known association coefficient measures it is of interest to know which parameter is evolving and how it is evolving with respect to the covariate υ several possibilities can be encountered for instance the location parameter is evolving linearly in the variable x the scale parameter is evolving in a quadratic manner for y and the copula parameter is linearly evolving therefore one can write θ x θ x 1 θ x r θ y θ y 1 θ y s and θ c θ c 1 θ c ℓ where θ x j ν α 0 j α 1 j ν α 2 j ν 2 θ y j ν β 0 j β 1 j ν β 2 j ν 2 and θ c j ν γ 0 j γ 1 j ν γ 2 j ν 2 for j 1 r or s or ℓ to cover the constant linear and quadratic forms when some coefficients are null the constants α β and γ are called the hyper parameters according to values of these hyper parameters stationarity linear and quadratic trends are considered usually in practice and for hydrological applications values of r and s could be 2 or 3 and ℓ is 1 in general the validity of a model is subject to constraints on its parameters to belong to a specific range to insure that a given parameter remains in its range after introducing the non stationarity effect suitable transformations are required for instance the scale parameter should always be nonnegative and in that case an exponential transformation is appropriate on the other hand by considering the parsimony principal it is not advisable to consider complex trend forms trends or changes in location parameters e g mean or median are the most visible and the easiest to detect scale trends and changes are less visible and detectable than in location changes in shape parameter are not considered in the literature since they are not present in all distributions and they may changes completely the class of the distributions a typical example for the latter is in the gev distribution where the sign of the shape parameter determines the type of the distribution gumbel weibull or fréchet however the evolution of the dependence structure cannot be directly visualized indeed contrary to the margin parameters the dependence involves at least two series and cannot be seen through the values of the observations therefore the rolling window technique can be used to exhibit how the dependence structure is evolving this technique is already used in several studies especially in econometrics swanson 1998 in finance van den goorbergh et al 2005 and in tourism arslanturk et al 2010 to select the appropriate distributions in the non stationarity context it is more convenient to consider selection criteria instead of using goodness of fit tests the reason is the large number of possibilities of the models to be considered even within the same parent distribution family for instance in the gev model the evolution form e g constant linear or quadratic for each parameter location and or scale defines a candidate distribution and hence leading to 9 models the number of such models increases rapidly in the multivariate setting in some studies especially univariate non stationarity coles 2001 el adlouni et al 2007 the deviance statistic is employed as a criterion to select the appropriate model this criterion can be used in the case of nested models where we can compare a model m1 with a sub model m0 coles 2001 however in the multivariate context it is very restrictive and not reasonable to consider only nested models since the whole distribution is composed of three different sub distributions two margins and a copula therefore we employed the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 which is more general the aic criterion is used by strupczewski et al 2001 in the univariate non stationary modeling of floods and by dias and embrechts 2010 in the non stationary copula for financial applications the non stationarity of the dependence between variables requires introducing dynamic copula models van den goorbergh et al 2005 in the present paper we consider parametric copulas where the variation is through its parameter with respect to the covariate the advantage of the parametric model is related to the robustness of the conclusions even for a misspecified model van den goorbergh et al 2005 in particular for the hydraulic design of major structures parametric models are preferred to nonparametric ones as reported by singh and strupczewski 2002 note that in patton 2003 2004 and fermanian et al 2004 the variation is taken into account using conditional copula whereas dias and embrechts 2010 considered copulas in multivariate time series analysis once the appropriate distribution copula and margins is selected the corresponding quantiles can be evaluated for a given risk p in 0 1 in the case where a significant non stationarity is present and not taken into account in the model the considered stationary quantiles do not reflect the real risk or the desired return period for the infrastructure under or over estimation the error depends proportionally to the amount of the trend it should be emphasized that when dealing with non stationary modelling long records of data series are required e g cheng et al 2014 this issue has been discussed in the univariate setting e g salas and obeysekera 2014 as well as in the multivariate setting e g cheng et al 2014 li et al 2019 the issue of the sample size becomes more important in the multivariate case and especially in the multivariate non stationary case where the number of parameters to estimate increases rapidly with the data dimension and the complexity of the non stationarity e g bender et al 2014 grimaldi et al 2016 ouarda et al 2020 2 3 procedure steps the procedure is summarized in the followings and then it is given with steps and in more details to characterize the trend in the series we start with univariate descriptive statistics and evaluating association measures with the covariate υ we can conduct tests to verify assumptions about whether the univariate series exhibit any trend then we find the possibly non stationary marginal distributions of series x and y using information criteria we then estimate the parameters using in general the maximum likelihood ml method or specific methods such as the generalized ml gml for the gev el adlouni et al 2007 to determine the trend in the dependency structure between the series we propose to use rolling windows of the association measures finally we find the best copula stationary or not using information criteria and also we estimate its parameters using the maximum pseudo likelihood mpl method the corresponding multivariate quantile stationary or not can be obtained the following general and main steps are essential for modeling non stationarity in the multivariate context 1 descriptive perform univariate analysis for each variable it includes descriptive statistics visualization with respect to the covariate and non stationarity testing evaluate and plot the different association measure series obtained from the rolling windows 2 testing apply a non stationarity test on the rolling window series of the association measures such as mann kendall or its modified versions to check the existence of possible significant trends multivariate trend tests can also be applied directly to the multivariate data series 3 model selection and estimation from the previous steps propose a class of credible model candidates univariate and copula where the parameters could possibly depend on the covariate in linear or quadratic forms estimate the parameters of the whole model which includes the hyper parameters of the copula and those of each margins evaluate the selection criteria i e the appropriate version of the aic for each considered model in previous steps select the optimal model i e corresponding to the smallest aic value 4 multivariate quantile estimation obtain the corresponding quantiles real values for the univariate quantiles and quantile curves for the bivariate case for a given risk value 0 p 1 2 4 step 1 descriptive study the objective of the first step of the above procedure is to highlight the marginal characteristics of the series x 1 x n and y 1 y n in particular to produce graphics of the series in terms of the covariate υ these graphs allow to identify if the series x 1 x n and y 1 y n have possible marginal trends the usual tests in fa can be used to check if the basic assumptions are fulfilled i e the wald wolfowitz test for the independence wald and wolfowitz 1943 the wilcoxon test for the homogeneity mann and whitney 1947 wilcoxon 1945 and the mann kendall test for non stationarity in location kendall 1975 mann 1945 the coefficients ρ p τ k and ρ s are to be evaluated between the series themselves and also between each series and the covariate υ 2 5 step 2 testing trend in the dependence in order to know whether or not there exists a trend in the dependence structure we evaluate the association coefficients between x 1 x n and y 1 y n for q windows of size s s n this technique has been already employed in several papers as indicated previously in this section note that in the case where the series are of short length there will be not enough data to obtain a reliable rolling window series however in this case a non stationarity could not be generated since when a trend exists it is observed on a relatively long period note that the size q of the rolling window series is related to the sample size n and the width s of the window as q n s 1 the choice of s is a trade off between increasing the number of rolling window series q in order to perform reliable analysis s would hence be small and efficient values of the dependence coefficients in each window s would hence be large enough but q would decrease this issue can be difficult to solve in cases of short series indeed a large s allows a better representative value of the dependence coefficients but leads to short rolling series and vice versa short s leads to large rolling window series but not reliable dependence coefficients plotting the obtained values of the association measures over the rolling window is useful to detect visually the possible presence of a trend in the dependence to check the significance of such trend we apply a stationarity test on the rolling window series of the association measures note that the well known and widely used mann kendall test kendall 1975 mann 1945 cannot be directly employed since the required assumptions especially the serial independence may not be fulfilled it is clear that these series are auto correlated by construction to overcome this limitation several versions of the mann kendall test are proposed in the literature among these approaches the pre whitening the trend free pre whitening and block bootstrap are used in hydrological applications e g khaliq et al 2008 2009 a brief presentation and specific references for each approach can be found in khaliq et al 2008 in the present study we consider the block bootstrap approach since it has some practical advantages compared to the others in addition we obtain the regression lines linear or quadratic by considering the rolling window series and the covariate as a predictor when the association measures in terms of the corresponding rolling window series indicate a trend then the model representing the series should be non stationary in its dependence structure through the copula more formally the multivariate trend tests presented in chebana et al 2013 can be applied to detect overall multivariate trend 2 6 step 3 margins selection of non stationary margins to find the most appropriate non stationary marginal distribution we consider the widely used distributions in hydrology that is the generalized extreme value gev the lognormal ln2 and the three parameter lognormal ln3 el adlouni et al 2007 strupczewski et al 2001 villarini et al 2009 in general we estimate the hyper parameters of each marginal non stationary model by the maximum likelihood approach then we assess for each model the corresponding aic criterion given by 3 aic 2 log m l 2 h where ml is the maximum likelihood value of the model and h represents the number of the estimated hyper parameters the model with the lowest aic will be selected several studies have used this principal e g engeland et al 2004 strupczewski et al 2001 sugahara et al 2009 the deviance is another criterion employed e g by coles 2001 and el adlouni et al 2007 which is useful for nested models and it is not appropriate in the present context 2 7 step 3 copula selection of non stationary copula in order to focus on potential class of copulas that are generally appropriate for hydrological applications we make use of the upper tail dependence utd parameter salvadori et al 2007 this parameter should be non null for suitable copulas since the study focuses on extreme hydrological events therefore we consider the following one parameter copulas gumbel galambos and hüsler reiss for these copulas table 1 gives the expressions of the corresponding utd parameters and their relations with the parameter of associated copula on the other hand the aic criterion is used to select a copula model among this list including their non stationary versions usually the aic is based on the maximum likelihood of a given model for copula parameters the so called maximum pseudo likelihood mpl is preferred as an estimation method kim et al 2007 and kojadinovic and yan 2010 showed that the mpl is generally the best method to estimate copula parameter hence the aic based on mpl becomes more precise than the one based on ml the mpl is based on the pseudo observations u ij rather than the original observations which are given by 4 u ij r ij n 1 for i 1 2 and j 1 n where rij stands for the ascending ranks associated with the samples respectively of x and y genest et al 1995 shih and louis 1995 the formula of the pseudo likelihood for the u ij s is then given by 5 l n γ j 1 n c γ u 1 j u 2 j γ υ j where c γ represents the density function corresponding to the copula c γ the corresponding aic expression becomes 6 aic 2 log l n γ 2 h where l n γ stands for the value of the pseudo likelihood l n γ at the mpl estimator γ this formulation is employed for instance by cech 2008 and kim et al 2009 on the basis of the utd parameter and the rolling windows of the association measures several copula models are to be compared using the aic to select the most appropriate one 2 8 step 4 non stationary multivariate quantile after having determined the appropriate copula and margins and estimating their parameters it remains to calculate the corresponding non stationary multivariate quantile which represents the risk associated to a selected value 0 p 1 to include the non stationarity aspect in the quantile curve the parameter of the copula as well as the margins should depend on the covariate υ in this case for the same given p we obtain a number of quantile curves each of which is associated to a fixed value of the covariate υ explicitly the bivariate non stationary quantile is given by 7 q x y p υ x y r 2 where x f x θ x υ 1 u y f y θ y υ 1 v u v 0 1 c γ υ u v p this bivariate non stationary quantile can have different forms as illustrated in fig 1 these forms depend on which variable is affected by non stationarity and also on the way it is affected fig 1 is based on an illustrative example where the quantile curves are affected by the non stationary in different ways we observe that the variation in the margins affects the naïve parts of the quantile curve however the variation in the copula parameter affects the shape of its proper part therefore ignoring variations in some or all model parameters can conduct to errors in safety and costs since the obtained quantiles do not correspond to the actual risk the above development is focused on the bivariate case because for its simplicity and usefulness in practice however it can be conducted in the multivariate setting with the appropriate adaptations it is important to notice that in the multivariate case several technical difficulties and practical aspects arise in the stationary context chebana and ouarda 2011 gave a summary for these elements 3 adaptation to floods in hydrological studies extreme events are of interest therefore marginal distributions as well as copulas should be selected in some appropriate classes for the marginal distributions the gev and log normal with two or three parameters ln2 and ln3 respectively distributions are among the most employed in hydrology see e g hosking and wallis 1997 rao and hamed 2000 the cumulative distribution function of the gev distribution is given by 8 f gev x μ σ k exp 1 k x μ σ 1 k if k 0 and exp exp x μ σ if k 0 for x μ σ k if k 0 fr e chet x r if k 0 gumbel and x μ σ k if k 0 weibull where μ r σ 0 and k r are respectively the location scale and shape parameters the second considered distribution is ln2 with density function given by aitchison and brown 1957 9 f l n 2 x μ σ 1 x σ 2 π e log x μ 2 2 σ 2 x 0 where μ r and σ 0 are respectively the mean and standard deviation of log x the third considered distribution is ln3 with a density function aitchison and brown 1957 10 f l n 3 x μ σ m f l n 2 x m μ σ x m where μ and σ are as in 10 whereas m r is threshold parameter lower bound to incorporate the non stationarity in the gev coles 2001 and el adlouni et al 2007 proposed to link the location and scale parameters to the covariate υ to obtain gev μ υ σ υ k the covariate υ could be for instance time in units of years for annual maximum model the shape parameter k is considered to be constant with respect to υ for simplicity and for practical reasons as assumed by el adlouni et al 2007 they considered the following models gev0 without any trend gev1 with a linear trend in the location parameter μ υ μ 0 μ 1 υ gev2 with a quadratic trend in the location parameter μ υ μ 0 μ 1 υ μ 2 υ 2 and gev11 with a linear trend in both the location and scale parameters μ υ μ 0 μ 1 υ σ υ exp σ 0 σ 1 υ to ensure a positive value of σ υ we use the transformation φ σ υ log σ υ in the estimation of hyper parameters the inclusion of the non stationarity aspect in ln2 and ln3 is inspired by the gev case since ln2 has only two parameters we consider only a non stationarity in the location parameter i e ln2 μ υ σ this consideration is based on the parsimonious principle therefore we have the models ln20 ln21 and ln22 where the location parameter μ varies similarly as in gev0 gev1 and gev2 respectively for the ln3 case the location and threshold parameters vary with respect to υ i e ln3 μ υ σ m υ we consider the models ln30 ln31 ln32 and ln311 by adopting similar notations as in gev to describe and model the dependence structure in the hydrological context several copulas are considered these copulas belong to the archimedean or extreme value families 1 the logistic gumbel copula which belongs to the class of archimedean copulas is given by the expression nelsen 2006 11 c γ u v exp log u γ log v γ 1 γ for u v 0 1 and γ 1 since γ should be greater than 1 we use the transformation φ γ υ ln γ υ 1 when estimating the hyper parameters we consider three cases of variation of γ stationary linear non stationary and quadratic non stationary these cases are described as follows gumbel0 without trend γ υ 1 exp γ 1 gumbel1 with linear trend γ υ 1 exp γ 1 γ 2 υ and gumbel2 with quadratic trend γ υ 1 exp γ 1 γ 2 υ γ 3 υ 2 2 the galambos which belongs to the extreme value copula class is expressed as follows galambos 1975 12 c γ u v u v exp log u γ log v γ 1 γ for u v 0 1 and γ 0 3 the hüsler reiss as a an extreme value copula is given by hüsler and reiss 1989 c γ u v exp log u φ 1 γ γ 2 log log u log v log v φ 1 γ γ 2 log log v log u for u v 0 1 and γ 0 where φ is the cumulative function of the standard normal distribution for galambos and hüsler reiss copulas we employ the transformation φ γ υ log γ υ to keep the parameter positive in a similar way to gumbel copula we consider the non stationary galambos and hüsler reiss copulas where the corresponding parameters are either constant with linear trend or with quadratic trend for each case of the above copulas using the appropriate transformation φ γ we estimate the hyper parameters γ 1 γ 2 γ 3 based on the mpl approach kojadinovic and yan 2010 note that because of the above applied transformation on the parameters e g φ γ υ log γ υ the evolution of the parameters is not necessary linear or quadratic in addition the expressions relating the copula parameters to the association measures are also not linear or quadratic see table 1 therefore a simple way to check the validity of the model especially in the copula part is to plot the rolling window values of each one of the association measures versus time and the curve of the corresponding theoretical association measures obtained from the selected model 4 application in this section we introduce the employed dataset and the region of study we then present the obtained results by applying the proposed approach with the adaptation given above 4 1 dataset the original and basic dataset used is the daily streamflows of the ramsar station on the safarood river in north of iran on the period 1970 2000 the ramsar station is located in the margin of caspian sea where the reference number is 16 051 with longitude 50 38 and latitude 36 55 fig 2 the associated watershed covers approximately 173 000 km2 of the north and north western territories of iran the caspian sea basin receives the highest amount of annual rainfall in iran which varies between 2000 mm in the west to 450 mm in the east the rainfall season in iran usually begins from october and the winter is the major rainfall season in iran however the margin of caspian sea is the only region that receives summer rainfall the rivers in this region such as the safarood river usually originate from hill slopes and highlands of elburz mountains in the south of caspian sea therefore snow melt and rainfall are the main sources of water flow in safarood river the hydrological year starts in august and ends in july because it seems to have very low flow in early august for most years we notice that a typical hydrograph of a hydrological year in ramsar has two important events fig 3 the first one is a flood with a high peak but a short duration this event is denoted by sq and another flood with a longer duration but with a lower peak this event is denoted by sv the later event generally has a larger volume than the first the high peak flow is mainly caused by winter rainfall whereas the high flow volume during spring and summer is caused by both rainfall and snowmelt see e g modarres and sarhadi 2009 because of this particularity of the data we extracted two types of multivariate series according to sq and sv it consists in the peak q the volume v and the duration d for each of the events sq and sv however for space limitations and since the results for sv show no significant stationarity especially in the dependence and it contains an outlier observation we present only results related to sq on the basis of the hydrological literature we focus on q and v series the characteristics q and v are the most important and most studied because they are often highly correlated and most representative of the flood e g chebana and ouarda 2011 shiau 2003 yue et al 1999 note that data of the year 1991 are missing as well as the last 3 months of 1992 therefore the hydrological years 1990 1991 1991 1992 and 1992 1993 cannot be included in the analysis finally we have n 27 years each comprising a series of 365 or 366 daily flows 5 results in the following we present the obtained results through the application of the methodology in section 2 and flood adaptations in section 3 the considered covariate υ is time in units of years with lack in some values due to missing data that is υ 1 20 24 30 fig 4 presents separately the data series q and v according to the hydrological years together with their linear regression line as well as with a lowess smoother cleveland 1979 this trend is decreasing for both series but it is less significant for v table 2 presents values of the coefficients ρ p τ k and ρ s between q v and υ we observe that v and q are significantly dependent according to τ k and ρ s however we notice a significant association for τ k and ρ s between υ and q which is consistent with fig 4 left this is not the case for v and υ where the association is not significant which can be checked with fig 4 right as a summary the significant associations by τ k and ρ s are only for the couples q v and q υ the q v association is in agreement with literature e g yue et al 1999 table 3 presents both univariate and multivariate testing results similar to chebana et al 2013 we note that there is a significant trend for q but not for v which is consistent with fig 4 in addition among the multivariate tests the cet mk and spearman tests detect a multivariate trend in q v the cet test is the one recommended among the multivariate ones according to the literature and chebana et al 2013 note that the ramsar station is located in a region where rainfall series are shown to be non stationary modarres and sarhadi 2009 this could explain a part of the trends present in the flood series following the methodology in section 2 given that n 27 and by choosing a rolling window size of s 12 years the obtained size of the rolling window series is q 16 this number is reasonable in the hydrological context to obtain relevant series of ρ p τ k and ρ s to perform a fa other potentially possible values for instance s 10 and s 14 lead respectively to q 18 and q 14 with these values even though the results might only be slightly affected we consider either the series to analysis as short q 14 or the dependence coefficients to be less reliable s 10 fig 5 presents the linear and quadratic regression graphs of the rolling windows of ρ p τ k and ρ s for comparison purposes horizontal lines are added to fig 5 each horizontal line corresponds to the value of the appropriate dependence measure based on the whole series and not on the rolling windows we observe a significant difference between the stationary and non stationary cases this shows the impact of ignoring the trend in the dependence especially at the beginning and the ending of the series whatever the considered dependence measure we note that the r2 of these regressions are around 0 8 for τ k and ρ s which indicates that the model is well approaching the rolling windows of τ k and ρ s however the r2 for the regression of ρ p is lower 0 36 in addition quadratic regressions are not much more accurate on the basis of r2 and they are not very pronounced close to linear by the parsimony principle the linear regression would be more appropriate we also note that the trend between the coefficients and time is negative in summary the coefficients ρ p τ k and ρ s have negative linear trend with respect to time the classical and block bootstrap versions of the mann kendall test were applied for the stationarity of the series of rolling windows of ρ p τ k and ρ s table 4 presents the obtained results where we observe that on the basis of both tests there is a significant trend at α 5 in τ k and ρ s whereas in ρ p it could be significant if we set α 10 using the classical test but not with the block bootstrap version these results are important because if the dependency between the two studied variables change over time then the copula is also changing at least through its parameter see table 1 hence the estimated quantiles with a stationary copula will not be the same as with a non stationary copula which varies over time fig 1 in general the presence of a positive trend in the rolling windows of the association coefficients indicates that the major events for v and those for q happen more and more simultaneously whereas when the trend is downward the relationship between the major events of q and major events of v is less obvious when the dependence between volume and peak is changing the whole shape of the hydrogram is changing e g if the dependence is decreasing then high peak are associated to low volume or low peak to high volume considering in addition to the margins this variation is important to be taken into account since the hydrological risk is affected through the quantile curves changes in the dependence between q and v could be caused by regional climate changes or could be explained locally by late drought in the data series consequently a model that takes into account the non stationarity in the dependence structure is more accurate and more realistic we consider the three univariate distributions gev ln2 and ln3 with the different forms of non stationarity according to the procedure described in section 2 the aic values are obtained and are presented in table 5 since the best model is the one with the lowest aic we get the models ln21 and ln20 respectively for q and v for each series the best models according to the aic criterion are presented in table 6 with their estimated hyper parameters as well as the minimum value of the negative log likelihood function this selection is in agreement with the mann kendall test results and fig 4 it is noted in table 6 that the models found using the aic are consistent with the values of ρ p τ k and ρ s between v or q and υ given in table 2 we observe that the coefficients of the slope location parameter μ 1 in table 5 are negative for q which is consistent with fig 4 left and also the null value of μ 1 for v which is again in agreement with fig 4 right in summary because of the above arguments the selected marginal models are ln21 for q and ln20 for v fig 6 shows the series q and v on the same graph versus time in two different ways multiple time series and q v versus time in a 3d plot one can observe that the relation between q and v is not always constant over time and that the trend plan is not horizontal we observe from fig 6a there is a positive relationship between q and v because the associated maxima are reached approximately at the same dates in fig 6b we plotted the regression plan on the graph and we observe that there is a trend in bivariate data sets table 7 presents aic results including the estimated parameters of all considered copulas using the mpl and values of the aic criterion we note that the best non stationary copula for q v is gumbel2 fig 7 a represents the estimated quantile curves for p 0 95 using the selected non stationary margins as well as the logistic gumbel gumbel2 estimated using the mpl the other parts in fig 7 are presented for comparison purposes where q the copula or both are assumed to be stationary they correspond to the scenarios of ignoring the non stationarity only in the dependence fig 7b only in the peak fig 7c and in both the dependence and the peak fig 7d these figures show that not considering the non stationarity the obtained quantile curves do not correspond to the appropriate risk p as indicated above because of the applied transformation on the parameters and the non linear relations with the association measures the evolution of the parameters is not necessary linear or quadratic in order to check the validity of the proposed copula model we considered a direct and a simple graphical way where we plot the rolling window series of each one of the association measures versus time and the curve of the corresponding theoretical association measures obtained from the selected copula fig 8 presents this kind of plots for the studied dataset and the selected non stationary logistic gumbel copula we observe that the general shape of each association measure obtained from the model follows the corresponding empirical values the spearman coefficient ρ s is the best fitted compared to the two others however for all the coefficients the model does not include the negative part of the empirical values this is due to the parameter constraint range in the logistic gumbel copula where γ 1 which forces the coefficients to be positive 6 conclusion in the present study we developed a parametric model for simultaneously multivariate and non stationary hydrological series the objective of considering such a model is to approach in more accurate manner the complexity of the reality of hydrological phenomena this model is used to estimate non stationary multivariate quantiles that are actually a set of curves it takes into account the possibility of non stationarity in one or more margins of the series as well as in the dependence structure the marginal distributions are selected using the aic criterion and the corresponding hyper parameters are estimated using the ml or gml methods in terms of the copula the rolling windows of the association coefficients are obtained to characterize the possible trend of the dependence structure the appropriate copula is selected on the basis of a version of the aic criterion where the hyper parameters are estimated by the mpl approach several copulas and marginal distributions are considered the procedure is applied to a flood volume and peak dataset from iran the obtained results show a linear trend in the peak series q ln21 and no trend for the volume series v ln20 however a quadratic trend is observed in the dependence structure between v and q gumbel2 this trend in the dependence is noticeable from the rolling windows of the association coefficients over time these trends show that it is worth taking into account a possible non stationarity the shape of the hydrograph is changed over time and becomes different than it was at beginning of the series note that the methodology is applicable and more valuable for long series where the impact could be more

4969,to study hydrological events such as floods and droughts frequency analysis fa techniques are commonly employed fa relies on some assumptions especially the stationarity of the data series however the stationarity assumption is not always fulfilled for a variety of reasons such as climate change and human activities thus it is essential to check the stationarity or we should develop models that take into account the non stationarity in a new risk assessment framework on the other hand a majority of hydrological phenomena are described by a number of correlated characteristics to model the dependence structure between these hydrological variables copulas are the most employed tool generally in the literature the multivariate model is assumed to be the same over time even though multivariate stationarity is required considering the non stationarity in the dependence structure is important because when the copula parameter changes the multivariate quantile curve changes accordingly different scenarios can be considered when choosing a multivariate non stationary model since several variables and a dependence structure are involved the objective of the present study is to construct a model that integrates simultaneously multivariate and non stationarity aspects along with hypothesis testing for the copula part we consider versions called dynamic copulas and series of association measures are obtained through rolling windows of the corresponding series adapted versions of the aic criterion are employed to select the final model margins and copula the procedure is applied to a flood volume and peak dataset from iran the obtained model constitutes of a lognormal distribution for the margins with linear trend in the peak series stationary for the volume series and a quadratic trend in the logistic gumbel copula parameter for the dependence structure keywords copula flood multivariate frequency analysis nonstationarity and trend risk hydrology dunamic copula multivariate trend test 1 introduction frequency analysis fa techniques are common tools employed to study hydrological events such as floods and droughts rao and hamed 2000 however fa relies on some assumptions especially the stationarity of the data series in a simple formulation a series is stationarity if it exhibits no significant changes over time the statistical distribution of the series adjusted for the design of hydraulic structures has to be valid on their expected life however the stationarity assumption is not always fulfilled because of a number of reasons such as deforestation urbanisation and climate change e g jain and lall 2001 wang et al 2014 thus it is essential to question whether the fa assumptions in particular stationarity of the data series are valid or whether we should adapt the model to take into account non stationarity situations e g el adlouni et al 2007 gilroy and mccuen 2012 ouarda and charron 2019 khaliq et al 2006 concluded that non stationarity considerations should be incorporated into new risk assessment frameworks therefore non stationary models are introduced and developed recently e g strupczewski et al 2001 el adlouni et al 2007 a majority of hydrological phenomena are described by more than one correlated characteristics for instance floods are described mainly through their peak volume and duration multivariate fa takes into account the dependence structure between these features to model the dependence structure between hydrological variables several studies employed copulas e g chebana and ouarda 2011 dupuis 2007 genest and chebana 2017 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 li et al 2019 shiau et al 2006 zhang and singh 2006 zhu et al 2019 copulas are the link between the margins and the multivariate distribution function sklar 1959 in addition copulas are completely independent of the marginal distributions and the margins need not to be from the same family which gives more flexibility to the model since the hydrological risk is closely related to the quantile notion chebana and ouarda 2011 considered the multivariate quantiles where they showed that taking into account several variables simultaneously to assess multivariate quantiles is more flexible more realistic and improves the accuracy of the results in the previous studies the multivariate model is assumed to be the same over time or any other covariate however the multivariate fa still relies on the stationarity of the data sets a preliminary and important step consists in testing the non stationarity assumption with univariate and multivariate tests to this end chebana et al 2013 presented a number of multivariate tests which are extensions of the well known mann kendall and spearman tests considering the non stationarity in the dependence structure is important because when the copula parameter changes the quantile curve changes accordingly therefore the estimation of the multivariate quantiles will be more accurate and reflecting the reality this type of non stationarity in the dependence is studied for instance in the economic framework by patton 2006 in finance by van den goorbergh et al 2005 and in tourism by arslanturk et al 2010 multivariate non stationarity modeling is an emerging topic in statistical hydrology as well with a limited but growing number of recent studies including bender et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 kwon and lall 2016 sarhadi et al 2016 a comparison of three bivariate non stationary models has been conducted by zhang et al 2019 different scenarios can be considered when choosing a multivariate non stationary model that is which variable e g volume peak or both is affected which model features are concerned e g location scale or dependence and how they are changing e g linear or quadratic the objective of the present study is to construct a model that integrates simultaneously both the multivariate and non stationarity aspects it takes into account the dependence between variables and the evolving character of the hydrological phenomenon in the margins and in the copula non stationarity in the margins is relatively well treated in the hydrological literature and the developed methodology can be employed here for the copula part we consider versions of copulas where the parameters are not constant and known as dynamic copula e g van den goorbergh et al 2005 different association measures related to several copula parameters are considered to exhibit how the dependence is evolving series of these association measures are obtained through rolling windows for corresponding series in order to show the evolution of the dependence structure adapted versions of the aic criterion are employed to select the final model margins and copula the paper is organized as follows the methodology in section 2 gives the general outlines of the multivariate non stationarity and the main steps of the theoretical study as well as the required background elements section 3 presents adaptation and particular choices for flood context a case study application of the approach is given in section 4 for the ramsar station in iran finally the conclusion is reported in section 5 2 methodology let x and y be two random variables we consider samples of x y with n elements denoted by x 1 y 1 x n y n let f be the joint distribution function of x y and f x and f y be the marginal distribution functions respectively of x and y the series υ υ 1 υ 2 υ n represents the covariate which could be the time or a low frequency climate oscillation index 2 1 background in this part we briefly present required multivariate elements that do not involve non stationarity copulas have recently received increasing attention in various science fields including hydrology e g genest and chebana 2017 joe 2014 independently of the marginal distributions a copula is at the same time a description and a model of the dependence structure between the two random variables one of the most important results related to copulas is sklar s 1959 theorem it provides the link between copulas and bivariate distributions in general multivariate testing the basic assumptions is almost neglected in the hydrological literature even though it is important and could guide model selection especially when the assumptions are not fellfield regarding non stationarity testing chebana et al 2013 presented a review of number of multivariate tests along with comparisons of their performances from the literature these tests are extensions of the well known mann kendall and spearman tests the extension of the quantile notion to the multivariate context was the object of several studies the reader is referred to serfling 2002 for a review and a classification of some of these multivariate quantile versions recently belzunce et al 2007 defined a bivariate vector valued quantile version which is adapted and shown to be appropriate for hydrological application by chebana and ouarda 2011 for p in 0 1 the pth bivariate quantile for the event x x y y is given by 1 q x y p x y r 2 where x f x 1 u y f y 1 v u v 0 1 c γ u v p this definition leads to an infinity of solutions x y called combinations these combinations constitute the corresponding quantile curve for more details see chebana and ouarda 2011 the dependence can usually be measured by three types of coefficients pearson s rho correlation ρ p kendall s tau τ k and spearman s rho ρ s these coefficients are the most known and employed as association measures joe 2014 nelsen 2006 song and singh 2009 it is important to notice that the simple correlation measure ρ p is the widely used in practice but it is not always the appropriate tool since it is closely related to gaussian distribution and linearity embrechts et al 2002 however τ k and ρ s indicate whether there is an association with respect to the ranks of the observations of the series e g joe 2014 nelsen 2006 salvadori et al 2007 table 1 summarizes these relations for a number of known copulas see also salvadori et al 2007 these relations are established explicitly or through numerical approximations for a number of well known copulas 2 2 general description of the procedure the purpose of this study is to model x y with a joint distribution using a parametric model in the margins as well as in the copula therefore we consider the evolution of the distribution according to the variation of a covariate through the parameters of the copula and the margin as f x θ x υ f y θ y υ and c θ c υ where the covariate υ is assumed to belong to a subset λ from r with the same length as the data series the parameters θ x υ θ y υ and θ c υ represent respectively the parameter vectors for each component of the whole distribution which according to sklar s result can be written as 2 f θ ν x y c θ c ν f x θ x ν x f y θ y ν y x y r and ν λ with θ υ θ x υ θ y υ θ c υ the evolution of the parameters through the covariate can be simultaneously for all or a part of the components margins and copula usually the marginal parameters are composed as a vector of the location scale and shape whereas the copula parameter is a real valued the copula parameter summarizes the dependence and it can be expressed in terms of the well known association coefficient measures it is of interest to know which parameter is evolving and how it is evolving with respect to the covariate υ several possibilities can be encountered for instance the location parameter is evolving linearly in the variable x the scale parameter is evolving in a quadratic manner for y and the copula parameter is linearly evolving therefore one can write θ x θ x 1 θ x r θ y θ y 1 θ y s and θ c θ c 1 θ c ℓ where θ x j ν α 0 j α 1 j ν α 2 j ν 2 θ y j ν β 0 j β 1 j ν β 2 j ν 2 and θ c j ν γ 0 j γ 1 j ν γ 2 j ν 2 for j 1 r or s or ℓ to cover the constant linear and quadratic forms when some coefficients are null the constants α β and γ are called the hyper parameters according to values of these hyper parameters stationarity linear and quadratic trends are considered usually in practice and for hydrological applications values of r and s could be 2 or 3 and ℓ is 1 in general the validity of a model is subject to constraints on its parameters to belong to a specific range to insure that a given parameter remains in its range after introducing the non stationarity effect suitable transformations are required for instance the scale parameter should always be nonnegative and in that case an exponential transformation is appropriate on the other hand by considering the parsimony principal it is not advisable to consider complex trend forms trends or changes in location parameters e g mean or median are the most visible and the easiest to detect scale trends and changes are less visible and detectable than in location changes in shape parameter are not considered in the literature since they are not present in all distributions and they may changes completely the class of the distributions a typical example for the latter is in the gev distribution where the sign of the shape parameter determines the type of the distribution gumbel weibull or fréchet however the evolution of the dependence structure cannot be directly visualized indeed contrary to the margin parameters the dependence involves at least two series and cannot be seen through the values of the observations therefore the rolling window technique can be used to exhibit how the dependence structure is evolving this technique is already used in several studies especially in econometrics swanson 1998 in finance van den goorbergh et al 2005 and in tourism arslanturk et al 2010 to select the appropriate distributions in the non stationarity context it is more convenient to consider selection criteria instead of using goodness of fit tests the reason is the large number of possibilities of the models to be considered even within the same parent distribution family for instance in the gev model the evolution form e g constant linear or quadratic for each parameter location and or scale defines a candidate distribution and hence leading to 9 models the number of such models increases rapidly in the multivariate setting in some studies especially univariate non stationarity coles 2001 el adlouni et al 2007 the deviance statistic is employed as a criterion to select the appropriate model this criterion can be used in the case of nested models where we can compare a model m1 with a sub model m0 coles 2001 however in the multivariate context it is very restrictive and not reasonable to consider only nested models since the whole distribution is composed of three different sub distributions two margins and a copula therefore we employed the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 which is more general the aic criterion is used by strupczewski et al 2001 in the univariate non stationary modeling of floods and by dias and embrechts 2010 in the non stationary copula for financial applications the non stationarity of the dependence between variables requires introducing dynamic copula models van den goorbergh et al 2005 in the present paper we consider parametric copulas where the variation is through its parameter with respect to the covariate the advantage of the parametric model is related to the robustness of the conclusions even for a misspecified model van den goorbergh et al 2005 in particular for the hydraulic design of major structures parametric models are preferred to nonparametric ones as reported by singh and strupczewski 2002 note that in patton 2003 2004 and fermanian et al 2004 the variation is taken into account using conditional copula whereas dias and embrechts 2010 considered copulas in multivariate time series analysis once the appropriate distribution copula and margins is selected the corresponding quantiles can be evaluated for a given risk p in 0 1 in the case where a significant non stationarity is present and not taken into account in the model the considered stationary quantiles do not reflect the real risk or the desired return period for the infrastructure under or over estimation the error depends proportionally to the amount of the trend it should be emphasized that when dealing with non stationary modelling long records of data series are required e g cheng et al 2014 this issue has been discussed in the univariate setting e g salas and obeysekera 2014 as well as in the multivariate setting e g cheng et al 2014 li et al 2019 the issue of the sample size becomes more important in the multivariate case and especially in the multivariate non stationary case where the number of parameters to estimate increases rapidly with the data dimension and the complexity of the non stationarity e g bender et al 2014 grimaldi et al 2016 ouarda et al 2020 2 3 procedure steps the procedure is summarized in the followings and then it is given with steps and in more details to characterize the trend in the series we start with univariate descriptive statistics and evaluating association measures with the covariate υ we can conduct tests to verify assumptions about whether the univariate series exhibit any trend then we find the possibly non stationary marginal distributions of series x and y using information criteria we then estimate the parameters using in general the maximum likelihood ml method or specific methods such as the generalized ml gml for the gev el adlouni et al 2007 to determine the trend in the dependency structure between the series we propose to use rolling windows of the association measures finally we find the best copula stationary or not using information criteria and also we estimate its parameters using the maximum pseudo likelihood mpl method the corresponding multivariate quantile stationary or not can be obtained the following general and main steps are essential for modeling non stationarity in the multivariate context 1 descriptive perform univariate analysis for each variable it includes descriptive statistics visualization with respect to the covariate and non stationarity testing evaluate and plot the different association measure series obtained from the rolling windows 2 testing apply a non stationarity test on the rolling window series of the association measures such as mann kendall or its modified versions to check the existence of possible significant trends multivariate trend tests can also be applied directly to the multivariate data series 3 model selection and estimation from the previous steps propose a class of credible model candidates univariate and copula where the parameters could possibly depend on the covariate in linear or quadratic forms estimate the parameters of the whole model which includes the hyper parameters of the copula and those of each margins evaluate the selection criteria i e the appropriate version of the aic for each considered model in previous steps select the optimal model i e corresponding to the smallest aic value 4 multivariate quantile estimation obtain the corresponding quantiles real values for the univariate quantiles and quantile curves for the bivariate case for a given risk value 0 p 1 2 4 step 1 descriptive study the objective of the first step of the above procedure is to highlight the marginal characteristics of the series x 1 x n and y 1 y n in particular to produce graphics of the series in terms of the covariate υ these graphs allow to identify if the series x 1 x n and y 1 y n have possible marginal trends the usual tests in fa can be used to check if the basic assumptions are fulfilled i e the wald wolfowitz test for the independence wald and wolfowitz 1943 the wilcoxon test for the homogeneity mann and whitney 1947 wilcoxon 1945 and the mann kendall test for non stationarity in location kendall 1975 mann 1945 the coefficients ρ p τ k and ρ s are to be evaluated between the series themselves and also between each series and the covariate υ 2 5 step 2 testing trend in the dependence in order to know whether or not there exists a trend in the dependence structure we evaluate the association coefficients between x 1 x n and y 1 y n for q windows of size s s n this technique has been already employed in several papers as indicated previously in this section note that in the case where the series are of short length there will be not enough data to obtain a reliable rolling window series however in this case a non stationarity could not be generated since when a trend exists it is observed on a relatively long period note that the size q of the rolling window series is related to the sample size n and the width s of the window as q n s 1 the choice of s is a trade off between increasing the number of rolling window series q in order to perform reliable analysis s would hence be small and efficient values of the dependence coefficients in each window s would hence be large enough but q would decrease this issue can be difficult to solve in cases of short series indeed a large s allows a better representative value of the dependence coefficients but leads to short rolling series and vice versa short s leads to large rolling window series but not reliable dependence coefficients plotting the obtained values of the association measures over the rolling window is useful to detect visually the possible presence of a trend in the dependence to check the significance of such trend we apply a stationarity test on the rolling window series of the association measures note that the well known and widely used mann kendall test kendall 1975 mann 1945 cannot be directly employed since the required assumptions especially the serial independence may not be fulfilled it is clear that these series are auto correlated by construction to overcome this limitation several versions of the mann kendall test are proposed in the literature among these approaches the pre whitening the trend free pre whitening and block bootstrap are used in hydrological applications e g khaliq et al 2008 2009 a brief presentation and specific references for each approach can be found in khaliq et al 2008 in the present study we consider the block bootstrap approach since it has some practical advantages compared to the others in addition we obtain the regression lines linear or quadratic by considering the rolling window series and the covariate as a predictor when the association measures in terms of the corresponding rolling window series indicate a trend then the model representing the series should be non stationary in its dependence structure through the copula more formally the multivariate trend tests presented in chebana et al 2013 can be applied to detect overall multivariate trend 2 6 step 3 margins selection of non stationary margins to find the most appropriate non stationary marginal distribution we consider the widely used distributions in hydrology that is the generalized extreme value gev the lognormal ln2 and the three parameter lognormal ln3 el adlouni et al 2007 strupczewski et al 2001 villarini et al 2009 in general we estimate the hyper parameters of each marginal non stationary model by the maximum likelihood approach then we assess for each model the corresponding aic criterion given by 3 aic 2 log m l 2 h where ml is the maximum likelihood value of the model and h represents the number of the estimated hyper parameters the model with the lowest aic will be selected several studies have used this principal e g engeland et al 2004 strupczewski et al 2001 sugahara et al 2009 the deviance is another criterion employed e g by coles 2001 and el adlouni et al 2007 which is useful for nested models and it is not appropriate in the present context 2 7 step 3 copula selection of non stationary copula in order to focus on potential class of copulas that are generally appropriate for hydrological applications we make use of the upper tail dependence utd parameter salvadori et al 2007 this parameter should be non null for suitable copulas since the study focuses on extreme hydrological events therefore we consider the following one parameter copulas gumbel galambos and hüsler reiss for these copulas table 1 gives the expressions of the corresponding utd parameters and their relations with the parameter of associated copula on the other hand the aic criterion is used to select a copula model among this list including their non stationary versions usually the aic is based on the maximum likelihood of a given model for copula parameters the so called maximum pseudo likelihood mpl is preferred as an estimation method kim et al 2007 and kojadinovic and yan 2010 showed that the mpl is generally the best method to estimate copula parameter hence the aic based on mpl becomes more precise than the one based on ml the mpl is based on the pseudo observations u ij rather than the original observations which are given by 4 u ij r ij n 1 for i 1 2 and j 1 n where rij stands for the ascending ranks associated with the samples respectively of x and y genest et al 1995 shih and louis 1995 the formula of the pseudo likelihood for the u ij s is then given by 5 l n γ j 1 n c γ u 1 j u 2 j γ υ j where c γ represents the density function corresponding to the copula c γ the corresponding aic expression becomes 6 aic 2 log l n γ 2 h where l n γ stands for the value of the pseudo likelihood l n γ at the mpl estimator γ this formulation is employed for instance by cech 2008 and kim et al 2009 on the basis of the utd parameter and the rolling windows of the association measures several copula models are to be compared using the aic to select the most appropriate one 2 8 step 4 non stationary multivariate quantile after having determined the appropriate copula and margins and estimating their parameters it remains to calculate the corresponding non stationary multivariate quantile which represents the risk associated to a selected value 0 p 1 to include the non stationarity aspect in the quantile curve the parameter of the copula as well as the margins should depend on the covariate υ in this case for the same given p we obtain a number of quantile curves each of which is associated to a fixed value of the covariate υ explicitly the bivariate non stationary quantile is given by 7 q x y p υ x y r 2 where x f x θ x υ 1 u y f y θ y υ 1 v u v 0 1 c γ υ u v p this bivariate non stationary quantile can have different forms as illustrated in fig 1 these forms depend on which variable is affected by non stationarity and also on the way it is affected fig 1 is based on an illustrative example where the quantile curves are affected by the non stationary in different ways we observe that the variation in the margins affects the naïve parts of the quantile curve however the variation in the copula parameter affects the shape of its proper part therefore ignoring variations in some or all model parameters can conduct to errors in safety and costs since the obtained quantiles do not correspond to the actual risk the above development is focused on the bivariate case because for its simplicity and usefulness in practice however it can be conducted in the multivariate setting with the appropriate adaptations it is important to notice that in the multivariate case several technical difficulties and practical aspects arise in the stationary context chebana and ouarda 2011 gave a summary for these elements 3 adaptation to floods in hydrological studies extreme events are of interest therefore marginal distributions as well as copulas should be selected in some appropriate classes for the marginal distributions the gev and log normal with two or three parameters ln2 and ln3 respectively distributions are among the most employed in hydrology see e g hosking and wallis 1997 rao and hamed 2000 the cumulative distribution function of the gev distribution is given by 8 f gev x μ σ k exp 1 k x μ σ 1 k if k 0 and exp exp x μ σ if k 0 for x μ σ k if k 0 fr e chet x r if k 0 gumbel and x μ σ k if k 0 weibull where μ r σ 0 and k r are respectively the location scale and shape parameters the second considered distribution is ln2 with density function given by aitchison and brown 1957 9 f l n 2 x μ σ 1 x σ 2 π e log x μ 2 2 σ 2 x 0 where μ r and σ 0 are respectively the mean and standard deviation of log x the third considered distribution is ln3 with a density function aitchison and brown 1957 10 f l n 3 x μ σ m f l n 2 x m μ σ x m where μ and σ are as in 10 whereas m r is threshold parameter lower bound to incorporate the non stationarity in the gev coles 2001 and el adlouni et al 2007 proposed to link the location and scale parameters to the covariate υ to obtain gev μ υ σ υ k the covariate υ could be for instance time in units of years for annual maximum model the shape parameter k is considered to be constant with respect to υ for simplicity and for practical reasons as assumed by el adlouni et al 2007 they considered the following models gev0 without any trend gev1 with a linear trend in the location parameter μ υ μ 0 μ 1 υ gev2 with a quadratic trend in the location parameter μ υ μ 0 μ 1 υ μ 2 υ 2 and gev11 with a linear trend in both the location and scale parameters μ υ μ 0 μ 1 υ σ υ exp σ 0 σ 1 υ to ensure a positive value of σ υ we use the transformation φ σ υ log σ υ in the estimation of hyper parameters the inclusion of the non stationarity aspect in ln2 and ln3 is inspired by the gev case since ln2 has only two parameters we consider only a non stationarity in the location parameter i e ln2 μ υ σ this consideration is based on the parsimonious principle therefore we have the models ln20 ln21 and ln22 where the location parameter μ varies similarly as in gev0 gev1 and gev2 respectively for the ln3 case the location and threshold parameters vary with respect to υ i e ln3 μ υ σ m υ we consider the models ln30 ln31 ln32 and ln311 by adopting similar notations as in gev to describe and model the dependence structure in the hydrological context several copulas are considered these copulas belong to the archimedean or extreme value families 1 the logistic gumbel copula which belongs to the class of archimedean copulas is given by the expression nelsen 2006 11 c γ u v exp log u γ log v γ 1 γ for u v 0 1 and γ 1 since γ should be greater than 1 we use the transformation φ γ υ ln γ υ 1 when estimating the hyper parameters we consider three cases of variation of γ stationary linear non stationary and quadratic non stationary these cases are described as follows gumbel0 without trend γ υ 1 exp γ 1 gumbel1 with linear trend γ υ 1 exp γ 1 γ 2 υ and gumbel2 with quadratic trend γ υ 1 exp γ 1 γ 2 υ γ 3 υ 2 2 the galambos which belongs to the extreme value copula class is expressed as follows galambos 1975 12 c γ u v u v exp log u γ log v γ 1 γ for u v 0 1 and γ 0 3 the hüsler reiss as a an extreme value copula is given by hüsler and reiss 1989 c γ u v exp log u φ 1 γ γ 2 log log u log v log v φ 1 γ γ 2 log log v log u for u v 0 1 and γ 0 where φ is the cumulative function of the standard normal distribution for galambos and hüsler reiss copulas we employ the transformation φ γ υ log γ υ to keep the parameter positive in a similar way to gumbel copula we consider the non stationary galambos and hüsler reiss copulas where the corresponding parameters are either constant with linear trend or with quadratic trend for each case of the above copulas using the appropriate transformation φ γ we estimate the hyper parameters γ 1 γ 2 γ 3 based on the mpl approach kojadinovic and yan 2010 note that because of the above applied transformation on the parameters e g φ γ υ log γ υ the evolution of the parameters is not necessary linear or quadratic in addition the expressions relating the copula parameters to the association measures are also not linear or quadratic see table 1 therefore a simple way to check the validity of the model especially in the copula part is to plot the rolling window values of each one of the association measures versus time and the curve of the corresponding theoretical association measures obtained from the selected model 4 application in this section we introduce the employed dataset and the region of study we then present the obtained results by applying the proposed approach with the adaptation given above 4 1 dataset the original and basic dataset used is the daily streamflows of the ramsar station on the safarood river in north of iran on the period 1970 2000 the ramsar station is located in the margin of caspian sea where the reference number is 16 051 with longitude 50 38 and latitude 36 55 fig 2 the associated watershed covers approximately 173 000 km2 of the north and north western territories of iran the caspian sea basin receives the highest amount of annual rainfall in iran which varies between 2000 mm in the west to 450 mm in the east the rainfall season in iran usually begins from october and the winter is the major rainfall season in iran however the margin of caspian sea is the only region that receives summer rainfall the rivers in this region such as the safarood river usually originate from hill slopes and highlands of elburz mountains in the south of caspian sea therefore snow melt and rainfall are the main sources of water flow in safarood river the hydrological year starts in august and ends in july because it seems to have very low flow in early august for most years we notice that a typical hydrograph of a hydrological year in ramsar has two important events fig 3 the first one is a flood with a high peak but a short duration this event is denoted by sq and another flood with a longer duration but with a lower peak this event is denoted by sv the later event generally has a larger volume than the first the high peak flow is mainly caused by winter rainfall whereas the high flow volume during spring and summer is caused by both rainfall and snowmelt see e g modarres and sarhadi 2009 because of this particularity of the data we extracted two types of multivariate series according to sq and sv it consists in the peak q the volume v and the duration d for each of the events sq and sv however for space limitations and since the results for sv show no significant stationarity especially in the dependence and it contains an outlier observation we present only results related to sq on the basis of the hydrological literature we focus on q and v series the characteristics q and v are the most important and most studied because they are often highly correlated and most representative of the flood e g chebana and ouarda 2011 shiau 2003 yue et al 1999 note that data of the year 1991 are missing as well as the last 3 months of 1992 therefore the hydrological years 1990 1991 1991 1992 and 1992 1993 cannot be included in the analysis finally we have n 27 years each comprising a series of 365 or 366 daily flows 5 results in the following we present the obtained results through the application of the methodology in section 2 and flood adaptations in section 3 the considered covariate υ is time in units of years with lack in some values due to missing data that is υ 1 20 24 30 fig 4 presents separately the data series q and v according to the hydrological years together with their linear regression line as well as with a lowess smoother cleveland 1979 this trend is decreasing for both series but it is less significant for v table 2 presents values of the coefficients ρ p τ k and ρ s between q v and υ we observe that v and q are significantly dependent according to τ k and ρ s however we notice a significant association for τ k and ρ s between υ and q which is consistent with fig 4 left this is not the case for v and υ where the association is not significant which can be checked with fig 4 right as a summary the significant associations by τ k and ρ s are only for the couples q v and q υ the q v association is in agreement with literature e g yue et al 1999 table 3 presents both univariate and multivariate testing results similar to chebana et al 2013 we note that there is a significant trend for q but not for v which is consistent with fig 4 in addition among the multivariate tests the cet mk and spearman tests detect a multivariate trend in q v the cet test is the one recommended among the multivariate ones according to the literature and chebana et al 2013 note that the ramsar station is located in a region where rainfall series are shown to be non stationary modarres and sarhadi 2009 this could explain a part of the trends present in the flood series following the methodology in section 2 given that n 27 and by choosing a rolling window size of s 12 years the obtained size of the rolling window series is q 16 this number is reasonable in the hydrological context to obtain relevant series of ρ p τ k and ρ s to perform a fa other potentially possible values for instance s 10 and s 14 lead respectively to q 18 and q 14 with these values even though the results might only be slightly affected we consider either the series to analysis as short q 14 or the dependence coefficients to be less reliable s 10 fig 5 presents the linear and quadratic regression graphs of the rolling windows of ρ p τ k and ρ s for comparison purposes horizontal lines are added to fig 5 each horizontal line corresponds to the value of the appropriate dependence measure based on the whole series and not on the rolling windows we observe a significant difference between the stationary and non stationary cases this shows the impact of ignoring the trend in the dependence especially at the beginning and the ending of the series whatever the considered dependence measure we note that the r2 of these regressions are around 0 8 for τ k and ρ s which indicates that the model is well approaching the rolling windows of τ k and ρ s however the r2 for the regression of ρ p is lower 0 36 in addition quadratic regressions are not much more accurate on the basis of r2 and they are not very pronounced close to linear by the parsimony principle the linear regression would be more appropriate we also note that the trend between the coefficients and time is negative in summary the coefficients ρ p τ k and ρ s have negative linear trend with respect to time the classical and block bootstrap versions of the mann kendall test were applied for the stationarity of the series of rolling windows of ρ p τ k and ρ s table 4 presents the obtained results where we observe that on the basis of both tests there is a significant trend at α 5 in τ k and ρ s whereas in ρ p it could be significant if we set α 10 using the classical test but not with the block bootstrap version these results are important because if the dependency between the two studied variables change over time then the copula is also changing at least through its parameter see table 1 hence the estimated quantiles with a stationary copula will not be the same as with a non stationary copula which varies over time fig 1 in general the presence of a positive trend in the rolling windows of the association coefficients indicates that the major events for v and those for q happen more and more simultaneously whereas when the trend is downward the relationship between the major events of q and major events of v is less obvious when the dependence between volume and peak is changing the whole shape of the hydrogram is changing e g if the dependence is decreasing then high peak are associated to low volume or low peak to high volume considering in addition to the margins this variation is important to be taken into account since the hydrological risk is affected through the quantile curves changes in the dependence between q and v could be caused by regional climate changes or could be explained locally by late drought in the data series consequently a model that takes into account the non stationarity in the dependence structure is more accurate and more realistic we consider the three univariate distributions gev ln2 and ln3 with the different forms of non stationarity according to the procedure described in section 2 the aic values are obtained and are presented in table 5 since the best model is the one with the lowest aic we get the models ln21 and ln20 respectively for q and v for each series the best models according to the aic criterion are presented in table 6 with their estimated hyper parameters as well as the minimum value of the negative log likelihood function this selection is in agreement with the mann kendall test results and fig 4 it is noted in table 6 that the models found using the aic are consistent with the values of ρ p τ k and ρ s between v or q and υ given in table 2 we observe that the coefficients of the slope location parameter μ 1 in table 5 are negative for q which is consistent with fig 4 left and also the null value of μ 1 for v which is again in agreement with fig 4 right in summary because of the above arguments the selected marginal models are ln21 for q and ln20 for v fig 6 shows the series q and v on the same graph versus time in two different ways multiple time series and q v versus time in a 3d plot one can observe that the relation between q and v is not always constant over time and that the trend plan is not horizontal we observe from fig 6a there is a positive relationship between q and v because the associated maxima are reached approximately at the same dates in fig 6b we plotted the regression plan on the graph and we observe that there is a trend in bivariate data sets table 7 presents aic results including the estimated parameters of all considered copulas using the mpl and values of the aic criterion we note that the best non stationary copula for q v is gumbel2 fig 7 a represents the estimated quantile curves for p 0 95 using the selected non stationary margins as well as the logistic gumbel gumbel2 estimated using the mpl the other parts in fig 7 are presented for comparison purposes where q the copula or both are assumed to be stationary they correspond to the scenarios of ignoring the non stationarity only in the dependence fig 7b only in the peak fig 7c and in both the dependence and the peak fig 7d these figures show that not considering the non stationarity the obtained quantile curves do not correspond to the appropriate risk p as indicated above because of the applied transformation on the parameters and the non linear relations with the association measures the evolution of the parameters is not necessary linear or quadratic in order to check the validity of the proposed copula model we considered a direct and a simple graphical way where we plot the rolling window series of each one of the association measures versus time and the curve of the corresponding theoretical association measures obtained from the selected copula fig 8 presents this kind of plots for the studied dataset and the selected non stationary logistic gumbel copula we observe that the general shape of each association measure obtained from the model follows the corresponding empirical values the spearman coefficient ρ s is the best fitted compared to the two others however for all the coefficients the model does not include the negative part of the empirical values this is due to the parameter constraint range in the logistic gumbel copula where γ 1 which forces the coefficients to be positive 6 conclusion in the present study we developed a parametric model for simultaneously multivariate and non stationary hydrological series the objective of considering such a model is to approach in more accurate manner the complexity of the reality of hydrological phenomena this model is used to estimate non stationary multivariate quantiles that are actually a set of curves it takes into account the possibility of non stationarity in one or more margins of the series as well as in the dependence structure the marginal distributions are selected using the aic criterion and the corresponding hyper parameters are estimated using the ml or gml methods in terms of the copula the rolling windows of the association coefficients are obtained to characterize the possible trend of the dependence structure the appropriate copula is selected on the basis of a version of the aic criterion where the hyper parameters are estimated by the mpl approach several copulas and marginal distributions are considered the procedure is applied to a flood volume and peak dataset from iran the obtained results show a linear trend in the peak series q ln21 and no trend for the volume series v ln20 however a quadratic trend is observed in the dependence structure between v and q gumbel2 this trend in the dependence is noticeable from the rolling windows of the association coefficients over time these trends show that it is worth taking into account a possible non stationarity the shape of the hydrograph is changed over time and becomes different than it was at beginning of the series note that the methodology is applicable and more valuable for long series where the impact could be more
