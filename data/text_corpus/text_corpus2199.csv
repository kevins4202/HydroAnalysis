10995,this study aimed at examining the effects of different irrigation regimes amount and frequency on yield water use water productivity wp irrigation water productivity iwp and disease rate of drip irrigated peanut arachis hypogaea during the 2014 and 2015 seasons in the eastern mediterranean region of turkey the treatments consisted of combinations of 3 irrigation frequencies if if1 25 mm if2 50 mm if3 75 mm of cumulative pan evaporation cpe and 7 irrigation water levels wl1 0 50 wl2 0 75 wl3 1 00 and wl4 1 25 wl1 wl2 wl3 and wl4 treatments received 50 75 100 and 125 of cpe in addition partial root drying prd treatments wl5 prd50 wl6 prd75 and wl7 prd100 treatments were considered they received 50 75 and 100 of wl3 treatment from alternate laterals respectively these 21 treatment combinations were arranged and analysed in a split plot design with 4 replications the main plots and subplots were established to irrigation frequencies if1 if2 and if3 and levels wl1 wl2 wl3 wl4 wl5 wl6 and wl7 both if and wl were observed to have significantly influenced peanut yields at 1 level in each of the experimental years the largest and the smallest average peanut yields were acquired from the if2wl4 and if3wl1 treatments respectively results indicated that peanut crops under prd produced higher than those under deficit irrigation upon usage of the same volume of water amount significant linear relationships between irrigation yield and evapotranspiration yield were obtained during different irrigation frequencies in each season the yield response factor ky was 0 58 0 65 in if1 0 65 0 70 in if2 and 0 90 0 91 in if3 plots in both years water stress raised the disease emergence in peanut markedly in the experimental years the wp and iwp of prd peanut were significantly greater than full irrigation and deficit irrigation di treatments in both growing seasons which demonstrated that limiting water did not reduce wp values we conclude that di treatments resulted in importantly lower wp p 0 05 than prd treatments in both years in spite of applying the same volume of water keywords peanut water productivity yield response factor irrigation frequency leaf area index root rot 1 introduction the constant and rapid increase in the population of the country lead to an increase in nutrition clothing and living requirements of the people the human needs increase numerically in parallel with the increasing population on one side and such needs become even more together with the changes in the living standards brought by the technological developments considering the fact that the available water resources are limited in the mediterranean region and the increase in the pressure on usage of such resources by other sectors domestic urban and industrial and that irrigation is the biggest consumer of the water resources on earth it is inevitable to use the water efficiently sezen et al 2017 usage of pressurized irrigation systems which save water and energy minimize water losses relatively pollute the environment less and lead to increase in product yield and quality will lead to usage of the country s water resources in a more efficient way and decrease the above mentioned pressures peanut arachis hypogaea l is a major industrial and food crops in turkey as in many parts of the world it is grown both for the domestic and export marketing the average number of world annual peanut production was 43 9 million tons per year in 2016 37 1 of world peanut production was provided from china 15 5 from india 8 1 from nigeria and 5 6 from the united states turkey produces only 0 3 of world peanut production faostat 2018 the total production of peanut was 165 130 tons in turkey in 2016 according to the data in 2016 87 5 of peanut production in turkey is in the east mediterranean part of turkey tuik 2018 the east mediterranean region in turkey is known to have a semi arid zone where most of the limited annual rainfall and uneven distribution occur from may to october during the main growing season water scarcity is one of the most important factors affecting yield in the eastern mediterranean region of turkey sezen et al 2017 thus supplementary irrigation is required throught the growing period to ensure and improve plant development and yield of peanut in turkey generally traditional surface irrigation methods are used to irrigate peanut almost flood the entire soil surface without considering the actual consumptive requirements of the peanut these practices have created such problems as waterlogging and salinity which result in a waste of water and reduction in sufficient irrigation therefore drip irrigation is eligible to the less satisfactory traditional surface methods peanut instead of yield is affected by irregular distribution of rainfall in seasons and other biotic factors under rainfed conditions water management of peanut highly is important at all growth stages for optimum production rao et al 1988 meisner and karnok 1992 however some authors reported that the response of peanut to water stress during different development periods of crop is not equally sensitive flowering and pod filling periods are more reactive to water stress than early vegetative and late ripening stages howell et al 1980 doorenbos and kassam 1986 many studies confirm that irrigation scheduling aims at optimization of irrigation management minimizing water use increasing water productivity and raving economic returns while maintaining production optimizing irrigation schedule means achieving the best balance of high crop yield by increasing the marginal utility generated per unit of water and water saving under limited irrigation conditions above all it seems very important to provide the best desicion when stress is applied fereres and soriano 2007 nowadays full irrigation fi is considered a luxury use of water that can be reduced with minor or no effect on profitable yield kang and zhang 2004 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 both di and prd strategies must be developed for improved water saving prd can concluded higher water productivity reduced crop water use and water savings on different crops compared to fi e g zegbe et al 2004 geerts and raes 2009 wang et al 2009 jovanovic et al 2010 perry 2011 topak et al 2016 also experimental results show that crops under prd yield better than under di when the same volume of water is applied kriedmann and goodwin 2003 liu et al 2006 leib et al 2006 sezen et al 2011 2014 additionally irrigation frequency if is one of the most prominent factors in drip irrigation management due to the soil water pattern and water percolation under the root zone wang et al 2006 in peanut little information is available on the impacts of irrigation on root rot and almost nothing is known about how the disease is affected by different irrigation frequencies if and irrigation water levels wl using prd and di regimes in drip irrigation systems therefore the objectives of the present research were to i examine the influence of drip irrigation frequency and its mutual with irrigation water levels on soil water content peanut yield wp

alata horticultural research station tarsus turkey which is located around the point of 37 01 n latitude and 35 01 e longitude and altitude 60 0 m table 1 displays the some of climatic variables including temperatures evaporation relative humidity and rainfall for the two years of experiment the east mediterranean region has semi arid climate the rainfall received in the first and second growing seasons were 117 and 103 mm which was 77 0 and 80 0 of the long term rainfall respectively table 1 2 2 experimental soil and water property some properties of the experimental soil are listed in table 2 the values of the measured field water capacity at site varied between 29 46 to 32 08 g g 1 and wilting point increased from 15 81 to 19 83 g g 1 on a dry weight basis the soil included high ratios of sand 32 5 43 6 followed by clay 28 5 37 0 and silt 27 9 32 6 and it could be categorized as clay loam the dry soil bulk densities ranged from 1 38 to 1 58 g cm 3 along the 0 90 m profiles the available water in the 0 90 m of soil depth was 155 mm we used water for experimental area from an open channel whose quality was classified as c2s1 by ussl 1954 ph is 7 2 8 2 and mean electrical conductivity ec varied between 0 39 ds m 1 and 0 63 ds m 1 which is acceptable for the peanut 2 3 treatments and experimental methods the experiment was laid out in a split plot design with 3 irrigation frequencies as the main treatments based on different levels of cpe values if1 25 mm if2 50 mm if3 75 mm of cpe and 7 irrigation water levels wl1 0 50 wl2 0 75 wl3 1 00 wl4 1 25 wl5 prd50 wl6 prd75 and wl7 prd100 treatments as the sub treatments with 4 replications prd plots received 50 75 and 100 of the wl3 treatment from alternate laterals respectively class a pan is located at the meteorological station next to the experimental plots daily water level changes in the class a pan were measured with an micrometer system the irrigation water levels wl were evaluated as plant pan coefficients kcp1 0 50 kcp2 0 75 kcp3 1 00 and kcp4 1 25 each sub plot was 10 m long and 5 rows in width in the control unit a pressure gauge and flow meter were installed to measure operating pressure and water depth for drip irrigation of the wl1 wl2 wl3 and wl4 treatments laterals were used in each plant row and inline dripper 4 l h 1 spaced at 25 cm apart along the line in the prd plots two drip lines were located 20 cm from each side of the plant row for the wl5 wl6 and wl7 the irrigation management was that one supplied the water for one irrigation and the other for the following irrigation 2 4 agronomic practices the seedbed preparation involved deep plowing disking and loosening of the soil a combined driller was used to facilitate concurrent application of fertilizer and seeds peanut nc 7 arachis hypogaea type which is a virginia type peanut variety having larger seeds than many others and which has become a dominant type in the east mediterranean part of turkey was used crops were planted on may 20 2014 and may 08 2015 setting of the driller was 90 kg of seed per hectare at 5 cm soil depth in rows 0 70 m apart and 0 20 m between plant final plant densities after crop establishment were 7 plants m 2 in both years a compound fertilizer of 18 n 46 p2o5 0 k2o was used at a rate of 200 kg ha 1 during planting the remaining n of 400 kg ha 1 was applied as ammonium nitrate 33 n during flowering the harvest was carried out by manually collecting 6 m portions of three adjacent central rows at each subplot on november 06 2014 and october 09 2015 2 5 measurements and observations 2 5 1 soil water content swc the swc was measured before irrigation by a neutron probe hydroprobe model 503 and gravimetric method samples were taken using soil auger at 0 3 m layer increments up to 0 9 m in soil depth the four replications were taken per treatment until harvest in both growing seasons 2 5 2 evapotranspiration et water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp the amount of irrigation water i was calculated by using the equation given below i cpe p kcp a where i is irrigation water amount l cpe is the cumulative pan evaporation mm and p is the percentage of wetted area taken as 100 for row crops wl is the irrigation water levels 0 50 0 75 1 0 and 1 25 the values of wl evaluated as plant pan coefficients kcp1 0 50 kcp2 0 75 kcp3 1 00 and kcp4 1 25 kp is the coefficient of pan evaporation i e kp 1 00 a is the plot area m2 et value was estimated using the measured swc by a water balance method described by allen et al 1998 the equation can be written as et i p δswc dp rf where et is evapotranspiration mm i is the amount of irrigation water mm p is the precipitation mm δswc is the change in the soil water content in the 90 cm soil profiles mm dp is the deep percolation mm and rf is amount of runoff mm since the amount of irrigation water was controlled deep percolation and run off were assumed to be negligible wp and iwp values were estimated as peanut yield divided by total et and seasonal irrigation during the growing season hao et al 2015 2 5 3 the growth stages and leaf area index lai of peanut the time spent on harvesting and on the various phenological growth stages of peanut were noted according to the doorenbos and kassam 1986 the seeding date was assigned as 0 days after sowing das besides the leaf area of peanut plants were measured through the growing season to harvesting period by using an optical leaf area meter in both years 2 5 4 identification and evaluation of diseases plants were observed and recorded monthly after planting in terms of wilting symptoms of root rot were evaluated before harvest thirty plants from each parcel applied in different irrigation regimes before harvesting were uprooted and they were examined for root diseases the number of plants showing symptoms of wilt and root rot was evaluated together causal agents were determined by isolation from these plants and pathogenecity tests were done xu et al 2015 2 5 5 statistical analysis a split plot randomized complete block variance analysis was performed for each experimental year on the recorded data the software program sas statistical analysis system v9 0 was used the mean values were compared at a significance level of p 0 05 using least significant differences method lsd snedecor and cochran 1989 3 results and discussion 3 1 lai and growth stages of peanut the values of lai under different irrigation treatments in 2014 and 2015 growing seasons are presented in fig 1 a f the results clearly indicate that water stress brings about a reduction in lai the highest lais of 4 6 and 4 1 was measured in if2wl4 at the flowering stage on das 85 in 2014 and in 2015 the minimum lais 1 8 and 2 3 were recorded in if1wl1 treatment on dap 78 and dap 84 the similar findings was also observed by the following researchers davis and mack 1991 reported maximum lai of peanut 4 5 in heasland alabama nautiyal et al 2000 found that maximum lai of 3 0 at junagadh in india olayinka and etejere 2015 determined that the maximum lai of peanut varieties samnut 10 and mk 373 varying between 4 6 and 4 9 in guinea savanna zone of nigeria the growth stages of peanut were determined based on visual observation recorded as number of days after sowing das in both years table 3 the dates of growth stages in if2wl4 treatment were 169 in 2014 and 154 days in 2015 çalışkan et al 2008 recorded the peanut growing season as 120 160 days in 2006 and 2007 gulluoglu et al 2018 reported the fluctions from 158 to 164 days in the period of peanut nc 7 variety growing season in the southern turkey 3 2 peanut yield the highest peanut yield almost 5300 kg ha 1 in 2014 was obtained in if2wl4 treatment which was followed by if1wl4 and if2wl7 treatments with 4910 and 4890 kg ha 1 the lowest peanut yield obtained from the if3wl1 treatment was 2700 kg ha 1 in that year in 2015 maximum peanut yield was obtained from the if2wl4 treatment plots as 4420 kg ha 1 and followed by if1wl4 and if2wl7 plots with peanut yields of 4330 and 4320 kg ha 1 respectively minimum peanut yield was acquired from the if3wl1 treatment with 1960 kg ha 1 in 2015 table 4 peanut yield decreased with the reductions in the irrigation depending on the irrigation frequency regimes and amounts the gradually increasing water stress at lower frequency irrigations induced considerable reductions in peanut yield in both years kheira 2009 demonstrated peanut yields varying between 2200 and 3700 kg ha 1 for deficit and full irrigation levels in egypt rowland et al 2012 reported average yields of peanut in all fifteen irrigation treatments varying between 4203 and 4147 kg ha 1 in 2005 and 2006 respectively the analysis of variance remarked that the effect of irrigation frequencies if and water levels wl were significant p 0 05 on total peanut yield in 2014 tables 5a and 5b and their interactions were significant p 0 05 on total peanut yield in 2015 table 4 means were classified by lsd test at 5 probability level lsd grouping show that if2 treatment was the first group and if1 in the second at 5 level of significance table 5a considering to the irrigation levels wl4 was in the initial group and wl1 in the last group in 2014 table 5b in the first group if2wl4 treatment and in the last group if3wl1 treatment were at 5 level of significance in 2015 the more the irrigation frequency increased if3 the more significantly peanut yields diminished the results of related studies on peanut suggest that water deficit brings about a reduction of fresh fruit yield jain et al 1997 aydinsakir et al 2016 the results of the current study indicated that while the prd treatments received the same amount of irrigation water with the di plots in both years the prd obtained remarkably higher peanut yield than the di treatments table 4 neverthless so far prd has not been studied in peanut under open field numerous studies have been conducted to analyze the effect of prd and di in terms of crop yield throughout the world similar results were obtained by kang et al 1998 liu et al 2006 shahnazari et al 2007 and sezen et al 2011 on different crops under semi arid and arid climatic conditions 3 3 soil water content swc the irrigation scheduling of peanut is essential for crop growth depending on the growth stage and the degree of water stress since it is effective for crop emergence flowering and yield formation the variations of swc during 2014 and 2015 for each if are shown in fig 2 a c fig 2d f respectively as shown in these figures treatment irrigations began on 6 june 2014 and 23 may 2015 the swc were between field capacity fc 395 mm and permanent wilting point pwp 240 mm for both seasons the significant differences in the swc among treatments from the establishment to the harvesting in both years were caused by the water level and the uptake of root water although prd and di received the equal volume of water along the experiment both regimes had different water uptake patterns in the high if1 and medium if2 irrigation frequencies swc keeped greater as compared to lower frequency if3 in both years the available swc in the if1wl3 if1wl4 and if1wl7 plots of the higher irrigation frequency and if2wl3 if2wl4 and if2wl7 treatment plots of the if2 irrigation frequency remained above 50 in most of the all growth stages of peanut during the 2014 and 2015 therefore the if2wl3 if2wl4 and if2wl7 treatments performed an appropriate soil water condition for peanut morever almost in all irrigation water levels during the lower irrigation frequency if3 available water fell below 50 in both years it is reported that during the total growing period of peanut an adequate water supply and comparatively moist soils is essential for high yields are required rao et al 1988 reddy and reddy 1993 however flowering and fruit filling periods of peanut are more responsive to water stress than early vegetative and late ripening periods howell et al 1980 jain et al 1997 the findings of related studies showed that less than 40 50 of depletion in soil water can be acceptable for higher yields doorenbos and kassam 1986 3 4 irrigation water amount i and evapotranspiration et table 4 shows the total amount of irrigation water and seasonal crop et for the experimental years in order to ensure uniform plant growth in plots after sowing 15 mm and 25 mm water was equally applied to all experimental plots in 2014 and 2015 respectively the first treatment irrigation started on june 06 2014 and in the second year on may 23 2015 after obtaining homogenous plant germination treatment irrigation in the first year was ended on september 28 2014 and in the second year on september 15 2015 the seasonal irrigation depths in 2014 varied between 406 and 993 mm according to the treatments while a total of 30 irrigation applications was administered in the if1 treatments the irrigation frequency remained between 4 7 days depending on the daily evaporation value a total of 15 irrigation applications were carried out in the if2 treatments while the irrigation frequency ranged from 8 to 12 days the largest irrigation frequency if3 had 10 irrigation applications while the irrigation frequency was between 12 16 days in 2015 the seasonal irrigation depths varied from 411 to 1059 mm a total of 32 irrigation applications were made in the if1 treatments while the irrigation frequency was between 4 6 days a total of 15 irrigation applications are carried out in the if2 treatments just like in 2014 while the irrigation frequency was between 6 10 days similar to the first year a total of 10 irrigation application was implemented to if3 treatments while the irrigation frequency ranged from 10 to 16 days kheira 2009 reported total irrigation of peanut varying between 567 and 640 mm in the east nile delta egypt the et by peanut varied from 570 mm in if3wl5 to 1032 mm in if1wl4 during 2014 and 516 mm in if2wl1 to 1067 mm in if3wl4 treatment plots during 2015 season table 4 et values increased as a result of increasing water level in each if wl1 wl2 and wl3 treatments at each if received the same volume of water but wl5 wl6 and wl7 showed a lower seasonal et values bandyopadhyay et al 2005 reported that mean seasonal et of peanut varied between 419 and 449 mm with 115 days long growing period in addition kheira 2009 evaulated the effect of different irrigation program of peanut and reported evapotranspiration of 488 mm under full irrigation conditions aydinsakir et al 2016 reported that mean seasonal et of peanut varied between 193 and 809 mm in west mediterranean part of turkey our results on et are in general agreement with the above mentioned research findings 3 5 water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp wp values were significantly influenced by year if and i level p 0 05 in both years table 4 the highest wp and iwp values were obtained if2wl5 treatments in both growing seasons however the iwp values decreased with increasing irrigation frequency with the same irrigation water levels wl bandyopadhyay et al 2005 found that wp values ranged from 0 48 to 0 60 kg m 3 for peanut grown during two cropping seasons in india aydinsakir et al 2016 reported that the wp varied from 0 5 to 0 75 kg m 3 and 0 5 to 0 8 kg m 3 in 2013 and 2014 respectively kheira 2009 reported wp values for deficit irrigated peanut in egypt varying between 0 45 and 0 61 kg m 3 our results are in agreement with above mentioned study results 3 6 relationships between evapotranspiration irrigation and seed yield of peanut and the seed yield response factor ky a relatively higher peanut yield in all three irrigation frequencies was obtained when the water amount was increased but the yields tended to decrease at higher irrigation frequency if3 during the 2014 and 2015 the significant linear relationships between applied irrigation water and yield of peanut was found at each if plots in 2014 and 2015 growing seasons fig 3 a b peanut yields were closely related to the seasonal et in both experimental years for all irrigation frequencies a significant linear regression between the crop et and yield of peanut was observed in 2014 and 2015 seasons fig 4 a b the superior and favorable relationships between seasonal et and peanut yield were also noticed in related studies idinoba et al 2008 and kheira 2009 seasonal values of the peanut yield response factor ky for all irrigation frequencies if1 if2 an if3 for each experimental year were determined by stewart method doorenbos and kassam 1986 the ky the slope of the relative et deficit versus relative yield reduction is given in fig 5 a b the ky was 0 58 0 65 in if1 0 65 0 70 in if2 and 0 90 0 91 in if3 treatments in 2014 and 2015 growing seasons these results are in agreement with doorenbos and kassam 1986 in the literatures ky value was examined for different crops doorenbos and kassam 1986 indicated that ky value is 0 74 for peanut if ky is smaller than 1 it is more tolerant to water deficit conditions on the contrary kheira 2009 reported remarkably higher ky value from 2 5 to 3 5 respectively of deficit irrigated peanut in east nile delta egypt this difference with previous finding was due to the effect of the variation of different variety water management environment and climate condition therefore peanut can be assumed as tolerant to moderate water stress since ky values are lower than 1 0 3 7 evaluation of disease rates and pathogenicity fusarium oxysporum f solani and aspergillus niger fungi were isolated from infected plants and these fungi were determined as pathogen by pathogenecity tests all causal agents are seed and soil borne fusarium oxysporum f solani and aspergillus niger were shown to cause brown root rot in china which supplies 40 of peanut production in the world xu et al 2015 some othe studies also reported similar results in that peanut root rot caused by fusarium solani in indonesia and fusarium oxysporum f solani f equiseti and a niger fungi in israel joffe 1973 widodo and budiarti 2009 the disease rates determined for each irrigation frequency and irrigation water level are presented in table 6a and 6b typical symptoms of peanut disease were found on roots collar region stem and branches of infected plants when irrigation frequencies in both experiment years were analysed disease rates were found to be in the lowest level in if1 treatments and extended irrigation frequencies resulted in higher disease rates table 6a in if2 irrigation frequency low disease rates were obtained in both years irrigation water levels resulted in significantly different disease rates table 6b the highest disease rates were recorded in the wl1 in both years greater water stress increased disease rates for all irrigation frequencies high yield and low disease rate were characteristic of the wl4 treatment high temperature and extreme fluctuation in soil moisture were correlated with disease incidence and both factors were less detrimental in no water stress conditions frank and ben yephet 1997 melouk and damicone 1997 disease symptoms and disease rate appeared earlier in water stresses plants the lack of soil water affects plant development more than pathogen it is known that fusarium fungi can grow in dry soil jorge silva et al 1989 in a study investigating the effects of water stress and f oxysporum f sp lycopersici on the development of tomato plants it has been reported that disease symptoms have appeared earlier in plants with water stress ghaemi et al 2010 in our study peanut root rot disease rate was related to high temperature and lack of irrigation level plants with water stress increased disease rate it is suggested that supplementation of soil by organic matter good drainage seed treatments are key factors to avoid losses caused by disease 4 conclusions the present research evaluated the influence of irrigation frequency and its mutual with irrigation water levels on soil water content peanut yield wp iwp the disease rate and severity of root rot during 2014 and 2015 growing seasons in the east mediterranean of turkey the results showed that the if2wl4 treatment in both growing seasons provided the highest harvested yield of peanut the management of irrigation showed noteworthy effects on peanut yield p 0 05 prd method appears a eligible and favourable selection for peanut compared with traditonal deficit irrigation to avoid higher yield losts although peanut yield was decreased by mean of 7 7 and 2 2 as compared to if2wl4 in 2014 and 2015 respectively though the if2wl7 treatment received about 19 7 and 19 5 less water amount than if2wl4 plot prd treatments wl5 and wl6 have remarkable improved peanut yield than di treatments wl1 and wl2 in both years even if these treatments received the equal volume of water volume for all if if1 if2 and if3 conditions the findings also shed light on the guidelines of irrigation application for peanut producers in the east mediterranean region through the use of crop development models according to the 2 year results we can conclude that the yield of peanut in the semi arid areas of eastern mediterranean of turkey can be sustained or devoloped with regulated decreased amounts of irrigation without compromise productivity as the irrigation frequency increases the root rot in the peanut plant increased for both seasons since water stress negatively affects plant metabolism plants are predisposed to infection by pathogens the results also supported that the importance of irrigation frequencies and irrigation water levels to achieve higher yields of peanut in drip irrigation management under the east mediterranean climatic conditions in turkey yield and wp might differ when the same volume of water is applied under different irrigation frequencies due to the differences in swc the iwp values decreased with increasing if with the same wl values wp and iwp values were observed to have diminished with increment if lower wp and iwp were found in if1 and if3 irrigation frequencies compare with if2 frequency thus it is not suggested to use if1 and if3 for drip irrigated peanut growing in the east mediterranean part of turkey in conclusion the total amount of irrigation water of suggested treatment if2wl4 was 993 and 996 mm and seasonal water use of if2wl4 was 976 and 910 mm for two experimental years the number of irrigation applications in if2wl4 treatments was 15 times both experimental years and the irrigation frequencies changed from 8 to 12 days in 2014 and 6 10 days in 2015 in addition et of the peanut was below the amount of evaporation obtained from class a pan in the initial development period and late season thus lower irrigation water level wl3 1 0 values should be used instead of higher one wl4 1 25 in order for saving water greater wp iwp and water saving values were achieved from the if2wl7 regime in the experimental years under limited water conditions if2wl7 irrigation strategy is a suitable technique to improve both wp and iwp

10995,this study aimed at examining the effects of different irrigation regimes amount and frequency on yield water use water productivity wp irrigation water productivity iwp and disease rate of drip irrigated peanut arachis hypogaea during the 2014 and 2015 seasons in the eastern mediterranean region of turkey the treatments consisted of combinations of 3 irrigation frequencies if if1 25 mm if2

partial root drying prd treatments wl5 prd50 wl6 prd75 and wl7 prd100 treatments were considered they received 50 75 and 100 of wl3 treatment from alternate laterals respectively these 21 treatment combinations were arranged and analysed in a split plot design with 4 replications the main plots and subplots were established to irrigation frequencies if1 if2 and if3 and levels wl1 wl2 wl3 wl4 wl5 wl6 and wl7 both if and wl were observed to have significantly influenced peanut yields at 1 level in each of the experimental years the largest and the smallest average peanut yields were acquired from the if2wl4 and if3wl1 treatments respectively results indicated that peanut crops under prd produced higher than those under deficit irrigation upon usage of the same volume of water amount significant linear relationships between irrigation yield and evapotranspiration yield were obtained during different irrigation frequencies in each season the yield response factor ky was 0 58 0 65 in if1 0 65 0 70 in if2 and 0 90 0 91 in if3 plots in both years water stress raised the disease emergence in peanut markedly in the experimental years the wp and iwp of prd peanut were significantly greater than full irrigation and deficit irrigation di treatments in both growing seasons which demonstrated that limiting water did not reduce wp values we conclude that di treatments resulted in importantly lower wp p 0 05 than prd treatments in both years in spite of applying the same volume of water keywords peanut water productivity yield response factor irrigation frequency leaf area index root rot 1 introduction the constant and rapid increase in the population of the country lead to an increase in nutrition clothing and living requirements of the people the human needs increase numerically in parallel with the increasing population on one side and such needs become even more together with the changes in the living standards brought by the technological developments considering the fact that the available water resources are limited in the mediterranean region and the increase in the pressure on usage of such resources by other sectors domestic urban and industrial and that irrigation is the biggest consumer of the water resources on earth it is inevitable to use the water efficiently sezen et al 2017 usage of pressurized irrigation systems which save water and energy minimize water losses relatively pollute the environment less and lead to increase in product yield and quality will lead to usage of the country s water resources in a more efficient way and decrease the above mentioned pressures peanut arachis hypogaea l is a major industrial and food crops in turkey as in many parts of the world it is grown both for the domestic and export marketing the average number of world annual peanut production was 43 9 million tons per year in 2016 37 1 of world peanut production was provided from china 15 5 from india 8 1 from nigeria and 5 6 from the united states turkey produces only 0 3 of world peanut production faostat 2018 the total production of peanut was 165 130 tons in turkey in 2016 according to the data in 2016 87 5 of peanut production in turkey is in the east mediterranean part of turkey tuik 2018 the east mediterranean region in turkey is known to have a semi arid zone where most of the limited annual rainfall and uneven distribution occur from may to october during the main growing season water scarcity is one of the most important factors affecting yield in the eastern mediterranean region of turkey sezen et al 2017 thus supplementary irrigation is required throught the growing period to ensure and improve plant development and yield of peanut in turkey generally traditional surface irrigation methods are used to irrigate peanut almost flood the entire soil surface without considering the actual consumptive requirements of the peanut these practices have created such problems as waterlogging and salinity which result in a waste of water and reduction in sufficient irrigation therefore drip irrigation is eligible to the less satisfactory traditional surface methods peanut instead of yield is affected by irregular distribution of rainfall in seasons and other biotic factors under rainfed conditions water management of peanut highly is important at all growth stages for optimum production rao et al 1988 meisner and karnok 1992 however some authors reported that the response of peanut to water stress during different development periods of crop is not equally sensitive flowering and pod filling periods are more reactive to water stress than early vegetative and late ripening stages howell et al 1980 doorenbos and kassam 1986 many studies confirm that irrigation scheduling aims at optimization of irrigation management minimizing water use increasing water productivity and raving economic returns while maintaining production optimizing irrigation schedule means achieving the best balance of high crop yield by increasing the marginal utility generated per unit of water and water saving under limited irrigation conditions above all it seems very important to provide the best desicion when stress is applied fereres and soriano 2007 nowadays full irrigation fi is considered a luxury use of water that can be reduced with minor or no effect on profitable yield kang and zhang 2004 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 both di and prd strategies must be developed for improved water saving prd can concluded higher water productivity reduced crop water use and water savings on different crops compared to fi e g zegbe et al 2004 geerts and raes 2009 wang et al 2009 jovanovic et al 2010 perry 2011 topak et al 2016 also experimental results show that crops under prd yield better than under di when the same volume of water is applied kriedmann and goodwin 2003 liu et al 2006 leib et al 2006 sezen et al 2011 2014 additionally irrigation frequency if is one of the most prominent factors in drip irrigation management due to the soil water pattern and water percolation under the root zone wang et al 2006 in peanut little information is available on the impacts of irrigation on root rot and almost nothing is known about how the disease is affected by different irrigation frequencies if and irrigation water levels wl using prd and di regimes in drip irrigation systems therefore the objectives of the present research were to i examine the influence of drip irrigation frequency and its mutual with irrigation water levels on soil water content peanut yield wp iwp the disease rate and severity of root rot to improve the best management drip irrigation system for high peanut yield and wp in the east mediterranean region of turkey ii compare fi di and prd practices for their effects on water relations growth yield of peanut 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and climate the present experiment was carried out at the soil and water resources unit of alata horticultural research station tarsus turkey which is located around the point of 37 01 n latitude and 35 01 e longitude and altitude 60 0 m table 1 displays the some of climatic variables including temperatures evaporation relative humidity and rainfall for the two years of experiment the east mediterranean region has semi arid climate the rainfall received in the first and second growing seasons were 117 and 103 mm which was 77 0 and 80 0 of the long term rainfall respectively table 1 2 2 experimental soil and water property some properties of the experimental soil are listed in table 2 the values of the measured field water capacity at site varied between 29 46 to 32 08 g g 1 and wilting point increased from 15 81 to 19 83 g g 1 on a dry weight basis the soil included high ratios of sand 32 5 43 6 followed by clay 28 5 37 0 and silt 27 9 32 6 and it could be categorized as clay loam the dry soil bulk densities ranged from 1 38 to 1 58 g cm 3 along the 0 90 m profiles the available water in the 0 90 m of soil depth was 155 mm we used water for experimental area from an open channel whose quality was classified as c2s1 by ussl 1954 ph is 7 2 8 2 and mean electrical conductivity ec varied between 0 39 ds m 1 and 0 63 ds m 1 which is acceptable for the peanut 2 3 treatments and experimental methods the experiment was laid out in a split plot design with 3 irrigation frequencies as the main treatments based on different levels of cpe values if1 25 mm if2 50 mm if3 75 mm of cpe and 7 irrigation water levels wl1 0 50 wl2 0 75 wl3 1 00 wl4 1 25 wl5 prd50 wl6 prd75 and wl7 prd100 treatments as the sub treatments with 4 replications prd plots received 50 75 and 100 of the wl3 treatment from alternate laterals respectively class a pan is located at the meteorological station next to the experimental plots daily water level changes in the class a pan were measured with an micrometer system the irrigation water levels wl were evaluated as plant pan coefficients kcp1 0 50 kcp2 0 75 kcp3 1 00 and kcp4 1 25 each sub plot was 10 m long and 5 rows in width in the control unit a pressure gauge and flow meter were installed to measure operating pressure and water depth for drip irrigation of the wl1 wl2 wl3 and wl4 treatments laterals were used in each plant row and inline dripper 4 l h 1 spaced at 25 cm apart along the line in the prd plots two drip lines were located 20 cm from each side of the plant row for the wl5 wl6 and wl7 the irrigation management was that one supplied the water for one irrigation and the other for the following irrigation 2 4 agronomic practices the seedbed preparation involved deep plowing disking and loosening of the soil a combined driller was used to facilitate concurrent application of fertilizer and seeds peanut nc 7 arachis hypogaea type which is a virginia type peanut variety having larger seeds than many others and which has become a dominant type in the east mediterranean part of turkey was used crops were planted on may 20 2014 and may 08 2015 setting of the driller was 90 kg of seed per hectare at 5 cm soil depth in rows 0 70 m apart and 0 20 m between plant final plant densities after crop establishment were 7 plants m 2 in both years a compound fertilizer of 18 n 46 p2o5 0 k2o was used at a rate of 200 kg ha 1 during planting the remaining n of 400 kg ha 1 was applied as ammonium nitrate 33 n during flowering the harvest was carried out by manually collecting 6 m portions of three adjacent central rows at each subplot on november 06 2014 and october 09 2015 2 5 measurements and observations 2 5 1 soil water content swc the swc was measured before irrigation by a neutron probe hydroprobe model 503 and gravimetric method samples were taken using soil auger at 0 3 m layer increments up to 0 9 m in soil depth the four replications were taken per treatment until harvest in both growing seasons 2 5 2 evapotranspiration et water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp the amount of irrigation water i was calculated by using the equation given below i cpe p kcp a where i is irrigation water amount l cpe is the cumulative pan evaporation mm and p is the percentage of wetted area taken as 100 for row crops wl is the irrigation water levels 0 50 0 75 1 0 and 1 25 the values of wl evaluated as plant pan coefficients kcp1 0 50 kcp2 0 75 kcp3 1 00 and kcp4 1 25 kp is the coefficient of pan evaporation i e kp 1 00 a is the plot area m2 et value was estimated using the measured swc by a water balance method described by allen et al 1998 the equation can be written as et i p δswc dp rf where et is evapotranspiration mm i is the amount of irrigation water mm p is the precipitation mm δswc is the change in the soil water content in the 90 cm soil profiles mm dp is the deep percolation mm and rf is amount of runoff mm since the amount of irrigation water was controlled deep percolation and run off were assumed to be negligible wp and iwp values were estimated as peanut yield divided by total et and seasonal irrigation during the growing season hao et al 2015 2 5 3 the growth stages and leaf area index lai of peanut the time spent on harvesting and on the various phenological growth stages of peanut were noted according to the doorenbos and kassam 1986 the seeding date was assigned as 0 days after sowing das besides the leaf area of peanut plants were measured through the growing season to harvesting period by using an optical leaf area meter in both years 2 5 4 identification and evaluation of diseases plants were observed and recorded monthly after planting in terms of wilting symptoms of root rot were evaluated before harvest thirty plants from each parcel applied in different irrigation regimes before harvesting were uprooted and they were examined for root diseases the number of plants showing symptoms of wilt and root rot was evaluated together causal agents were determined by isolation from these plants and pathogenecity tests were done xu et al 2015 2 5 5 statistical analysis a split plot randomized complete block variance analysis was performed for each experimental year on the recorded data the software program sas statistical analysis system v9 0 was used the mean values were compared at a significance level of p 0 05 using least significant differences method lsd snedecor and cochran 1989 3 results and discussion 3 1 lai and growth stages of peanut the values of lai under different irrigation treatments in 2014 and 2015 growing seasons are presented in fig 1 a f the results clearly indicate that water stress brings about a reduction in lai the highest lais of 4 6 and 4 1 was measured in if2wl4 at the flowering stage on das 85 in 2014 and in 2015 the minimum lais 1 8 and 2 3 were recorded in if1wl1 treatment on dap 78 and dap 84 the similar findings was also observed by the following researchers davis and mack 1991 reported maximum lai of peanut 4 5 in heasland alabama nautiyal et al 2000 found that maximum lai of 3 0 at junagadh in india olayinka and etejere 2015 determined that the maximum lai of peanut varieties samnut 10 and mk 373 varying between 4 6 and 4 9 in guinea savanna zone of nigeria the growth stages of peanut were determined based on visual observation recorded as number of days after sowing das in both years table 3 the dates of growth stages in if2wl4 treatment were 169 in 2014 and 154 days in 2015 çalışkan et al 2008 recorded the peanut growing season as 120 160 days in 2006 and 2007 gulluoglu et al 2018 reported the fluctions from 158 to 164 days in the period of peanut nc 7 variety growing season in the southern turkey 3 2 peanut yield the highest peanut yield almost 5300 kg ha 1 in 2014 was obtained in if2wl4 treatment which was followed by if1wl4 and if2wl7 treatments with 4910 and 4890 kg ha 1 the lowest peanut yield obtained from the if3wl1 treatment was 2700 kg ha 1 in that year in 2015 maximum peanut yield was obtained from the if2wl4 treatment plots as 4420 kg ha 1 and followed by if1wl4 and if2wl7 plots with peanut yields of 4330 and 4320 kg ha 1 respectively minimum peanut yield was acquired from the if3wl1 treatment with 1960 kg ha 1 in 2015 table 4 peanut yield decreased with the reductions in the irrigation depending on the irrigation frequency regimes and amounts the gradually increasing water stress at lower frequency irrigations induced considerable reductions in peanut yield in both years kheira 2009 demonstrated peanut yields varying between 2200 and 3700 kg ha 1 for deficit and full irrigation levels in egypt rowland et al 2012 reported average yields of peanut in all fifteen irrigation treatments varying between 4203 and 4147 kg ha 1 in 2005 and 2006 respectively the analysis of variance remarked that the effect of irrigation frequencies if and water levels wl were significant p 0 05 on total peanut yield in 2014 tables 5a and 5b and their interactions were significant p 0 05 on total peanut yield in 2015 table 4 means were classified by lsd test at 5 probability level lsd grouping show that if2 treatment was the first group and if1 in the second at 5 level of significance table 5a considering to the irrigation levels wl4 was in the initial group and wl1 in the last group in 2014 table 5b in the first group if2wl4 treatment and in the last group if3wl1 treatment were at 5 level of significance in 2015 the more the irrigation frequency increased if3 the more significantly peanut yields diminished the results of related studies on peanut suggest that water deficit brings about a reduction of fresh fruit yield jain et al 1997 aydinsakir et al 2016 the results of the current study indicated that while the prd treatments received the same amount of irrigation water with the di plots in both years the prd obtained remarkably higher peanut yield than the di treatments table 4 neverthless so far prd has not been studied in peanut under open field numerous studies have been conducted to analyze the effect of prd and di in terms of crop yield throughout the world similar results were obtained by kang et al 1998 liu et al 2006 shahnazari et al 2007 and sezen et al 2011 on different crops under semi arid and arid climatic conditions 3 3 soil water content swc the irrigation scheduling of peanut is essential for crop growth depending on the growth stage and the degree of water stress since it is effective for crop emergence flowering and yield formation the variations of swc during 2014 and 2015 for each if are shown in fig 2 a c fig 2d f respectively as shown in these figures treatment irrigations began on 6 june 2014 and 23 may 2015 the swc were between field capacity fc 395 mm and permanent wilting point pwp 240 mm for both seasons the significant differences in the swc among treatments from the establishment to the harvesting in both years were caused by the water level and the uptake of root water although prd and di received the equal volume of water along the experiment both regimes had different water uptake patterns in the high if1 and medium if2 irrigation frequencies swc keeped greater as compared to lower frequency if3 in both years the available swc in the if1wl3 if1wl4 and if1wl7 plots of the higher irrigation frequency and if2wl3 if2wl4 and if2wl7 treatment plots of the if2 irrigation frequency remained above 50 in most of the all growth stages of peanut during the 2014 and 2015 therefore the if2wl3 if2wl4 and if2wl7 treatments performed an appropriate soil water condition for peanut morever almost in all irrigation water levels during the lower irrigation frequency if3 available water fell below 50 in both years it is reported that during the total growing period of peanut an adequate water supply and comparatively moist soils is essential for high yields are required rao et al 1988 reddy and reddy 1993 however flowering and fruit filling periods of peanut are more responsive to water stress than early vegetative and late ripening periods howell et al 1980 jain et al 1997 the findings of related studies showed that less than 40 50 of depletion in soil water can be acceptable for higher yields doorenbos and kassam 1986 3 4 irrigation water amount i and evapotranspiration et table 4 shows the total amount of irrigation water and seasonal crop et for the experimental years in order to ensure uniform plant growth in plots after sowing 15 mm and 25 mm water was equally applied to all experimental plots in 2014 and 2015 respectively the first treatment irrigation started on june 06 2014 and in the second year on may 23 2015 after obtaining homogenous plant germination treatment irrigation in the first year was ended on september 28 2014 and in the second year on september 15 2015 the seasonal irrigation depths in 2014 varied between 406 and 993 mm according to the treatments while a total of 30 irrigation applications was administered in the if1 treatments the irrigation frequency remained between 4 7 days depending on the daily evaporation value a total of 15 irrigation applications were carried out in the if2 treatments while the irrigation frequency ranged from 8 to 12 days the largest irrigation frequency if3 had 10 irrigation applications while the irrigation frequency was between 12 16 days in 2015 the seasonal irrigation depths varied from 411 to 1059 mm a total of 32 irrigation applications were made in the if1 treatments while the irrigation frequency was between 4 6 days a total of 15 irrigation applications are carried out in the if2 treatments just like in 2014 while the irrigation frequency was between 6 10 days similar to the first year a total of 10 irrigation application was implemented to if3 treatments while the irrigation frequency ranged from 10 to 16 days kheira 2009 reported total irrigation of peanut varying between 567 and 640 mm in the east nile delta egypt the et by peanut varied from 570 mm in if3wl5 to 1032 mm in if1wl4 during 2014 and 516 mm in if2wl1 to 1067 mm in if3wl4 treatment plots during 2015 season table 4 et values increased as a result of increasing water level in each if wl1 wl2 and wl3 treatments at each if received the same volume of water but wl5 wl6 and wl7 showed a lower seasonal et values bandyopadhyay et al 2005 reported that mean seasonal et of peanut varied between 419 and 449 mm with 115 days long growing period in addition kheira 2009 evaulated the effect of different irrigation program of peanut and reported evapotranspiration of 488 mm under full irrigation conditions aydinsakir et al 2016 reported that mean seasonal et of peanut varied between 193 and 809 mm in west mediterranean part of turkey our results on et are in general agreement with the above mentioned research findings 3 5 water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp wp values were significantly influenced by year if and i level p 0 05 in both years table 4 the highest wp and iwp values were obtained if2wl5 treatments in both growing seasons however the iwp values decreased with increasing irrigation frequency with the same irrigation water levels wl bandyopadhyay et al 2005 found that wp values ranged from 0 48 to 0 60 kg m 3 for peanut grown during two cropping seasons in india aydinsakir et al 2016 reported that the wp varied from 0 5 to 0 75 kg m 3 and 0 5 to 0 8 kg m 3 in 2013 and 2014 respectively kheira 2009 reported wp values for deficit irrigated peanut in egypt varying between 0 45 and 0 61 kg m 3 our results are in agreement with above mentioned study results 3 6 relationships between evapotranspiration irrigation and seed yield of peanut and the seed yield response factor ky a relatively higher peanut yield in all three irrigation frequencies was obtained when the water amount was increased but the yields tended to decrease at higher irrigation frequency if3 during the 2014 and 2015 the significant linear relationships between applied irrigation water and yield of peanut was found at each if plots in 2014 and 2015 growing seasons fig 3 a b peanut yields were closely related to the seasonal et in both experimental years for all irrigation frequencies a significant linear regression between the crop et and yield of peanut was observed in 2014 and 2015 seasons fig 4 a b the superior and favorable relationships between seasonal et and peanut yield were also noticed in related studies idinoba et al 2008 and kheira 2009 seasonal values of the peanut yield response factor ky for all irrigation frequencies if1 if2 an if3 for each experimental year were determined by stewart method doorenbos and kassam 1986 the ky the slope of the relative et deficit versus relative yield reduction is given in fig 5 a b the ky was 0 58 0 65 in if1 0 65 0 70 in if2 and 0 90 0 91 in if3 treatments in 2014 and 2015 growing seasons these results are in agreement with doorenbos and kassam 1986 in the literatures ky value was examined for different crops doorenbos and kassam 1986 indicated that ky value is 0 74 for peanut if ky is smaller than 1 it is more tolerant to water deficit conditions on the contrary kheira 2009 reported remarkably higher ky value from 2 5 to 3 5 respectively of deficit irrigated peanut in east nile delta egypt this difference with previous finding was due to the effect of the variation of different variety water management environment and climate condition therefore peanut can be assumed as tolerant to moderate water stress since ky values are lower than 1 0 3 7 evaluation of disease rates and pathogenicity fusarium oxysporum f solani and aspergillus niger fungi were isolated from infected plants and these fungi were determined as pathogen by pathogenecity tests all causal agents are seed and soil borne fusarium oxysporum f solani and aspergillus niger were shown to cause brown root rot in china which supplies 40 of peanut production in the world xu et al 2015 some othe studies also reported similar results in that peanut root rot caused by fusarium solani in indonesia and fusarium oxysporum f solani f equiseti and a niger fungi in israel joffe 1973 widodo and budiarti 2009 the disease rates determined for each irrigation frequency and irrigation water level are presented in table 6a and 6b typical symptoms of peanut disease were found on roots collar region stem and branches of infected plants when irrigation frequencies in both experiment years were analysed disease rates were found to be in the lowest level in if1 treatments and extended irrigation frequencies resulted in higher disease rates table 6a in if2 irrigation frequency low disease rates were obtained in both years irrigation water levels resulted in significantly different disease rates table 6b the highest disease rates were recorded in the wl1 in both years greater water stress increased disease rates for all irrigation frequencies high yield and low disease rate were characteristic of the wl4 treatment high temperature and extreme fluctuation in soil moisture were correlated with disease incidence and both factors were less detrimental in no water stress conditions frank and ben yephet 1997 melouk and damicone 1997 disease symptoms and disease rate appeared earlier in water stresses plants the lack of soil water affects plant development more than pathogen it is known that fusarium fungi can grow in dry soil jorge silva et al 1989 in a study investigating the effects of water stress and f oxysporum f sp lycopersici on the development of tomato plants it has been reported that disease symptoms have appeared earlier in plants with water stress ghaemi et al 2010 in our study peanut root rot disease rate was related to high temperature and lack of irrigation level plants with water stress increased disease rate it is suggested that supplementation of soil by organic matter good drainage seed treatments are key factors to avoid losses caused by disease 4 conclusions the present research evaluated the influence of irrigation frequency and its mutual with irrigation water levels on soil water content peanut yield wp iwp the disease rate and severity of root rot during 2014 and 2015 growing seasons in the east mediterranean of turkey the results showed that the if2wl4 treatment in both growing seasons provided the highest harvested yield of peanut the management of irrigation showed noteworthy effects on peanut yield p 0 05 prd method appears a eligible and favourable selection for peanut compared with traditonal deficit irrigation to avoid higher yield losts although peanut yield was decreased by mean of 7 7 and 2 2 as compared to if2wl4 in 2014 and 2015 respectively though the if2wl7 treatment received about 19 7 and 19 5 less water amount than if2wl4 plot prd treatments wl5 and wl6 have remarkable improved peanut yield than di treatments wl1 and wl2 in both years even if these treatments received the equal volume of water volume for all if if1 if2 and if3 conditions the findings also shed light on the guidelines of irrigation application for peanut producers in the east mediterranean region through the use of crop development models according to the 2 year results we can conclude that the yield of peanut in the semi arid areas of eastern mediterranean of turkey can be sustained or devoloped with regulated decreased amounts of irrigation without compromise productivity as the irrigation frequency increases the root rot in the peanut plant increased for both seasons since water stress negatively affects plant metabolism plants are predisposed to infection by pathogens the results also supported that the importance of irrigation frequencies and irrigation water levels to achieve higher yields of peanut in drip irrigation management under the east mediterranean climatic conditions in turkey yield and wp might differ when the same volume of water is applied under different irrigation frequencies due to the differences in swc the iwp values decreased with increasing if with the same wl values wp and iwp values were observed to have diminished with increment if lower wp and iwp were found in if1 and if3 irrigation frequencies compare with if2 frequency thus it is not suggested to use if1 and if3 for drip irrigated peanut growing in the east mediterranean part of turkey in conclusion the total amount of irrigation water of suggested treatment if2wl4 was 993 and 996 mm and seasonal water use of if2wl4 was 976 and 910 mm for two experimental years the number of irrigation applications in if2wl4 treatments was 15 times both experimental years and the irrigation frequencies changed from 8 to 12 days in 2014 and 6 10 days in 2015 in addition et of the peanut was below the amount of evaporation obtained from class a pan in the initial development period and late season thus lower irrigation water level wl3 1 0 values should be used instead of higher one wl4 1 25 in order for saving water greater wp iwp and water saving values were achieved from the if2wl7 regime in the experimental years under limited water conditions if2wl7 irrigation strategy is a suitable technique to improve both wp and iwp

10996,accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration et 0 is very important in hydrological cycle research and is essential in agricultural water management and allocation the application of the standard model fao 56 penman monteith to estimate et 0 is restricted due to the absence of required meteorological data although many machine learning algorithms have been applied in modeling et 0 with fewer meteorological variables most of the models are trained and tested using data from the same station their performances outside the training station are not evaluated this study aims to investigate generalization ability of the random forest rf algorithm in modeling et 0 with different input combinations refer to different circumstances in missing data and compares this algorithm with the gene expression programming gep method using the data from 24 weather stations in a karst region of southwest china the et 0 estimated by the fao 56 penman monteith model was used as a reference to evaluate the derived rf based and gep based models and the coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe coefficiency of efficiency nsce root of mean squared error rmse and percent bias pbias were used as evaluation criteria the results revealed that the derived rf based generalization et 0 models are successfully applied in modeling et 0 with complete and incomplete meteorological variables r 2 nsce rmse and pbias ranged from 0 637 to 0 987 0 626 to 0 986 0 107 to 0 563 mm day 1 and 2 916 to 1 571 respectively and seven rf based models corresponding to different incomplete data circumstances are proposed the gep based generalization et 0 models are also proposed and they produced promising results r 2 nsce rmse and pbias ranged from 0 639 to 0 944 0 636 to 0 942 0 222 to 0 555 mm day 1 and 1 98 to 0 248 respectively although the rf based et 0 models performed slightly better than the gep based models the gep approach has the ability to give explicit expressions between the dependent and independent variables which is more convenient for irrigators with minimal computer skills therefore we recommend applying the rf based models in water balance research and the gep based models in agricultural irrigation practice moreover the models performance decreased with periods due to climate change impact on et 0 at last both of the two methods have the ability to assess the importance of predictors the order of the importance of meteorological variables on et 0 in guangxi is sunshine duration air temperature relative humidity and wind speed keywords water resources climate change impact variable importance karst region 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is an important branch of the hydrologic cycle traore and guven 2013 as more than 60 of total global precipitation is dissipated by it falamarzi et al 2014 accurate observation of actual et is important in the design of irrigation schedules water resource management and water allocation wang et al 2015 although et can be monitored directly by using a lysimeter allen et al 2011 or a method for the transfer of the energy balance and water vapor mass shiri et al 2014b these measurements are laborious time consuming and expensive shiri et al 2014b moreover the measurements are limited in time and space falamarzi et al 2014 alternatively et can be estimated by a reference evapotranspiration et 0 multiplied by a crop coefficient which is the most extensive approach recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao allen et al 1998 wang et al 2015 rahimikhoob 2016 the empirical crop coefficient k c defined as the ratio of actual crop et to the reference crop et is determined predominantly using specific crop characteristics and only a small percentage with environmental conditions allen et al 1998 for example the k c values of hops were 0 69 1 02 and 0 85 in at initial mid season and end season periods respectively fandio et al 2015 k c values of approximately 80 crops are available on the fao s website therefore precisely calculating et 0 is essential for accurately estimating et rahimikhoob 2016 et 0 is the rate of et of a hypothesized grass with adequate water supply albedo 0 23 height 0 12 and surface resistance 70 s m and represents the maximum atmospheric evaporative power at a given time and location regardless of crop type and soil characteristics allen et al 1998 shiri et al 2012 feng et al 2016 allen et al 1998 stressed that et 0 is influenced only by meteorological factors therefore many methods have been proposed to estimate et 0 from climatic data in these methods the fao 56 penman monteith fao pm is a physical approach proposed based on the theories of aerodynamics and energy balance this approach has been recommended as the standard method by the fao and is used to calibrate other et 0 methods allen et al 1998 shiri et al 2012 the method has two important advantages 1 it can be applied to different geographic and climatic zones without local calibration because of its theoretical basis and the results have been proven to be more consistent with the observation data than other methods 2 it has been validated using lysimeters worldwide kumar et al 2008 shiri et al 2012 wang et al 2015 the main drawback of the fao pm is that it requires a full set of meteorological factors including air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed and high quality data kim and kim 2008a kumar et al 2009 furthermore the computation procedure is complicated for irrigation technicians who typically are not sophisticated computer users traore and guven 2013 however weather stations that satisfy the requirements of observations are limited especially in developing countries wang et al 2015 shiri et al 2014b 2012 air temperature sensors are generally available in most weather stations worldwide whereas sensors for observing other meteorological factors are found in relatively fewer stations and the quality of data is not always reliable shiri et al 2012 droogers and allen 2002 therefore there is a need to develop simpler et 0 models that use fewer meteorological variables and have adequate precision empirical et 0 models using smaller amounts of climatic data have also been widely used as a substitute for fao pm the hargreaves samani equation is superior to others as it requires only the maximum and minimum air temperatures hargreaves 1982 and provides the most accurate global average performance almorox et al 2015 it was therefore employed in this study et 0 can be recognized as a function of several meteorological variables with the advancement in computational resources and the emergence of big data some machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to estimate et 0 such as artificial neural networks ann kumar et al 2002 kim and kim 2008b shiri et al 2014a genetic programming gp izadifar and elshorbagy 2010 kisi and guven 2010 support vector machine svm tabari et al 2012 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis shiri et al 2012 tabari et al 2012 extreme learning machine elm feng et al 2016 abdullah et al 2015 and gene expression programming gep shiri et al 2012 2014c wang et al 2015 unlike other machine learning approaches that produce black box models the gep has the ability to provide explicit expressions between dependent and independent variables a powerful advantage for practical applications and transferability traore and guven 2013 shiri et al 2014c thus it was applied in this study at present the major deficiency in research on machine learning based et 0 estimation models is that these models are trained and tested using climatic data at the same station and their applicability is not validated beyond the training stations therefore although the proposed models have adequate accuracy as has been reported abdullah et al 2015 kim and kim 2008b kumar et al 2008 traore and guven 2011 they may be useful only in the training stations and their effectiveness is otherwise doubtful moreover it is impossible to develop et 0 models for each locations one effective way is to develop generalized et 0 models using fewer meteorological variables but few studies have considered this shiri et al 2014c kisi 2016 beyond this no research has tested whether machine learning based et 0 models are applicable in the context of climate change which has an important impact on water resource management allen et al 1998 wang et al 2015 the random forest rf method which is an ensemble learning method for classification and regression has become popular in recent years because of its robust performance across a wide range of datasets high prediction accuracy limited number of user defined parameters and ability to avoid overfitting jing et al 2015 it can also estimate the relative importance of variables fern et al 2014 conducted an exhaustive evaluation of 179 classifiers arising from 17 families discriminant analysis bayesian ann svm decision trees rule based classifiers boosting bagging stacking random forests generalized linear models nearest neighbors partial least squares principal component regression logistic and multinomial regression and multiple adaptive regression splines over 121 datasets and concluded that the rf delivers the best performance overall rf has been successfully applied to many areas guangxi located in southwest china has one of the largest continuous karst landforms in the world although this region has a subtropical mountainous monsoon climate with a large amount of annual precipitation more than 1200 mm the karst habitat is deficient in water resources for vegetation growth because there are a large number of fissures gaps channels and sinkholes thus these karst systems have an ineffective water storage capacity chen et al 2009 2010 furthermore drought occurs more frequently liu et al 2014 found that southwestern china has generally become drier in relation to global climate change and that regional mean annual precipitation has decreased by 11 4 mm per decade it is therefore acknowledged that accurate et 0 estimation is important for water resource allocation and management for agriculture in this region the objectives of the study are 1 to demonstrate the applicability of rf and gep in estimating et 0 2 to develop and compare the performance of the generalized rf based and gep based et 0 estimation models in guangxi with different meteorological variables used as input and evaluate the applicability of the models in the context of climate change and 3 to identify the contribution rank of each climatic factor in et 0 estimation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data collection guangxi is located in the pearl river basin of southwest china between 20 54 26 23 n and 104 29 112 04 e and covers approximately 236 700 km2 accounting for 2 47 of china s total territory the carbonate area takes up approximately 37 8 of the province the territory tilts from northwest to southeast and has a hilly mountain terrain the region has a tropical and subtropical humid climate with an average annual temperature of 17 23 c and annual precipitation of 1080 2760 mm fig 1 shows the geographical locations of the study area and the distribution of 24 meteorological stations in it a summary of the stations is listed in table 1 daily climatic data from the 24 meteorological stations recorded from 2010 to 2014 containing the maximum and minimum air temperature c wind speed at a height of 2 m m s relative humidity and duration of sunshine hours were acquired from the national climatic centre of the china meteorological administration five years of daily meteorological data are sufficient to develop et 0 models because et 0 exhibits a smaller variation in comparison with other climate variables such as precipitation shiri et al 2012 based on our previous study wu et al 2017 the 24 stations were divided into two types according to landform karst 10 and non karst areas 14 six stations were then selected hechi laibin and pingguo from the karst area and wuzhou mengshan and dongxing from the non karst area to validate the models at the spatial scale the six stations were chosen because they typically represented the change in trend of et 0 no significant variation hechi and wuzhou significant increase pingguo and dongxing and significant decrease laibin and mengshan wu et al 2017 moreover according to long term data recorded at the six stations the validation can be used to examine the impact of climate change on the performance of the models the daily climatic data from the remaining 18 stations from 2010 to 2013 were used to train the rf and gep models and the remaining data 2014 were used for testing fifteen input combinations table 2 representing different scenarios where meteorological data were missing traore and guven 2013 were applied to establish the rf and gep models air temperature t a was generally available at most meteorological stations while the other parameters were found at fewer stations and the quality of the data was not always guaranteed therefore air temperatures t max and t min were introduced to all input combinations the 15 input combinations were divided into seven types type 1 rf1 was a temperature based univariate model type 2 rf2 rf3 and rf4 was a bivariate model with t a and rh in rf2 t a and u 2 in rf3 and t a and n in rf4 respectively type 3 gep5 gep6 and gep7 was a trivariate model in which rf5 used t a rh and u 2 rf6 used t a u 2 and n rf7 used t a rh and n type 4 rf8 type 5 rf9 rf10 and rf11 and type 6 rf12 rf13 and rf14 were formed by adding r a to types 1 2 and 3 respectively lastly type 7 rf15 used all the meteorological variables the input combinations in gep models were the same as rf models as shown in table 2 2 2 fao 56 penman monteith et 0 values estimated by the fao pm equation were used as the reference target values for developing and evaluating the rf based and gep based models kisi 2016 wang et al 2015 the fao pm equation is given as 1 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et 0 is reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 r n is net radiation at the crop surface mj m2 d g is the heat flux density of soil mj m2 d δ is slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve kpa c γ is the psychometric constant kpa c e s is saturation vapor pressure kpa e a is actual vapor pressure kpa u 2 is wind speed at a height of 2 m m s and t mean is mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c allen et al 1998 in this work due to a lack of radiation data r n was indirectly estimated based on the fao 56 procedure from duration of sunshine and location of the weather stations which was the difference between the incoming net shortwave and the net outgoing longwave radiation and g 0 for the day timescale moreover r a extraterrestrial radiation was estimated from the site latitude of the site and the day of the year 1 1 january and 365 or 366 31 december which represented the theoretical solar radiation used to estimate r n allen et al 1998 t mean was estimated by averaging t max and t min 2 3 hargreaves and samani equation the hargreaves samani equation hargreaves 1982 is the simplest method to estimate et 0 and was proposed in allen et al 1998 if only the air temperatures are variables 2 4 theory of random forest random forest rf is an ensemble learning method for classification regression and clustering it randomly creates a group of decision trees and forecasts the class that is the mode of classes classification or the mean regression of individual trees the following gives a brief description of the procedure for building an rf model a draw n tree bootstrap samples from the original data a bootstrap subset contains approximately 2 3 of the elements of the original dataset b for each bootstrap subset build an unpruned regression tree at each node rather than choosing the best split among all predictors randomly sample m try of the predictors and choose the best split from among those variables c predict new data by aggregating the predictions of the n tree trees majority votes for classification and average for regression in this study the r package randomforest developed by liaw and wiener liaw and wiener 2002 james et al 2013 was used for rf model training and testing this package needs only a few tunable parameters the number of trees n tree in the forest and the number of predictors in the random subset of each node m try in this study the default values of m try one third of all predictor variables was used as the creator of the rf algorithm in breiman 2001 which for most occasions is adequate to generate predictions of desirable accuracy n tree was built using an iterative evaluation and out of bag error mean squared error for regression problems was used during parameter optimization to yield the minimum error from fig 2 it is evident that the mean squared errors decreased with n tree and r 2 increased correspondingly in general there was a threshold of n tree beyond which increasing the number of trees induced no significant performance gain and only increased computational cost from the perspectives of accuracy and the computational burden n tree 1000 was used in this study as a tree based method it is convenient to evaluate the importance of the variables in the rf in this study it means distinguishing variables that best contributed to the predictive ability of et 0 the importance of variables was calculated by computing the reduction in prediction accuracy resulting from randomly permuting the values of a variable the greater the decreasing in prediction accuracy the more important the relevant variable and vice versa 2 5 gene expression programming gene expression programming gep combines two popular genetic techniques genetic programming gp using expression tree structures of different sizes and shapes and genetic algorithms ga describing complex relations by simpler fixed length linear structures called chromosomes traore and guven 2013 it thus harnesses the advantages of each of the two methods and overcomes their individual constraints in the gep algorithm the solution to the problem being investigated is described via chromosomes that consist of one or more genes two or more genes can be combined to make a chromosome and the chromosomes are combined through a linking function the generation of the initial population is the first stage in the gep algorithm the chromosomes are then expressed in a tree expression where the tree consisting of chromosomes is reproduced as new programs through replication and genetic modification mutation transposition and recombination of the chromosomes were executed in this process this process can be repeated until a certain criterion is met such as the minimum fit function value the major steps to solve problems using the gep are as follows traore and guven 2011 wang et al 2015 a select the fitness function according to shiri et al 2014c the fitness function of the root mean squared error rmse is applicable to modeling et 0 b determine the set of terminals t and the set of functions f to create the chromosomes t consists of different input combinations presented in table 2 a total of 15 input combinations were used in the study the function set used here contained 13 basic mathematical functions x x 2 x 3 x x 3 ln x sin x cos x and tan x c choose the chromosomal architecture the head size was 8 the number of genes was 3 and number of chromosomes was 30 d determine the linking function it can be addition or multiplication for algebraic subtrees addition was selected here e determine the values of the gene operators the mutation rate was 0 044 inversion rate was 0 1 the one point and two point recombination rate was 0 3 the gene recombination and gene transpiration rate was 0 1 the insertion sequence transposition rate was 0 1 and the root insertion sequence transpiration rate was 0 1 select parsimony pressure as the penalizing tool with different input combinations the program ran until the accuracy of the model no longer significantly improved and the gep model was thus developed this study used genexprotools 5 0 developed by gepsoft limited to this end 2 6 statistical indicators and input combinations to evaluate the accuracy of model predictions four statistical indicators were used a the coefficient of determination r 2 where a value close to 1 0 indicates that most of the total variance of the observed values is explained by the model fandio et al 2015 2 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 where o i and p i represent pairs of observed and predicted values for a given variable and o i and p i are the mean values of o i and p i respectively b the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce proposed by nash and sutcliffe 1970 which determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance between the observed and the predicted values a value of nsce close to 1 0 indicates that the residual variance is much smaller than the observed variance in data and thus good model performance krause et al 2005 3 nsce 1 0 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 c the root mean square error rmse 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 d the percent bias pbias can provide insight into the simulated data to be larger or smaller than their corresponding observations positive values of pbias imply that the model underestimates the target values and vice versa fandio et al 2015 5 pbias 100 i 1 n o i p i i 1 n o i 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of rf based models during the testing period the et 0 values estimated from fao pm were considered the benchmark to evaluate the application of the proposed rf and gep models during the testing periods the statistical indicators r 2 nsce rmse and pbias are shown in table 3 it was observed that r 2 nsce rmse and pbias ranged from 0 637 to 0 987 0 626 to 0 986 0 107 to 0 563 mm day 1 and 2 916 to 1 571 respectively the presence or absence of critical meteorological factors in the input sets significantly impacted the performance of rf based models type 1 rf1 used only t min and t max as input set and can be considered a temperature based model it yielded the worst estimation r 2 0 637 nsce 0 626 rmse 0 563 mm day 1 and pbias 2 916 in comparison with the rest of the models nevertheless rf1 was superior to the conventional hargreaves samani model which yield r 2 0 565 nsce 0 528 rmse 0 633 mm day 1 and pbias 6 494 it could thus be used as an alternative method when only t min and t max were available rf2 3 and 4 were formed by adding rh u 2 and n to rf1 combinations respectively from the viewpoint of the statistical indicators rf2 r 2 0 787 nsce 0 786 rmse 0 426 mm day 1 and pbias 1 152 3 r 2 0 764 nsce 0 762 rmse 0 449 mm day 1 and pbias 1 530 and 4 r 2 0 899 nsce 0 894 rmse 0 300 mm day 1 and pbias 2 744 outperformed the rf1 model it can be inferred that the order of factors influencing et 0 in guangxi was n rh and u 2 this result is similar to that in studies by thomas 2000 who revealed that the duration of sunshine is the major factor controlling evapotranspiration south of 35 o n yin et al 2010 also reported that n primarily determines change in et 0 in the subtropical and tropical regions of china type 3 was the trivariate model air temperature and two other meteorological variables and the input combinations contained n rf6 and rf7 to produce a similar accuracy in modeling et 0 with r 2 values of 0 945 against 0 938 nsce values of 0 942 against 0 938 rmse values of 0 247 against 0 245 mm day 1 and pbias values of 2 020 against 0 372 moreover the models considering n rf6 and rf7 outperformed the model without n rf5 which confirmed the importance of n for the estimation of et 0 in guangxi by comparing types 1 2 and 3 with types 4 5 and 6 it can be concluded that adding r a to the input sets improved models performances table 3 therefore r a represents the extraterrestrial radiation and should be considered to estimate et 0 when solar radiation is unavailable because it is a computed variable that can easily be acquired the importance of r a was also pointed out by traore and guven 2013 rf8 was superiority to the conventional hargreaves samani model when using the same input variables with r 2 values of 0 705 against 0 565 nsce values of 0 698 against 0 528 rmse values of 0 506 against 0 633 mm day 1 and pbias values of 2 790 against 6 494 therefore rf8 can be substitute for the hargreaves samani model when only t a data were available for guangxi in other circumstance of incomplete data in guangxi rf9 10 11 12 13 and 14 were developed by considering r a in rf2 3 4 5 6 and 7 respectively and yielded more accurate estimations of et 0 table 3 type 6 rf15 had a full set of meteorological variables similar to fao pm and generated the best results with the highest r 2 and nsce and the lowest rmse and pbias however the rf15 model could not replace fao pm in a scenario featuring complete data fig 3 shows the distribution of the four statistical parameters of the seven rf models at each of the 18 training stations from high to low latitude it is clear that rf15 outperformed the other models on all statistical criteria as it considered all variables that had an influence on et 0 moreover fig 3 shows that although the statistical parameters fluctuated the models became more effective and robust when added to more climatic variables which was consistent with table 3 rf9 rf10 and rf12 had lower r 2 and nsce and higher rmse and pbias than rf11 r13 rf14 and rf15 owing to their less n as input that represented the amount of available energy for evapotranspiration droogers and allen 2002 moreover the models generally performed better at high latitudes karst region than low latitudes non karst region fig 3 this might have been the case because low latitude areas mean annual sunshine duration was 1580 2 hours had a longer duration of total sunshine than high latitude areas mean annual sunshine duration was 1337 9 hours and the difference was significant p 0 0007 thus the deficiency in the duration of sunshine rf9 rf10 and rf12 or variation in it rf11 rf13 and rf14 caused a large variation in et 0 in low latitude areas furthermore from the spatial distribution of pbias we can infer that the models overestimated et 0 in high latitude areas and underestimated et 0 in low latitude areas because the duration of sunshine solar radiation had a positive relation with et 0 yin et al 2010 the mean value of n in high latitude area was lower than in the whole area thus the generalized models overestimated et 0 and vice versa all results indicate the significant effect of duration of sunshine on the modelling of et 0 this section summarizes the excellent regression capacity of rf in estimating et 0 moreover unlike other studies that targeted the given weather stations the generalization capability of the rf approach proposed here is considered 3 2 performance of gep based models during the testing period the performance of the of gep model on different input combinations is presented in table 3 the values of r 2 nsce rmse and pbias ranged from 0 639 to 0 944 0 636 to 0 942 0 222 to 0 555 mm day 1 and 1 798 to 0 348 respectively therefore the derived gep models exhibited the ability to capture the variation in et 0 in guangxi china type 1 gep1 contained only t min and t max and produced the poorest results type 2 gep2 3 and 4 was formed by introducing rh u 2 and n to gep1 and its performance are superior to that of gep1 thus n variables were the most effective in estimating et 0 because adding n to gep1 gep4 significantly improved performance yielding the largest increases in r 2 40 and nsce 40 and the largest reductions in rmse 45 and pbias 58 followed by rh and u 2 this is consistent with the analysis in section 3 1 our previous study had also found that n and rh were the main meteorological factors influencing the change in et 0 wu et al 2017 type 3 gep5 6 and 7 added u 2 n and rh to the input combinations of gep2 3 and 4 respectively and performed better than type 2 by comparing type 1 2 and 3 with type 4 5 and 6 we see that similar to the proposed rf based et 0 models adding the calculated rather than the observed variable r a which is easy to obtain to the input combinations can systematically improve the performance of the models table 3 gep8 contained the same meteorological variables t max t min and r a as the conventional hargreaves equation and was superior to the hargreaves model with r 2 values of 0 653 against 0 565 nsce values of 0 646 against 0 528 rmse values of 0 546 against 0 633 mm day 1 and pbias values of 3 122 against 6 494 therefore if only air temperature is available in guangxi china the gep8 model can be a suitable substitute for the conventional hargreaves method its algebraic equation is 6 et 0 sin sin 3 sin 3 sin sin r a r a sin sin 2 sin 3 tan t max r a 54 485 t max 13 537 t min 49 289 t max t min 2 when air temperature and rh are available and n and u 2 are unavailable or contain a great deal of missing data the gep9 model can be used r 2 0 757 nsce 0 754 rmse 0 457 mm day 1 and pbias 1 360 it is expressed as follows 7 et 0 exp 3 t max 33 210 9 5 863 t max 5 863 cos rh 7 546 rh 0 151 exp exp r a rh 3 3 3 if only air temperature and wind speed can be used in guangxi china gep10 can be applied r 2 0 764 nsce 0 759 rmse 0 452 mm day 1 and pbias 2 692 it can be written as 8 et 0 t max t min 4 8 t max 4 sin sin 0 114 t max sin t max t max u 2 r a t min 3 r a t min if only air temperature and duration of sunshine are available for guangxi gep11 is the best method to estimate et 0 r 2 0 892 nsce 0 885 rmse 0 313 mm day 1 and pbias 3 323 gep11 can be presented as follows 9 et 0 t min 2 t min 3 t min 3 2 776 3 cos n 1 5 r a t max t min 3 n 3 93 003 t min 4 gep12 can be employed in cases where the duration of sunshine is missing r 2 0 828 nsce 0 826 rmse 0 384 mm day 1 and pbias 1 368 the expression is 10 et 0 sin ra t min 3 t max rh 9 234 3 ln 3 221 t max 3 sin u 2 3 u t max 2 457 4 3 227 in some circumstances where relative humidity is usually unavailable or the data quality is unreliable traore and guven 2011 gep13 can be used and yields adequate accuracy r 2 0 939 nsce 0 934 rmse 0 237 mm day 1 and pbias 2 186 the derived formula is 11 et 0 ln r a u 2 t max r a 3 t min 99 352 2 t max 2 u 2 n 6 521 sin t min 3 u 2 in case wind speed is unavailable gep14 can be used r 2 0 932 nsce 0 931 rmse 0 242 mm day 1 and pbias 0 274 the expression is 12 et 0 n rh 2

942 rmse 0 222 mm day 1 and pbias 0 348 outperformed the other gep models as it considered all meteorological variables as does fao pm moreover although the performance of fao pm was slightly better than that of gep15 gep15 is more convenient to use because fao pm contains a significant number of sophisticated intermediate parameters that need to be estimated feng et al 2016 and can easily use the derivative that is convenient for analyzing the sensitivity parameters yin et al 2010 the expression of gep15 is 13 et 0 n t min r a u 2 rh tan tan t min u 2 3 rh n 1 941 t max rh u 2 fig 4 shows the distribution of the four statistical parameters of the seven gep models at each of the 18 training stations from high to low latitude like the rf models gep9 gep10 and gep12 performed worse than gep11 gep13 gep14 and gep15 due to the absence of data on the duration of sunshine it is also clear that the gep models generally performed better in high latitude areas karst region than in low latitude areas non karst region fig 3 which is consistent with previous analysis from the spatial distribution of pbias we can again infer that the gep models overestimated et 0 in high latitude areas and underestimated it in low latitude areas 3 3 performance of rf based and gep based models using data from outside the training stations as mentioned in section 2 1 the rf and gep models were further spatially evaluated using climatic data collected from six meteorological stations other than the 18 meteorological stations used to train the rf and gep models in the same period 2010 2014 as mentioned in sections 3 1 and 3 2 r a can improve model performance and is a calculated variable from the location of a station and the day of the year that does not need to be observed it can thus be seen as a default variable to be used in the estimation of et 0 we evaluated the models rf8 rf15 and gep8 gep15 their performance is shown in table 4 and figs 5 and 6 as the results indicate the trend at the six stations was identical to that at the other 18 stations used in training and testing the best performance indicators at the six stations were obtained by input combinations containing the duration of sunshine rf11 rf13 rf14 and rf15 and gep11 gep13 gep14 and gep15 figs 5 and 6 also show that et 0 in the stations in pingguo was underestimated and rf and gep models performed slightly worse in pingguo than at the other stations this can be explained by the mean value of et 0 where et 0 in pingguo 2 78 mm day 1 was significantly p 0 001 larger than in hechi 2 09 mm day 1 laibin 2 18 mm day 1 mengshan 2 25 mm day 1 wuzhou 2 45 mm day 1 and dongxing 2 47 mm day 1 to this end because of the spatial variation of climatic variables more weather stations should be used to develop more robust models the superiority of rf models over gep models was also noted however the differences were minimal and the main purpose of developing the gep based models of et 0 was to generate an easy to use mathematical expression with few meteorological variables for irrigators with minimal computer skills traore and guven 2011 shiri et al 2014c yassin et al 2016 3 4 testing rf based and gep based models under climate change to evaluate the rf based and gep based models of et 0 under climate change we validated the proposed models using climatic data collected from 1960 to 2009 at six weather stations where the data typically represented trends of change in et 0 the performance is shown in table 5 and figs 7 and 8 table 5 shows that the best model was one with all climatic variables in the 15th combination the results of which were significantly close to those of the fao 56 pm model moreover figs 7 and 8 show that for the rf models at laibin et 0 recorded a significant variation and hechi et 0 had no significant variation from 1960 to 2009 divided into five periods 1960 1969 1970 1979 1980 1989 1990 1999 and 2000 2009 r 2 and rmse clearly show that the performance of the models declined with time moreover the coefficients of variation of r 2 and rmse were larger in laibin 0 037 and 0 117 mm day 1 than in hechi 0 018 and 0 077 mm day 1 the gep models showed the same tendency as the rf models which indicates that the performance of the models was sensitive to climate change climate change is the statistically significant mean climatic state of a significant change over a longer period typically 10 years or longer thus the proposed models can be applied to this period based on the results similar research related to data driven models kim and kim 2008b kumar et al 2008 tabari et al 2012 shiri et al 2012 yassin et al 2016 should be evaluated in the context of climate change 3 5 relative importance of climatic factors in estimation of et 0 the analysis of the sensitivity of et 0 to meteorological variables is important for a thorough understanding of the impact of global climate change on evapotranspiration and for water resource management yin et al 2010 the rf and gep algorithms have the ability to evaluate the importance of predictors the performances of the models with different input combinations can thus be explained by analyzing the importance of the meteorological factors on et 0 fig 9 a shows the importance of different variables for et 0 by rf method higher value of the mean decrease in gini implies greater importance breiman 2001 the order of importance of meteorological variables based on the rf method was n 43 9 t max 23 0 rh 12 1 t min 11 5 u 2 6 2 r a 3 3 and the order based on the gep method fig 9b was n 30 4 t max 4 3 rh 35 2 u 2 15 9 t min 14 3 r a 6 9 it can thus be concluded that the order of the importance of climatic factors in guangxi was n t rh and u 2 the result is consistent with the preceding analysis where n was the most important variable for estimating et 0 rh u 2 and r a ranked as third fifth and sixth respectively this was different with other studies which relate to different climate zone yin et al 2010 yassin et al 2016 4 conclusions the rf algorithm has a lot of merit and the ability to model complicated nonlinear systems however it is rarely applied in hydrological research this study aims to investigate the applicability and the generalization of rf in modeling et 0 in guangxi with different input combinations refer to the different circumstances in missing data and compare with the gep method the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the derived rf based generalization et 0 models are successfully applied in modeling et 0 with complete and incomplete meteorological variables in general the more variables in use by a model the higher chance of producing better performance moreover we proposed seven rf based models corresponding to different incomplete data circumstances specifically rf8 can be used as an alternative of the conventional hargreaves samani model since it performs better than the latter 2 the gep based generalization et 0 models are also proposed and the models produce promising results although the rf based et 0 models performed slightly better than the gep based models they are black box models the gep approach has the ability to give explicit expressions between the dependent and independent variables which is more convenient for irrigators with minimal computer skills than the rf based models therefore we recommend applying the rf based models in water balance research and the gep based models in agricultural irrigation practice 3 based on a spatial evaluation the rf and gep models were generally performed better in high latitude areas karst region than in low latitude areas non karst region and both of them overestimated et 0 at high latitude areas and underestimated at low latitude areas which were induced by the differences of sunshine duration of the two regions moreover it was found that the performance of the developed models decreased with periods 4 both of the rf and gep algorithm have the ability to evaluate the importance of predictors the order of importance of meteorological variables on et 0 in guangxi is sunshine duration air temperature relative humidity and wind speed acknowledgements this study was financially supported by the guangxi natural science foundation 2018gxnsfba281136 and 2018gxnsfga281003 and the national natural science foundation of china

10996,accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration et 0 is very important in hydrological cycle research and is essential in agricultural water management and allocation the application of the standard model fao 56 penman monteith to estimate et 0 is restricted due to the absence of required meteorological data although many machine learning algorithms have been applied in modeling et 0 with fewer meteorological variables most of the models are trained and tested using data from the same station their performances outside the training station are not evaluated this study aims to investigate generalization ability of the random forest rf algorithm in modeling et 0 with different input combinations refer to different circumstances in missing data and compares this algorithm with the gene expression programming gep method using the data from 24 weather stations in a karst region of southwest china the et 0 estimated by the fao 56 penman monteith model was used as a reference to evaluate the derived rf based and gep based models and the coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe coefficiency of efficiency nsce root of mean squared error rmse and percent bias pbias were used as evaluation criteria the results revealed that the derived rf based generalization et 0 models are successfully applied in modeling et 0 with complete and incomplete meteorological variables r 2 nsce rmse and pbias ranged from 0 637 to 0 987 0 626 to 0 986 0 107 to 0 563 mm day 1 and 2 916 to 1 571 respectively and seven rf based models corresponding to different incomplete data circumstances are proposed the gep based generalization et 0 models are also proposed and they produced promising results r 2 nsce rmse and pbias ranged from 0 639 to 0 944 0 636 to 0 942 0 222 to 0 555 mm day 1 and 1 98 to 0 248 respectively although the rf based et 0 models performed slightly better than the gep based models the gep approach has the ability to give explicit expressions between the dependent and independent variables which is more convenient for irrigators with minimal computer skills therefore we recommend applying the rf based models in water balance research and the gep based models in agricultural irrigation practice moreover the models performance decreased with periods due to climate change impact on et 0 at last both of the two methods have the ability to assess the importance of predictors the order of the importance of meteorological variables on et 0 in guangxi is sunshine duration air temperature relative humidity and wind speed keywords water resources climate change impact variable importance karst region 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is an important branch of the hydrologic cycle traore and guven 2013 as more than 60 of total global precipitation is dissipated by it falamarzi et al 2014 accurate observation of actual et is important in the design of irrigation schedules water resource management and water allocation wang et al 2015 although et can be monitored directly by using a lysimeter allen et al 2011 or a method for the transfer of the energy balance and water vapor mass shiri et al 2014b these measurements are laborious time consuming and expensive shiri et al 2014b moreover the measurements are limited in time and space falamarzi et al 2014 alternatively et can be estimated by a reference evapotranspiration et 0 multiplied by a crop coefficient which is the most extensive approach recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao allen et al 1998 wang et al 2015 rahimikhoob 2016 the empirical crop coefficient k c defined as the ratio of actual crop et to the reference crop et is determined predominantly using specific crop characteristics and only a small percentage with environmental conditions allen et al 1998 for example the k c values of hops were 0 69 1 02 and 0 85 in at initial mid season and end season periods respectively fandio et al 2015 k c values of approximately 80 crops are available on the fao s website therefore precisely calculating et 0 is essential for accurately estimating et rahimikhoob 2016 et 0 is the rate of et of a hypothesized grass with adequate water supply albedo 0 23 height 0 12 and surface resistance 70 s m and represents the maximum atmospheric evaporative power at a given time and location regardless of crop type and soil characteristics allen et al 1998 shiri et al 2012 feng et al 2016 allen et al 1998 stressed that et 0 is influenced only by meteorological factors therefore many methods have been proposed to estimate et 0 from climatic data in these methods the fao 56 penman monteith fao pm is a physical approach proposed based on the theories of aerodynamics and energy balance this approach has been recommended as the standard method by the fao and is used to calibrate other et 0 methods allen et al 1998 shiri et al 2012 the method has two important advantages 1 it can be applied to different geographic and climatic zones without local calibration because of its theoretical basis and the results have been proven to be more consistent with the observation data than other methods 2 it has been validated using lysimeters worldwide kumar et al 2008 shiri et al 2012 wang et al 2015 the main drawback of the fao pm is that it requires a full set of meteorological factors including air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed and high quality data kim and kim 2008a kumar et al 2009 furthermore the computation procedure is complicated for irrigation technicians who typically are not sophisticated computer users traore and guven 2013 however weather stations that satisfy the requirements of observations are limited especially in developing countries wang et al 2015 shiri et al 2014b 2012 air temperature sensors are generally available in most weather stations worldwide whereas sensors for observing other meteorological factors are found in relatively fewer stations and the quality of data is not always reliable shiri et al 2012 droogers and allen 2002 therefore there is a need to develop simpler et 0 models that use fewer meteorological variables and have adequate precision empirical et 0 models using smaller amounts of climatic data have also been widely used as a substitute for fao pm the hargreaves samani equation is superior to others as it requires only the maximum and minimum air temperatures hargreaves 1982 and provides the most accurate global average performance almorox et al 2015 it was therefore employed in this study et 0 can be recognized as a function of several meteorological variables with the advancement in computational resources and the emergence of big data some machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to estimate et 0 such as artificial neural networks ann kumar et al 2002 kim and kim 2008b shiri et al 2014a genetic programming gp izadifar and elshorbagy 2010 kisi and guven 2010 support vector machine svm tabari et al 2012 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis shiri et al 2012 tabari et al 2012 extreme learning machine elm feng et al 2016 abdullah et al 2015 and gene expression programming gep shiri et al 2012 2014c wang et al 2015 unlike other machine learning approaches that produce black box models the gep has the ability to provide explicit expressions between dependent and independent variables a powerful advantage for practical applications and transferability traore and guven 2013 shiri et al 2014c thus it was applied in this study at present the major deficiency in research on machine learning based et 0 estimation models is that these models are trained and tested using climatic data at the same station and their applicability is not validated beyond the training stations therefore although the proposed models have adequate accuracy as has been reported abdullah et al 2015 kim and kim 2008b kumar et al 2008 traore and guven 2011 they may be useful only in the training stations and their effectiveness is otherwise doubtful moreover it is impossible to develop et 0 models for each locations one effective way is to develop generalized et 0 models using fewer meteorological variables but few studies have considered this shiri et al 2014c kisi 2016 beyond this no research has tested whether machine learning based et 0 models are applicable in the context of climate change which has an important impact on water resource management allen et al 1998 wang et al 2015 the random forest rf method which is an ensemble learning method for classification and regression has become popular in recent years because of its robust performance across a wide range of datasets high prediction accuracy limited number of user defined parameters and ability to avoid overfitting jing et al 2015 it can also estimate the relative importance of variables fern et al 2014 conducted an exhaustive evaluation of 179 classifiers arising from 17 families discriminant analysis bayesian ann svm decision trees rule based classifiers boosting bagging stacking random forests generalized linear models nearest neighbors partial least squares principal component regression logistic and multinomial regression and multiple adaptive regression splines over 121 datasets and concluded that the rf delivers the best performance overall rf has been successfully applied to many areas guangxi located in southwest china has one of the largest continuous karst landforms in the world although this region has a subtropical mountainous monsoon climate with a large amount of annual precipitation more than 1200 mm the karst habitat is deficient in water resources for vegetation growth because there are a large number of fissures gaps channels and sinkholes thus these karst systems have an ineffective water storage capacity chen et al 2009 2010 furthermore drought occurs more frequently liu et al 2014 found that southwestern china has generally become drier in relation to global climate change and that regional mean annual precipitation has decreased by 11 4 mm per decade it is therefore acknowledged that accurate et 0 estimation is important for water resource allocation and management for agriculture in this region the objectives of the study are 1 to demonstrate the applicability of rf and gep in estimating et 0 2 to develop and compare the performance of the generalized rf based and gep based et 0 estimation models in guangxi with different meteorological variables used as input and evaluate the applicability of the models in the context of climate change and 3 to identify the contribution rank of each climatic factor in et 0 estimation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data collection guangxi is located in the pearl river basin of southwest china between 20 54 26 23 n and 104 29 112 04 e and covers approximately 236 700 km2 accounting for 2 47 of china s total territory the carbonate area takes up approximately 37 8 of the province the territory tilts from northwest to southeast and has a hilly mountain terrain the region has a tropical and subtropical humid climate with an average annual temperature of 17 23 c and annual precipitation of 1080 2760 mm fig 1 shows the geographical locations of the study area and the distribution of 24 meteorological stations in it a summary of the stations is listed in table 1 daily climatic data from the 24 meteorological stations recorded from 2010 to 2014 containing the maximum and minimum air temperature c wind speed at a height of 2 m m s relative humidity and duration of sunshine hours were acquired from the national climatic centre of the china meteorological administration five years of daily meteorological data are sufficient to develop et 0 models because et 0 exhibits a smaller variation in comparison with other climate variables such as precipitation shiri et al 2012 based on our previous study wu et al 2017 the 24 stations were divided into two types according to landform karst 10 and non karst areas 14 six stations were then selected hechi laibin and pingguo from the karst area and wuzhou mengshan and dongxing from the non karst area to validate the models at the spatial scale the six stations were chosen because they typically represented the change in trend of et 0 no significant variation hechi and wuzhou significant increase pingguo and dongxing and significant decrease laibin and mengshan wu et al 2017 moreover according to long term data recorded at the six stations the validation can be used to examine the impact of climate change on the performance of the models the daily climatic data from the remaining 18 stations from 2010 to 2013 were used to train the rf and gep models and the remaining data 2014 were used for testing fifteen input combinations table 2 representing different scenarios where meteorological data were missing traore and guven 2013 were applied to establish the rf and gep models air temperature t a was generally available at most meteorological stations while the other parameters were found at fewer stations and the quality of the data was not always guaranteed therefore air temperatures t max and t min were introduced to all input combinations the 15 input combinations were divided into seven types type 1 rf1 was a temperature based univariate model type 2 rf2 rf3 and rf4 was a bivariate model with t a and rh in rf2 t a and u 2 in rf3 and t a and n in rf4 respectively type 3 gep5 gep6 and gep7 was a trivariate model in which rf5 used t a rh and u 2 rf6 used t a u 2 and n rf7 used t a rh and n type 4 rf8 type 5 rf9 rf10 and rf11 and type 6 rf12 rf13 and rf14 were formed by adding r a to types 1 2 and 3 respectively lastly type 7 rf15 used all the meteorological variables the input combinations in gep models were the same as rf models as shown in table 2 2 2 fao 56 penman monteith et 0 values estimated by the fao pm equation were used as the reference target values for developing and evaluating the rf based and gep based models kisi 2016 wang et al 2015 the fao pm equation is given as 1 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et 0 is reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 r n is net radiation at the crop surface mj m2 d g is the heat flux density of soil mj m2 d δ is slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve kpa c γ is the psychometric constant kpa c e s is saturation vapor pressure kpa e a is actual vapor pressure kpa u 2 is wind speed at a height of 2 m m s and t mean is mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c allen et al 1998 in this work due to a lack of radiation data r n was indirectly estimated based on the fao 56 procedure from duration of sunshine and location of the weather stations which was the difference between the incoming net shortwave and the net outgoing longwave radiation and g 0 for the day timescale moreover r a extraterrestrial radiation was estimated from the site latitude of the site and the day of the year 1 1 january and 365 or 366 31 december which represented the theoretical solar radiation used to estimate r n allen et al 1998 t mean was estimated by averaging t max and t min 2 3 hargreaves and samani equation the hargreaves samani equation hargreaves 1982 is the simplest method to estimate et 0 and was proposed in allen et al 1998 if only the air temperatures are variables 2 4 theory of random forest random forest rf is an ensemble learning method for classification regression and clustering it randomly creates a group of decision trees and forecasts the class that is the mode of classes classification or the mean regression of individual trees the following gives a brief description of the procedure for building an rf model a draw n tree bootstrap samples from the original data a bootstrap subset contains approximately 2 3 of the elements of the original dataset b for each bootstrap subset build an unpruned regression tree at each node rather than choosing the best split among all predictors randomly sample m try of the predictors and choose the best split from among those variables c predict new data by aggregating the predictions of the n tree trees majority votes for classification and average for regression in this study the r package randomforest developed by liaw and wiener liaw and wiener 2002 james et al 2013 was used for rf model training and testing this package needs only a few tunable parameters the number of trees n tree in the forest and the number of predictors in the random subset of each node m try in this study the default values of m try one third of all predictor variables was used as the creator of the rf algorithm in breiman 2001 which for most occasions is adequate to generate predictions of desirable accuracy n tree was built using an iterative evaluation and out of bag error mean squared error for regression problems was used during parameter optimization to yield the minimum error from fig 2 it is evident that the mean squared errors decreased with n tree and r 2 increased correspondingly in general there was a threshold of n tree beyond which increasing the number of trees induced no significant performance gain and only increased computational cost from the perspectives of accuracy and the computational burden n tree 1000 was used in this study as a tree based method it is convenient to evaluate the importance of the variables in the rf in this study it means distinguishing variables that best contributed to the predictive ability of et 0 the importance of variables was calculated by computing the reduction in prediction accuracy resulting from randomly permuting the values of a variable the greater the decreasing in prediction accuracy the more important the relevant variable and vice versa 2 5 gene expression programming gene expression programming gep combines two popular genetic techniques genetic programming gp using expression tree structures of different sizes and shapes and genetic algorithms ga describing complex relations by simpler fixed length linear structures called chromosomes traore and guven 2013 it thus harnesses the advantages of each of the two methods and overcomes their individual constraints in the gep algorithm the solution to the problem being investigated is described via chromosomes that consist of one or more genes two or more genes can be combined to make a chromosome and the chromosomes are combined through a linking function the generation of the initial population is the first stage in the gep algorithm the chromosomes are then expressed in a tree expression where the tree consisting of chromosomes is reproduced as new programs through replication and genetic modification mutation transposition and recombination of the chromosomes were executed in this process this process can be repeated until a certain criterion is met such as the minimum fit function value the major steps to solve problems using the gep are as follows traore and guven 2011 wang et al 2015 a select the fitness function according to shiri et al 2014c the fitness function of the root mean squared error rmse is applicable to modeling et 0 b determine the set of terminals t and the set of functions f to create the chromosomes t consists of different input combinations presented in table 2 a total of 15 input combinations were used in the study the function set used here contained 13 basic mathematical functions x x 2 x 3 x x 3 ln x sin x cos x and tan x c choose the chromosomal architecture the head size was 8 the number of genes was 3 and number of chromosomes was 30 d determine the linking function it can be addition or multiplication for algebraic subtrees addition was selected here e determine the values of the gene operators the mutation rate was 0 044 inversion rate was 0 1 the one point and two point recombination rate was 0 3 the gene recombination and gene transpiration rate was 0 1 the insertion sequence transposition rate was 0 1 and the root insertion sequence transpiration rate was 0 1 select parsimony pressure as the penalizing tool with different input combinations the program ran until the accuracy of the model no longer significantly improved and the gep model was thus developed this study used genexprotools 5 0 developed by gepsoft limited to this end 2 6 statistical indicators and input combinations to evaluate the accuracy of model predictions four statistical indicators were used a the coefficient of determination r 2 where a value close to 1 0 indicates that most of the total variance of the observed values is explained by the model fandio et al 2015 2 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 where o i and p i represent pairs of observed and predicted values for a given variable and o i and p i are the mean values of o i and p i respectively b the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce proposed by nash and sutcliffe 1970 which determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance between the observed and the predicted values a value of nsce close to 1 0 indicates that the residual variance is much smaller than the observed variance in data and thus good model performance krause et al 2005 3 nsce 1 0 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 c the root mean square error rmse 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 d the percent bias pbias can provide insight into the simulated data to be larger or smaller than their corresponding observations positive values of pbias imply that the model underestimates the target values and vice versa fandio et al 2015 5 pbias 100 i 1 n o i p i i 1 n o i 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of rf based models during the testing period the et 0 values estimated from fao pm were considered the benchmark to evaluate the application of the proposed rf and gep models during the testing periods the statistical indicators r 2 nsce rmse and pbias are shown in table 3 it was observed that r 2 nsce rmse and pbias ranged from 0 637 to 0 987 0 626 to 0 986 0 107 to 0 563 mm day 1 and 2 916 to 1 571 respectively the presence or absence of critical meteorological factors in the input sets significantly impacted the performance of rf based models type 1 rf1 used only t min and t max as input set and can be considered a temperature based model it yielded the worst estimation r 2 0 637 nsce 0 626 rmse 0 563 mm day 1 and pbias 2 916 in comparison with the rest of the models nevertheless rf1 was superior to the conventional hargreaves samani model which yield r 2 0 565 nsce 0 528 rmse 0 633 mm day 1 and pbias 6 494 it could thus be used as an alternative method when only t min and t max were available rf2 3 and 4 were formed by adding rh u 2 and n to rf1 combinations respectively from the viewpoint of the statistical indicators rf2 r 2 0 787 nsce 0 786 rmse 0 426 mm day 1 and pbias 1 152 3 r 2 0 764 nsce 0 762 rmse 0 449 mm day 1 and pbias 1 530 and 4 r 2 0 899 nsce 0 894 rmse 0 300 mm day 1 and pbias 2 744 outperformed the rf1 model it can be inferred that the order of factors influencing et 0 in guangxi was n rh and u 2 this result is similar to that in studies by thomas 2000 who revealed that the duration of sunshine is the major factor controlling evapotranspiration south of 35 o n yin et al 2010 also reported that n primarily determines change in et 0 in the subtropical and tropical regions of china type 3 was the trivariate model air temperature and two other meteorological variables and the input combinations contained n rf6 and rf7 to produce a similar accuracy in modeling et 0 with r 2 values of 0 945 against 0 938 nsce values of 0 942 against 0 938 rmse values of 0 247 against 0 245 mm day 1 and pbias values of 2 020 against 0 372 moreover the models considering n rf6 and rf7 outperformed the model without n rf5 which confirmed the importance of n for the estimation of et 0 in guangxi by comparing types 1 2 and 3 with types 4 5 and 6 it can be concluded that adding r a to the input sets improved models performances table 3 therefore r a represents the extraterrestrial radiation and should be considered to estimate et 0 when solar radiation is unavailable because it is a computed variable that can easily be acquired the importance of r a was also pointed out by traore and guven 2013 rf8 was superiority to the conventional hargreaves samani model when using the same input variables with r 2 values of 0 705 against 0 565 nsce values of 0 698 against 0 528 rmse values of 0 506 against 0 633 mm day 1 and pbias values of 2 790 against 6 494 therefore rf8 can be substitute for the hargreaves samani model when only t a data were available for guangxi in other circumstance of incomplete data in guangxi rf9 10 11 12 13 and 14 were developed by considering r a in rf2 3 4 5 6 and 7 respectively and yielded more accurate estimations of et 0 table 3 type 6 rf15 had a full set of meteorological variables similar to fao pm and generated the best results with the highest r 2 and nsce and the lowest rmse and pbias however the rf15 model could not replace fao pm in a scenario featuring complete data fig 3 shows the distribution of the four statistical parameters of the seven rf models at each of the 18 training stations from high to low latitude it is clear that rf15 outperformed the other models on all statistical criteria as it considered all variables that had an influence on et 0 moreover fig 3 shows that although the statistical parameters fluctuated the models became more effective and robust when added to more climatic variables which was consistent with table 3 rf9 rf10 and rf12 had lower r 2 and nsce and higher rmse and pbias than rf11 r13 rf14 and rf15 owing to their less n as input that represented the amount of available energy for evapotranspiration droogers and allen 2002 moreover the models generally performed better at high latitudes karst region than low latitudes non karst region fig 3 this might have been the case because low latitude areas mean annual sunshine duration was 1580 2 hours had a longer duration of total sunshine than high latitude areas mean annual sunshine duration was 1337 9 hours and the difference was significant p 0 0007 thus the deficiency in the duration of sunshine rf9 rf10 and rf12 or variation in it rf11 rf13 and rf14 caused a large variation in et 0 in low latitude areas furthermore from the spatial distribution of pbias we can infer that the models overestimated et 0 in high latitude areas and underestimated et 0 in low latitude areas because the duration of sunshine solar radiation had a positive relation with et 0 yin et al 2010 the mean value of n in high latitude area was lower than in the whole area thus the generalized models overestimated et 0 and vice versa all results indicate the significant effect of duration of sunshine on the modelling of et 0 this section summarizes the excellent regression capacity of rf in estimating et 0 moreover unlike other studies that targeted the given weather stations the generalization capability of the rf approach proposed here is considered 3 2 performance of gep based models during the testing period the performance of the of gep model on different input combinations is presented in table 3 the values of r 2 nsce rmse and pbias ranged from 0 639 to 0 944 0 636 to 0 942 0 222 to 0 555 mm day 1 and 1 798 to 0 348 respectively therefore the derived gep models exhibited the ability to capture the variation in et 0 in guangxi china type 1 gep1 contained only t min and t max and produced the poorest results type 2 gep2 3 and 4 was formed by introducing rh u 2 and n to gep1 and its performance are superior to that of gep1 thus n variables were the most effective in estimating et 0 because adding n to gep1 gep4 significantly improved performance yielding the largest increases in r 2 40 and nsce 40 and the largest reductions in rmse 45 and pbias 58 followed by rh and u 2 this is consistent with the analysis in section 3 1 our previous study had also found that n and rh were the main meteorological factors influencing the change in et 0 wu et al 2017 type 3 gep5 6 and 7 added u 2 n and rh to the input combinations of gep2 3 and 4 respectively and performed better than type 2 by comparing type 1 2 and 3 with type 4 5 and 6 we see that similar to the proposed rf based et 0 models adding the calculated rather than the observed variable r a which is easy to obtain to the input combinations can systematically improve the performance of the models table 3 gep8 contained the same meteorological variables t max t min and r a as the conventional hargreaves equation and was superior to the hargreaves model with r 2 values of 0 653 against 0 565 nsce values of 0 646 against 0 528 rmse values of 0 546 against 0 633 mm day 1 and pbias values of 3 122 against 6 494 therefore if only air temperature is available in guangxi china the gep8 model can be a suitable substitute for the conventional hargreaves method its algebraic equation is 6 et 0 sin sin 3 sin 3 sin sin r a r a sin sin 2 sin 3 tan t max r a 54 485 t max 13 537 t min 49 289 t max t min 2 when air temperature and rh are available and n and u 2 are unavailable or contain a great deal of missing data the gep9 model can be used r 2 0 757 nsce 0 754 rmse 0 457 mm day 1 and pbias 1 360 it is expressed as follows 7 et 0 exp 3 t max 33 210 9 5 863 t max 5 863 cos rh 7 546 rh 0 151 exp exp r a rh 3 3 3 if only air temperature and wind speed can be used in guangxi china gep10 can be applied r 2 0 764 nsce 0 759 rmse 0 452 mm day 1 and pbias 2 692 it can be written as 8 et 0 t max t min 4 8 t max 4 sin sin 0 114 t max sin t max t max u 2 r a t min 3 r a t min if only air temperature and duration of sunshine are available for guangxi gep11 is the best method to estimate et 0 r 2 0 892 nsce 0 885 rmse 0 313 mm day 1 and pbias 3 323 gep11 can be presented as follows 9 et 0 t min 2 t min 3 t min 3 2 776 3 cos n 1 5 r a t max t min 3 n 3 93 003 t min 4 gep12 can be employed in cases where the duration of sunshine is missing r 2 0 828 nsce 0 826 rmse 0 384 mm day 1

942 rmse 0 222 mm day 1 and pbias 0 348 outperformed the other gep models as it considered all meteorological variables as does fao pm moreover although the performance of fao pm was slightly better than that of gep15 gep15 is more convenient to use because fao pm contains a significant number of sophisticated intermediate parameters that need to be estimated feng et al 2016 and can easily use the derivative that is convenient for analyzing the sensitivity parameters yin et al 2010 the expression of gep15 is 13 et 0 n t min r a u 2 rh tan tan t min u 2 3 rh n 1 941 t max rh u 2 fig 4 shows the distribution of the four statistical parameters of the seven gep models at each of the 18 training stations from high to low latitude like the rf models gep9 gep10 and gep12 performed worse than gep11 gep13 gep14 and gep15 due to the absence of data on the duration of sunshine it is also clear that the gep models generally performed better in high latitude areas karst region than in low latitude areas non karst region fig 3 which is consistent with previous analysis from the spatial distribution of pbias we can again infer that the gep models overestimated et 0 in high latitude areas and underestimated it in low latitude areas 3 3 performance of rf based and gep based models using data from outside the training stations as mentioned in section 2 1 the rf and gep models were further spatially evaluated using climatic data collected from six meteorological stations other than the 18 meteorological stations used to train the rf and gep models in the same period 2010 2014 as mentioned in sections 3 1 and 3 2 r a can improve model performance and is a calculated variable from the location of a station and the day of the year that does not need to be observed it can thus be seen as a default variable to be used in the estimation of et 0 we evaluated the models rf8 rf15 and gep8 gep15 their performance is shown in table 4 and figs 5 and 6 as the results indicate the trend at the six stations was identical to that at the other 18 stations used in training and testing the best performance indicators at the six stations were obtained by input combinations containing the duration of sunshine rf11 rf13 rf14 and rf15 and gep11 gep13 gep14 and gep15 figs 5 and 6 also show that et 0 in the stations in pingguo was underestimated and rf and gep models performed slightly worse in pingguo than at the other stations this can be explained by the mean value of et 0 where et 0 in pingguo 2 78 mm day 1 was significantly p 0 001 larger than in hechi 2 09 mm day 1 laibin 2 18 mm day 1 mengshan 2 25 mm day 1 wuzhou 2 45 mm day 1 and dongxing 2 47 mm day 1 to this end because of the spatial variation of climatic variables more weather stations should be used to develop more robust models the superiority of rf models over gep models was also noted however the differences were minimal and the main purpose of developing the gep based models of et 0 was to generate an easy to use mathematical expression with few meteorological variables for irrigators with minimal computer skills traore and guven 2011 shiri et al 2014c yassin et al 2016 3 4 testing rf based and gep based models under climate change to evaluate the rf based and gep based models of et 0 under climate change we validated the proposed models using climatic data collected from 1960 to 2009 at six weather stations where the data typically represented trends of change in et 0 the performance is shown in table 5 and figs 7 and 8 table 5 shows that the best model was one with all climatic variables in the 15th combination the results of which were significantly close to those of the fao 56 pm model moreover figs 7 and 8 show that for the rf models at laibin et 0 recorded a significant variation and hechi et 0 had no significant variation from 1960 to 2009 divided into five periods 1960 1969 1970 1979 1980 1989 1990 1999 and 2000 2009 r 2 and rmse clearly show that the performance of the models declined with time moreover the coefficients of variation of r 2 and rmse were larger in laibin 0 037 and 0 117 mm day 1 than in hechi 0 018 and 0 077 mm day 1 the gep models showed the same tendency as the rf models which indicates that the performance of the models was sensitive to climate change climate change is the statistically significant mean climatic state of a significant change over a longer period typically 10 years or longer thus the proposed models can be applied to this period based on the results similar research related to data driven models kim and kim 2008b kumar et al 2008 tabari et al 2012 shiri et al 2012 yassin et al 2016 should be evaluated in the context of climate change 3 5 relative importance of climatic factors in estimation of et 0 the analysis of the sensitivity of et 0 to meteorological variables is important for a thorough understanding of the impact of global climate change on evapotranspiration and for water resource management yin et al 2010 the rf and gep algorithms have the ability to evaluate the importance of predictors the performances of the models with different input combinations can thus be explained by analyzing the importance of the meteorological factors on et 0 fig 9 a shows the importance of different variables for et 0 by rf method higher value of the mean decrease in gini implies greater importance breiman 2001 the order of importance of meteorological variables based on the rf method was n 43 9 t max 23 0 rh 12 1 t min 11 5 u 2 6 2 r a 3 3 and the order based on the gep method fig 9b was n 30 4 t max 4 3 rh 35 2 u 2 15 9 t min 14 3 r a 6 9 it can thus be concluded that the order of the importance of climatic factors in guangxi was n t rh and u 2 the result is consistent with the preceding analysis where n was the most important variable for estimating et 0 rh u 2 and r a ranked as third fifth and sixth respectively this was different with other studies which relate to different climate zone yin et al 2010 yassin et al 2016 4 conclusions the rf algorithm has a lot of merit and the ability to model complicated nonlinear systems however it is rarely applied in hydrological research this study aims to investigate the applicability and the generalization of rf in modeling et 0 in guangxi with different input combinations refer to the different circumstances in missing data and compare with the gep method the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the derived rf based generalization et 0 models are successfully applied in modeling et 0 with complete and incomplete meteorological variables in general the more variables in use by a model the higher chance of producing better performance moreover we proposed seven rf based models corresponding to different incomplete data circumstances specifically rf8 can be used as an alternative of the conventional hargreaves samani model since it performs better than the latter 2 the gep based generalization et 0 models are also proposed and the models produce promising results although the rf based et 0 models performed slightly better than the gep based models they are black box models the gep approach has the ability to give explicit expressions between the dependent and independent variables which is more convenient for irrigators with minimal computer skills than the rf based models therefore we recommend applying the rf based models in water balance research and the gep based models in agricultural irrigation practice 3 based on a spatial evaluation the rf and gep models were generally performed better in high latitude areas karst region than in low latitude areas non karst region and both of them overestimated et 0 at high latitude areas and underestimated at low latitude areas which were induced by the differences of sunshine duration of the two regions moreover it was found that the performance of the developed models decreased with periods 4 both of the rf and gep algorithm have the ability to evaluate the importance of predictors the order of importance of meteorological variables on et 0 in guangxi is sunshine duration air temperature relative humidity and wind speed acknowledgements this study was financially supported by the guangxi natural science foundation 2018gxnsfba281136 and 2018gxnsfga281003 and the national natural science foundation of china

10997,the effect of controlled drainage cd on nitrogen n losses from controlled irrigation ci paddy fields through subsurface drainage and ammonia volatilization av was investigated by managing water table control levels wtc with a lysimeter equipped with an automatic water table control system three drainage treatments were implemented namely controlled water table depths 1 3 the increases of the wtc resulted in a high proportion of groundwater levels below the wtc which reduced the subsurface outflow from ci paddy fields by 30 5 during the first week after fertilization total n concentrations in the 0 10 cm soil solution and subsurface drain water were higher as the wtc increased the increase of the wtc during the first week after fertilization could effectively decrease the n losses from ci paddy fields by 9 5 and the first weekly n losses through subsurface drainage and av after fertilization were reduced by 17 2 and 9 3 respectively the large reductions in subsurface outflow decreased the first weekly n losses through subsurface drainage after fertilization the retention time of shallow water in ci paddy fields was extended with the increases in wtc which may reduce the first weekly av losses after fertilization results show that the combination of ci and cd may be an effective water management method for mitigating n losses through subsurface drainage and av after fertilization from paddy fields keyword paddy field water saving irrigation controlled drainage nitrogen subsurface drain ammonia volatilization 1 introduction china is the primary rice producing country in the world the harvested area was 30 6 million hectares in 2014 fao 2014 excessive nitrogen n fertilizer is often applied to paddy soils in china to maximize rice yields lin et al 2007 the over application of n along with conventional water management practices always results in serious n losses from paddy fields peng et al 2006 yoshinaga et al 2007 aside from their economic significance to farmers n losses from paddy fields cause the eutrophication of surface water and groundwater ju et al 2009 tian et al 2007 and seriously impact on ecosystems biological diversity fraser and stevens 2008 in general previous measurements have showed that ammonia volatilization av and leaching are the main pathways of n losses from paddy fields cho et al 2002 song et al 2004 wang et al 2014 zhu et al 2000 several water fertilizer and tillage techniques may be useful for reducing n losses through av and leaching from paddy fields cao et al 2013 cui et al 2014 hayashi et al 2008 he et al 2014 luo et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 water saving irrigation wsi is an effective water management practice for reducing n leaching loss from paddy fields peng et al 2011 tan et al 2013 furthermore av losses are reduced in wsi paddy fields compared with those in flooding irrigation paddy fields dong et al 2012 xu et al 2012 controlled drainage cd has emerged as an effective method for reducing nitrate n losses from subsurface drain fields and has been tested in the united states gilliam et al 1979 woli et al 2010 canada drury et al 2001 lalonde et al 1996 sweden wesström and messing 2007 and china qu et al 2009 cd is typically applied by installing a structure in the subsurface drainage tube to manage the water table skaggs et al 2012 given the alternate drying and wetting in wsi paddy fields cd could be used in paddy fields the application of cd may effectively reduce the av losses from wsi paddy fields especially during the first week after fertilization he et al 2014 variations of groundwater levels in cd lengthen the duration of shallow water in wsi paddy fields during the first week after fertilization he et al 2014 the duration of shallow water after fertilization may increase the percolation water and subsurface outflow from wsi paddy fields during this period even though it may be helpful in reducing av horneck and holcomb 2011 moreover cd could influence the nitrification and denitrification processes by changing the redox states of paddy soils thereby affecting the transformation of the n applied the n leaching loss after fertilization from wsi paddy fields may be significantly affected by cd because of the variations in percolation water subsurface outflow and n concentrations in paddy soils however no study has focused on the effects of cd on n leaching loss during the first week after fertilization from wsi paddy fields in addition whether the changes in n transformation caused by cd affect the av losses from wsi paddy fields has not been determined therefore the present study aimed to use a lysimeter equipped with an automatic water table control system to evaluate the effects of cd on the first weekly n losses from wsi paddy fields through subsurface drainage and av after fertilization the effect of the changes in n transformation caused by cd on av losses was further evaluated by analyzing the experimental data 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site experiments were conducted in lysimeters at the kunshan experiment station in suzhou jiangsu province 31 15 50 n 120 57 43 e which is located in the lower reach of taihu lake basin kunshan has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 15 5 c the mean annual precipitation is 1097 1 mm and the annual evaporation is 1365 9 mm the soil type of the experimental field is a dark yellow hydromorphic paddy soil the saturated soil moistures vol vol 1 for the layers at 0 20 0 30 and 0 40 cm are 52 0 50 1 and 47 9 respectively table 1 shows the basic chemical and physical properties of plowed layer soils 2 2 experimental design the experiment consisted of three drainage treatments namely controlled water table depths 1 2 and 3 cwt1 cwt2 and cwt3 respectively every treatment was conducted in triplicate in nine lysimeters different water table control levels wtc were set for three drainage treatments in different rice growth stages the wtc was equated to the outlet height in cd the subsurface drainage was stopped when the groundwater levels in the paddy fields fall below the wtc the automatic water table control system installed on each drain tube was used to manage the subsurface drainage on the basis of the wtc for cwt1 the wtc was adjusted daily on the basis of the actual water table depths that were measured using a water table observation well the well was installed in the open paddy fields outside the lysimeter for cwt2 the wtc was controlled on the basis of the rice root zone depths at different stages in accordance with the water table management used in eastern canada and the midwestern united states madramootoo et al 1998 the wtc in the later tillering and milk stages was also adjusted depending on the characteristics of rice growth and cultivation needs for cwt3 the wtc was set 10 15 cm lower than that for cwt2 at different rice growth stages the wtc of different treatments in 2013 was optimized on the basis of the field measurements conducted in 2012 fig 1 shows the wtc at different rice growth stages for cwt1 cwt2 and cwt3 in 2012 and 2013 the rice variety used in this study was japonica rice jia 04 33 in 2012 the rice seedlings were transplanted on june 28 and harvested on october 24 in 2013 the rice seedlings were transplanted on june 25 and harvested on october 25 the fertilization process conducted in this experiment followed the local rice cultivation practices table 2 the irrigation management adopted for all plots was ci the thresholds of soil moisture for ci at different rice growth stages were referred to the study of he et al 2014 2 3 experimental layout experiments were conducted in nine lysimeters with a mobile shelter and gallery each lysimeter had an area of 2 5 m 2 m and a depth of 1 3 m the influence of rainfall was avoided to regulate soil moisture in ci accurately each lysimeter was individually irrigated by using a pipe installed with a water meter the subsurface drainage from each plot was drained through a water permeable tube 40 mm in inner diameter installed 1 2 m below the soil surface into the gallery subsurface drainage was conducted on the basis of the wtc by using an automatic water table control system as described in detail by peng et al 2014 2 4 field measurement and sampling the soil moisture was measured daily using a trease system 6050 3 sec when no pond water remained in the paddy fields the pond water depth in the paddy fields was measured daily using a vertical ruler the irrigation water volume was recorded using a water meter installed on the pipe of each plot the subsurface outflow was measured by a tipping bucket gauge 0 05 mm resolution the obtained data were then transferred to a computer x3100m4 ibm subsurface drain water samples were collected from the sampling devices placed on both sides of the tipping bucket gauges soil solution samples were obtained from each lysimeter at a depth of 0 10 cm water samples were collected twice at 2 day intervals after fertilization total n tn concentrations in the water samples were determined via ultraviolet spectrophotometry with resolution by alkaline potassium persulfate jianping et al 2006 using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uv 2800 unico the n losses through subsurface drainage were calculated by multiplying the subsurface outflow volume between the dates via the tn concentration in the sample taken at the latter date the av rate from the paddy fields was measured in triplicate via ventilation methods by using 20 cm high polyvinyl chloride pvc collectors with a phosphoglycerol soaked sponge as the absorbent wang et al 2004 samples were collected daily after fertilization for 1 week the samples collected in the phosphoglycerol soaked sponge from the paddy fields by the pvc collectors were immediately immersed in 450 ml of 1 0 mol l 1 kcl solution in 500 ml containers and shaken on a reciprocating shaker then ammonium n nh4 n concentrations in the solutions extracted by the av loss collectors were analyzed through the indophenol blue method state environmental protection administration of china 2002 the av rate was calculated using eq 1 and the first weekly av losses after fertilization were summed 1 r a v m a d 10 2 where rav is the av rate kg n ha 1 d 1 m denotes the ammonia n collected by the pvc collector mg a represents the cross sectional area of the pvc collector m2 and d indicates the interval for av sample collection d 2 5 chemical and statistical analysis statistical analyses were conducted on a randomized plot design following standard procedures spss 17 0 the significance was calculated on the basis of the least significant difference test at a 0 05 probability level 3 results 3 1 soil moisture and water table depth the water table depths followed the same pattern in the different treatments during the first week after fertilization fig 2 the groundwater levels in ci paddy fields were generally raised to the soil surface after irrigation which was exclusively due to groundwater recharge from the irrigation water moreover high groundwater levels lasted only 1 day after irrigation and fell sharply due to high evaporation and percolation as the wtc increased high proportions of groundwater levels below the wtc were observed in ci paddy field during the first week after fertilization fig 2 the average wtc during the first week after tillering fertilization tf were 4 2 20 and 25 cm in 2012 and 32 5 20 and 35 cm in 2013 for cwt1 cwt2 and cwt3 respectively the proportions of groundwater levels below the wtc were 87 5 37 5 and 25 0 in 2012 and 12 5 25 0 and 25 0 in 2013 for cwt1 cwt2 and cwt3 respectively the average wtc during the first week after panicle fertilization pf were 2 5 30 and 35 cm in 2012 and 36 6 30 and 45 cm in 2013 for cwt1 cwt2 and cwt3 respectively the proportions of groundwater levels below the wtc were 12 5 0 0 and 0 0 in 2012 and 25 0 50 0 and 37 5 in 2013 for cwt1 cwt2 and cwt3 respectively previous studies observed lower groundwater levels than the targeted levels in cd due to the deep seepage below the plastic curtain sanchez valero et al 2007 in the current experiment the groundwater levels in ci paddy fields were mostly higher than the wtc during the first week after fertilization due to the presence of more irrigation water than that in dry farmlands no significant difference was observed in the soil moisture of cwt1 cwt2 and cwt3 during the first week after fertilization fig 2 which was different from the results in dry farmland noory et al 2009 found that cd would increase the soil moisture in a semi arid area rainfall and groundwater capillary rise were the main water supply in the dry farmlands the groundwater capillary rise was enhanced under shallow groundwater depths ghamarnia et al 2013 huo et al 2012 therefore the soil moisture in the cd was high because of the great groundwater capillary rise by contrast irrigation water was the main water supply for paddy fields the influence of irrigation treatment on soil moisture was considerably higher than that of drainage treatment given that the same irrigation treatment was used no significant differences in soil moisture were observed with the changes in wtc the application of cd by increasing the wtc to appropriate levels may lengthen the duration of shallow water in paddy fields after fertilization during the first week after pf in 2012 the durations of shallow water in cwt1 cwt2 and cwt3 was 5 3 and 3 days respectively with the wtc increased more water was stored in paddy fields than drained thereby lengthening the duration of shallow water in ci paddy fields after fertilization 3 2 subsurface outflow the daily subsurface outflow from ci paddy fields was generally greatest after irrigation due to the increased groundwater levels fig 3 the daily subsurface outflow during the first week after fertilization was similar in magnitude and duration in the different treatments in 2012 and 2013 which was expected given their same irrigation treatment the first weekly subsurface outflow after fertilization decreased with the increasing wtc in 2012 during the first week after tf and pf the subsurface outflows were 4 05 5 90 and 6 00 mm and 12 00 21 35 and 24 75 mm for cwt1 cwt2 and cwt3 respectively in 2013 the first weekly subsurface outflows after tf and pf were 39 00 19 00 and 40 80 mm and 8 75 11 30 and 11 50 mm for cwt1 cwt2 and cwt3 respectively the increases of the wtc decreased the first weekly subsurface outflows after fertilization between 2 55 mm and 21 75 mm with an average reduction of 30 5 3 3 n concentrations in the 0 10 cm soil solution and subsurface drain water tn concentrations in the 0 10 cm soil solution were higher with the increasing wtc fig 4 for example in 2012 the average tn concentration in the 0 10 cm soil solution from cwt1 during the first week after tf was 16 40 mg l 1 which was 83 05 and 65 97 higher than those from cwt2 and cwt3 respectively during the first week after pf the average tn concentration in the 0 10 cm soil solution from cwt1 was 19 11 mg l 1 which was 7 04 and 44 70 higher than those from cwt2 and cwt3 respectively tn concentrations in the subsurface drain water from ci paddy fields tended to increase as the wtc increased fig 5 in 2012 the average tn concentration in the subsurface drain water from cwt1 during the first week after tf was 3 21 mg l 1 which was 21 97 higher than that from cwt2 and close to that from cwt3 during the first week after pf the average tn concentration in the subsurface drain water from cwt1 was 6 83 mg l 1 which was 35 27 and 70 25 higher than those from cwt2 and cwt3 respectively 3 4 n losses through subsurface drainage and ammonia volatilization the increases in the wtc reduced the first weekly n losses through subsurface drainage and av after fertilization table 3 in 2012 the first weekly n losses from cwt1 and cwt2 after tf were 15 88 and 15 41 kg n ha 1 which were 10 0 and 12 7 lower than that from cwt3 17 64 kg n ha 1 respectively significant differences in the first weekly n losses after pf were confirmed among the treatments with low values for cwt1 the first weekly n loss from cwt1 followed by pf was 5 86 kg n ha 1 which was 30 5 and 31 4 lower than those from cwt2 and cwt3 8 43 and 8 54 kg n ha 1 respectively in 2013 the first weekly n losses after tf from cwt2 21 85 kg n ha 1 were significantly decreased by 25 9 and 19 0 compared with cwt1 and cwt3 29 48 and 26 97 kg n ha 1 respectively the first weekly n losses after pf were increased with cwt2 16 47 kg n ha 1 by 17 8 and 20 3 compared with cwt1 and cwt3 13 98 and 13 69 kg n ha 1 respectively therefore the increases of the wtc reduced the average first weekly n losses by 9 5 through subsurface drainage and av after fertilization during the first week after fertilization in 2012 and 2013 the n losses through subsurface drainage decreased between 0 09 kg n ha 1 and 1 22 kg n ha 1 as the wtc increased with an average reduction of 0 28 kg n ha 1 17 2 table 3 lower weekly av losses followed by fertilization were observed as the wtc increased except for pf in 2013 table 3 the av losses during the first week after pf in 2012 and tf in 2013 were significantly reduced as the wtc increased in 2012 the first weekly av losses after pf from cwt1 were 30 0 and 35 5 lower than those from cwt2 and cwt3 respectively in 2013 the first weekly av losses after tf from cwt2 were significantly decreased by 25 1 and 15 7 compared with those from cwt1 and cwt3 respectively 4 discussions 4 1 effect of controlled drainage on subsurface outflow from paddy fields the subsurface outflow from ci paddy fields was directly influenced by the wtc the increases in wtc resulted in high proportions of groundwater levels below the wtc thereby restraining the subsurface drainage therefore the subsurface outflow after fertilization from ci paddy fields decreased as the wtc increased the cd may significantly reduce the subsurface outflow from dry farmlands compared with free drain fd and an appropriate rise in outlet height could further reduce the subsurface outflow huang and yuan 2012 in our experiment the wtc was equated to the outlet height in cd the increases in wtc reduced the subsurface outflow after fertilization from ci paddy fields which confirmed the results obtained in dry farmlands in this experiment the first weekly subsurface outflow after fertilization decreased by 30 5 as the wtc increased this result was generally less than but comparable to the other values reported in the literature adeuya et al 2012 measured a 15 24 reduction in tile flow from the fields with cd compared with fd in indiana usa drury et al 2001 observed a 26 38 reduction in tile flow from fields with cd compared to fd in ontario canada however greater than 75 reductions were also recorded in plots with cd compared with fd verma and cooke 2012 wesström and messing 2007 the large range in tile flow reductions with cd among the studies was likely due to several factors including the rise in outlet height williams et al 2015 in the experiments of verma and wesström the average outlet height in cd was 70 cm more than that in fd in our experiment the differences in wtc among the treatments ranged from 2 5 cm to 34 8 cm which were considerably lower than 70 cm the high increases in outlet height or wtc may result in a great reduction in subsurface outflow thus the reductions in the first weekly subsurface outflow after fertilization were lower in this experiment than those in the experiments of verma and wesström 4 2 effect of controlled drainage on n losses from paddy fields the mitigation mechanism of cd on weekly n losses through subsurface drainage and av after fertilization was different during the first week after fertilization the relative decrease in n losses through subsurface drainage was lower than the reduction in subsurface outflow increasing the wtc could result in high tn concentrations in the subsurface drain water previous studies also indicated that rising the outlet height in cd could increase the denitrification rates and reduce the nitrification rates williams et al 2015 thereby increasing the nh4 n concentrations in soils in addition the dilution effect was weakened due to the decreasing subsurface outflow with the increasing wtc which may also increase the nh4 n concentrations in contrast with dry farmlands nh4 n was the main form of n in the paddy soil solution due to the soil and fertilizer texture peng et al 2011 therefore tn concentrations in the subsurface drainage water increased as the wtc increased the reductions in n losses through subsurface drainage after fertilization were primarily due to the large reductions in subsurface outflow most of studies investigating the effects of cd on n losses reported similar findings in ontario canada lalonde et al 1996 measured a 40 9 95 reduction in subsurface outflow and a 62 4 95 7 reduction in n loads from cd compared with fd similarly wesström and messing 2007 found that the decrease in drainage water amounts was similar to that in n loads following cd compared with fd significant reductions in weekly av losses were observed after pf in 2012 and tf in 2013 with the increasing wtc the high wtc in cwt1 delayed the absence of shallow water during the first week after pf in 2012 which restrained the av rates and reduced the av losses he et al 2014 the wet dry cycles during the first week followed by tf in 2013 were all three times for cwt1 cwt2 and cwt3 which may be influenced by the reflooding for pesticide application on july 22 fig 2 in the first wet dry cycles cwt1 and cwt2 lengthened the duration of shallow water compared with cwt3 the av rate after tf in cwt3 peaked at 14 327 kg n ha 1 d 1 on july 18 which was 11 6 and 32 4 higher than those in cwt1 and cwt2 12 834 and 10 817 kg n ha 1 d 1 respectively fig 6 no differences in the duration of shallow water were observed among the different treatments in the last two wet dry cycles however the tn concentration in the 0 10 cm soil solution from cwt1 was higher than those from cwt2 and cwt3 after tf respectively fig 4 this difference may have resulted in the higher av rates on july 19 and 20 observed in cwt1 than those in cwt2 and cwt3 respectively fig 6 these results revealed a positive correlation between the av rates and n contents in the 0 10 cm soil solutions in wsi paddy fields xu et al 2012 5 conclusions the application of cd by increasing the wtc to an appropriate level during the first week after fertilization may effectively decrease the weekly n losses from paddy fields by 9 5 the first weekly n losses through subsurface drainage and av followed by fertilization were reduced by 17 2 and 9 3 respectively as the wtc increased the combination of ci and cd may be an effective water management method for mitigating n losses from paddy fields through subsurface drainage and av after fertilization the increases of the wtc resulted in high proportions of groundwater levels below the wtc thereby reducing the first weekly subsurface outflow from ci paddy fields by 30 5 tn concentrations in the 0 10 cm soil solution and subsurface drain water were higher as the increases in wtc reductions in the first weekly n losses through subsurface drainage after fertilization were primarily due to the large reductions in subsurface outflow amounts caused by the high wtc the high wtc helped to maintain a shallow water after fertilization in ci paddy fields which reduced the first weekly av losses from the paddy fields acknowledgments the research was

table control levels wtc with a lysimeter equipped with an automatic water table control system three drainage treatments were implemented namely controlled water table depths 1 3 the increases of the wtc resulted in a high proportion of groundwater levels below the wtc which reduced the subsurface outflow from ci paddy fields by 30 5 during the first week after fertilization total n concentrations in the 0 10 cm soil solution and subsurface drain water were higher as the wtc increased the increase of the wtc during the first week after fertilization could effectively decrease the n losses from ci paddy fields by 9 5 and the first weekly n losses through subsurface drainage and av after fertilization were reduced by 17 2 and 9 3 respectively the large reductions in subsurface outflow decreased the first weekly n losses through subsurface drainage after fertilization the retention time of shallow water in ci paddy fields was extended with the increases in wtc which may reduce the first weekly av losses after fertilization results show that the combination of ci and cd may be an effective water management method for mitigating n losses through subsurface drainage and av after fertilization from paddy fields keyword paddy field water saving irrigation controlled drainage nitrogen subsurface drain ammonia volatilization 1 introduction china is the primary rice producing country in the world the harvested area was 30 6 million hectares in 2014 fao 2014 excessive nitrogen n fertilizer is often applied to paddy soils in china to maximize rice yields lin et al 2007 the over application of n along with conventional water management practices always results in serious n losses from paddy fields peng et al 2006 yoshinaga et al 2007 aside from their economic significance to farmers n losses from paddy fields cause the eutrophication of surface water and groundwater ju et al 2009 tian et al 2007 and seriously impact on ecosystems biological diversity fraser and stevens 2008 in general previous measurements have showed that ammonia volatilization av and leaching are the main pathways of n losses from paddy fields cho et al 2002 song et al 2004 wang et al 2014 zhu et al 2000 several water fertilizer and tillage techniques may be useful for reducing n losses through av and leaching from paddy fields cao et al 2013 cui et al 2014 hayashi et al 2008 he et al 2014 luo et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 water saving irrigation wsi is an effective water management practice for reducing n leaching loss from paddy fields peng et al 2011 tan et al 2013 furthermore av losses are reduced in wsi paddy fields compared with those in flooding irrigation paddy fields dong et al 2012 xu et al 2012 controlled drainage cd has emerged as an effective method for reducing nitrate n losses from subsurface drain fields and has been tested in the united states gilliam et al 1979 woli et al 2010 canada drury et al 2001 lalonde et al 1996 sweden wesström and messing 2007 and china qu et al 2009 cd is typically applied by installing a structure in the subsurface drainage tube to manage the water table skaggs et al 2012 given the alternate drying and wetting in wsi paddy fields cd could be used in paddy fields the application of cd may effectively reduce the av losses from wsi paddy fields especially during the first week after fertilization he et al 2014 variations of groundwater levels in cd lengthen the duration of shallow water in wsi paddy fields during the first week after fertilization he et al 2014 the duration of shallow water after fertilization may increase the percolation water and subsurface outflow from wsi paddy fields during this period even though it may be helpful in reducing av horneck and holcomb 2011 moreover cd could influence the nitrification and denitrification processes by changing the redox states of paddy soils thereby affecting the transformation of the n applied the n leaching loss after fertilization from wsi paddy fields may be significantly affected by cd because of the variations in percolation water subsurface outflow and n concentrations in paddy soils however no study has focused on the effects of cd on n leaching loss during the first week after fertilization from wsi paddy fields in addition whether the changes in n transformation caused by cd affect the av losses from wsi paddy fields has not been determined therefore the present study aimed to use a lysimeter equipped with an automatic water table control system to evaluate the effects of cd on the first weekly n losses from wsi paddy fields through subsurface drainage and av after fertilization the effect of the changes in n transformation caused by cd on av losses was further evaluated by analyzing the experimental data 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site experiments were conducted in lysimeters at the kunshan experiment station in suzhou jiangsu province 31 15 50 n 120 57 43 e which is located in the lower reach of taihu lake basin kunshan has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 15 5 c the mean annual precipitation is 1097 1 mm and the annual evaporation is 1365 9 mm the soil type of the experimental field is a dark yellow hydromorphic paddy soil the saturated soil moistures vol vol 1 for the layers at 0 20 0 30 and 0 40 cm are 52 0 50 1 and 47 9 respectively table 1 shows the basic chemical and physical properties of plowed layer soils 2 2 experimental design the experiment consisted of three drainage treatments namely controlled water table depths 1 2 and 3 cwt1 cwt2 and cwt3 respectively every treatment was conducted in triplicate in nine lysimeters different water table control levels wtc were set for three drainage treatments in different rice growth stages the wtc was equated to the outlet height in cd the subsurface drainage was stopped when the groundwater levels in the paddy fields fall below the wtc the automatic water table control system installed on each drain tube was used to manage the subsurface drainage on the basis of the wtc for cwt1 the wtc was adjusted daily on the basis of the actual water table depths that were measured using a water table observation well the well was installed in the open paddy fields outside the lysimeter for cwt2 the wtc was controlled on the basis of the rice root zone depths at different stages in accordance with the water table management used in eastern canada and the midwestern united states madramootoo et al 1998 the wtc in the later tillering and milk stages was also adjusted depending on the characteristics of rice growth and cultivation needs for cwt3 the wtc was set 10 15 cm lower than that for cwt2 at different rice growth stages the wtc of different treatments in 2013 was optimized on the basis of the field measurements conducted in 2012 fig 1 shows the wtc at different rice growth stages for cwt1 cwt2 and cwt3 in 2012 and 2013 the rice variety used in this study was japonica rice jia 04 33 in 2012 the rice seedlings were transplanted on june 28 and harvested on october 24 in 2013 the rice seedlings were transplanted on june 25 and harvested on october 25 the fertilization process conducted in this experiment followed the local rice cultivation practices table 2 the irrigation management adopted for all plots was ci the thresholds of soil moisture for ci at different rice growth stages were referred to the study of he et al 2014 2 3 experimental layout experiments were conducted in nine lysimeters with a mobile shelter and gallery each lysimeter had an area of 2 5 m 2 m and a depth of 1 3 m the influence of rainfall was avoided to regulate soil moisture in ci accurately each lysimeter was individually irrigated by using a pipe installed with a water meter the subsurface drainage from each plot was drained through a water permeable tube 40 mm in inner diameter installed 1 2 m below the soil surface into the gallery subsurface drainage was conducted on the basis of the wtc by using an automatic water table control system as described in detail by peng et al 2014 2 4 field measurement and sampling the soil moisture was measured daily using a trease system 6050 3 sec when no pond water remained in the paddy fields the pond water depth in the paddy fields was measured daily using a vertical ruler the irrigation water volume was recorded using a water meter installed on the pipe of each plot the subsurface outflow was measured by a tipping bucket gauge 0 05 mm resolution the obtained data were then transferred to a computer x3100m4 ibm subsurface drain water samples were collected from the sampling devices placed on both sides of the tipping bucket gauges soil solution samples were obtained from each lysimeter at a depth of 0 10 cm water samples were collected twice at 2 day intervals after fertilization total n tn concentrations in the water samples were determined via ultraviolet spectrophotometry with resolution by alkaline potassium persulfate jianping et al 2006 using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uv 2800 unico the n losses through subsurface drainage were calculated by multiplying the subsurface outflow volume between the dates via the tn concentration in the sample taken at the latter date the av rate from the paddy fields was measured in triplicate via ventilation methods by using 20 cm high polyvinyl chloride pvc collectors with a phosphoglycerol soaked sponge as the absorbent wang et al 2004 samples were collected daily after fertilization for 1 week the samples collected in the phosphoglycerol soaked sponge from the paddy fields by the pvc collectors were immediately immersed in 450 ml of 1 0 mol l 1 kcl solution in 500 ml containers and shaken on a reciprocating shaker then ammonium n nh4 n concentrations in the solutions extracted by the av loss collectors were analyzed through the indophenol blue method state environmental protection administration of china 2002 the av rate was calculated using eq 1 and the first weekly av losses after fertilization were summed 1 r a v m a d 10 2 where rav is the av rate kg n ha 1 d 1 m denotes the ammonia n collected by the pvc collector mg a represents the cross sectional area of the pvc collector m2 and d indicates the interval for av sample collection d 2 5 chemical and statistical analysis statistical analyses were conducted on a randomized plot design following standard procedures spss 17 0 the significance was calculated on the basis of the least significant difference test at a 0 05 probability level 3 results 3 1 soil moisture and water table depth the water table depths followed the same pattern in the different treatments during the first week after fertilization fig 2 the groundwater levels in ci paddy fields were generally raised to the soil surface after irrigation which was exclusively due to groundwater recharge from the irrigation water moreover high groundwater levels lasted only 1 day after irrigation and fell sharply due to high evaporation and percolation as the wtc increased high proportions of groundwater levels below the wtc were observed in ci paddy field during the first week after fertilization fig 2 the average wtc during the first week after tillering fertilization tf were 4 2 20 and 25 cm in 2012 and 32 5 20 and 35 cm in 2013 for cwt1 cwt2 and cwt3 respectively the proportions of groundwater levels below the wtc were 87 5 37 5 and 25 0 in 2012 and 12 5 25 0 and 25 0 in 2013 for cwt1 cwt2 and cwt3 respectively the average wtc during the first week after panicle fertilization pf were 2 5 30 and 35 cm in 2012 and 36 6 30 and 45 cm in 2013 for cwt1 cwt2 and cwt3 respectively the proportions of groundwater levels below the wtc were 12 5 0 0 and 0 0 in 2012 and 25 0 50 0 and 37 5 in 2013 for cwt1 cwt2 and cwt3 respectively previous studies observed lower groundwater levels than the targeted levels in cd due to the deep seepage below the plastic curtain sanchez valero et al 2007 in the current experiment the groundwater levels in ci paddy fields were mostly higher than the wtc during the first week after fertilization due to the presence of more irrigation water than that in dry farmlands no significant difference was observed in the soil moisture of cwt1 cwt2 and cwt3 during the first week after fertilization fig 2 which was different from the results in dry farmland noory et al 2009 found that cd would increase the soil moisture in a semi arid area rainfall and groundwater capillary rise were the main water supply in the dry farmlands the groundwater capillary rise was enhanced under shallow groundwater depths ghamarnia et al 2013 huo et al 2012 therefore the soil moisture in the cd was high because of the great groundwater capillary rise by contrast irrigation water was the main water supply for paddy fields the influence of irrigation treatment on soil moisture was considerably higher than that of drainage treatment given that the same irrigation treatment was used no significant differences in soil moisture were observed with the changes in wtc the application of cd by increasing the wtc to appropriate levels may lengthen the duration of shallow water in paddy fields after fertilization during the first week after pf in 2012 the durations of shallow water in cwt1 cwt2 and cwt3 was 5 3 and 3 days respectively with the wtc increased more water was stored in paddy fields than drained thereby lengthening the duration of shallow water in ci paddy fields after fertilization 3 2 subsurface outflow the daily subsurface outflow from ci paddy fields was generally greatest after irrigation due to the increased groundwater levels fig 3 the daily subsurface outflow during the first week after fertilization was similar in magnitude and duration in the different treatments in 2012 and 2013 which was expected given their same irrigation treatment the first weekly subsurface outflow after fertilization decreased with the increasing wtc in 2012 during the first week after tf and pf the subsurface outflows were 4 05 5 90 and 6 00 mm and 12 00 21 35 and 24 75 mm for cwt1 cwt2 and cwt3 respectively in 2013 the first weekly subsurface outflows after tf and pf were 39 00 19 00 and 40 80 mm and 8 75 11 30 and 11 50 mm for cwt1 cwt2 and cwt3 respectively the increases of the wtc decreased the first weekly subsurface outflows after fertilization between 2 55 mm and 21 75 mm with an average reduction of 30 5 3 3 n concentrations in the 0 10 cm soil solution and subsurface drain water tn concentrations in the 0 10 cm soil solution were higher with the increasing wtc fig 4 for example in 2012 the average tn concentration in the 0 10 cm soil solution from cwt1 during the first week after tf was 16 40 mg l 1 which was 83 05 and 65 97 higher than those from cwt2 and cwt3 respectively during the first week after pf the average tn concentration in the 0 10 cm soil solution from cwt1 was 19 11 mg l 1 which was 7 04 and 44 70 higher than those from cwt2 and cwt3 respectively tn concentrations in the subsurface drain water from ci paddy fields tended to increase as the wtc increased fig 5 in 2012 the average tn concentration in the subsurface drain water from cwt1 during the first week after tf was 3 21 mg l 1 which was 21 97 higher than that from cwt2 and close to that from cwt3 during the first week after pf the average tn concentration in the subsurface drain water from cwt1 was 6 83 mg l 1 which was 35 27 and 70 25 higher than those from cwt2 and cwt3 respectively 3 4 n losses through subsurface drainage and ammonia volatilization the increases in the wtc reduced the first weekly n losses through subsurface drainage and av after fertilization table 3 in 2012 the first weekly n losses from cwt1 and cwt2 after tf were 15 88 and 15 41 kg n ha 1 which were 10 0 and 12 7 lower than that from cwt3 17 64 kg n ha 1 respectively significant differences in the first weekly n losses after pf were confirmed among the treatments with low values for cwt1 the first weekly n loss from cwt1 followed by pf was 5 86 kg n ha 1 which was 30 5 and 31 4 lower than those from cwt2 and cwt3 8 43 and 8 54 kg n ha 1 respectively in 2013 the first weekly n losses after tf from cwt2 21 85 kg n ha 1 were significantly decreased by 25 9 and 19 0 compared with cwt1 and cwt3 29 48 and 26 97 kg n ha 1 respectively the first weekly n losses after pf were increased with cwt2 16 47 kg n ha 1 by 17 8 and 20 3 compared with cwt1 and cwt3 13 98 and 13 69 kg n ha 1 respectively therefore the increases of the wtc reduced the average first weekly n losses by 9 5 through subsurface drainage and av after fertilization during the first week after fertilization in 2012 and 2013 the n losses through subsurface drainage decreased between 0 09 kg n ha 1 and 1 22 kg n ha 1 as the wtc increased with an average reduction of 0 28 kg n ha 1 17 2 table 3 lower weekly av losses followed by fertilization were observed as the wtc increased except for pf in 2013 table 3 the av losses during the first week after pf in 2012 and tf in 2013 were significantly reduced as the wtc increased in 2012 the first weekly av losses after pf from cwt1 were 30 0 and 35 5 lower than those from cwt2 and cwt3 respectively in 2013 the first weekly av losses after tf from cwt2 were significantly decreased by 25 1 and 15 7 compared with those from cwt1 and cwt3 respectively 4 discussions 4 1 effect of controlled drainage on subsurface outflow from paddy fields the subsurface outflow from ci paddy fields was directly influenced by the wtc the increases in wtc resulted in high proportions of groundwater levels below the wtc thereby restraining the subsurface drainage therefore the subsurface outflow after fertilization from ci paddy fields decreased as the wtc increased the cd may significantly reduce the subsurface outflow from dry farmlands compared with free drain fd and an appropriate rise in outlet height could further reduce the subsurface outflow huang and yuan 2012 in our experiment the wtc was equated to the outlet height in cd the increases in wtc reduced the subsurface outflow after fertilization from ci paddy fields which confirmed the results obtained in dry farmlands in this experiment the first weekly subsurface outflow after fertilization decreased by 30 5 as the wtc increased this result was generally less than but comparable to the other values reported in the literature adeuya et al 2012 measured a 15 24 reduction in tile flow from the fields with cd compared with fd in indiana usa drury et al 2001 observed a 26 38 reduction in tile flow from fields with cd compared to fd in ontario canada however greater than 75 reductions were also recorded in plots with cd compared with fd verma and cooke 2012 wesström and messing 2007 the large range in tile flow reductions with cd among the studies was likely due to several factors including the rise in outlet height williams et al 2015 in the experiments of verma and wesström the average outlet height in cd was 70 cm more than that in fd in our experiment the differences in wtc among the treatments ranged from 2 5 cm to 34 8 cm which were considerably lower than 70 cm the high increases in outlet height or wtc may result in a great reduction in subsurface outflow thus the reductions in the first weekly subsurface outflow after fertilization were lower in this experiment than those in the experiments of verma and wesström 4 2 effect of controlled drainage on n losses from paddy fields the mitigation mechanism of cd on weekly n losses through subsurface drainage and av after fertilization was different during the first week after fertilization the relative decrease in n losses through subsurface drainage was lower than the reduction in subsurface outflow increasing the wtc could result in high tn concentrations in the subsurface drain water previous studies also indicated that rising the outlet height in cd could increase the denitrification rates and reduce the nitrification rates williams et al 2015 thereby increasing the nh4 n concentrations in soils in addition the dilution effect was weakened due to the decreasing subsurface outflow with the increasing wtc which may also increase the nh4 n concentrations in contrast with dry farmlands nh4 n was the main form of n in the paddy soil solution due to the soil and fertilizer texture peng et al 2011 therefore tn concentrations in the subsurface drainage water increased as the wtc increased the reductions in n losses through subsurface drainage after fertilization were primarily due to the large reductions in subsurface outflow most of studies investigating the effects of cd on n losses reported similar findings in ontario canada lalonde et al 1996 measured a 40 9 95 reduction in subsurface outflow and a 62 4 95 7 reduction in n loads from cd compared with fd similarly wesström and messing 2007 found that the decrease in drainage water amounts was similar to that in n loads following cd compared with fd significant reductions in weekly av losses were observed after pf in 2012 and tf in 2013 with the increasing wtc the high wtc in cwt1 delayed the absence of shallow water during the first week after pf in 2012 which restrained the av rates and reduced the av losses he et al 2014 the wet dry cycles during the first week followed by tf in 2013 were all three times for cwt1 cwt2 and cwt3 which may be influenced by the reflooding for pesticide application on july 22 fig 2 in the first wet dry cycles cwt1 and cwt2 lengthened the duration of shallow water compared with cwt3 the av rate after tf in cwt3 peaked at 14 327 kg n ha 1 d 1 on july 18 which was 11 6 and 32 4 higher than those in cwt1 and cwt2 12 834 and 10 817 kg n ha 1 d 1 respectively fig 6 no differences in the duration of shallow water were observed among the different treatments in the last two wet dry cycles however the tn concentration in the 0 10 cm soil solution from cwt1 was higher than those from cwt2 and cwt3 after tf respectively fig 4 this difference may have resulted in the higher av rates on july 19 and 20 observed in cwt1 than those in cwt2 and cwt3 respectively fig 6 these results revealed a positive correlation between the av rates and n contents in the 0 10 cm soil solutions in wsi paddy fields xu et al 2012 5 conclusions the application of cd by increasing the wtc to an appropriate level during the first week after fertilization may effectively decrease the weekly n losses from paddy fields by 9 5 the first weekly n losses through subsurface drainage and av followed by fertilization were reduced by 17 2 and 9 3 respectively as the wtc increased the combination of ci and cd may be an effective water management method for mitigating n losses from paddy fields through subsurface drainage and av after fertilization the increases of the wtc resulted in high proportions of groundwater levels below the wtc thereby reducing the first weekly subsurface outflow from ci paddy fields by 30 5 tn concentrations in the 0 10 cm soil solution and subsurface drain water were higher as the increases in wtc reductions in the first weekly n losses through subsurface drainage after fertilization were primarily due to the large reductions in subsurface outflow amounts caused by the high wtc the high wtc helped to maintain a shallow water after fertilization in ci paddy fields which reduced the first weekly av losses from the paddy fields acknowledgments the research was

very vital undoubtedly it is not possible to achieve sustainable development in agriculture without preventing the loss of water and the use of new technologies bodner et al 2015 membrane bioreactor mbr is nowadays a feasible option for resolving lacking water due to drought sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 drought stress is one of the most important inhibitors of plant production in lots of arid and semi arid areas of the world reddy et al 2004 in addition to reducing plants yield drought stress causes changes in plant physiological traits and also can bring about the loss of beneficial soil microorganisms elliott and wildung 1992 drought stress mainly leads to reduced plant growth nutritional disturbance loreto and centritto 2008 reduction of photosynthesis and increased oxidative stress in plants several factors cause the plants to tolerate drought stress through the changes made in physiological and biochemical mechanisms and plant hormonal balance ramoliya et al 2004 as it was stated by benabdellah et al 2011 beneficial soil microorganisms exhibit a positive role when the plants encounter with environmental stresses soil microorganisms as so imperative component in the soil system can enhance plants tolerance against abiotic stresses improve plant nutrition and protect it when drought stress occurs ruiz lozano et al 2012 addition of beneficial microorganisms to the soil rhizosphere is an effective approach in sustainable agricultural development reducing the use of chemical inputs increasing soil health and fertility enhancing environmental protection and improving crops quality owen et al 2015 the symbiosis of plant with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus amf is one of the most promising ways to overcome drought stress amf decreases the adverse effects of drought stress by improving the absorption of nutrients better and faster access to moisture and osmotic regulation wu et al 2013 inoculation of plant with amf can regulate the hydraulic conduction of the root for transferring of water to the stem and accelerate the water conveyance to plant leaves zhao et al 2015 ortiz et al 2015 claimed that not only the symbiotic fungi but also the growth promoting rhizospheric bacteria can develop root system and increase plant water absorption also these bacteria are able to increase the expression of genes responsible for providing resistance against abiotic stresses investigations have shown that amf can coexist with medicinal plants and subsequently execute a positive effect on plant growth and yield toussaint et al 2007 researchers reported that under drought stress condition amf and pseudomonas fluorescens bacterium pfb brought about a significant increase in growth and dry matter production through the improvement of plant nutritional status rahimzadeh and pirzad 2017 microorganisms play a conspicuous function in the adjustment of drought stress by osmotic regulation through increasing of compatible solutes such as proline ruiz lozano et al 2008 basically osmotic regulators such as soluble sugars and proline are produced under drought stress conditions to reduce cell water potential and help regulate osmotic balance osmotic regulation is considered as an important mechanism for tolerance to drought stress yooyongwech et al 2016 in drought stress reduction of osmotic potential in tissues is due to increased proline content by regulating the proline biosynthesis pathway which in consequence maintains cellular water and protects membranes and proteins also antioxidant enzymes act as a defensive barrier against plant tensions pyngrope et al 2013 the action of antioxidant enzymes in stress tolerable plants is generally high so that there is a high correlation between drought stress tolerance and antioxidant activity kosar et al 2015 in addition photosynthesis indices such as chlorophyll content minimum fo and maximum fm chlorophyll fluorescence and the variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence ratio fv fm can be used as criteria for identifying drought stress tolerance mirshad and puthur 2016 purple coneflower echinacea purpurea l moench originates from north america and as a perennial herb is a member of the

of irrigation water and precipitation in different irrigation regimes and two harvest times have been reported in table 2 in first harvest water use efficiency was calculated from sowing in may 2016 to harvest time in november 2016 in spite of high rainfall from november 2016 to march 2017 because of cold weather fig 1 plants were in rosette stage during this period and therefore water use efficiency was calculated for second harvest since the plant re growth and emergence of vegetative buds in march 2017 to harvest time in september 2017 as it was reported by howell 1994 water use

depletions the highest amount of chlorophyll a was observed in combined use of chemical p with amf sole consumption of amf and 100 chemical p treatment table 10 in the irrigation regime of 25 available water depletion the highest content of chlorophyll b was observed in combined use of chemical p with amf and sole consumption of amf table 10 however with an increase in irrigation intervals to 50 available water depletion application of chemical p with amf and 100 chemical p treatment could show better results than other treatments in 75 available water depletion use of chemical p with amf and 100 chemical p application caused chlorophyll b content to be increased by 59 and 44 respectively than control table 10 the amount of chlorophyll a b in second harvest showed a decrease of 14 in respect of the first harvest table 6 in irrigation regime of 25 available water depletion chlorophyll a b was increased by 9 and 8 than control in chemical p combination with pfb and sole consumption of pfb respectively table 10 by the increase of available water depletion to 50 and 75 application of 100 chemical p chemical p with amf and sole application of amf could create better results than other treatments in regard of chlorophyll a b content the highest leaf carotenoids were obtained in combination of chemical p with pfb and sole application of pfb which in comparison with control showed an increase of 22 and 19 respectively after pfb amf showed a superior capability to increase leaf carotenoids compared to the control table 5 3 5 soluble carbohydrates and proline in both harvests an increase in water stress intensityup to 50 available water depletion increased the amount of soluble carbohydrates however in the irrigation regime of 75 available water depletion the amount of soluble carbohydrates in plant leaf was reduced table 8 in 25 available water depletion application of chemical p with pfb could increase the amout of soluble carbohydrates in respect of 100 chemical p and control table 10 in 50 available water depletion application of chemical p with amf and pfb compared to control showed an increase of 26 and 17 in the amount of soluble carbohydrates respectively table 10 however regarding the soluble carbohydrates no significant differences were observed among p supply treatments in irrigation regime of 75 available water depletion in the first harvest increase in water stress intensity made a significant increase in proline content so that the highest percentage of proline was occurred in 75 available water depletion which was 36 higher than 25 depletion table 8 in the second harvest at 25 and 50 available water depletion the amount of proline was higher than the first harvest but there was no significant difference among various irrigation regimes table 8 in 25 of available water depletion application of chemical p with pfb could increase proline content compared to other treatments table 10 by rising in irrigation intervals to 50 and 75 available water depletion application of 100 chemical p chemical p with amf and sole consumption of amf could increase proline content in comparison with other treatments 3 6 the activity of catalase and peroxidase enzymes catalase activity was increased by enhanced water stress intensity so that the increase of catalase activity in 75 available water depletion compared to 25 depletion was 33 table 4 on the other hand the highest levels of catalase activity were found to be 8 93 and 9 39 μmol mg 1 protein min 1 in the combined use of chemical p with amf and sole application of amf respectively table 5 also the catalase activity in the first harvest compared to the second one showed a significant increase table 6 raise in irrigation intervals intensified the peroxidase activity so that the peroxidase activity in 75 available water depletion compared to 25 depletion showed an increase of 65 however the amount of peroxidase in 25 and 50 available water depletion were not significantly different table 4 3 7 biomass yield and its components p resources irrigation regimes and harvest time showed a significant influence on all biomass yield components table 7 the irrigation regimes and harvest time interaction was momentous on flower leaf and total yield also the interaction of p sources with harvest time was significant on biomass and yield components table 7 as the irrigation intervals were increased a decreasing trend was observed in flower yield in both of harvests the lowest flower yield was obtained in 75 available water depletion which showed a decrease of 35 and 34 compared to 25 depletion respectively table 8 from the other point of view the highest flower yield 114 g m 2 in the first harvest was occurred in the combined use of chemical p with amf which showed a significant difference with pfb and control but had no significant difference with other treatments table 9 the highest flower yield was observed in 100 chemical p treatment in the second harvest table 9 similar to the chemical p treatment the use of chemical p with amf or pfb had a relatively high ability to increase the flower yield while there was no significant differentiation among them table 9 increase in irrigation intervals reduced the yield of the leaf so that in the first and second harvest leaf yield reduction in 75 available water depletion compared to 25 depletion was 26 and 29 respectively table 8 in both harvests the highest yield of leaf 98 3 and 169 2 g m 2 respectively was obtained in the combined use chemical p with amf table 9 in contrast for both harvests the lowest leaf yield 84 1 and 120 8 g m 2 respectively was occurred in control treatment of p supply table 9 the yield of the stem was decreased by increasing in irrigation intervals so that the reduction in stem yield in 75 available water depletion compared with 25 depletion was 21 table 4 however stem yield did not show the statistically significant difference in irrigation regimes of 50 and 75 available water depletion in the first harvest no significant differences were observed among different combinations of fertilizers table 9 in second harvest the highest stem yield 85 5 g m 2 was observed in the combined use of chemical p with amf which of course did not show any significant difference with 100 chemical p treatment table 9 increase in water stress intensity reduced the total yield of e purpurea so that plant total yield reduction in 75 available water depletion compared to 25 depletion was 28 and 30 respectively table 8 in the first harvest the highest total yield 284 3 g m 2 was obtained in the complete supply of p from the chemical source table 9 also in second harvest application of chemical p with amf compared to control increased the total yield of e purpurea by 39 table 9 root yield showed a decreasing trend as the water stress was intensified so that in 75 of available water depletion root yield reduced by 30 in comparison with 25 depletion however irrigation regimes of 25 and 50 available water depletion had no significant difference in respect to root yield table 4 the highest root yield of e purpurea 1270 g m 2 was obtained by consumption of 100 p fertilizer from the chemical source which did not show any significant difference with the application of chemical p with amf or pfb table 5 integrated use of chemical p with amf and chemical p with pfb caused a significant increase in root yield compared to control 48 and 40 respectively table 5 3 8 water use efficiency wue water use efficiency was significantly affected by irrigation intervals p sources and harvest time table 7 also the interaction of p sources and harvest time on water use efficiency was significant water use efficiency showed a decreasing pattern as the irrigation intervals were increased so that the water use efficiency in irrigation interval of 75 available water depletion showed a decrease of 18 compared to 25 depletion table 4 in first harvest the highest rate of water use efficiency 0 502 kg m 3 was found in 100 chemical p treatment which did not show significant differences with the combination of p fertilizer and amf table 9 in second harvest the treatment of p fertilizer with amf significantly increased the water use efficiency by 40 compared to the control table 9 4 discussion 4 1 spad value and chlorophyll fluorescence in this study the increase in irrigation intervals caused a disturbance in the spad value and chlorophyll fluorescence indices increase in irrigation intervals reduced the spad value and the variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence ratio fv fm while it improved the minimum fo and maximum fm fluorescence of chlorophyll the leaf chlorophyll content depends on the plant metabolism the activity of the rubisco enzyme and the amount of leaf nitrogen under environmental stress conditions the connection between chlorophylls and chloroplast proteins is weakened and chlorophylls may be destroyed watanabe et al 1994 also the increase of fo and fm indices indicates that there is a problem or degradation in photosystem ii protein d1 and another part of the photosystem or probable interruption of energy transfer to the optical center of photosynthesis reaction calatayud et al 2006 the reduction of fv fm is due to a disruption of the chloroplast structure which reduces the photochemical capacity of photosystem ii porcar castell et al 2014 the presence of any disturbance and alteration in the pigments of photosystem ii was resulted in a reduction of the maximum quantum function in the photosystem under conditions compatible with darkness fracheboud and leipner 2003 the results of this investigation revealed that the highest leaf relative chlorophyll content was found in the application of amf or its combination with p fertilizer also the sole application of chemical p or its combination with amf could somewhat improve chlorophyll fluorescence indices according to studies amf can increase drought tolerance by improving chlorophyll fluorescence indices and photochemical capacity of photosystem ii li et al 2015 pinior et al 2005 moreover the higher ratio of variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence at different irrigation intervals in the second harvest than the first one is probably due to the plant adaptation to environmental conditions and differences in weather conditions on the other hand in conditions of drought stress the increase of variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence ratio can be attributed to the decrease of temperature in the early stages of plant growth fig 1 4 2 the amount of photosynthetic pigments in 25 available water depletion application of chemical p with pfb and sole consumption of pfb showed high ability to increase chlorophyll a chlorophyll a b and carotenoids in plant leaves also by the increase of irrigation intervals to 50 and 75 available water depletion application of amf and 100 chemical p could act better than other treatments it seems that consumption of p fertilizer sources could increase the content of chlorophyll in e purpurea by improving the growth of root and increasing the absorption of plant required nutrients it was stated by hosseinzadeh et al 2016 that increase in rubisco carboxylase activity and leaf n concentration would increase leaf chlorophyll content also it has been stated that plant n concentration would be increased by p consumption smith and read 2010 probably application of 100 chemical phosphorus by increasing nitrogen concentration attarzadeh et al 2019 can partly increase leaf chlorophyll content therefore the utilization of 100 p fertilization could increase the leaf chlorophyll content probably due to enhancement in plant n concentration pfb also causes more chlorophyll synthesis owing to the release of n in soil rhizosphere under stress condition mineral nutrients are able to preserve carbon dioxide maintain photosynthesis and care for chloroplast han and lee 2005 increase in chlorophyll content by plant growth stimulator bacteria and amf has also been confirmed by other scholars baset et al 2010 vafadar et al 2014 the effect of different irrigation regimes revealed that the amount of chlorophyll content in e purpurea decreased with increasing of drought stress in fact the free radicals attack produced by the oxidative stress was an effective factor in reducing chlorophyll content under drought stress conditions khorasaninejad et al 2018 4 3 antioxidant enzymes soluble sugar and proline the present study showed that amf and pfb inoculation ameliorated the hostile effects of water stress the superior activity of antioxidant enzymes like catalase in amf or pfb inoculated plants rather than no inoculated ones approves this claim it was stated by koussevitzky et al 2008 that beneficial soil microorganisms are effective in plant reaction to water stress through controlling oxidative reactions and impelling antioxidant defense under drought stress conditions antioxidant systems need to be in a coordinated and systemic way to restrain the harmful effects and protect the plant blokhina et al 2003 in general the highest level of these activities may occur when cellular damage increases the accumulation of proline and soluble carbohydrates in plant shoot was influenced by inoculation of beneficial soil microorganisms increased concentration of soluble carbohydrates and proline in amf and pfb inoculated plants can create satisfactory condition for water absorption actually the accumulation of proline in plant tissues can cause osmotic regulation under environmental stress conditions molinari et al 2007 ortiz et al 2015 stated that inoculation of plants with beneficial soil microorganisms increased the concentration of compatible solutes and activity of antioxidant enzymes possibly in the irrigation regimes of 25 and 50 available water depletion the increase of proline content in second harvest than the first one is due to root development attarzadeh et al 2019 which in turn results in the further absorption of soil nutrients the improvement of growth indices and consequently the accumulation of organic matters such as proline 4 4 biomass yield increase in water stress intensity caused the biomass yield components to show a decreasing trend on the other hand in the second harvest the combination of chemical p with amf similar to chemical p treatment showed a high ability to increase the biomass yield components of e purpurea the raise of growth indices in amf and pfb inoculated plants can be attributed to higher leaf chlorophyll content and improved activity of antioxidant enzymes increase of compatible solutes for instance proline and regulation of antioxidant enzymes activity has been reported by ortiz et al 2015 as an effective strategy to improve plant growth in water stress conditions by spreading the hyphae and developing the root system amf provides more water which results in the production and accumulation of more dry matter in the plant augé 2001 it has also been reported that bio fertilizers can enhance photosynthetic productions and motivate plant growth improving the plant nutrients absorption han and lee 2005 as stated by lucy et al 2004 bio fertilizers influence the growth and development of plants and increase growth indices through the production of growth promoting hormones like gibberellin cytokinin and auxin it can be concluded that increase of flowers leaves and total yield of e purpurea in second harvest than the first one is due to the adaptation of the plant to environmental conditions root development better absorption of water and essential nutrients and differences in weather conditions jalil sheshbahreh et al 2019 reported that due to osmotic pressure around the root in drought stress conditions the absorption of nutrients in e purpurea was reduced but soil application of beneficial microorganisms improved the efficiency of nutrients absorption and increased the biological yield also vafadar et al 2014 reported that an increase in the growth indices including biomass yield in plants inoculated with amf and pfb was due to increased chlorophyll content and improved photosynthetic activity 4 5 water use efficiency wue biological yield and water use efficiency were reduced by drought stress in irrigation intervals of 50 and 75 available water depletion in contrast root growth water absorption and water use efficiency were increased by application of 100 chemical p and its combination with amf as it was stated by zhao et al 2015 plant nutrition has a positive effect on water use efficiency in conditions where soil moisture is less than optimal in the integrated feeding systems plant leaf area is increased due to the improvement of root system and better uptake of soil water and nutrients increased leaf area leads to higher light absorption efficient photosynthesis and better plant biomass accumulation romero munar et al 2017 production of photosynthetic materials will result in improved biological yield and water use efficiency jalilian et al 2012 jalil sheshbahreh et al 2019 reported that water use efficiency in e purpurea is decreased due to the reduced root water absorption in drought stress conditions but the use of beneficial soil microorganisms improved water use efficiency 5 conclusion in conclusion the consequences of this investigation showed that an increase in water stress intensity had a negative effect on a b and chlorophyll a b content the biomass yield and water use efficiency increase in irrigation intervals enhanced the minimum and maximum fluorescence proline content and the activity of catalase during the irrigation regime of 25 available water depletion the highest amount of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll a b were obtained in combined use chemical p with pfb and sole application of pfb by increasing in irrigation intervals to 50 and 75 available water depletion application of 100 chemical p combined use of chemical p with amf and sole consumption of amf could act better than other treatments in respect to chlorophyll content after pfb amf showed superior capability to increase carotenoids of leaf rather than control amf and pfb inoculation or their combinations with chemical p were effective in increase of soluble carbohydrates 26 and 17 proline 39 and 22 and antioxidant activity of catalase about 24 and peroxidase and thus they increased the biological yield it seems that in plants inoculated with amf and pfb due to the increased activity of antioxidant enzymes and chlorophyll content an increase in the rate of growth indices has occurred in addition to the application of 100 chemical phosphorus in e purpurea which increased root yield the combination of p fertilizer with amf and pfb caused a significant increase in root dry yield compared to control in summary this investigation outcome showed bio fertilizers prosperous symbiosis with e purpurea in improvement of physiological characteristics increase of biological yield water use efficiency and reduction of water stress hostile effects it also seems that amf and pfb had better ameliorating effect under drought stress and normal conditions respectively funding this study was financially assisted by the

very vital undoubtedly it is not possible to achieve sustainable development in agriculture without preventing the loss of water and the use of new technologies bodner et al 2015 membrane bioreactor mbr is nowadays a feasible option for resolving lacking water due to drought sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 drought stress is one of the most important inhibitors of plant production in lots of arid and semi arid areas of the world reddy et al 2004 in addition to reducing plants yield drought stress causes changes in plant physiological traits and also can bring about the loss of beneficial soil microorganisms elliott and wildung 1992 drought stress mainly leads to reduced plant growth nutritional disturbance loreto and centritto 2008 reduction of photosynthesis and increased oxidative stress in plants several factors cause the plants to tolerate drought stress through the changes made in physiological and biochemical mechanisms and plant hormonal balance ramoliya et al 2004 as it was stated by benabdellah et al 2011 beneficial soil microorganisms exhibit a positive role when the plants encounter with environmental stresses soil microorganisms as so imperative component in the soil system can enhance plants tolerance against abiotic stresses improve plant nutrition and protect it when drought stress occurs ruiz lozano et al 2012 addition of beneficial microorganisms to the soil rhizosphere is an effective approach in sustainable agricultural development reducing the use of chemical inputs increasing soil health and fertility enhancing environmental protection and improving crops quality owen et al 2015 the symbiosis of plant with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus amf is one of the most promising ways to overcome drought stress amf decreases the adverse effects of drought stress by improving the absorption of nutrients better and faster access to moisture and osmotic regulation wu et al 2013 inoculation of plant with amf can regulate the hydraulic conduction of the root for transferring of water to the stem and accelerate the water conveyance to plant leaves zhao et al 2015 ortiz et al 2015 claimed that not only the symbiotic fungi but also the growth promoting rhizospheric bacteria can develop root system and increase plant water absorption also these bacteria are able to increase the expression of genes responsible for providing resistance against abiotic stresses investigations have shown that amf can coexist with medicinal plants and subsequently execute a positive effect on plant growth and yield toussaint et al 2007 researchers reported that under drought stress condition amf and pseudomonas fluorescens bacterium pfb brought about a significant increase in growth and dry matter production through the improvement of plant nutritional status rahimzadeh and pirzad 2017 microorganisms play a conspicuous function in the adjustment of drought stress by osmotic regulation through increasing of compatible solutes such as proline ruiz lozano et al 2008 basically osmotic regulators such as soluble sugars and proline are produced under drought stress conditions to reduce cell water potential and help regulate osmotic balance osmotic regulation is considered as an important mechanism for tolerance to drought stress yooyongwech et al 2016 in drought stress reduction of osmotic potential in tissues is due to increased proline content by regulating the proline biosynthesis pathway which in consequence maintains cellular water and protects membranes and proteins also antioxidant enzymes act as a defensive barrier against plant tensions pyngrope et al 2013 the action of antioxidant enzymes in stress tolerable plants is generally high so that there is a high correlation between drought stress tolerance and antioxidant activity kosar et al 2015 in addition photosynthesis indices such as chlorophyll content minimum fo and maximum fm chlorophyll fluorescence and the variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence ratio fv fm can be used as criteria for identifying drought stress tolerance mirshad and puthur 2016 purple coneflower echinacea purpurea l moench originates from north america and as a perennial herb is a member of the asteraceae family the aerial parts and roots of this plant contain valuable substances which due to antifungal antiviral and antibacterial properties have noticeable influence in improvement of the body immune system bodinet et al 2002 the products of this herb are known to be the sixth superior selling drug in the united states in 2010 blumenthal 2011 given the fact that e purpurea cultivation is expanding achievement to the optimum production of this valuable medicinal plant is essential omidbaigi 2002 soils in arid and semi arid areas have no suitable capability to supply the nutritional needs of plants owing to lacking of organic matter and biological activities due to the low dietary requirements of medicinal plants they are extremely suitable cases for movement from conventional agriculture to organic farming on the other hand due to the environmental problems caused by the application of chemical fertilizers the use of biological compounds can play a critical role in the development of sustainable agriculture and improvement of crop yields moreover inoculation of amf or pfb could consider like natural mbr to cleaning the water and soil resources from infection in dry lands therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the plant inoculation of amf or pfb in the improvement of physiological indices and yield of e purpurea under different p supply and drougth

of irrigation water and precipitation in different irrigation regimes and two harvest times have been reported in table 2 in first harvest water use efficiency was calculated from sowing in may 2016 to harvest time in november 2016 in spite of high rainfall from november 2016 to march 2017 because of cold weather fig 1 plants were in rosette stage during this period and therefore water use efficiency was calculated for second harvest since the plant re growth and emergence of vegetative buds in march 2017 to harvest time in september 2017 as it was reported by howell 1994 water use efficiency is the amount of plant s economic yield dry total yield or biological yield relative to the amount of supplied water irrigation water and precipitation calculated according to the eq 6 6 water use efficiency wue dry total yield kg wi m3 where wi is the amount of supplied water irrigation water and precipitation 2 6 statistical analysis sas software version 9 1 was used for two way

compound analysis was performed on data provided that the interaction was significant after slicing the comparison of means was done using duncan s multiple range test at probability level of 0 05 it should be noted that the results of mean comparison were only presented for the traits that the effect of experimental factors on them was statistically significant if interactions were significant means comparison of interactions were merely described in results 3 results 3 1 physiological traits the result of irrigation regimes was significant on all traits except carotenoids table 3 also phosphorus sources had a major effect on all determined characters except maximum fluorescence fm and peroxidase activity the consequence of harvest time was significant on minimum fluorescence fo maximum fluorescence the variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence ratio fv fm chlorophyll a chlorophyll a b proline and catalase the interaction of irrigation regimes with phosphorus sources was significant on minimum fluorescence chlorophyll a chlorophyll b chlorophyll a b soluble carbohydrates and proline table 3 also the interaction of irrigation regimes with harvest time was meaningful on minimum fluorescence maximum fluorescence the variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence ratio soluble carbohydrates and proline p sources and harvest time had significant interaction on minimum fluorescence 3 2 spad value increase in irrigation intervals made a decrease in spad value so that the reduction of chlorophyll content in available water depletion of 75 was 20 compared to 25 irrigation regime the spad value in available water depletions of 25 and 50 did not show any statistically significant difference table 4 the highest spad values 46 49 and 44 93 were respectively observed when p fertilizer was integrated with plant inoculation by amf or amf was applied alone table 5 3 3 chlorophyll fluorescence index with the increase in irrigation intervals the minimum chlorophyll fluorescence rate showed an increasing trend in the first and second harvest the minimum chlorophyll fluorescence showed the highest amount in 75 available water depletion these increases compared with 25 available water depletion were 80 and 70 respectively table 8 on the other hand in the first harvest the lowest fo 73 44 occurred in 100 chemical p treatment table 9 in the second harvest the lowest minimum fluorescence content was observed in combined use of amf with chemical p or sole application of amf table 9 in each irrigation regime chemical p amf similar to the single use of amf showed a relatively high ability to reduce the minimum chlorophyll fluorescence however no significant differences were observed among fertilizer treatments table 10 increase in drought stress intensity caused the maximum fluorescence rate to show an increasing trend in the second harvest the highest content of fm was occurred in 75 available water depletion which showed an increase of 34 compared with 25 depletion table 8 in the firstharvest the maximum fluorescence number did not show any significant difference at various irrigation regimes the highest ratio of variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence 0 732 was observed in combined use of chemical p with amf which did not show any significant difference with the sole application of amf or chemical p fertilizer table 5 the irrigation regimes and harvest time interaction showed the lowest fv fm 0 609 occurred in 75 available water depletion in the first harvest which had no significant difference with 50

photosynthetic pigments the amount of chlorophyll a at the first harvest was 2 26 mg g 1 fresh weight which was 28 higher than its corresponding one 1 76 mg g 1 in the second harvest table 6 in 25 available water depletion compared to control chlorophyll a content in the combined use of chemical p with pfb and sole consumption of pfb increased by 17 and 14 respectively table 10 in 50 and 75 depletions the highest amount of chlorophyll a was observed in combined use of chemical p with amf sole consumption of amf and 100 chemical p treatment table 10 in the irrigation regime of 25 available water depletion the highest content of chlorophyll b was observed in combined use of chemical p with amf and sole consumption of amf table 10 however with an increase in irrigation intervals to 50 available water depletion application of chemical p with amf and 100 chemical p treatment could show better results than other treatments in 75 available water depletion use of chemical p with amf and 100 chemical p application caused chlorophyll b content to be increased by 59 and 44 respectively than control table 10 the amount of chlorophyll a b in second harvest showed a decrease of 14 in respect of the first harvest table 6 in irrigation regime of 25 available water depletion chlorophyll a b was increased by 9 and 8 than control in chemical p combination with pfb and sole consumption of pfb respectively table 10 by the increase of available water depletion to 50 and 75 application of 100 chemical p chemical p with amf and sole application of amf could create better results than other treatments in regard of chlorophyll a b content the highest leaf carotenoids were obtained in combination of chemical p with pfb and sole application of pfb which in comparison with control showed an increase of 22 and 19 respectively after pfb amf showed a superior capability to increase leaf carotenoids compared to the control table 5 3 5 soluble carbohydrates and proline in both harvests an increase in water stress intensityup to 50 available water depletion increased the amount of soluble carbohydrates however in the irrigation regime of 75 available water depletion the amount of soluble carbohydrates in plant leaf was reduced table 8 in 25 available water depletion application of chemical p with pfb could increase the amout of soluble carbohydrates in respect of 100 chemical p and control table 10 in 50 available water depletion application of chemical p with amf and pfb compared to control showed an increase of 26 and 17 in the amount of soluble carbohydrates respectively table 10 however regarding the soluble carbohydrates no significant differences were observed among p supply treatments in irrigation regime of 75 available water depletion in the first harvest increase in water stress intensity made a significant increase in proline content so that the highest percentage of proline was occurred in 75 available water depletion which was 36 higher than 25 depletion table 8 in the second harvest at 25 and 50 available water depletion the amount of proline was higher than the first harvest but there was no significant difference among various irrigation regimes table 8 in 25 of available water depletion application of chemical p with pfb could increase proline content compared to other treatments table 10 by rising in irrigation intervals to 50 and 75 available water depletion application of 100 chemical p chemical p with amf and sole consumption of amf could increase proline content in comparison with other treatments 3 6 the activity of catalase and peroxidase enzymes catalase activity was increased by enhanced water stress intensity so that the increase of catalase activity in 75 available water depletion compared to 25 depletion was 33 table 4 on the other hand the highest levels of catalase activity were found to be 8 93 and 9 39 μmol mg 1 protein min 1 in the combined use of chemical p with amf and sole application of amf respectively table 5 also the catalase activity in the first harvest compared to the second one showed a significant increase table 6 raise in irrigation intervals intensified the peroxidase activity so that the peroxidase activity in 75 available water depletion compared to 25 depletion showed an increase of 65 however the amount of peroxidase in 25 and 50 available water depletion were not significantly different table 4 3 7 biomass yield and its components p resources irrigation regimes and harvest time showed a significant influence on all biomass yield components table 7 the irrigation regimes and harvest time interaction was momentous on flower leaf and total yield also the interaction of p sources with harvest time was significant on biomass and yield components table 7 as the irrigation intervals were increased a decreasing trend was observed in flower yield in both of harvests the lowest flower yield was obtained in 75 available water depletion which showed a decrease of 35 and 34 compared to 25 depletion respectively table 8 from the other point of view the highest flower yield 114 g m 2 in the first harvest was occurred in the combined use of chemical p with amf which showed a significant difference with pfb and control but had no significant difference with other treatments table 9 the highest flower yield was observed in 100 chemical p treatment in the second harvest table 9 similar to the chemical p treatment the use of chemical p with amf or pfb had a relatively high ability to increase the flower yield while there was no significant differentiation among them table 9 increase in irrigation intervals reduced the yield of the leaf so that in the first and second harvest leaf yield reduction in 75 available water depletion compared to 25 depletion was 26 and 29 respectively table 8 in both harvests the highest yield of leaf 98 3 and 169 2 g m 2 respectively was obtained in the combined use chemical p with amf table 9 in contrast for both harvests the lowest leaf yield 84 1 and 120 8 g m 2 respectively was occurred in control treatment of p supply table 9 the yield of the stem was decreased by increasing in irrigation intervals so that the reduction in stem yield in 75 available water depletion compared with 25 depletion was 21 table 4 however stem yield did not show the statistically significant difference in irrigation regimes of 50 and 75 available water depletion in the first harvest no significant differences were observed among different combinations of fertilizers table 9 in second harvest the highest stem yield 85 5 g m 2 was observed in the combined use of chemical p with amf which of course did not show any significant difference with 100 chemical p treatment table 9 increase in water stress intensity reduced the total yield of e purpurea so that plant total yield reduction in 75 available water depletion compared to 25 depletion was 28 and 30 respectively table 8 in the first harvest the highest total yield 284 3 g m 2 was obtained in the complete supply of p from the chemical source table 9 also in second harvest application of chemical p with amf compared to control increased the total yield of e purpurea by 39 table 9 root yield showed a decreasing trend as the water stress was intensified so that in 75 of available water depletion root yield reduced by 30 in comparison with 25 depletion however irrigation regimes of 25 and 50 available water depletion had no significant difference in respect to root yield table 4 the highest root yield of e purpurea 1270 g m 2 was obtained by consumption of 100 p fertilizer from the chemical source which did not show any significant difference with the application of chemical p with amf or pfb table 5 integrated use of chemical p with amf and chemical p with pfb caused a significant increase in root yield compared to control 48 and 40 respectively table 5 3 8 water use efficiency wue water use efficiency was significantly affected by irrigation intervals p sources and harvest time table 7 also the interaction of p sources and harvest time on water use efficiency was significant water use efficiency showed a decreasing pattern as the irrigation intervals were increased so that the water use efficiency in irrigation interval of 75 available water depletion showed a decrease of 18 compared to 25 depletion table 4 in first harvest the highest rate of water use efficiency 0 502 kg m 3 was found in 100 chemical p treatment which did not show significant differences with the combination of p fertilizer and amf table 9 in second harvest the treatment of p fertilizer with amf significantly increased the water use efficiency by 40 compared to the control table 9 4 discussion 4 1 spad value and chlorophyll fluorescence in this study the increase in irrigation intervals caused a disturbance in the spad value and chlorophyll fluorescence indices increase in irrigation intervals reduced the spad value and the variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence ratio fv fm while it improved the minimum fo and maximum fm fluorescence of chlorophyll the leaf chlorophyll content depends on the plant metabolism the activity of the rubisco enzyme and the amount of leaf nitrogen under environmental stress conditions the connection between chlorophylls and chloroplast proteins is weakened and chlorophylls may be destroyed watanabe et al 1994 also the increase of fo and fm indices indicates that there is a problem or degradation in photosystem ii protein d1 and another part of the photosystem or probable interruption of energy transfer to the optical center of photosynthesis reaction calatayud et al 2006 the reduction of fv fm is due to a disruption of the chloroplast structure which reduces the photochemical capacity of photosystem ii porcar castell et al 2014 the presence of any disturbance and alteration in the pigments of photosystem ii was resulted in a reduction of the maximum quantum function in the photosystem under conditions compatible with darkness fracheboud and leipner 2003 the results of this investigation revealed that the highest leaf relative chlorophyll content was found in the application of amf or its combination with p fertilizer also the sole application of chemical p or its combination with amf could somewhat improve chlorophyll fluorescence indices according to studies amf can increase drought tolerance by improving chlorophyll fluorescence indices and photochemical capacity of photosystem ii li et al 2015 pinior et al 2005 moreover the higher ratio of variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence at different irrigation intervals in the second harvest than the first one is probably due to the plant adaptation to environmental conditions and differences in weather conditions on the other hand in conditions of drought stress the increase of variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence ratio can be attributed to the decrease of temperature in the early stages of plant growth fig 1 4 2 the amount of photosynthetic pigments in 25 available water depletion application of chemical p with pfb and sole consumption of pfb showed high ability to increase chlorophyll a chlorophyll a b and carotenoids in plant leaves also by the increase of irrigation intervals to 50 and 75 available water depletion application of amf and 100 chemical p could act better than other treatments it seems that consumption of p fertilizer sources could increase the content of chlorophyll in e purpurea by improving the growth of root and increasing the absorption of plant required nutrients it was stated by hosseinzadeh et al 2016 that increase in rubisco carboxylase activity and leaf n concentration would increase leaf chlorophyll content also it has been stated that plant n concentration would be increased by p consumption smith and read 2010 probably application of 100 chemical phosphorus by increasing nitrogen concentration attarzadeh et al 2019 can partly increase leaf chlorophyll content therefore the utilization of 100 p fertilization could increase the leaf chlorophyll content probably due to enhancement in plant n concentration pfb also causes more chlorophyll synthesis owing to the release of n in soil rhizosphere under stress condition mineral nutrients are able to preserve carbon dioxide maintain photosynthesis and care for chloroplast han and lee 2005 increase in chlorophyll content by plant growth stimulator bacteria and amf has also been confirmed by other scholars baset et al 2010 vafadar et al 2014 the effect of different irrigation regimes revealed that the amount of chlorophyll content in e purpurea decreased with increasing of drought stress in fact the free radicals attack produced by the oxidative stress was an effective factor in reducing chlorophyll content under drought stress conditions khorasaninejad et al 2018 4 3 antioxidant enzymes soluble sugar and proline the present study showed that amf and pfb inoculation ameliorated the hostile effects of water stress the superior activity of antioxidant enzymes like catalase in amf or pfb inoculated plants rather than no inoculated ones approves this claim it was stated by koussevitzky et al 2008 that beneficial soil microorganisms are effective in plant reaction to water stress through controlling oxidative reactions and impelling antioxidant defense under drought stress conditions antioxidant systems need to be in a coordinated and systemic way to restrain the harmful effects and protect the plant blokhina et al 2003 in general the highest level of these activities may occur when cellular damage increases the accumulation of proline and soluble carbohydrates in plant shoot was influenced by inoculation of beneficial soil microorganisms increased concentration of soluble carbohydrates and proline in amf and pfb inoculated plants can create satisfactory condition for water absorption actually the accumulation of proline in plant tissues can cause osmotic regulation under environmental stress conditions molinari et al 2007 ortiz et al 2015 stated that inoculation of plants with beneficial soil microorganisms increased the concentration of compatible solutes and activity of antioxidant enzymes possibly in the irrigation regimes of 25 and 50 available water depletion the increase of proline content in second harvest than the first one is due to root development attarzadeh et al 2019 which in turn results in the further absorption of soil nutrients the improvement of growth indices and consequently the accumulation of organic matters such as proline 4 4 biomass yield increase in water stress intensity caused the biomass yield components to show a decreasing trend on the other hand in the second harvest the combination of chemical p with amf similar to chemical p treatment showed a high ability to increase the biomass yield components of e purpurea the raise of growth indices in amf and pfb inoculated plants can be attributed to higher leaf chlorophyll content and improved activity of antioxidant enzymes increase of compatible solutes for instance proline and regulation of antioxidant enzymes activity has been reported by ortiz et al 2015 as an effective strategy to improve plant growth in water stress conditions by spreading the hyphae and developing the root system amf provides more water which results in the production and accumulation of more dry matter in the plant augé 2001 it has also been reported that bio fertilizers can enhance photosynthetic productions and motivate plant growth improving the plant nutrients absorption han and lee 2005 as stated by lucy et al 2004 bio fertilizers influence the growth and development of plants and increase growth indices through the production of growth promoting hormones like gibberellin cytokinin and auxin it can be concluded that increase of flowers leaves and total yield of e purpurea in second harvest than the first one is due to the adaptation of the plant to environmental conditions root development better absorption of water and essential nutrients and differences in weather conditions jalil sheshbahreh et al 2019 reported that due to osmotic pressure around the root in drought stress conditions the absorption of nutrients in e purpurea was reduced but soil application of beneficial microorganisms improved the efficiency of nutrients absorption and increased the biological yield also vafadar et al 2014 reported that an increase in the growth indices including biomass yield in plants inoculated with amf and pfb was due to increased chlorophyll content and improved photosynthetic activity 4 5 water use efficiency wue biological yield and water use efficiency were reduced by drought stress in irrigation intervals of 50 and 75 available water depletion in contrast root growth water absorption and water use efficiency were increased by application of 100 chemical p and its combination with amf as it was stated by zhao et al 2015 plant nutrition has a positive effect on water use efficiency in conditions where soil moisture is less than optimal in the integrated feeding systems plant leaf area is increased due to the improvement of root system and better uptake of soil water and nutrients increased leaf area leads to higher light absorption efficient photosynthesis and better plant biomass accumulation romero munar et al 2017 production of photosynthetic materials will result in improved biological yield and water use efficiency jalilian et al 2012 jalil sheshbahreh et al 2019 reported that water use efficiency in e purpurea is decreased due to the reduced root water absorption in drought stress conditions but the use of beneficial soil microorganisms improved water use efficiency 5 conclusion in conclusion the consequences of this investigation showed that an increase in water stress intensity had a negative effect on a b and chlorophyll a b content the biomass yield and water use efficiency increase in irrigation intervals enhanced the minimum and maximum fluorescence proline content and the activity of catalase during the irrigation regime of 25 available water depletion the highest amount of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll a b were obtained in combined use chemical p with pfb and sole application of pfb by increasing in irrigation intervals to 50 and 75 available water depletion application of 100 chemical p combined use of chemical p with amf and sole consumption of amf could act better than other treatments in respect to chlorophyll content after pfb amf showed superior capability to increase carotenoids of leaf rather than control amf and pfb inoculation or their combinations with chemical p were effective in increase of soluble carbohydrates 26 and 17 proline 39 and 22 and antioxidant activity of catalase about 24 and peroxidase and thus they increased the biological yield it seems that in plants inoculated with amf and pfb due to the increased activity of antioxidant enzymes and chlorophyll content an increase in the rate of growth indices has occurred in addition to the application of 100 chemical phosphorus in e purpurea which increased root yield the combination of p fertilizer with amf and pfb caused a significant increase in root dry yield compared to control in summary this investigation outcome showed bio fertilizers prosperous symbiosis with e purpurea in improvement of physiological characteristics increase of biological yield water use efficiency and reduction of water stress hostile effects it also seems that amf and pfb had better ameliorating effect under drought stress and normal conditions respectively funding this study was financially assisted by the

faced with a threefold challenge i meeting the demand for food to feed approximately 9 billion people in the coming decades ii developing environmentally friendly and sustainable methods of production and iii improving the nutritional food security of rural resource poor households godfray et al 2010 there are approximately 239 million people in sub saharan africa suffering from micronutrient deficiency as a form of hidden hunger afari sefa et al 2011 hidden hunger is a chronic lack of iron zinc and vitamins its effects may not be immediately apparent but it may have severe consequences in the long term by inducing stunted growth delayed cognitive development and reduced immunity maberly et al 1994 afari sefa et al 2011 noted that in sub saharan africa consumption of vegetables per capita was below the minimum of 200 kg person 1 year 1 vegetables are important in a diet because they supplement essential micronutrients iron and zinc and β carotene which the body converts into vitamin a mabhaudhi et al 2017a iterated that vegetables could be classified as traditional or alien traditional vegetables refer to species that were introduced in an area more than a hundred years ago where they adapted to local conditions and they became part of the local culture in contrast alien vegetables are crops that have recently been imported to a certain geographical location and are produced commercially since recent times mabhaudhi et al 2017a nyathi et al 2018a oelofse and van averbeke 2012 several authors afari sefa et al 2011 chivenge et al 2015 govender et al 2017 mabhaudhi et al 2017a b maseko et al 2018 mavengahama et al 2013 oelofse and van averbeke 2012 reached consensus on the important benefits of traditional vegetables when compared to alien vegetables this includes their high nutrient density iron zinc and β carotene their short crop cycle the low use of agronomic inputs their high productivity under water stress conditions and their abundance in the wild i e available for rural resource poor households or next to cereal crops as weeds nyathi et al 2018b however information on these benefits was anecdotal assumptions were that traditional vegetables grow naturally in the wild or next to mainstream crops zea mays maize oryza sativa rice triticum aestivum wheat solanum tuberosum irish potato without being supplied with fertilizer and water this makes traditional vegetables champion species in areas experiencing high levels of nutritional food insecurity and water scarcity mabhaudhi et al 2016 the water productivity index wp total

dry biomass water use and water productivity of twenty vegetables table 1 presents dry biomass aboveground biomass and or storage organ for twenty vegetables the mean values for traditional vegetables ranged from 0 5 to 5 9 t ha 1 the lowest aboveground edible biomass was obtained from pumpkin 0 5 t ha 1 the median biomass aboveground edible biomass plus stems from amaranth 3 6 t ha 1 and jute mallow 3 6 t ha 1 and the highest biomass aboveground edible biomass plus stems from sweet potato 5 9 t ha 1 chinese cabbage and black nightshade exhibited the lowest seasonal water use 180 mm whereas sweet potato displayed the highest seasonal water use 505 mm water productivity values for traditional vegetables ranged from 0 21 to 2 09 kg m 3 the lowest water productivity value was obtained from pumpkin 0 21 kg m 3 and the highest water productivity values were obtained from chinese cabbage 2 09 kg m 3 and spider flower 2 05 kg m 3 we could not compute water productivity for blackjack and kale because information on biomass aboveground edible biomass plus stems and water use was missing in the literature investigated for alien vegetables biomass aboveground biomass and or storage organ ranged from 2 6 9 0 t ha 1 the lowest biomass aboveground biomass and or storage organ was obtained from beetroot 2 6 t ha 1 median values from swiss chard 4 0 t ha 1 and carrot 4 2 t ha 1 and the highest from cabbage 9 0 t ha 1 table 1 our results illustrate that alien vegetables are more productive than traditional vegetables per unit area of land the lowest seasonal water use for alien vegetables was 234 mm tomato median seasonal values were 340 mm beetroot and 360 mm butternut and the highest seasonal water use was 537 mm onion water productivity values for alien vegetables ranged from 0 76 to 2 45 kg m 3 the lowest water productivity was obtained from beetroot whereas the highest water productivity was observed from cabbage generally the grand mean results show that water productivity values for traditional vegetables grand mean 1 29 kg m 3 and alien vegetables 1 37 kg m 3 are comparable 3 2 nutrient concentrations nutritional yield and potential contribution to human nutrition the nutrient concentrations of ten traditional vegetables are presented in table 2 the mean iron content varied from 9 to 47 mg 100 g 1 pumpkin aboveground edible biomass exhibited the lowest iron concentration and black nightshade displayed the highest iron concentration zinc concentration ranged from 2 to 29 mg 100 g 1 the lowest zinc concentration was attained from sweet potato aboveground edible biomass whereas the highest zinc concentration was obtained from cowpea aboveground edible biomass kale showed the lowest vitamin a concentration 241 μg rae 100 g 1 and amaranth 1556 μg rae 100 g 1 displayed the highest vitamin a concentration table 3 presents nutrient concentrations values of ten alien vegetables the results of this study highlighted that alien vegetables are lower in iron and zinc compared to traditional vegetables the mean values ranged from 4 to 43 mg 100 g 1 for iron for zinc the mean values ranged from 2 to 16 mg 100 g 1 for vitamin a alien vegetables were superior grand mean 2121 μg rae 100 g 1 over traditional vegetables grand mean 884 μg rae 100 g 1 it is crucial to note that onion contains no vitamin a 0 μg rae 100 g 1 the estimated percentage nutrient contribution of twenty vegetables for four age groups is presented in table 4 assessments showed that 100 g of boiled spider flower could potentially provide 87 of iron whereas amaranth could potentially provide 32 of zinc and 47 of vitamin a to the daily recommended nutrient intake for infants for children aged between 4 19 years traditional vegetables could potentially contribute a lesser percentage to the daily recommended nutrient intake because of the higher demand box 1 for vitamin a it was interesting to note that butternut could potentially provide more than the daily recommended nutrient intake for all age groups we calculated the amount of nutrients that can be harvested per unit area of land nutritional yield ny for traditional and alien vegetables table 5 the grand means displayed more micronutrients 2 fold could be harvested from traditional vegetables compared to alien vegetables and more β carotene 3 fold could be harvested from alien vegetables compared to traditional vegetables for traditional vegetables the highest fe ny 1082 g ha 1 zn ny 1294 g ha 1 and β carotene ny 453 g ha 1 were obtained from sweet potato aboveground edible biomass cowpea aboveground edible biomass and amaranth respectively for alien vegetables the highest fe ny 1223 g ha 1 zn ny 515 g ha 1 and β carotene ny 1984 g ha 1 were achieved from swiss chard and butternut respectively 3 3 nutritional water productivity the grand mean results indicated that nutritional water productivity values for traditional vegetables were 485 mg m 3 for iron 182 mg m 3 for zinc and 13 377 μg rae m 3 for vitamin a table 5 the lowest nutritional water productivity values for iron 19 mg m 3 zinc 17 mg m 3 and vitamin a 546 mg m 3 were observed from pumpkin aboveground edible biomass respectively the highest nutritional water productivity for iron was observed from spider flower 827 mg m 3 for zinc 612 mg m 3 it was attained from cowpea aboveground edible biomass and for vitamin a 23 649 μg rae m 3 from chinese cabbage generally our results revealed that traditional vegetables were more productive than alien vegetables grand means for iron 185 mg m 3 and for zinc 71 mg m 3 per unit of water used to produce micronutrients whereas alien vegetables were more productive per unit of water used to produce vitamin a grand mean 27 222 μg rae m 3 for alien vegetables the lowest nutritional water productivity for iron zinc and vitamin a was obtained from carrot 87 mg m 3 butternut 18 mg m 3 and beetroot 191 μg rae m 3 respectively the highest nutritional water productivity values were 430 mg m 3 for iron cabbage 260 mg m 3 for zinc carrot and 83 854 μg rae m 3 for vitamin a butternut our results showed that spider flower required the least amount of water to meet iron 202 litres person 1 day 1 and vitamin a 162 litres person 1 day 1 requirements whereas cowpea aboveground edible biomass required the least amount of water to meet zinc requirements 269 litres person 1 day 1 table 6 for alien vegetables our results revealed that more water would be required to meet human nutrition requirements for micronutrients swiss chard indicated that 1060 litres person 1 day 1 would be required to meet iron requirements carrot showed that 808 litres person 1 day 1 would be required to meet zinc requirements and butternut illustrated that 59 litres person 1 day 1 would be required to meet vitamin a requirements 4 discussion although nutritional water productivity data can provide useful information in an agricultural context in relation to human nutritional requirements water use of crops and crop productivity nutritional water productivity data of traditional vegetables is minimal ordinarily literature chivenge et al 2015 maseko et al 2018 mavengahama et al 2013 use anecdotal information to back up claims that traditional vegetables are more productive in terms of biomass aboveground biomass and or storage organ and water productivity and nutrient dense iron zinc and β carotene than alien vegetables therefore this study sought to assess these claims using datasets biomass aboveground biomass and or storage organ nutrient concentration and evapotranspiration sourced from literature we assessed nutritional water productivity of ten traditional vegetables with ten alien vegetables our expectations were that selected traditional vegetables were superior to alien vegetables in terms of biomass aboveground biomass and or storage organ however the results of this study revealed that alien vegetables were more productive than traditional vegetables in terms of biomass aboveground biomass and or storage organ we suspect that reported yield values for traditional vegetables occurred under sub optimal conditions and reported yield values for alien vegetables occurred under optimal conditions over the years alien vegetables have been improved through plant breeding and were selected for high performance under well endowed growing conditions agricultural production for most rural resource poor households occurs under rain fed conditions maseko et al 2018 therefore achieving yield potential is limited by water availability assuming that the crop is well managed sowing date cultivar date plant density nutrient management and crop protection van ittersum et al 2013 in future decades water scarcity will intensify especially for sub saharan africa therefore the water productivity index wp a ratio of biomass aboveground biomass and or storage organ per crop evapotranspiration would be a critical benchmark for food production van ittersum et al 2013 this index is synonymous to water use efficiency however van halsema and vincent 2012 argued that these two terms are not similar the difference being the denominator water use efficiency is the ratio of biomass aboveground biomass and or storage organ per total water applied our results show that traditional vegetables use slightly less water grand mean 473 mm season than alien vegetables grand mean 513 mm season which agrees with other studies chibarabada et al 2017 nyathi et al 2018b oelofse and van averbeke 2012 in addition the results of this study illustrated that water productivity of both vegetables traditional vegetables 1 29 kg m 3 and alien vegetables 1 37 kg m 3 was comparable this was contrary to previous studies nyathi et al 2016 nyathi et al 2018b which reported that the water productivity of traditional vegetables was higher than that of alien vegetables these contradictory findings by our study might have been caused by assessing water productivity using datasets from various locations whereas studies by nyathi et al 2016 and nyathi et al 2018b assessed water productivity using datasets from the same location unkovich et al 2018 emphasized the need to use the beneficial use of water transpiration rather than evapotranspiration when assessing water productivity of crops studies conducted by nyathi et al 2018a and nyathi et al 2018b assessed water productivity of selected traditional vegetables amaranth and spider flower and an alien vegetable swiss chard their initial results showed that water productivity of traditional vegetables and an alien vegetable were similar when evapotranspiration was used as the denominator however when transpiration was used as the denominator water productivity of traditional vegetables was higher than the water productivity of the alien vegetable this illustrates the need to use transpiration instead of evapotranspiration in addition assessing water productivity of vegetables beetroot cowpea pumpkin and sweet potato that have both different types of edible plant parts leaves and the storage organ is a challenge some studies evaluated water productivity using only one plant part for example a study by oelofse and van averbeke 2012 evaluated water productivity of pumpkin aboveground edible biomass which excluded the storage organ this is a bit unfortunate because the aboveground biomass may be partitioned into both plant parts and would favour the storage organ over the aboveground edible biomass therefore it is crucial to use total biomass aboveground biomass and the storage organ when assessing the water productivity of these vegetables these vegetables have the potential of being used for dual purpose dark green leafy vegetable and the storage organ for human consumption for improved food and nutrition security in addition we converted the water footprint values of selected alien vegetables to water productivity values table a2 at a glance these values are higher compared to the values of this study probably the water footprint values from le roux et al 2016 and mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 were calculated on a fresh mass basis therefore alien vegetables might have high water footprint if a fresh mass was used but if a dry mass was used water footprints of these vegetables could be relatively low le roux et al 2016 le roux et al 2016 found that the water footprints of maize and wheat were higher than those of vegetables if expressed in terms of fresh mass however when expressed in terms of dry mass the water footprints of maize and wheat were similar to those of vegetables information on water footprints for selected traditional vegetables was missing from literature surveyed from research conducted by nutritionists on the nutrient concentration of crops daily consumption targets to meet human nutrition requirements can be derived uusiku et al 2010 van jaarsveld et al 2014 schönfeldt and pretorius 2011 our results showed that traditional vegetables were superior to alien vegetables in iron 52 and zinc 64 whereas alien vegetables were superior to traditional vegetables in vitamin a 58 concentration this concurs with several studies which have been conducted on the nutrient concentration of selected vegetables schönfeldt and pretorius 2011 usda 2018 uusiku et al 2010 van jaarsveld et al 2014 wenhold et al 2012 however the reported nutritional values show a quite high degree of variability we pose a question why are nutritional values of vegetables not conservative uusiku et al 2010 attributed the variation to genotype environment management and different seasons several studies afolayan and jimoh 2009 odhav et al 2007 uusiku et al 2010 van jaarsveld et al 2014 schönfeldt and pretorius 2011 conducted by nutritionists did not evaluate the effect of environmental factors climatic conditions severe drought conditions soil fertility and management on nutrient concentrations of vegetables the goal of nutritionists is to compute the portion per 100 g of iron zinc and β carotene that should be consumed to meet daily consumption targets for human nutrition aerts and chapin 1999 found that nitrogen deficiency in crops such as lettuce carrot swiss chard and maize reduced β carotene concentration another study conducted by cole et al 2016 found that fertilizer application increased iron and zinc in tomato plant tissues in addition nyathi et al 2018 2018b revealed that severe water stress increased iron and zinc nutrient concentration whereas β carotene concentration showed sensitivity towards severe water stressed conditions for amaranth spider flower and swiss chard these studies highlight that environmental factors play a major role in the nutrient concentration of crops there is not much collaboration amongst nutritionists agronomists and irrigation experts mabhaudhi et al 2016 however evaluating nutrient concentration without considering yield is not an ideal practice because of both account for the nutrient yield per unit area of land a useful term that was suggested by bumgarner et al 2012 the mean results revealed that traditional vegetables have higher iron and zinc nutritional yields while alien vegetables were superior in β carotene nutritional yield this study provided new insight into the importance of using nutritional yield as a parameter for assessing the nutritional superiority of selected vegetables for the assessments of the number of children aged between 4 18 years that one could feed for a period of 90 days from one hectare for iron and zinc requirements traditional vegetables showed that it could provide for more children iron grand mean 40 zinc grand mean 15 children compared to alien vegetables iron grand mean 15 children zinc grand mean 6 children appendix a 3 practically this suggests that these children would need to consume huge amounts of boiled alien vegetables to meet their daily iron and zinc requirements sweet potato aboveground edible biomass 96 children showed the highest number of children that it could potentially supply with iron and cowpea aboveground edible biomass 70 children showed the highest number of children that it could potentially supply with zinc for vitamin a alien vegetables 69 children could potentially supply more children compared to traditional vegetables grand mean 32 children for a period of 90 days butternut illustrated the highest number 264 children of children that it could potentially supply with vitamin a limited information exists on nutritional yield of alien and traditional vegetables nyathi et al 2018b conducted a study that evaluated nutritional yields of nutrients iron zinc and β carotene for amaranth spider flower and swiss chard they reported nutritional yield values that were within the range of the current study for example our study reported iron nutrition yield of 587 g ha 1 for amaranth whereas nyathi et al 2018b reported iron nutritional yield values for amaranth ranging from 362 to 1361 g ha 1 nutritional water productivity nwp is an index that links crop production water use in agriculture and nutrient concentration chibarabada et al 2017 mabhaudhi et al 2016 it was interesting to note that traditional vegetables were more productive than alien vegetables in fe nwp and zn nwp spider flower was the most productive vegetable to produce iron per unit of water used whereas cowpea aboveground edible biomass was the most productive vegetable to produce zinc per unit of water used table 5 alien vegetables were more productive 2 fold in β carotene nwp compared to traditional vegetables butternut was the most productive vegetable to produce vitamin a per unit of water used table 5 this highlights the need for crop diversification in order to maximize the amount of nutrients produced per unit of water used to meet human nutrition requirements practically nwp values can be used to compute the total amount of water required litres person 1 day 1 to meet human nutrition requirements iron zinc and vitamin a table 6 for example the current population of south africa is estimated at 56 5 million people and it is expected to reach 65 million people by the year 2030 statistics south africa stats sa 2018 therefore a diet of spider flower used as a side dish would require 11 417 424 kiloliters day 1 202 l day 1 56 521 900 people 1000 l kl to meet iron requirements for children aged between 4 18 years in 2018 in 2030 the same diet would require 13 130 000 kl day 1 202 l day 1 65 000 000 people 1000 l kl to meet iron requirements for the same age group an additional 1 712 576 kl day 1 information on nwp of vegetables is inadequate conducted studies mabhaudhi et al 2017b nyathi et al 2018b mdemu et al 2009 renault and wallender 2000 reported nwp values iron zinc and β carotene for limited vegetables amaranth spider flower swiss chard cowpea tomato and onion our study is the first to benchmark nwp for a number of vegetables table 5 5 limitations of the study and future research water use values of selected vegetables were sourced from literature and used to generate the water productivity database the challenge with this approach is that some studies did not indicate whether water use was total water applied or evapotranspiration this has placed a severe limitation on water productivity values reported by this study another complexity was that the estimates of nutritional water productivity values fe nwp zn nwp and β carotene nwp of this study came from two independent datasets a crop water productivity database and the nutrient concentration database both with some level of uncertainty our major concern was the reliability of using these two independent datasets to generate a third database nwp we agree that this approach is not ideal but it was the only pragmatic approach to come up with first order estimates of nutritional water productivity for traditional vegetables and alien vegetables regardless of the complexities reported by this paper key findings showed that traditional vegetables are low in β carotene concentration and dense in iron and zinc this contradicts information from literature which reported traditional vegetables as miracle crops nutrient dense in all micronutrients and vitamins using anecdotal information our study is the first in assessing nutritional water productivity of ten traditional vegetables and compare them with ten alien vegetables we propose that future research and validation of these results should consider the following the results of this study highlighted that nutrient concentration of vegetables is not conservative because of several factors plant variety among species environment soil type and ph harvesting method climatic conditions different seasons soil fertility and water availability however it was not clear which of these factors affect nutrient concentration of vegetables therefore future research should assess the major factors crucial for determining the nutrient concentration of vegetables yield response of traditional vegetables to irrigation and fertilizer is unknown we propose that field experiments for a wide range of traditional vegetables should be conducted to assess their yield response to inputs water and fertility stresses and should develop new variables aboveground edible biomass nutrient concentration nutritional yield evapotranspiration water productivity and nutritional water productivity using datasets collected from the same experiments table 7 these newly developed variables will improve the agronomic knowledge of traditional vegetables in addition data collected from field experiments can be used to calibrate and validate crop growth models aquacrop the soil water balance and agricultural production system simulator apsim for upscaling the results in countries such as kenya and tanzania traditional vegetables have been commercialized through various awareness campaigns local radio stations tv stations trade fairs exhibitions in store promotions outdoor promotions nutritional walks and product sampling mwangi and kimathi 2006 this show that there is a possibility of commercializing traditional vegetables in other sub saharan african countries therefore future efforts to commercialize traditional vegetables should consider using massive awareness campaigns as in kenya and tanzania in addition these studies should consider assessing other factors personal food preferences attitude aspirations and identity middle class that influence the acceptability and consumption of traditional vegetables in other sub saharan african countries mavengahama et al 2013 the aboveground edible biomass of traditional vegetables can be higher in nutrient concentration iron zinc and β carotene compared with alien vegetables however nutrients might not be bioavailable because of anti nutrients such as oxalate hydrocyanic acid tannins and polyphenols mavengahama et al 2013 moreover the bioavailability of nutrients might change depending on the method of food preparation i e boiling steaming or frying schönfeldt and pretorius 2011 we propose that food scientists in collaboration with chefs should find the best method of preparing traditional vegetables such that micronutrients and vitamins are bioavailable for human consumption traditional vegetables are highly perishable within a few hours of being harvested in 2015 the south africa s agricultural research council in collaboration with nestle launched a new line of maggi noodles containing amaranth http www nestle com media news nestle south africa maggi noodles morogo launch to improve the shelf life of traditional vegetables and reduce post harvest losses we propose that more of such products should be developed from traditional vegetables in collaboration with nutraceutical companies in sub saharan africa in sub saharan africa vegetables such as beetroot cowpea pumpkin and sweet potato have the potential of being utilized as dual purpose vegetables green leafy vegetable and the storage organ the aboveground edible biomass can be an additional source of green leafy vegetable during the summer season and after the end of the growing season the storage organ can be consumed this spreads food availability over a longer period hence an improvement in the nutritional food security of rural resource poor households nyathi et al 2019 we propose that a study should be conducted to evaluate the effect of leaf harvesting on yield and nutrient concentration of storage organs if water become scarce water footprints information can inform farmers to plant less water intensive crops le roux et al 2016 the literature surveyed for this study showed that information on the water footprint of traditional vegetables is minimal we propose that future research should consider evaluating the water footprints of many traditional vegetables using data collected from the same location acknowledgements funding from the south african water research commission wrc under project k5 2171 4 and from the netherlands university foundation for international cooperation nuffic has supported this project appendix a see table a3

and iii improving the nutritional food security of rural resource poor households godfray et al 2010 there are approximately 239 million people in sub saharan africa suffering from micronutrient deficiency as a form of hidden hunger afari sefa et al 2011 hidden hunger is a chronic lack of iron zinc and vitamins its effects may not be immediately apparent but it may have severe consequences in the long term by inducing stunted growth delayed cognitive development and reduced immunity maberly et al 1994 afari sefa et al 2011 noted that in sub saharan africa consumption of vegetables per capita was below the minimum of 200 kg person 1 year 1 vegetables are important in a diet because they supplement essential micronutrients iron and zinc and β carotene which the body converts into vitamin a mabhaudhi et al 2017a iterated that vegetables could be classified as traditional or alien traditional vegetables refer to species that were introduced in an area more than a hundred years ago where they adapted to local conditions and they became part of the local culture in contrast alien vegetables are crops that have recently been imported to a certain geographical location and are produced commercially since recent times mabhaudhi et al 2017a nyathi et al 2018a oelofse and van averbeke 2012 several authors afari sefa et al 2011 chivenge et al 2015 govender et al 2017 mabhaudhi et al 2017a b maseko et al 2018 mavengahama et al 2013 oelofse and van averbeke 2012 reached consensus on the important benefits of traditional vegetables when compared to alien vegetables this includes their high nutrient density iron zinc and β carotene their short crop cycle the low use of agronomic inputs their high productivity under water stress conditions and their abundance in the wild i e available for rural resource poor households or next to cereal crops as weeds nyathi et al 2018b however information on these benefits was anecdotal assumptions were that traditional vegetables grow naturally in the wild or next to mainstream crops zea mays maize oryza sativa rice triticum aestivum wheat solanum tuberosum irish potato without being supplied with fertilizer and water this makes traditional vegetables champion species in areas experiencing high levels of nutritional food insecurity and water scarcity mabhaudhi et al 2016 the water productivity index wp total

litres person 1 day 1 tnr nwp mg m 3 6 people 1000 where tnr mg day 1 is total nutrients required iron mg day 1 zinc mg day 1 and vitamin a μg rae day 1 by a family of six people 3 results 3 1 total dry biomass water use and water productivity of twenty vegetables table 1 presents dry biomass aboveground biomass and or storage organ for twenty vegetables the mean values for traditional vegetables ranged from 0 5 to 5 9 t ha 1 the lowest aboveground edible biomass was obtained from pumpkin 0 5 t ha 1 the median biomass aboveground edible biomass plus stems from amaranth 3 6 t ha 1 and jute mallow 3 6 t ha 1 and the highest biomass aboveground edible biomass plus stems from sweet potato 5 9 t ha 1 chinese cabbage and black nightshade exhibited the lowest seasonal water use 180 mm whereas sweet potato displayed the highest seasonal water use 505 mm water productivity values for traditional vegetables ranged from 0 21 to 2 09 kg m 3 the lowest water productivity value was obtained from pumpkin 0 21 kg m 3 and the highest water productivity values were obtained from chinese cabbage 2 09 kg m 3 and spider flower 2 05 kg m 3 we could not compute water productivity for blackjack and kale because information on biomass aboveground edible biomass plus stems and water use was missing in the literature investigated for alien vegetables biomass aboveground biomass and or storage organ ranged from 2 6 9 0 t ha 1 the lowest biomass aboveground biomass and or storage organ was obtained from beetroot 2 6 t ha 1 median values from swiss chard 4 0 t ha 1 and carrot 4 2 t ha 1 and the highest from cabbage 9 0 t ha 1 table 1 our results illustrate that alien vegetables are more productive than traditional vegetables per unit area of land the lowest seasonal water use for alien vegetables was 234 mm tomato median seasonal values were 340 mm beetroot and 360 mm butternut and the highest seasonal water use was 537 mm onion water productivity values for alien vegetables ranged from 0 76 to 2 45 kg m 3 the lowest water productivity was obtained from beetroot whereas the highest water productivity was observed from cabbage generally the grand mean results show that water productivity values for traditional vegetables grand mean 1 29 kg m 3 and alien vegetables 1 37 kg m 3 are comparable 3 2 nutrient concentrations nutritional yield and potential contribution to human nutrition the nutrient concentrations of ten traditional vegetables are presented in table 2 the mean iron content varied from 9 to 47 mg 100 g 1 pumpkin aboveground edible biomass exhibited the lowest iron concentration and black nightshade displayed the highest iron concentration zinc concentration ranged from 2 to 29 mg 100 g 1 the lowest zinc concentration was attained from sweet potato aboveground edible biomass whereas the highest zinc concentration was obtained from cowpea aboveground edible biomass kale showed the lowest vitamin a concentration 241 μg rae 100 g 1 and amaranth 1556 μg rae 100 g 1 displayed the highest vitamin a concentration table 3 presents nutrient concentrations values of ten alien vegetables the results of this study highlighted that alien vegetables are lower in iron and zinc compared to traditional vegetables the mean values ranged from 4 to 43 mg 100 g 1 for iron for zinc the mean values ranged from 2 to 16 mg 100 g 1 for vitamin a alien vegetables were superior grand mean 2121 μg rae 100 g 1 over traditional vegetables grand mean 884 μg rae 100 g 1 it is crucial to note that onion contains no vitamin a 0 μg rae 100 g 1 the estimated percentage nutrient contribution of twenty vegetables for four age groups is presented in table 4 assessments showed that 100 g of boiled spider flower could potentially provide 87 of iron whereas amaranth could potentially provide 32 of zinc and 47 of vitamin a to the daily recommended nutrient intake for infants for children aged between 4 19 years traditional vegetables could potentially contribute a lesser percentage to the daily recommended nutrient intake because of the higher demand box 1 for vitamin a it was interesting to note that butternut could potentially provide more than the daily recommended nutrient intake for all age groups we calculated the amount of nutrients that can be harvested per unit area of land nutritional yield ny for traditional and alien vegetables table 5 the grand means displayed more micronutrients 2 fold could be harvested from traditional vegetables compared to alien vegetables and more β carotene 3 fold could be harvested from alien vegetables compared to traditional vegetables for traditional vegetables the highest fe ny 1082 g ha 1 zn ny 1294 g ha 1 and β carotene ny 453 g ha 1 were obtained from sweet potato aboveground edible biomass cowpea aboveground edible biomass and amaranth respectively for alien vegetables the highest fe ny 1223 g ha 1 zn ny 515 g ha 1 and β carotene ny 1984 g ha 1 were achieved from swiss chard and butternut respectively 3 3 nutritional water productivity the grand mean results indicated that nutritional water productivity values for traditional vegetables were 485 mg m 3 for iron 182 mg m 3 for zinc and 13 377 μg rae m 3 for vitamin a table 5 the lowest nutritional water productivity values for iron 19 mg m 3 zinc 17 mg m 3 and vitamin a 546 mg m 3 were observed from pumpkin aboveground edible biomass respectively the highest nutritional water productivity for iron was observed from spider flower 827 mg m 3 for zinc 612 mg m 3 it was attained from cowpea aboveground edible biomass and for vitamin a 23 649 μg rae m 3 from chinese cabbage generally our results revealed that traditional vegetables were more productive than alien vegetables grand means for iron 185 mg m 3 and for zinc 71 mg m 3 per unit of water used to produce micronutrients whereas alien vegetables were more productive per unit of water used to produce vitamin a grand mean 27 222 μg rae m 3 for alien vegetables the lowest nutritional water productivity for iron zinc and vitamin a was obtained from carrot 87 mg m 3 butternut 18 mg m 3 and beetroot 191 μg rae m 3 respectively the highest nutritional water productivity values were 430 mg m 3 for iron cabbage 260 mg m 3 for zinc carrot and 83 854 μg rae m 3 for vitamin a butternut our results showed that spider flower required the least amount of water to meet iron 202 litres person 1 day 1 and vitamin a 162 litres person 1 day 1 requirements whereas cowpea aboveground edible biomass required the least amount of water to meet zinc requirements 269 litres person 1 day 1 table 6 for alien vegetables our results revealed that more water would be required to meet human nutrition requirements for micronutrients swiss chard indicated that 1060 litres person 1 day 1 would be required to meet iron requirements carrot showed that 808 litres person 1 day 1 would be required to meet zinc requirements and butternut illustrated that 59 litres person 1 day 1 would be required to meet vitamin a requirements 4 discussion although nutritional water productivity data can provide useful information in an agricultural context in relation to human nutritional requirements water use of crops and crop productivity nutritional water productivity data of traditional vegetables is minimal ordinarily literature chivenge et al 2015 maseko et al 2018 mavengahama et al 2013 use anecdotal information to back up claims that traditional vegetables are more productive in terms of biomass aboveground biomass and or storage organ and water productivity and nutrient dense iron zinc and β carotene than alien vegetables therefore this study sought to assess these claims using datasets biomass aboveground biomass and or storage organ nutrient concentration and evapotranspiration sourced from literature we assessed nutritional water productivity of ten traditional vegetables with ten alien vegetables our expectations were that selected traditional vegetables were superior to alien vegetables in terms of biomass aboveground biomass and or storage organ however the results of this study revealed that alien vegetables were more productive than traditional vegetables in terms of biomass aboveground biomass and or storage organ we suspect that reported yield values for traditional vegetables occurred under sub optimal conditions and reported yield values for alien vegetables occurred under optimal conditions over the years alien vegetables have been improved through plant breeding and were selected for high performance under well endowed growing conditions agricultural production for most rural resource poor households occurs under rain fed conditions maseko et al 2018 therefore achieving yield potential is limited by water availability assuming that the crop is well managed sowing date cultivar date plant density nutrient management and crop protection van ittersum et al 2013 in future decades water scarcity will intensify especially for sub saharan africa therefore the water productivity index wp a ratio of biomass aboveground biomass and or storage organ per crop evapotranspiration would be a critical benchmark for food production van ittersum et al 2013 this index is synonymous to water use efficiency however van halsema and vincent 2012 argued that these two terms are not similar the difference being the denominator water use efficiency is the ratio of biomass aboveground biomass and or storage organ per total water applied our results show that traditional vegetables use slightly less water grand mean 473 mm season than alien vegetables grand mean 513 mm season which agrees with other studies chibarabada et al 2017 nyathi et al 2018b oelofse and van averbeke 2012 in addition the results of this study illustrated that water productivity of both vegetables traditional vegetables 1 29 kg m 3 and alien vegetables 1 37 kg m 3 was comparable this was contrary to previous studies nyathi et al 2016 nyathi et al 2018b which reported that the water productivity of traditional vegetables was higher than that of alien vegetables these contradictory findings by our study might have been caused by assessing water productivity using datasets from various locations whereas studies by nyathi et al 2016 and nyathi et al 2018b assessed water productivity using datasets from the same location unkovich et al 2018 emphasized the need to use the beneficial use of water transpiration rather than evapotranspiration when assessing water productivity of crops studies conducted by nyathi et al 2018a and nyathi et al 2018b assessed water productivity of selected traditional vegetables amaranth and spider flower and an alien vegetable swiss chard their initial results showed that water productivity of traditional vegetables and an alien vegetable were similar when evapotranspiration was used as the denominator however when transpiration was used as the denominator water productivity of traditional vegetables was higher than the water productivity of the alien vegetable this illustrates the need to use transpiration instead of evapotranspiration in addition assessing water productivity of vegetables beetroot cowpea pumpkin and sweet potato that have both different types of edible plant parts leaves and the storage organ is a challenge some studies evaluated water productivity using only one plant part for example a study by oelofse and van averbeke 2012 evaluated water productivity of pumpkin aboveground edible biomass which excluded the storage organ this is a bit unfortunate because the aboveground biomass may be partitioned into both plant parts and would favour the storage organ over the aboveground edible biomass therefore it is crucial to use total biomass aboveground biomass and the storage organ when assessing the water productivity of these vegetables these vegetables have the potential of being used for dual purpose dark green leafy vegetable and the storage organ for human consumption for improved food and nutrition security in addition we converted the water footprint values of selected alien vegetables to water productivity values table a2 at a glance these values are higher compared to the values of this study probably the water footprint values from le roux et al 2016 and mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 were calculated on a fresh mass basis therefore alien vegetables might have high water footprint if a fresh mass was used but if a dry mass was used water footprints of these vegetables could be relatively low le roux et al 2016 le roux et al 2016 found that the water footprints of maize and wheat were higher than those of vegetables if expressed in terms of fresh mass however when expressed in terms of dry mass the water footprints of maize and wheat were similar to those of vegetables information on water footprints for selected traditional vegetables was missing from literature surveyed from research conducted by nutritionists on the nutrient concentration of crops daily consumption targets to meet human nutrition requirements can be derived uusiku et al 2010 van jaarsveld et al 2014 schönfeldt and pretorius 2011 our results showed that traditional vegetables were superior to alien vegetables in iron 52 and zinc 64 whereas alien vegetables were superior to traditional vegetables in vitamin a 58 concentration this concurs with several studies which have been conducted on the nutrient concentration of selected vegetables schönfeldt and pretorius 2011 usda 2018 uusiku et al 2010 van jaarsveld et al 2014 wenhold et al 2012 however the reported nutritional values show a quite high degree of variability we pose a question why are nutritional values of vegetables not conservative uusiku et al 2010 attributed the variation to genotype environment management and different seasons several studies afolayan and jimoh 2009 odhav et al 2007 uusiku et al 2010 van jaarsveld et al 2014 schönfeldt and pretorius 2011 conducted by nutritionists did not evaluate the effect of environmental factors climatic conditions severe drought conditions soil fertility and management on nutrient concentrations of vegetables the goal of nutritionists is to compute the portion per 100 g of iron zinc and β carotene that should be consumed to meet daily consumption targets for human nutrition aerts and chapin 1999 found that nitrogen deficiency in crops such as lettuce carrot swiss chard and maize reduced β carotene concentration another study conducted by cole et al 2016 found that fertilizer application increased iron and zinc in tomato plant tissues in addition nyathi et al 2018 2018b revealed that severe water stress increased iron and zinc nutrient concentration whereas β carotene concentration showed sensitivity towards severe water stressed conditions for amaranth spider flower and swiss chard these studies highlight that environmental factors play a major role in the nutrient concentration of crops there is not much collaboration amongst nutritionists agronomists and irrigation experts mabhaudhi et al 2016 however evaluating nutrient concentration without considering yield is not an ideal practice because of both account for the nutrient yield per unit area of land a useful term that was suggested by bumgarner et al 2012 the mean results revealed that traditional vegetables have higher iron and zinc nutritional yields while alien vegetables were superior in β carotene nutritional yield this study provided new insight into the importance of using nutritional yield as a parameter for assessing the nutritional superiority of selected vegetables for the assessments of the number of children aged between 4 18 years that one could feed for a period of 90 days from one hectare for iron and zinc requirements traditional vegetables showed that it could provide for more children iron grand mean 40 zinc grand mean 15 children compared to alien vegetables iron grand mean 15 children zinc grand mean 6 children appendix a 3 practically this suggests that these children would need to consume huge amounts of boiled alien vegetables to meet their daily iron and zinc requirements sweet potato aboveground edible biomass 96 children showed the highest number of children that it could potentially supply with iron and cowpea aboveground edible biomass 70 children showed the highest number of children that it could potentially supply with zinc for vitamin a alien vegetables 69 children could potentially supply more children compared to traditional vegetables grand mean 32 children for a period of 90 days butternut illustrated the highest number 264 children of children that it could potentially supply with vitamin a limited information exists on nutritional yield of alien and traditional vegetables nyathi et al 2018b conducted a study that evaluated nutritional yields of nutrients iron zinc and β carotene for amaranth spider flower and swiss chard they reported nutritional yield values that were within the range of the current study for example our study reported iron nutrition yield of 587 g ha 1 for amaranth whereas nyathi et al 2018b reported iron nutritional yield values for amaranth ranging from 362 to 1361 g ha 1 nutritional water productivity nwp is an index that links crop production water use in agriculture and nutrient concentration chibarabada et al 2017 mabhaudhi et al 2016 it was interesting to note that traditional vegetables were more productive than alien vegetables in fe nwp and zn nwp spider flower was the most productive vegetable to produce iron per unit of water used whereas cowpea aboveground edible biomass was the most productive vegetable to produce zinc per unit of water used table 5 alien vegetables were more productive 2 fold in β carotene nwp compared to traditional vegetables butternut was the most productive vegetable to produce vitamin a per unit of water used table 5 this highlights the need for crop diversification in order to maximize the amount of nutrients produced per unit of water used to meet human nutrition requirements practically nwp values can be used to compute the total amount of water required litres person 1 day 1 to meet human nutrition requirements iron zinc and vitamin a table 6 for example the current population of south africa is estimated at 56 5 million people and it is expected to reach 65 million people by the year 2030 statistics south africa stats sa 2018 therefore a diet of spider flower used as a side dish would require 11 417 424 kiloliters day 1 202 l day 1 56 521 900 people 1000 l kl to meet iron requirements for children aged between 4 18 years in 2018 in 2030 the same diet would require 13 130 000 kl day 1 202 l day 1 65 000 000 people 1000 l kl to meet iron requirements for the same age group an additional 1 712 576 kl day 1 information on nwp of vegetables is inadequate conducted studies mabhaudhi et al 2017b nyathi et al 2018b mdemu et al 2009 renault and wallender 2000 reported nwp values iron zinc and β carotene for limited vegetables amaranth spider flower swiss chard cowpea tomato and onion our study is the first to benchmark nwp for a number of vegetables table 5 5 limitations of the study and future research water use values of selected vegetables were sourced from literature and used to generate the water productivity database the challenge with this approach is that some studies did not indicate whether water use was total water applied or evapotranspiration this has placed a severe limitation on water productivity values reported by this study another complexity was that the estimates of nutritional water productivity values fe nwp zn nwp and β carotene nwp of this study came from two independent datasets a crop water productivity database and the nutrient concentration database both with some level of uncertainty our major concern was the reliability of using these two independent datasets to generate a third database nwp we agree that this approach is not ideal but it was the only pragmatic approach to come up with first order estimates of nutritional water productivity for traditional vegetables and alien vegetables regardless of the complexities reported by this paper key findings showed that traditional vegetables are low in β carotene concentration and dense in iron and zinc this contradicts information from literature which reported traditional vegetables as miracle crops nutrient dense in all micronutrients and vitamins using anecdotal information our study is the first in assessing nutritional water productivity of ten traditional vegetables and compare them with ten alien vegetables we propose that future research and validation of these results should consider the following the results of this study highlighted that nutrient concentration of vegetables is not conservative because of several factors plant variety among species environment soil type and ph harvesting method climatic conditions different seasons soil fertility and water availability however it was not clear which of these factors affect nutrient concentration of vegetables therefore future research should assess the major factors crucial for determining the nutrient concentration of vegetables yield response of traditional vegetables to irrigation and fertilizer is unknown we propose that field experiments for a wide range of traditional vegetables should be conducted to assess their yield response to inputs water and fertility stresses and should develop new variables aboveground edible biomass nutrient concentration nutritional yield evapotranspiration water productivity and nutritional water productivity using datasets collected from the same experiments table 7 these newly developed variables will improve the agronomic knowledge of traditional vegetables in addition data collected from field experiments can be used to calibrate and validate crop growth models aquacrop the soil water balance and agricultural production system simulator apsim for upscaling the results in countries such as kenya and tanzania traditional vegetables have been commercialized through various awareness campaigns local radio stations tv stations trade fairs exhibitions in store promotions outdoor promotions nutritional walks and product sampling mwangi and kimathi 2006 this show that there is a possibility of commercializing traditional vegetables in other sub saharan african countries therefore future efforts to commercialize traditional vegetables should consider using massive awareness campaigns as in kenya and tanzania in addition these studies should consider assessing other factors personal food preferences attitude aspirations and identity middle class that influence the acceptability and consumption of traditional vegetables in other sub saharan african countries mavengahama et al 2013 the aboveground edible biomass of traditional vegetables can be higher in nutrient concentration iron zinc and β carotene compared with alien vegetables however nutrients might not be bioavailable because of anti nutrients such as oxalate hydrocyanic acid tannins and polyphenols mavengahama et al 2013 moreover the bioavailability of nutrients might change depending on the method of food preparation i e boiling steaming or frying schönfeldt and pretorius 2011 we propose that food scientists in collaboration with chefs should find the best method of preparing traditional vegetables such that micronutrients and vitamins are bioavailable for human consumption traditional vegetables are highly perishable within a few hours of being harvested in 2015 the south africa s agricultural research council in collaboration with nestle launched a new line of maggi noodles containing amaranth http www nestle com media news nestle south africa maggi noodles morogo launch to improve the shelf life of traditional vegetables and reduce post harvest losses we propose that more of such products should be developed from traditional vegetables in collaboration with nutraceutical companies in sub saharan africa in sub saharan africa vegetables such as beetroot cowpea pumpkin and sweet potato have the potential of being utilized as dual purpose vegetables green leafy vegetable and the storage organ the aboveground edible biomass can be an additional source of green leafy vegetable during the summer season and after the end of the growing season the storage organ can be consumed this spreads food availability over a longer period hence an improvement in the nutritional food security of rural resource poor households nyathi et al 2019 we propose that a study should be conducted to evaluate the effect of leaf harvesting on yield and nutrient concentration of storage organs if water become scarce water footprints information can inform farmers to plant less water intensive crops le roux et al 2016 the literature surveyed for this study showed that information on the water footprint of traditional vegetables is minimal we propose that future research should consider evaluating the water footprints of many traditional vegetables using data collected from the same location acknowledgements funding from the south african water research commission wrc under project k5 2171 4
