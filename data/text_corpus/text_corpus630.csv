3150,to face the challenges of ongoing climate change renewable energy sources are needed to reduce co2 emissions to the atmosphere the south german molasse basin sgmb contains an important geothermal aquifer in germany however an enhanced understanding of the flow regime at the basin scale remains a fundamental limiting factor in assessing a long term and sustainable strategy for using this green energy source here we report 14cdoc and 81kr groundwater dating results together with hydrochemical data stable water isotopes noble gases and out diffusion experiments that indicate that the thermal groundwater consists of at least two groundwater sources a formerly unknown young groundwater component with apparent water ages between 9 800 and 18 700 a and an old groundwater component which shows an apparent water age of up to approximately 300 ka the results of the out diffusion experiments with core material from the upper jurassic aquifer uja suggest that diffusion processes between rock matrix water and more mobile fracture water represent a controlling mechanism for groundwater flow and the observed extended apparent groundwater ages within the uja the observed elevated 14cdoc activities and the high spatial heterogeneity in groundwater ages close to the southern margin of the sgmb were interpreted as a recharge zone of the system the combination of the 14cdoc and 81kr methods shows the potential as a powerful groundwater dating tool for deep aquifers keywords 14cdoc 81kr groundwater dating upper jurassic aquifer south german molasse basin geothermal groundwater 1 introduction the upper jurassic aquifer uja in the south german molasse basin sgmb plays a key role in renewable energy production in bavaria as this aquifer is considered to contain the largest thermal water resource for hydrothermal energy use in central europe goldscheider et al 2010 stober 2014 therefore understanding the flow regime at the basin scale remains a fundamental limiting factor in assessing a long term and sustainable strategy for using this green energy source moreover there is a lack of reliable groundwater dating of the uja over the entire extent of the sgmb in combination with the heterogeneous and complex geological structure of the basin the origin of the deep geothermal groundwater resource and the time scale of recharge into the basin are still largely unknown at present there are a number of methods available for groundwater dating the most common technique is the use of radioactive isotopes with their specific dating ranges e g aggarwal 2013 numerous papers describe the application of 3h t1 2 12 3 years e g vogel et al 1974 schlosser et al 1988 and 14c t1 2 5 730 years for groundwater dating e g wassenaar et al 1991 kalin 2000 coppola et al 2015 while 81kr t1 2 229 000 years has become more common over the last couple of years e g sturchio et al 2004 jiang et al 2012 aeschbach hertig 2014 the 14c method is the only available radioisotope that can date old groundwater at a time scale between a few thousands of years and up to around 30 ka radiocarbon dating can be done on dissolved inorganic carbon dic but often requires various correction models fontes and garnier 1979 han and plummer 2013 because several physical and biogeochemical processes may affect the 14cdic content within the aquifer fontes and garnier 1979 fontes 1983 fontes 1992 geyh 2000 mook 2005 hershey et al 2016 cartwright et al 2020 such isotope dilution effects were also assumed for the north western margin of the uja by heine and einsiedl 2020 where different wells deliver water with corrected 14cdic apparent water ages up to around 30 ka while the 14cdoc apparent water ages are much lower and may mainly represent holocene origin up to now it was assumed for the central part of the uja that groundwater has 14cdic concentrations below or very close to the detection limit of 2 pmc goldbrunner 1987 heidinger et al 2019 but the question arises whether previous 14cdic measurements represent reasonable groundwater dating results in contrast it was shown by heine and einsiedl 2020 that 14c dating on dissolved organic carbon doc is suitable to date groundwater in the uja because of its probable resistance against microbial degradation and the lack of isotope dilution processes by biogeochemical processes murphy et al 1989 geyer et al 1993 hershey et al 2016 thomas et al 2021 apparent groundwater ages outside the range of 14c dating can be studied with the inert 81kr making this radioisotope an interesting tool for dating very old groundwater up to 1 3 ma gerber et al 2017 81kr dating is a relatively new and innovative method and provides an ideal tracer because the production of 81kr is mainly restricted to the atmosphere and it is assumed that there is no or only a little in situ subsurface production in aquifers with moderate to low uranium concentration purtschert et al 2021 moreover there are no additional sinks for 81kr within a reservoir collon et al 2004 jiang et al 2012 gerber et al 2017 previous to this work three 81kr measurements were performed at three deep water wells in the southern part of the uja and showed apparent groundwater ages between 60 and 135 ka heidinger et al 2019 based on these few data an increase of 81kr apparent ages from the southern margin of the basin to the north was assumed by the authors and points to a northwards directed flow of the upper jurassic groundwater with its recharge area south of the molasse basin heidinger et al 2019 in this context it is worth mentioning that the observed high piston flow ages of the uja located in the north western part of cracow poland were explained by diffusion effects between the mobile water in the fractures and quasi stagnant water in the rock matrix zuber et al 2000 the rock matrix water may partially also be an important water reservoir of the uja in the sgmb further it is speculated that rock matrix diffusion processes also affect the calculated 81kr apparent ages and the hydrochemistry within the sgmb to study the effect of rock matrix diffusion on apparent groundwater ages and the water chemistry the chemical and isotopic composition of pore water can be investigated by out diffusion experiments and has already been successfully applied in different laboratory studies with the crystalline rock matrix waber and smellie 2008 waber et al 2012 therefore in a multi parameter approach we extended the 81kr analyses in the southern part of the uja and combined them with new 14cdoc analyses finding a formerly unknown young groundwater component that further supports the hypothesis of a recharge area in the southern part of the sgmb was done by 14cdoc analyses we also included hydrochemistry data stable water isotopes strontium isotopes and noble gas methods in this multi parameter approach to give new insight into the water age distribution of the uja in addition to characterise the effect of rock matrix diffusion on apparent water ages and water chemistry on mobile groundwater in the fractures out diffusion experiments with core material from a deep drilling campaign in munich were carried out 2 study area and hydrogeological setting 2 1 study area and geological setting the sgmb is flanked by the danube in the north and the alpine folded molasse in the south with our study area being located south of munich in the central part of the sgmb fig 1 the sgmb is part of the north alpine foreland basin extending from france in the west over switzerland and germany to austria in the east stober 2014 the sgmb was formed at the eocene oligocene border during the alpine orogeny and is composed of a crystalline basement covered by mesozoic sediments from the jurassic and cretaceous with a thickness between 500 and 1000 m while the rest of the basin is filled with sediments from the oligocene and miocene bachmann et al 1987 the structure of the sgmb dips from north to south below the alps resulting in a maximum thickness of the basin up to 5000 m in front of the alps bachmann et al 1987 an up to 600 m thick uja shows a heterogeneous geology which consists mainly of small pored limestones and fine to coarse grained dolomites böhm et al 2013 konrad et al 2021 the geology is characterised by deep karstic features fractures and fault zones lemcke 1988 frisch and huber 2000 because of the geological structure of the sgmb increasingwater temperatures can be usually found at higher depths of the uja lüschen et al 2014 fritzer 2012 following an average geothermal gradient of approx 3 5 c 100 m in the sgmb water temperatures of up to 155 c at a depth of around 5 km within the upper jurassic aquifer can be found in the south of munich providing excellent conditions for low enthalpy hydrogeothermal energy exploitation steiner et al 2014 the high water temperatures and the high demand for energy in the densely populated region of munich lead to the increasing use of the upper jurassic geothermal resource for heat and electricity production steiner et al 2014 since the construction of the first geothermal plants in the 1990s the number of geothermal plants in the sgmb has increased to a total of 24 geothermal plants in the bavarian part of the sgmb today agemar et al 2014 the high interest in the upper jurassic aquifer for geothermal energy supply has initiated many studies in the sgmb these works can generally be divided into studies with a focus on the hydrochemistry udluft 1975 andrews et al 1985 stichler et al 1987 prestel 1988 weise et al 1991 bertleff et al 1993 stichler 1997 bertleff and watzel 2002 birner et al 2011 mayrhofer 2013 stober et al 2014 stober 2014 heidinger et al 2019 heine and einsiedl 2020 heine et al 2021 and hydraulic studies lemcke and tunn 1956 lemcke 1976 villinger 1977 andres and frisch 1981 lemcke 1987 villinger 1988 frisch and huber 2000 savvatis et al 2015 the results of the studies are often contradictory and do not yet provide a uniform hydrogeological picture of the dynamics within the uja in the central part of the sgmb the recent upper jurassic groundwater shows an uncharacteristically low salinity for a deep groundwater system therefore it is assumed that the fossil upper jurassic formation water was washed out by a meteoric groundwater component and the recent upper jurassic thermal water may be composed of a mixture of meteoric freshwater and saline tertiary formation waters and petroleum associated waters lemcke and tunn 1956 udluft 1975 lemcke 1976 stichler et al 1987 prestel 1988 balderer 1990 stichler 1997 birner et al 2011 mayrhofer 2013 stober 2014 by combining hydrochemistry and environmental isotope data using a type of cluster analysis three different groundwater types within the uja of the central part of the sgmb were found heine et al 2021 water types 1 subtypes 1a and 1b and 2 na ca hco3 cl type are found in the southern eastern and northern parts of the central part of the sgmb around the city area of munich they are characterised by relatively low mineralisation tds 1000 mg l while δ2h and δ18o signatures may indicate groundwater recharge under cold climate conditions in contrast to groundwater types 1 and 2 groundwater type 3 na cl hco3 type shows increasing 40ar 36ar ratios and δ2h and δ18o signatures that plot significantly below the gmwl this groundwater type is typical for wells west of munich these findings suggest that groundwater type 3 may be affected by highly saline fossil groundwater from the overlying paleogene and neogene sediments heine et al 2021 the observed hydrochemical data patterns together with the 81kr apparent ages lead to the conclusion of an infiltration area in the south of the central part of the sgmb probably very close to the north of the alpine margin bertleff et al 1993 heidinger et al 2019 heine et al 2021 or south of the northern calcareous alps udluft 1975 2 2 glaciations during the pleistocene and last glacial maximum during the pleistocene two major glaciations covered mainly the northern parts of europe with glaciers and permafrost the glaciers came either from scandinavia or from mountain ranges such as the alps edmunds and milne 2001 the sgmb was affected by the riss glaciation lasting approximately from 130 to 200 ka and the würm glaciation lasting from 15 to 115 ka ago therefore it is not clear whether significant recharge into groundwater existed during high glacial periods as there are gaps in continuous groundwater recharge observed from calculated apparent groundwater ages in some european aquifers during the pleistocene mcintosh et al 2012 for example a multitracer study that was performed in the glatt valley in switzerland revealed an interruption in local groundwater recharge between 17 and 25 ka caused by overlying glaciers beyerle et al 1998 similarly results of dating speleothems in karstic caves in the cracow wielun upland west northwest of cracow showed the lack of significant infiltration in the period of 15 to 20 ka pazdur et al 1995 as a consequence groundwater systems may probably have been most significantly drained at the end of the last glacial extension phase nevertheless good recharge conditions may have existed in some other systems judging from continuous records of 14c dates during the pleistocene blavoux and olive 1982 rudolph et al 1984 van der kemp et al 2000 which may document the potential of local groundwater recharge between around 15 to 30 ka the study area of the sgmb may not have been completely covered with glaciers during the pleistocene as illustrated in fig 1 bertleff et al 1993 the most extensive glaciation meg with the furthest glacier advance was during the riss glaciation bertleff et al 1993 the last extension phase during the würm glaciation reached its peak at the last glacial maximum lgm in the sgmb which can be dated to around 25 ka seguinot et al 2018 most of the sgmb can be assumed to be glacier free at this point in the late pleistocene with a potential for groundwater recharge 3 methods and materials 3 1 groundwater sampling campaign thermal groundwater was repeatedly sampled at 5 deep geothermal wells 1 5 for hydrochemistry stable water isotopes strontium isotopes radiocarbon 14cdoc and 14cdic tritium and noble gases between january and march 2021 in addition 81kr analyses were performed at two locations wells 3 and 4 all samples were taken during the regular operation of the geothermal wells in addition all wells are only screened in the main upper jurassic aquifer at a depth between 2 900 and 5 100 m and are in operation for more than five years with pumping rates between 60 and 150 l s this guarantee that collected data is not influenced by fluids from the drilling process the water temperatures at the five samples geothermal wells range between 135 and 155 c during the sampling the physicochemical parameters ph specific electric conductivity ec and groundwater temperature t were constantly measured with a multi parameter portable meter multi 3430 wtw the carbonate species hco 3 and h2co3 were determined on site by titration with 0 1 m hcl and naoh the groundwater samples for chemical analysis were field filtered with a 0 22 µm filter the samples were stored in 50 ml hdpe containers acidified with hno3 65 for cations and stored at 4 c while the samples for anions were frozen prior to analysis the major cations and anions were analysed with an ion chromatograph dionex ics1100 thermo fisher scientific at the chair of hydrogeology at the technical university of munich the analytical error was 5 the groundwater samples for analysis of the strontium isotopes 87sr 86sr were also field filtered with a 0 22 µm filter in 50 ml hdpe containers and stored at 4 c prior to analysis with thermal ionisations mass spectrometry vg sector 54 mircromass at the laboratory of isoanalysis ug in berlin the data correction and normalisation of the raw data are described in mahlknecht et al 2017 the measure the dissolved organic carbon doc 15 ml of the groundwater sample was

hydrogeology at the technical university of munich the analytical error was 5 for the stable water isotopes measurements 15 ml hdpe vials were filled completely with groundwater while the hydrocarbons contained in the groundwater sample were removed by the addition of activated carbon the sample was also field filtered with a 0 22 µm filter and the stable water isotope ratios were analysed with an isotopic water analyser iwa 45ep los gatos research at the chair of hydrogeology at the technical university of munich the stable water isotope ratios are expressed in the delta notation δ18o and δ2h relative to the vsmow standard the analytical error was 0 1 for δ18o and 1 δ2h for the analysis of 14cdoc 20 l of groundwater was poured into cleaned hdpe jerry cans acidified to ph 2 with approximately 25 ml hcl 36 and stored at 4 c prior to extraction at the laboratory the extraction of the doc was done with the spe ppl method dittmar et al 2008 li et al 2016 heine and einsiedl 2020 subsequently the samples were sent to the leibniz laboratory for radiometric dating and stable isotope research at the christian albrechts university of kiel and the analysis was performed with accelerator mass spectrometry hve 3mv tandetron 4130 for the analysis of dic two cleaned 1l hdpe bottles were completely filled with groundwater and sent to the gadam centre of the silesian university of technology in gliwice poland the analysis was done with accelerator mass spectrometry ams piotrowska 2013 groundwater sampling for the 81kr analyses was carried out by the hydroisotop gmbh the sampling and analysis process is described in detail by heidinger et al 2019 after pre concentration of two water samples at hydroisotop gmbh the samples were analysed with the atta 3 method at the laboratory for radiokrypton dating at the argonne national laboratory the samples for the noble gas analysis were collected in copper tubes mounted in aluminium racks and were air tight sealed with stainless steel clamps on both sides of the copper tube beyerle et al 2000 to avoid any degassing or fractionation processes the samples were taken uncooled and under reservoir pressure nakata et al 2019 after sampling the sealed copper tubes were stored at 4 c the analysis of the samples was done with an mm5400 mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific at the institute of environmental physics in heidelberg for the analysis of tritium 1 l hdpe containers were not completely filled as described in sültenfuß et al 2009 the samples were stored at 4 c until analysis with a quadrupole mass spectrometer qms at the department of oceanography of the institute of environmental physics at the university of bremen the tritium detection limit is 0 1 tu 3 2 determination of the upper jurassic pore water by core sampling in addition to the groundwater samples pore water experiments were performed to study the composition of the upper jurassic pore water for this we used 2 rock samples from the sidewall coring swc at schäftlarnstraße th4 the size of the samples was limited due to the technical properties of the swc and ranged between 3 and 5 cm with corresponding masses between 105 and 149 g the samples were taken from depths of 2 940 and 3 260 m from zeta 4 5 k2 and zeta 1 k3 the effective porosity and the mass of porewater of each core sample were determined as described in bohnsack et al 2020 the groundwater found at schäftlarnstraße corresponds very closely to groundwater type 3 but also shows similarities to groundwater type 1 according to the classification of heine et al 2021 out diffusion experiments were done for each sample for each sample 3d printed polylactide containers were custom made the inside and outside of the containers were sealed with water resistant food safe epoxy resin prior to the experiments the cap of the containers was also sealed airtight with the epoxy resin the containers are designed in a way that the samples are covered for as long as possible with water the samples were covered with 100 ml bi distilled water from the laboratory which was buffered with bicarbonate buffer tablets to minimise dissolution of the carbonates this bi distilled water shows chloride concentrations below the detection limit of 1 mg l the samples were taken from the bottom of the container through a discofix 3 way stopcock by b braun the containers were constantly shaken in a rotary shaker at 20 c at the beginning of the experiments 1 ml of sample was taken at regular intervals the sample intervals were increased during the time of the experiments the chloride concentration was measured in those samples the experiment was finished after 91 days 13 weeks and then the sodium and chloride concentrations were measured the samples were analysed with an ion chromatograph dionex ics1100 thermo fisher scientific at the chair of hydrogeology at the technical university of munich the analytical error was 5 in a blind sample a container with the epoxy resin sealing was tested to guarantee that there was no cross contamination the initial sodium and chloride concentration of the pore water was then calculated by a mass balance equation as follows waber and smellie 2008 1 c pw m pw m twi σ n m s c equil c o r r e c t e d m twi c twi σ n m s c s m pw with 2 c equil c o r r e c t e d c t w m twi σ n m s m twi where c

mixing effects can be calculated with 81kr as follows sturchio et al 2004 purtschert et al 2013 3 81 t 1 λ 81 ln r r air with λ 81 the decay constant of 81kr the apparent groundwater ages or piston flow ages for 14c can be calculated as follows 4 14 t 8267 ln 14 c t 14 c 0 with 14 c t measured radiocarbon concentration and 14 c 0 the initial radiocarbon concentration the initial 14c0doc concentrations can be in the range of to 85 pmc geyer et al 1993 to 120 pmc einsiedl et al 2007a 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical and isotopic composition of the uja groundwater the results of the groundwater sampling campaign that was performed at five deep wells 1 5 in the southern part of the sgmb are presented in tables 1 and 2 the ph values ranged from 6 2 to 6 6 while the tds varied between 437 mg l and 789 mg l with the highest tds value for groundwater sample 3 the groundwater shows a high alkalinity and can be classified as na hco3 cl type according to the classification of the groundwater in the uja by heine et al 2021 this groundwater represents water type 1 interestingly groundwater from well 3 showed higher concentrations of sodium and chloride compared to all other water samples this may indicate some effect of saline formation waters that may stem from the overlying tertiary rocks or from fossil water that is still stored in the rock matrix and exchanges by diffusion heine et al 2021 the nitrate content at all sampled wells was as expected for deep carbonate aquifers below the detection limit of 0 8 mg l while sulfate concentrations were in the range between 4 78 mg l and 34 72 mg l in a previous study that was performed by einsiedl et al 2007b it was shown by using δ34s of dissolved sulphate and δ34s values of fulvic acids that bacterial sulfate reduction has occurred in the groundwater of the uja as the redox potential of the deep geothermal water was strongly reduced and h2s was also detected at the investigated wells data not shown we suggest that the strong variation of sulfate concentrations may be controlled by bacterial sulfate reduction fluoride concentrations were under the detection limit of 1 24 mg l and 7 48 mg l while the bromide concentrations ranged between 0 38 mg l and 0 92 mg l both ions are characteristic of deep groundwater within the sgmb particularly for groundwater of the na cl type eichinger et al 2007 doc concentrations were in the range between 1 3 mg l and 4 1 mg l the elevated doc concentration of well 3 of around 4 mg l together with fluoride concentrations of more than 7 mg l may indicate some influences of fossil water and oilfield water from the overlying tertiary sands heine et al 2021 it is worth to be mentioned that the rate of chemical reactions may increase at higher temperature as a result groundwater with higher temperatures can dissolve more minerals from the surrounding rocks and may therefore have a higher electrical conductivity for instance the results of geochemical modelling using phreeqc showed that an increase of the water temperature from 20 c up to 100 c will double the ca mg ratio in water stober 2014 however the water temperature of the sampled wells is very close together between 135 and 155 c and may have only an effect on the absolute electrical conductivity but not on the observed differences between them the stable water isotopes of water samples 1 2 4 and 5 plot below the gmwl but close to the lmwl for munich fig 4 these samples showed values between 11 42 and 11 76 for δ18o and 85 1 and 85 7 for δ2h while sample 3 deviates from this cluster and was significantly isotopically enriched in δ18o the samples within the cluster 1 2 4 and 5 and sample 3 were of meteoric origin and may have be formed under cold climate conditions the isotopic shift of sample 3 to heavier δ18o values may be affected by a more intense water rock interaction than samples 1 2 4 and 5 heine et al 2021 this interpretation is also supported by the 87sr 86sr ratio of sample 3 the 87sr 86sr ratios of all groundwater samples ranged between 0 708599 and 0 709093 while the 87sr 86sr ratio of the upper jurassic carbonate rocks is characterised by isotope values of around 0 7075 thuro et al 2019 the highest sr2 concentration was found for sample 3 with a value of 0 75 mg l that corresponds with a 87sr 86sr ratio of 0 708599 this may indicate that the strontium isotope chemistry of all groundwater samples was not predominantly influenced by the dissolution of upper jurassic carbonate rocks after recharge however the elevated sr2 concentrations of groundwater sample 3 are coupled with the lowest 87sr 86sr isotope ratio this result may support the interpretation of an intensive water rock interaction and the dissolution of calcite carbonates most likely from upper jurassic rocks with lower rock matrix porosity however elevated doc and fluoride concentrations at location 3 may also show that the groundwater chemistry of sample 3 is influenced by exchange processes between formation water from the tertiary and groundwater from the uja therefore we also tested the hypothesis that the water chemistry of groundwater sample 3 is in addition to the infiltration of formation water from the tertiary also affected by rock matrix diffusion to reach this goal we performed out diffusion experiments as described in section 3 2 we hypothesise that the diffusion of pore water from the upper jurassic carbonate rocks affects the water chemistry of the upper jurassic thermal groundwater and is the source of the higher mineralisation with increasing apparent ages due to higher groundwater residence times the interaction between groundwater and pore water is more intense and results in the observed higher mineralisation two drillcore samples k2 and k3 from the schäftlarnstraße th4 in munich were used table 3 for this purpose the concentration of the conservative tracer chloride was measured at regular intervals and the experiment was terminated after the equilibrium state was reached steady state with respect to the out diffusion of chloride from the pore water of the two rock samples to the experimental solution is attained when the time series concentrations of chloride reach a plateau for both rock samples steady state was observed after about 92 days and complete equilibration was ensured after a state of equilibrium was reached the sodium concentration was measured using the mass balance equations the hydrochemical composition of the pore water was calculated we estimated chloride concentrations of 4 157 mg l for k2 and 2 629 mg l for k3 with a respective sodium concentration of 1823 mg l for k2 and 1 956 mg l for k3 the measured mass of the pore water was 1 40 g for k2 and 6 39 g for k3 and the effective porosity was 3 14 for k2 and 14 78 for k3 the pore water of the upper jurassic rocks shows significantly higher chloride and sodium concentration compared to groundwater types 1 to 3 fig 2 the chloride and sodium concentrations of both analysed groundwater samples were in good agreement with the chloride sodium ratio found in sample k3 which may indicate that the mineralisation of the uja is affected by diffusive interaction between lowly mineralised mobile groundwater in the fractures and more highly mineralised upper jurassic pore water based on the results of the out diffusion experiments we suggest that rock matrix diffusion may also lead to significantly higher apparent water ages within the uja 4 2 evolution of the thermal groundwater using the environmental isotopes 14cdoc 81kr 3he 4he and 40ar 36ar contrary to the previous results reported by goldbrunner 1987 and heidinger et al 2019 we found 14cdic concentrations above the expected 2 pmc from the literature fig 2 however as outlined before the interpretation of 14cdic values particularly close to around 5 pmc tab 1 is debatable as aggarwal et al 2015 suggested 5 pmc as the lowest measurable value for the calculation of apparent water ages using 14cdic furthermore zuber et al 2000 also found some evidence that 14c is regarded as unreliable due to isotope exchange between dissolved and solid carbonates as suggested by δ13c values of dic for the uja in the mazovian basin in poland therefore we used 14cdoc to characterise the apparent water ages of the southern uja as suggested for carbonatic aquifers by heine and einsiedl 2020 and thomas et al 2021 to exclude the possibility of contamination with recent groundwater from the drilling process or during the operation of the geothermal power plants we measured 3h at all five locations the 3h concentrations of all five groundwater samples were close to or below 0 1 tu indicating the absence of water younger than 60 to 70 years which supports our results from the 14cdoc measurements being trustworthy as expected higher 14cdoc content was observed at all five sampled locations fig 3 compared to 14cdic contents with an initial 85 pmc 14c0doc content geyer et al 1993 we obtain corresponding piston flow ages between around 9 900 and 18 700 a for the sampled deep wells 1 5 table 1 in contrast uncorrected 14cdic apparent groundwater ages were between 16 300 and 22 900 a using the 14cdoc method we revealed a young up to now unknown groundwater component stemming from the pleistocene holocene border these data show clear evidence that groundwater at the southern border of the central part of the uja was partially recharged during the pleistocene holocene between around 9 900 and 18 700 a we also suggest that the 14cdoc method for determining groundwater ages and mean travel times for carbonate aquifers may be more robust than 14cdic values close to detection and corrected by geochemical models as discussed by heine and einsiedl 2020 however for groundwater samples 1 2 and 3 with calculated 14cdoc apparent ages between 9 800 and 12 600 a we would expect less depleted δ2h values as a result of climate warming at the border of pleistocene to holocene to estimate the contribution of the groundwater component shifting the δ2h values to more depleted values we construct a correlation between apparent 14cdoc ages and δ2h signatures using available 14cdoc apparent water ages linked with δ2h values from the western part of the uja heine and einsiedl 2020 in fig 4 again as outlined above the δ18o values may be affected by more intense water rock interactions and were not used for mixing calculations the two sites bw and hb represent a warm age end member from the holocene while the two other sites bj and of represent a cold age end member of the uja from the pleistocene based on this relationship between 14cdoc ages and δ2h values the δ2h values of samples 1 2 and 3 fall below the trend line and an additional contribution of around 70 of groundwater recharged during cold climate conditions has to be assumed to explain the isotopic shift to lower δ2h values of samples 1 2 and 3 therefore in addition to the radiocarbon measurements 81kr analyses were performed at locations 3 and 4 81kr content of 42 pmkr for well 3 and 56 pmkr for well 4 with corresponding apparent ages of 286 and 189 ka were found in this context it is worth mentioning that within a small area of the study area fig 5 our sampled locations 3 and 4 showed significantly higher apparent 81kr ages than previously reported apparent 81kr ages in heidinger et al 2019 in close vicinity of the investigated wells of our study the authors found apparent 81kr ages of 60 and 135 ka with corresponding stable water isotopes that demonstrate groundwater recharge under cold climate conditions the high variance in apparent 81kr ages of more than 200 ka highlights once again the heterogeneity of the uja the lack of a continuous and persistent trend in increasing apparent 81kr ages from the southern margin of the molasse basin to munich in the north may suggest that hydrogeological processes other than downstream groundwater ageing may occur within the aquifer fig 5 the 3he 4he ratios of the four samples 2 3 4 and 5 are close together in the range of 1 01 10 7 to 7 21 10 8 compared to the 3he 4he ratio in air saturated water asw all four sampled locations show an accumulation of 4he resulting in lower 3he 4he ratios the corresponding 40ar 36ar ratios of the samples vary between 294 96 and 302 04 fig 6 groundwater sample 3 shows the lowest 3he 4he ratio with 1 01 10 7 while the 40ar 36ar ratio is the highest of the four samples with 302 04 the 40ar 36ar ratio in sample 2 and sample 4 are close to or below the 40ar 36ar ratio of 295 4 in asw while the 40ar 36ar ratio of sample 5 is in between samples 3 and 4 the accumulation of 4he and 40ar results in lower 3he 4he ratios and respectively higher 40ar 36ar ratios as a result both the 3he 4he and 40ar 36ar ratios of samples 3 and 4 support the observed increase of apparent 81kr ages and may indicate a substantial contribution of water much older than that recharged in the late glacial with the new 14cdoc measurements and the additional 81kr measurements we are now able to extend the knowledge about the flow system in the southern part of the sgmb and the groundwater recharge history the 14cdoc and 81kr results suggest a highly heterogeneous flow system within the study area and no clear evidence of simple and uniform flow paths from south to north within the central part of the sgmb as suggested by heidinger et al 2019 furthermore the results from the 14cdoc measurements with apparent groundwater ages below 20 ka are interpreted as recharge at the end of the last glacial period and support the idea of a potential recharge area at the southern margin of the sgmb apparent 81kr ages may document additional recharge events at an earlier epoch and may also be responsible for the heterogeneous distribution of apparent water ages in this southern area of the sgmb 4 3 hydrochemical evolution of the thermal uja water the results of the environmental isotope study demonstrate that the recent upper jurassic thermal groundwater is the result of mixing between at least two groundwater components with different recharge timescales as groundwater becomes more evolved over time due to water rock interaction concentrations of bicarbonate calcium and magnesium typically increase due to a progressive dissolution of jurassic carbonates from well 2 to well 3 fig 7 chloride concentrations also showed a reasonable relationship with increasing apparent water ages and may be mostly affected by more pronounced diffusion processes between water stored in the matrix and the more mobile groundwater location 5 deviates from the observed trends in some parameters especially when looking closer at non conservative ions such as sr2 and k but overall we see an increase in the concentration of all parameters with increasing 40ar 36ar ratios which supports our apparent water ages and may be a further robust evidence of the interpretation of variable apparent water ages within the uja 4 4 glacial impact on recharge processes and geological features allowing infiltration into the uja the results from groundwater dating using the environmental isotopes of 14cdoc and 81kr revealed at least two groundwater components with apparent water ages between around 10 to 20 ka and approximately 300 ka it is speculated that the two observed groundwater components within the uja can be assigned to the aftermath of the würm glaciation at the pleistocene holocene transition and to the riss glaciation subglacial infiltration of meltwater during glaciations has repeatedly been considered as the main recharge mechanism of the uja in the sgmb bertleff et al 1993 bertleff and watzel 2002 in fact the observed broad range of apparent water ages within the studied area could be interpreted as pulsed recharge events that correspond to the different glacial stages of the würm and riss glaciations rather than a continuous recharge record a requirement for the infiltration of glacial meltwater into the subsurface under the ice sheet pressure is a sufficient hydraulic permeability of the sediments boulton et al 1996 grasby and chen 2005 this is in agreement with what person et al 2003 observed from numerical modelling of glaciated aquifers which need increased hydraulic heads from the cover of the ice sheets to explain the deep penetration of palaeowater into the aquifers however it was stated in the literature that the observed maximum penetration depth of glacial meltwater during the pleistocene into european and north american sedimentary basins is hardly deeper than 1000 m mcintosh et al 2012 provost et al 1998 modelled infiltration depths up to several km in the fennoscandian shield while king clayton et al 1995 and person et al 2007 found that the formation of permafrost can affect the penetration depth of glacial meltwater significantly and drive groundwater into deeper depths mcintosh et al 2012 even observed detectable age gaps in groundwater systems in europe and north america during the lgm that were likely caused by missing recharge during covering phases with glaciations and permafrost therefore questions remain particularly about the hydrogeological and geological factors controlling glacial recharge through sedimentary basins to great depths cartwright et al 2007 suggested so called seal bypass systems as potential pathways for deep penetrating groundwater flow those systems are present in the sgmb in the form of for example deep reaching fault systems which can enhance fluid flow such as surface discharge from pleistocene glaciers into the uja 5 conclusion while groundwater dating using 14cdic has often been used for deep groundwater systems the combined results of 14cdoc and 81kr groundwater dating are to the best of our knowledge not available in the literature our field study results show that the uja groundwater in the southern part of the sgmb is composed of at least two groundwater components a formerly unknown young component from the pleistocene holocene transition which is younger than 20 ka and an old water component which is affected by matrix diffusion effects leading to apparent water ages of up to almost 300 ka this study illustrates the usefulness of combining the 14cdoc method with 81kr for groundwater dating of deep aquifers the finding of the formerly unknown young groundwater component may provide some evidence that the main recharge area of the uja is located at the southern border of the central sgmb the observed heterogeneity of the calculated apparent groundwater ages within the southern margin of the sgmb may be closely linked to groundwater recharge during different periods of glaciations in the pleistocene glaciations may be the driving force for groundwater recharge where recharge can happen and also the mechanism of recharge that drives the water to such deep depths seal bypass systems may have the potential to encompass a range of geologic features that promote cross strata fluid migration and allow fluids to bypass the pore network of the dominant seal lithology the presented combination of 14cdoc and 81kr as groundwater dating tools may be a promising approach for the understanding of deep groundwater systems credit

3150,to face the challenges of ongoing climate change renewable energy sources are needed to reduce co2 emissions to the atmosphere the south german molasse basin sgmb contains an important geothermal aquifer in germany however an enhanced understanding of the flow regime at the basin scale remains a fundamental limiting factor in assessing a long term and sustainable strategy for using this green energy source here we report 14cdoc and 81kr groundwater dating results together with hydrochemical data stable water isotopes noble gases and out diffusion experiments that indicate that the thermal groundwater consists of at least two groundwater sources a formerly unknown young groundwater component with apparent water ages between 9 800 and 18 700 a and an old groundwater component which shows an apparent water age of up to approximately 300 ka the results of the out diffusion experiments with core material from the upper jurassic aquifer uja suggest that diffusion processes between rock matrix water and more mobile fracture water represent a controlling mechanism for groundwater flow and the observed extended apparent groundwater ages within the uja the observed elevated 14cdoc activities and the high spatial heterogeneity in groundwater ages close to the southern margin of the sgmb were interpreted as a recharge zone of the system the combination of the 14cdoc and 81kr methods shows the potential as a powerful groundwater dating tool for deep aquifers keywords 14cdoc 81kr groundwater dating upper jurassic aquifer south german molasse basin geothermal groundwater 1 introduction the upper jurassic aquifer uja in the south german molasse basin sgmb plays a key role in renewable energy production in bavaria as this aquifer is considered to contain the largest thermal water resource for hydrothermal energy use in central europe goldscheider et al 2010 stober 2014 therefore understanding the flow regime at the basin scale remains a fundamental limiting factor in assessing a long term and sustainable strategy for using this green energy source moreover there is a lack of reliable groundwater dating of the uja over the entire extent of the sgmb in combination with the heterogeneous and complex geological structure of the basin the origin of the deep geothermal groundwater resource and the time scale of recharge into the basin are still largely unknown at present there are a number of methods available for groundwater dating the most common technique is the use of radioactive isotopes with their specific dating ranges e g aggarwal 2013 numerous papers describe the application of 3h t1 2 12 3 years e g vogel et al 1974 schlosser et al 1988 and 14c t1 2 5 730 years for groundwater dating e g wassenaar et al 1991 kalin 2000 coppola et al 2015 while 81kr t1 2 229 000 years has become more common over the last couple of years e g sturchio et al 2004 jiang et al 2012 aeschbach hertig 2014 the 14c method is the only available radioisotope that can date old groundwater at a time scale between a few thousands of years and up to around 30 ka radiocarbon dating can be done on dissolved inorganic carbon dic but often requires various correction models fontes and garnier 1979 han and plummer 2013 because several physical and biogeochemical processes may affect the 14cdic content within the aquifer fontes and garnier 1979 fontes 1983 fontes 1992 geyh 2000 mook 2005 hershey et al 2016 cartwright et al 2020 such isotope dilution effects were also assumed for the north western margin of the uja by heine and einsiedl 2020 where different wells deliver water with corrected 14cdic apparent water ages up to around 30 ka while the 14cdoc apparent water ages are much lower and may mainly represent holocene origin up to now it was assumed for the central part of the uja that groundwater has 14cdic concentrations below or very close to the detection limit of 2 pmc goldbrunner 1987 heidinger et al 2019 but the question arises whether previous 14cdic measurements represent reasonable groundwater dating results in contrast it was shown by heine and einsiedl 2020 that 14c dating on dissolved organic carbon doc is suitable to date groundwater in the uja because of its probable resistance against microbial degradation and the lack of isotope dilution processes by biogeochemical processes murphy et al 1989 geyer et al 1993 hershey et al 2016 thomas et al 2021 apparent groundwater ages outside the range of 14c dating can be studied with the inert 81kr making this radioisotope an interesting tool for dating very old groundwater up to 1 3 ma gerber et al 2017 81kr dating is a relatively new and innovative method and provides an ideal tracer because the production of 81kr is mainly restricted to the atmosphere and it is assumed that there is no or only a little in situ subsurface production in aquifers with moderate to low uranium concentration purtschert et al 2021 moreover there are no additional sinks for 81kr within a reservoir collon et al 2004 jiang et al 2012 gerber et al 2017 previous to this work three 81kr measurements were performed at three deep water wells in the southern part of the uja and showed apparent groundwater ages between 60 and 135 ka heidinger et al 2019 based on these few data an increase of 81kr apparent ages from the southern margin of the basin to the north was assumed by the authors and points to a northwards directed flow of the upper jurassic groundwater with its recharge area south of the molasse basin heidinger et al 2019 in this context it is worth mentioning that the observed high piston flow ages of the uja located in the north western part of cracow poland were explained by diffusion effects between the mobile water in the fractures and quasi stagnant water in the rock matrix zuber et al 2000 the rock matrix water may partially also be an important water reservoir of the uja in the sgmb further it is speculated that rock matrix diffusion processes also affect the calculated 81kr apparent ages and the hydrochemistry within the sgmb to study the effect of rock matrix diffusion on apparent groundwater ages and the water chemistry the chemical and isotopic composition of pore water can be investigated by out diffusion experiments and has already been successfully applied in different laboratory studies with the crystalline rock matrix waber and smellie 2008 waber et al 2012 therefore in a multi parameter approach we extended the 81kr analyses in the southern part of the uja and combined them with new 14cdoc analyses finding a formerly unknown young groundwater component that further supports the hypothesis of a recharge area in the southern part of the sgmb was done by 14cdoc analyses we also included hydrochemistry data stable water isotopes strontium isotopes and noble gas methods in this multi parameter approach to give new insight into the water age distribution of the uja in addition to characterise the effect of rock matrix diffusion on apparent water ages and water chemistry on mobile groundwater in the fractures out diffusion experiments with core material from a deep drilling campaign in munich were carried out 2 study area and hydrogeological setting 2 1 study area and geological setting the sgmb is flanked by the danube in the north and the alpine folded molasse in the south with our study area being located south of munich in the central part of the sgmb fig 1 the sgmb is part of the north alpine foreland basin extending from france in the west over switzerland and germany to austria in the east stober 2014 the sgmb was formed at the eocene oligocene border during the alpine orogeny and is composed of a crystalline basement covered by mesozoic sediments from the jurassic and cretaceous with a thickness between 500 and 1000 m while the rest of the basin is filled with sediments from the oligocene and miocene bachmann et al 1987 the structure of the sgmb dips from north to south below the alps resulting in a maximum thickness of the basin up to 5000 m in front of the alps bachmann et al 1987 an up to 600 m thick uja shows a heterogeneous geology which consists mainly of small pored limestones and fine to coarse grained dolomites böhm et al 2013 konrad et al 2021 the geology is characterised by deep karstic features fractures and fault zones lemcke 1988 frisch and huber 2000 because of the geological structure of the sgmb increasingwater temperatures can be usually found at higher depths of the uja lüschen et al 2014 fritzer 2012 following an average geothermal gradient of approx 3 5 c 100 m in the sgmb water temperatures of up to 155 c at a depth of around 5 km within the upper jurassic aquifer can be found in the south of munich providing excellent conditions for low enthalpy hydrogeothermal energy exploitation steiner et al 2014 the high water temperatures and the high demand for energy in the densely populated region of munich lead to the increasing use of the upper jurassic geothermal resource for heat and electricity production steiner et al 2014 since the construction of the first geothermal plants in the 1990s the number of geothermal plants in the sgmb has increased to a total of 24 geothermal plants in the bavarian part of the sgmb today agemar et al 2014 the high interest in the upper jurassic aquifer for geothermal energy supply has initiated many studies in the sgmb these works can generally be divided into studies with a focus on the hydrochemistry udluft 1975 andrews et al 1985 stichler et al 1987 prestel 1988 weise et al 1991 bertleff et al 1993 stichler 1997 bertleff and watzel 2002 birner et al 2011 mayrhofer 2013 stober et al 2014 stober 2014 heidinger et al 2019 heine and einsiedl 2020 heine et al 2021 and hydraulic studies lemcke and tunn 1956 lemcke 1976 villinger 1977 andres and frisch 1981 lemcke 1987 villinger 1988 frisch and huber 2000 savvatis et al 2015 the results of the studies are often contradictory and do not yet provide a uniform hydrogeological picture of the dynamics within the uja in the central part of the sgmb the recent upper jurassic groundwater shows an uncharacteristically low salinity for a deep groundwater system therefore it is assumed that the fossil upper jurassic formation water was washed out by a meteoric groundwater component and the recent upper jurassic thermal water may be composed of a mixture of meteoric freshwater and saline tertiary formation waters and petroleum associated waters lemcke and tunn 1956 udluft 1975 lemcke 1976 stichler et al 1987 prestel 1988 balderer 1990 stichler 1997 birner et al 2011 mayrhofer 2013 stober 2014 by combining hydrochemistry and environmental isotope data using a type of cluster analysis three different groundwater types within the uja of the central part of the sgmb were found heine et al 2021 water types 1 subtypes 1a and 1b and 2 na ca hco3 cl type are found in the southern eastern and northern parts of the central part of the sgmb around the city area of munich they are characterised by relatively low mineralisation tds 1000 mg l while δ2h and δ18o signatures may indicate groundwater recharge under cold climate conditions in contrast to groundwater types 1 and 2 groundwater type 3 na cl hco3 type shows increasing 40ar 36ar ratios and δ2h and δ18o signatures that plot significantly below the gmwl this groundwater type is typical for wells west of munich these findings suggest that groundwater type 3 may be affected by highly saline fossil groundwater from the overlying paleogene and neogene sediments heine et al 2021 the observed hydrochemical data patterns together with the 81kr apparent ages lead to the conclusion of an infiltration area in the south of the central part of the sgmb probably very close to the north of the alpine margin bertleff et al 1993 heidinger et al 2019 heine et al 2021 or south of the northern calcareous alps udluft 1975 2 2 glaciations during the pleistocene and last glacial maximum during the pleistocene two major glaciations covered mainly the northern parts of europe with glaciers and permafrost the glaciers came either from scandinavia or from mountain ranges such as the alps edmunds and milne 2001 the sgmb was affected by the riss glaciation lasting approximately from 130 to 200 ka and the würm glaciation lasting from 15 to 115 ka ago therefore it is not clear whether significant recharge into groundwater existed during high glacial periods as there are gaps in continuous groundwater recharge observed from calculated apparent groundwater ages in some european aquifers during the pleistocene mcintosh et al 2012 for example a multitracer study that was performed in the glatt valley in switzerland revealed an interruption in local groundwater recharge between 17 and 25 ka caused by overlying glaciers beyerle et al 1998 similarly results of dating speleothems in karstic caves in the cracow wielun upland west northwest of cracow showed the lack of significant infiltration in the period of 15 to 20 ka pazdur et al 1995 as a consequence groundwater systems may probably have been most significantly drained at the end of the last glacial extension phase nevertheless good recharge conditions may have existed in some other systems judging from continuous records of 14c dates during the pleistocene blavoux and olive 1982 rudolph et al 1984 van der kemp et al 2000 which may document the potential of local groundwater recharge between around 15 to 30 ka the study area of the sgmb may not have been completely covered with glaciers during the pleistocene as illustrated in fig 1 bertleff et al 1993 the most extensive glaciation meg with the furthest glacier advance was during the riss glaciation bertleff et al 1993 the last extension phase during the würm glaciation reached its peak at the last glacial maximum lgm in the sgmb which can be dated to around 25 ka seguinot et al 2018 most of the sgmb can be assumed to be glacier free at this point in the late pleistocene with a potential for groundwater recharge 3 methods and materials 3 1 groundwater sampling campaign thermal groundwater was repeatedly sampled at 5 deep geothermal wells 1 5 for hydrochemistry stable water isotopes strontium isotopes radiocarbon 14cdoc and 14cdic tritium and noble gases between january and march 2021 in addition 81kr analyses were performed at two locations wells 3 and 4 all samples were taken during the regular operation of the geothermal wells in addition all wells are only screened in the main upper jurassic aquifer at a depth between 2 900 and 5 100 m and are in operation for more than five years with pumping rates between 60 and 150 l s this guarantee that collected data is not influenced by fluids from the drilling process the water temperatures at the five samples geothermal wells range between 135 and 155 c during the sampling the physicochemical

hydrogeology at the technical university of munich the analytical error was 5 for the stable water isotopes measurements 15 ml hdpe vials were filled completely with groundwater while the hydrocarbons contained in the groundwater sample were removed by the addition of activated carbon the sample was also field filtered with a 0 22 µm filter and the stable water isotope ratios were analysed with an isotopic water analyser iwa 45ep los gatos research at the chair of hydrogeology at the technical university of munich the stable water isotope ratios are expressed in the delta notation δ18o and δ2h relative to the vsmow standard the analytical error was 0 1 for δ18o and 1 δ2h for the analysis of 14cdoc 20 l of groundwater was poured into cleaned hdpe jerry cans acidified to ph 2 with approximately 25 ml hcl 36 and stored at 4 c prior to extraction at the laboratory the extraction of the doc was done with the spe ppl method dittmar et al 2008 li et al 2016 heine and einsiedl 2020 subsequently the samples were sent to the leibniz laboratory for radiometric dating and stable isotope research at the christian albrechts university of kiel and the analysis was performed with accelerator mass spectrometry hve 3mv tandetron 4130 for the analysis of dic two cleaned 1l hdpe bottles were completely filled with groundwater and sent to the gadam centre of the silesian university of technology in gliwice poland the analysis was done with accelerator mass spectrometry ams piotrowska 2013 groundwater sampling for the 81kr analyses was carried out by the hydroisotop gmbh the sampling and analysis process is described in detail by heidinger et al 2019 after pre concentration of two water samples at hydroisotop gmbh the samples were analysed with the atta 3 method at the laboratory for radiokrypton dating at the argonne national laboratory the samples for the noble gas analysis were collected in copper tubes mounted in aluminium racks and were air tight sealed with stainless steel clamps on both sides of the copper tube beyerle et al 2000 to avoid any degassing or fractionation processes the samples were taken uncooled and under reservoir pressure nakata et al 2019 after sampling the sealed copper tubes were stored at 4 c the analysis of the samples was done with an mm5400 mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific at the institute of environmental physics in heidelberg for the analysis of tritium 1 l hdpe containers were not completely filled as described in sültenfuß et al 2009 the samples were stored at 4 c until analysis with a quadrupole mass spectrometer qms at the department of oceanography of the institute of environmental physics at the university of bremen the tritium detection limit is 0 1 tu 3 2 determination of the upper jurassic pore water by core sampling in addition to the groundwater samples pore water experiments were performed to study the composition of the upper jurassic pore water for this we used 2 rock samples from the sidewall coring swc at schäftlarnstraße th4 the size of the samples was limited due to the technical properties of the swc and ranged between 3 and 5 cm with corresponding masses between 105 and 149 g the samples were taken from depths of 2 940 and 3 260 m from zeta 4 5 k2 and zeta 1 k3 the effective porosity and the mass of porewater of each core sample were determined as described in bohnsack et al 2020 the groundwater found at schäftlarnstraße corresponds very closely to groundwater type 3 but also shows similarities to groundwater type 1 according to the classification of heine et al 2021 out diffusion experiments were done for each sample for each sample 3d printed polylactide containers were custom made the inside and outside of the containers were sealed with water resistant food safe epoxy resin prior to the experiments the cap of the containers was also sealed airtight with the epoxy resin the containers are designed in a way that the samples are covered for as long as possible with water the samples were covered with 100 ml bi distilled water from the laboratory which was buffered with bicarbonate buffer tablets to minimise dissolution of the carbonates this bi distilled water shows chloride concentrations below the detection limit of 1 mg l the samples were taken from the bottom of the container through a discofix 3 way stopcock by b braun the containers were constantly shaken in a rotary shaker at 20 c at the beginning of the experiments 1 ml of sample was taken at regular intervals the sample intervals were increased during the time of the experiments the chloride concentration was measured in those samples the experiment was finished after 91 days 13 weeks and then the sodium and chloride concentrations were measured the samples were analysed with an ion chromatograph dionex ics1100 thermo fisher scientific at the chair of hydrogeology at the technical university of munich the analytical error was 5 in a blind sample a container with the epoxy resin sealing was tested to guarantee that there was no cross contamination the initial sodium and chloride concentration of the pore water was then calculated by a mass balance equation as follows waber and smellie 2008 1 c pw m pw m twi σ n m s c equil c o r r e c t e d m twi c twi σ n m s c s m pw with 2 c equil c o r r e c t e d c t w m twi σ n m s m twi where c

mixing effects can be calculated with 81kr as follows sturchio et al 2004 purtschert et al 2013 3 81 t 1 λ 81 ln r r air with λ 81 the decay constant of 81kr the apparent groundwater ages or piston flow ages for 14c can be calculated as follows 4 14 t 8267 ln 14 c t 14 c 0 with 14 c t measured radiocarbon concentration and 14 c 0 the initial radiocarbon concentration the initial 14c0doc concentrations can be in the range of to 85 pmc geyer et al 1993 to 120 pmc einsiedl et al 2007a 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical and isotopic composition of the uja groundwater the results of the groundwater sampling campaign that was performed at five deep wells 1 5 in the southern part of the sgmb are presented in tables 1 and 2 the ph values ranged from 6 2 to 6 6 while the tds varied between 437 mg l and 789 mg l with the highest tds value for groundwater sample 3 the groundwater shows a high alkalinity and can be classified as na hco3 cl type according to the classification of the groundwater in the uja by heine et al 2021 this groundwater represents water type 1 interestingly groundwater from well 3 showed higher concentrations of sodium and chloride compared to all other water samples this may indicate some effect of saline formation waters that may stem from the overlying tertiary rocks or from fossil water that is still stored in the rock matrix and exchanges by diffusion heine et al 2021 the nitrate content at all sampled wells was as expected for deep carbonate aquifers below the detection limit of 0 8 mg l while sulfate concentrations were in the range between 4 78 mg l and 34 72 mg l in a previous study that was performed by einsiedl et al 2007b it was shown by using δ34s of dissolved sulphate and δ34s values of fulvic acids that bacterial sulfate reduction has occurred in the groundwater of the uja as the redox potential of the deep geothermal water was strongly reduced and h2s was also detected at the investigated wells data not shown we suggest that the strong variation of sulfate concentrations may be controlled by bacterial sulfate reduction fluoride concentrations were under the detection limit of 1 24 mg l and 7 48 mg l while the bromide concentrations ranged between 0 38 mg l and 0 92 mg l both ions are characteristic of deep groundwater within the sgmb particularly for groundwater of the na cl type eichinger et al 2007 doc concentrations were in the range between 1 3 mg l and 4 1 mg l the elevated doc concentration of well 3 of around 4 mg l together with fluoride concentrations of more than 7 mg l may indicate some influences of fossil water and oilfield water from the overlying tertiary sands heine et al 2021 it is worth to be mentioned that the rate of chemical reactions may increase at higher temperature as a result groundwater with higher temperatures can dissolve more minerals from the surrounding rocks and may therefore have a higher electrical conductivity for instance the results of geochemical modelling using phreeqc showed that an increase of the water temperature from 20 c up to 100 c will double the ca mg ratio in water stober 2014 however the water temperature of the sampled wells is very close together between 135 and 155 c and may have only an effect on the absolute electrical conductivity but not on the observed differences between them the stable water isotopes of water samples 1 2 4 and 5 plot below the gmwl but close to the lmwl for munich fig 4 these samples showed values between 11 42 and 11 76 for δ18o and 85 1 and 85 7 for δ2h while sample 3 deviates from this cluster and was significantly isotopically enriched in δ18o the samples within the cluster 1 2 4 and 5 and sample 3 were of meteoric origin and may have be formed under cold climate conditions the isotopic shift of sample 3 to heavier δ18o values may be affected by a more intense water rock interaction than samples 1 2 4 and 5 heine et al 2021 this interpretation is also supported by the 87sr 86sr ratio of sample 3 the 87sr 86sr ratios of all groundwater samples ranged between 0 708599 and 0 709093 while the 87sr 86sr ratio of the upper jurassic carbonate rocks is characterised by isotope values of around 0 7075 thuro et al 2019 the highest sr2 concentration was found for sample 3 with a value of 0 75 mg l that corresponds with a 87sr 86sr ratio of 0 708599 this may indicate that the strontium isotope chemistry of all groundwater samples was not predominantly influenced by the dissolution of upper jurassic carbonate rocks after recharge however the elevated sr2 concentrations of groundwater sample 3 are coupled with the lowest 87sr 86sr isotope ratio this result may support the interpretation of an intensive water rock interaction and the dissolution of calcite carbonates most likely from upper jurassic rocks with lower rock matrix porosity however elevated doc and fluoride concentrations at location 3 may also show that the groundwater chemistry of sample 3 is influenced by exchange processes between formation water from the tertiary and groundwater from the uja therefore we also tested the hypothesis that the water chemistry of groundwater sample 3 is in addition to the infiltration of formation water from the tertiary also affected by rock matrix diffusion to reach this goal we performed out diffusion experiments as described in section 3 2 we hypothesise that the diffusion of pore water from the upper jurassic carbonate rocks affects the water chemistry of the upper jurassic thermal groundwater and is the source of the higher mineralisation with increasing apparent ages due to higher groundwater residence times the interaction between groundwater and pore water is more intense and results in the observed higher mineralisation two drillcore samples k2 and k3 from the schäftlarnstraße th4 in munich were used table 3 for this purpose the concentration of the conservative tracer chloride was measured at regular intervals and the experiment was terminated after the equilibrium state was reached steady state with respect to the out diffusion of chloride from the pore water of the two rock samples to the experimental solution is attained when the time series concentrations of chloride reach a plateau for both rock samples steady state was observed after about 92 days and complete equilibration was ensured after a state of equilibrium was reached the sodium concentration was measured using the mass balance equations the hydrochemical composition of the pore water was calculated we estimated chloride concentrations of 4 157 mg l for k2 and 2 629 mg l for k3 with a respective sodium concentration of 1823 mg l for k2 and 1 956 mg l for k3 the measured mass of the pore water was 1 40 g for k2 and 6 39 g for k3 and the effective porosity was 3 14 for k2 and 14 78 for k3 the pore water of the upper jurassic rocks shows significantly higher chloride and sodium concentration compared to groundwater types 1 to 3 fig 2 the chloride and sodium concentrations of both analysed groundwater samples were in good agreement with the chloride sodium ratio found in sample k3 which may indicate that the mineralisation of the uja is affected by diffusive interaction between lowly mineralised mobile groundwater in the fractures and more highly mineralised upper jurassic pore water based on the results of the out diffusion experiments we suggest that rock matrix diffusion may also lead to significantly higher apparent water ages within the uja 4 2 evolution of the thermal groundwater using the environmental isotopes 14cdoc 81kr 3he 4he and 40ar 36ar contrary to the previous results reported by goldbrunner 1987 and heidinger et al 2019 we found 14cdic concentrations above the expected 2 pmc from the literature fig 2 however as outlined before the interpretation of 14cdic values particularly close to around 5 pmc tab 1 is debatable as aggarwal et al 2015 suggested 5 pmc as the lowest measurable value for the calculation of apparent water ages using 14cdic furthermore zuber et al 2000 also found some evidence that 14c is regarded as unreliable due to isotope exchange between dissolved and solid carbonates as suggested by δ13c values of dic for the uja in the mazovian basin in poland therefore we used 14cdoc to characterise the apparent water ages of the southern uja as suggested for carbonatic aquifers by heine and einsiedl 2020 and thomas et al 2021 to exclude the possibility of contamination with recent groundwater from the drilling process or during the operation of the geothermal power plants we measured 3h at all five locations the 3h concentrations of all five groundwater samples were close to or below 0 1 tu indicating the absence of water younger than 60 to 70 years which supports our results from the 14cdoc measurements being trustworthy as expected higher 14cdoc content was observed at all five sampled locations fig 3 compared to 14cdic contents with an initial 85 pmc 14c0doc content geyer et al 1993 we obtain corresponding piston flow ages between around 9 900 and 18 700 a for the sampled deep wells 1 5 table 1 in contrast uncorrected 14cdic apparent groundwater ages were between 16 300 and 22 900 a using the 14cdoc method we revealed a young up to now unknown groundwater component stemming from the pleistocene holocene border these data show clear evidence that groundwater at the southern border of the central part of the uja was partially recharged during the pleistocene holocene between around 9 900 and 18 700 a we also suggest that the 14cdoc method for determining groundwater ages and mean travel times for carbonate aquifers may be more robust than 14cdic values close to detection and corrected by geochemical models as discussed by heine and einsiedl 2020 however for groundwater samples 1 2 and 3 with calculated 14cdoc apparent ages between 9 800 and 12 600 a we would expect less depleted δ2h values as a result of climate warming at the border of pleistocene to holocene to estimate the contribution of the groundwater component shifting the δ2h values to more depleted values we construct a correlation between apparent 14cdoc ages and δ2h signatures using available 14cdoc apparent water ages linked with δ2h values from the western part of the uja heine and einsiedl 2020 in fig 4 again as outlined above the δ18o values may be affected by more intense water rock interactions and were not used for mixing calculations the two sites bw and hb represent a warm age end member from the holocene while the two other sites bj and of represent a cold age end member of the uja from the pleistocene based on this relationship between 14cdoc ages and δ2h values the δ2h values of samples 1 2 and 3 fall below the trend line and an additional contribution of around 70 of groundwater recharged during cold climate conditions has to be assumed to explain the isotopic shift to lower δ2h values of samples 1 2 and 3 therefore in addition to the radiocarbon measurements 81kr analyses were performed at locations 3 and 4 81kr content of 42 pmkr for well 3 and 56 pmkr for well 4 with corresponding apparent ages of 286 and 189 ka were found in this context it is worth mentioning that within a small area of the study area fig 5 our sampled locations 3 and 4 showed significantly higher apparent 81kr ages than previously reported apparent 81kr ages in heidinger et al 2019 in close vicinity of the investigated wells of our study the authors found apparent 81kr ages of 60 and 135 ka with corresponding stable water isotopes that demonstrate groundwater recharge under cold climate conditions the high variance in apparent 81kr ages of more than 200 ka highlights once again the heterogeneity of the uja the lack of a continuous and persistent trend in increasing apparent 81kr ages from the southern margin of the molasse basin to munich in the north may suggest that hydrogeological processes other than downstream groundwater ageing may occur within the aquifer fig 5 the 3he 4he ratios of the four samples 2 3 4 and 5 are close together in the range of 1 01 10 7 to 7 21 10 8 compared to the 3he 4he ratio in air saturated water asw all four sampled locations show an accumulation of 4he resulting in lower 3he 4he ratios the corresponding 40ar 36ar ratios of the samples vary between 294 96 and 302 04 fig 6 groundwater sample 3 shows the lowest 3he 4he ratio with 1 01 10 7 while the 40ar 36ar ratio is the highest of the four samples with 302 04 the 40ar 36ar ratio in sample 2 and sample 4 are close to or below the 40ar 36ar ratio of 295 4 in asw while the 40ar 36ar ratio of sample 5 is in between samples 3 and 4 the accumulation of 4he and 40ar results in lower 3he 4he ratios and respectively higher 40ar 36ar ratios as a result both the 3he 4he and 40ar 36ar ratios of samples 3 and 4 support the observed increase of apparent 81kr ages and may indicate a substantial contribution of water much older than that recharged in the late glacial with the new 14cdoc measurements and the additional 81kr measurements we are now able to extend the knowledge about the flow system in the southern part of the sgmb and the groundwater recharge history the 14cdoc and 81kr results suggest a highly heterogeneous flow system within the study area and no clear evidence of simple and uniform flow paths from south to north within the central part of the sgmb as suggested by heidinger et al 2019 furthermore the results from the 14cdoc measurements with apparent groundwater ages below 20 ka are interpreted as recharge at the end of the last glacial period and support the idea of a potential recharge area at the southern margin of the sgmb apparent 81kr ages may document additional recharge events at an earlier epoch and may also be responsible for the heterogeneous distribution of apparent water ages in this southern area of the sgmb 4 3 hydrochemical evolution of the thermal uja water the results of the environmental isotope study demonstrate that the recent upper jurassic thermal groundwater is the result of mixing between at least two groundwater components with different recharge timescales as groundwater becomes more evolved over time due to water rock interaction concentrations of bicarbonate calcium and magnesium typically increase due to a progressive dissolution of jurassic carbonates from well 2 to well 3 fig 7 chloride concentrations also showed a reasonable relationship with increasing apparent water ages and may be mostly affected by more pronounced diffusion processes between water stored in the matrix and the more mobile groundwater location 5 deviates from the observed trends in some parameters especially when looking closer at non conservative ions such as sr2 and k but overall we see an increase in the concentration of all parameters with increasing 40ar 36ar ratios which supports our apparent water ages and may be a further robust evidence of the interpretation of variable apparent water ages within the uja 4 4 glacial impact on recharge processes and geological features allowing infiltration into the uja the results from groundwater dating using the environmental isotopes of 14cdoc and 81kr revealed at least two groundwater components with apparent water ages between around 10 to 20 ka and approximately 300 ka it is speculated that the two observed groundwater components within the uja can be assigned to the aftermath of the würm glaciation at the pleistocene holocene transition and to the riss glaciation subglacial infiltration of meltwater during glaciations has repeatedly been considered as the main recharge mechanism of the uja in the sgmb bertleff et al 1993 bertleff and watzel 2002 in fact the observed broad range of apparent water ages within the studied area could be interpreted as pulsed recharge events that correspond to the different glacial stages of the würm and riss glaciations rather than a continuous recharge record a requirement for the infiltration of glacial meltwater into the subsurface under the ice sheet pressure is a sufficient hydraulic permeability of the sediments boulton et al 1996 grasby and chen 2005 this is in agreement with what person et al 2003 observed from numerical modelling of glaciated aquifers which need increased hydraulic heads from the cover of the ice sheets to explain the deep penetration of palaeowater into the aquifers however it was stated in the literature that the observed maximum penetration depth of glacial meltwater during the pleistocene into european and north american sedimentary basins is hardly deeper than 1000 m mcintosh et al 2012 provost et al 1998 modelled infiltration depths up to several km in the fennoscandian shield while king clayton et al 1995 and person et al 2007 found that the formation of permafrost can affect the penetration depth of glacial meltwater significantly and drive groundwater into deeper depths mcintosh et al 2012 even observed detectable age gaps in groundwater systems in europe and north america during the lgm that were likely caused by missing recharge during covering phases with glaciations and permafrost therefore questions remain particularly about the hydrogeological and geological factors controlling glacial recharge through sedimentary basins to great depths cartwright et al 2007 suggested so called seal bypass systems as potential pathways for deep penetrating groundwater flow those systems are present in the sgmb in the form of for example deep reaching fault systems which can enhance fluid flow such as surface discharge from pleistocene glaciers into the uja 5 conclusion while groundwater dating using 14cdic has often been used for deep groundwater systems the combined results of 14cdoc and 81kr groundwater dating are to the best of our knowledge not available in the literature our field study results show that the uja groundwater in the southern part of the sgmb is composed of at least two groundwater components a formerly unknown young component from the pleistocene holocene transition which is younger than 20 ka and an old water component which is affected by matrix diffusion effects leading to apparent water ages of up to almost 300 ka this study illustrates the usefulness of combining the 14cdoc method with 81kr for groundwater dating of deep aquifers the finding of the formerly unknown young groundwater component may provide some evidence that the main recharge area of the uja is located at the southern border of the central sgmb the observed heterogeneity of the calculated apparent groundwater ages within the southern margin of the sgmb may be closely linked to groundwater recharge during different periods of glaciations in the pleistocene glaciations may be the driving force for groundwater recharge where recharge can happen and also the mechanism of recharge that drives the water to such deep depths seal bypass systems may have the potential to encompass a range of geologic features that promote cross strata fluid migration and allow fluids to bypass the pore network of the dominant seal lithology the presented combination of 14cdoc and 81kr as groundwater dating tools may be a promising approach for the understanding of deep groundwater systems credit

3151,in the east african rift valley geogenic fluoride contamination of groundwater is particularly noticeable as a drinking water problem in the tabora region in the central part of tanzania which consists of two basins lake tanganyika basin ltb and an internal drainage basin idb within a semi arid region fluoride contaminated groundwater that exceeds the world health organization standards is pumped from many wells in the fractured and weathered zones of the granitic layer underlying these basins fluoride contamination of groundwater is heterogeneously distributed in the granitic layer posing an obstacle to groundwater development in this study a relationship between the fluoride concentration and the hydrogeological structure was investigated using geophysical survey data to achieve efficient groundwater development in geogenic contaminated areas based on the results the following two mechanisms have been determined regarding fluoride contamination in the tabora region 1 with respect to the weathered zones in both the ltb and idb the greater the extent of weathering the more readily fluoride leaches into groundwater this suggests that fluoride leaching due to the chemical weathering of minerals containing fluoride increases with the weathering of rocks in the field 2 with respect to the fractured zones in the ltb a large well yield potential and a deeper water strike depth to the water vein result in lower fluoride concentrations the suggested flow mechanism for the ltb is that water recharge in a groundwater depression area with a low fluoride concentration flow to substantial depth and over long distances through fault systems which form preferential flow paths this implies that the fractured zone along the fault system in the ltb is a high priority reservoir for the development of safe water resources in the tabora region the hydrogeological mechanisms discussed in this study provide a basis for establishing estimation methods for the prediction of safe groundwater resources before a borehole is drilled however more reliable data needs to be collected to clarify the effects of hydrogeology on groundwater fluoride contamination for the fractured zone in the idb data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction geogenic fluoride contamination of groundwater and surface water which are the main sources of drinking water for the inhabitants of water scarce areas is a problem throughout the world ali et al 2016 kim and jeong 2005 selinus et al 2005 viero et al 2009 if anthropogenic contamination is not considered the chemical constituents of igneous and sedimentary rocks are most likely to be leached from weathered and fractured zones into groundwater and surface water through various processes when the concentration of leached material increases many sources of water cannot be used for drinking purposes igneous rock especially granite may contain high concentrations of fluoride for example granite contains about 500 mg kg to 1 400 mg kg of fluoride average 810 mg kg kraukopf and bird 1995 koritnig 1978 wedepohl 1969 and mica and hornblende minerals in granite are rich sources of fluoride selinus et al 2005 which is leached from mica by weathering and hydrothermal processes gilkes and suddhiprakarn 1979 pozzuoli et al 1992 tsurumaki and sakuramoto 1985 watanabe et al 2005 in the case of fluoride contamination due to the influence of crystalline rocks including granite many research papers and reports have reported serious problems due to fluorosis in india hossain and patra 2020 mondal et al 2009 raju et al 2012 reddy et al 2009 sadashivaiah et al 2008 shekhar et al 2017 singaraja et al 2014 and jacks et al 2005 have shown that fluoride leaching into sediments by repeated evapotranspiration is a prominent mechanism in southern india additional research confirms high concentrations of fluoride in many countries with similar geological and climate conditions including ghana south africa and countries in the east african rift system bgs 2002 farooqi 2015 gaciri and davies 1992 kilham and hecky 1973 msonda et al 2007 selinus et al 2005 in these countries the fluoride concentration in the water source often does not meet the world health organization who standard 1 5 mg l who 2017 as a result of using drinking water with high fluoride concentrations for many years more than 80 million people in the countries that are part of the east african rift valley have dental and skeletal fluorosis bgs 2002 frencken 1990 there are many research papers and reports on the effects of drinking water with excessive fluoride on the human body bhatnagar et al 2011 farooqi 2015 fawell et al 2006 tanzania fig 1 is one of the countries with fluoride contamination in the east african rift valley region and the fluoride in water sources is particularly high in the northern to the central part of tanzania pittalis 2010 fluoride concentrations ranging from 759 to 1 980 mg l have been detected in lake magadi located west of arusha in northern tanzania jones et al 1977 and up to 690 mg l in lakes and rivers of the surrounding area nanyaro et al 1984 in addition a survey conducted in the internal drainage basin idb by the japan international cooperation agency jica jica 2008 also found concentrations of fluoride that exceeded the who standard in many water sources regardless of the water s origin jica 2008 reported that spring samples had a maximum fluoride concentration of 66 mg l and shallow and deep wells had a maximum fluoride concentration of 30 mg l due to the use of these high fluoride water sources as drinking water numerous young inhabitants with fluorosis symptoms have been found in the study area of the basin especially in the arusha region bgs 2002 jica 2008 the tabora region located in central tanzania is no exception and a maximum concentration of 10 3 mg l of fluoride has been detected in deep wells in the igunga district fig 1 based on an inventory survey jica 2008 fluoride detection surveys have only been conducted sporadically in the igunga and nzega districts fig 1 kagabu et al 2016 reported that water particularly fissure water was sampled from wells and that tracer analysis was carried out on the samples in the tabora region due to the altitude effect there is a negative correlation between altitude and stable oxygen or hydrogen isotope ratio in meteoric water the stable oxygen isotope ratio is low at high altitudes this allows for the possibility that the recharge area is far away and at a higher altitude in addition the electrical conductivity ec of fissure water in the basement rock in the tabora region tends to increase at lower altitudes and from the relationship between the apparent groundwater residence time obtained from the chlorofluorocarbon cfc 12 concentration and ec the residence time tends to increase as the ec increases furthermore the tabora region is almost entirely underlain by granite fig 1 and to supply safe water to the inhabitant drinking water is mainly taken from deep wells targeting weathered zones fractured zones or both time and money are required to investigate potential source areas and drill boreholes to obtain sufficient well yields from the aquifer because groundwater is unevenly distributed in weathered and fractured zones the problem is exacerbated because boreholes cannot be used as production wells and are abandoned if they do not meet the who standard due to the problem of fluoride contamination in fact a similar situation occurred in the jica project implemented between 2013 and 2017 mowi 2017 there is currently no suitable study to solve this problem in this study areas with a low fluoride concentration in the tabora region were identified through analysis of the jica survey data jica 2011 mowi 2017 to efficiently improve the success rate of acquiring drinkable water supplies the purpose of this study is to understand the hydrogeological mechanisms of fluoride contamination in the tabora region by using geophysical survey data to fill up the gap of the ambiguous knowledge in the survey steps which will lead to the next step i e establishing a method to easily estimate fluoride contamination this study is intended to elucidate the fluoride contamination mechanism from a hydrogeological point of view based on geophysical exploration and well drilling data as physical weathering and fracturing of hard rock should promote the leaching of fluoride contained in hard rock to groundwater in water rock interaction 2 site description and methodology 2 1 study area the tabora region is located on a plateau in central tanzania from 4 to 7 s latitude and 31 34 e longitude covering an area of approximately 76 700 km2 the altitude ranges from approximately 1 000 m to 1 600 m and the slope gradually decreases from north to south but the highest hills with an altitude of 1 600 m are in the south eastern part of the region fig 2 the tabora region is covered by three basins lake tanganyika basin ltb an internal drainage basin idb and lake rukwa basin and their areas account for 68 28 and 4 of the total respectively jica 2011 this study focuses on the ltb and idb because of they cover most of the tabora region and the distribution of analysed wells figs 1 and 2 the climate in the ltb and idb is semi arid to arid and the annual rainfall is approximately 1 000 mm which is equivalent to the mean annual precipitation of tanzania according to bgs 2002 and jica 2011 the rainy season extends from october to may rainfall is concentrated from november to april and the dry season is from june to september the temperature peaks at approximately 32 2 c from september to october and at approximately 14 7 c from june to july the sunshine duration is between 10 2 h which is the longest in july in the dry season and 7 6 h the shortest in january in the rainy season evapotranspiration is estimated to be 150 mm month in the rainy season and 250 mm month in the dry season according to onodera et al 1996 the amount of recharge in dodoma the capital of tanzania which has slightly less precipitation but the same geology and hydrological cycle as the tabora region is approximately 3 20 of the annual precipitation based on these results jica 2011 estimated that the annual recharge in the tabora region is in the approximate range 50 200 mm year from analyses of both the water balance analysis and the tank model the geology of the tabora region is characterized by archean plutonic rocks and metamorphic rocks that are widely distributed as basement rocks these are covered by terrestrial sedimentary rocks of paleozoic to cenozoic age lacustrine sediment and alluvium deposited in order from the bottom the weathered zone and fractured zone which are the targets of deep wells consist mainly of archean plutonic and metamorphic rocks such as granite granodiorite gneiss amphibolite migmatite and schist structurally fig 1 fault systems developed in the north south direction and the northwest southeast direction i e parallel to the east african rift valley and several subsidiary faults extend from the main faults in a northeast southwest direction bgs 2002 jica 2011 although weathered zone thickness varies from place to place throughout the tabora region basically the depth of tens of meters below the surface of the archean volcanic and metamorphic rocks shown in fig 1 is a weathered zone the thickness of the fractured zone varies with the size of each lineament and fault and the parts along the lineaments and faults shown in fig 1 indicate the fractured zones the aquifers in the study area can be divided into two main groups the alluvium and the pleistocene strata and the fissure water in bedrock that flows through the lineaments and faults and groundwater stored in the weathered zones of the bedrock fig 1 however the extent of the alluvium and pleistocene strata is very narrow and limited in the study area modified groundwater contours are shown in fig 1 by integrating the well data used in this study with groundwater contours analysed and created by jica 2011 based on the static water levels total water head for deep wells groundwater recharge areas in the ltb are particularly concentrated during the rainy season when seasonal rivers appear at low elevations along topographic features formed by faults and lineaments providing a source of recharge to the weathered and fractured zone river water collects into the malagarasi river fig 1 and discharges into the lake tanganyika via various branches of the malagarasi river which flows primarily through the northern and north western parts of the tabora region the major groundwater flow direction is from northeast to southwest fig 1 jica 2011 in the idb groundwater recharge occurs primarily during the rainy season like in the ltb around lakes and in the northern part of the basin mountainous areas most of the rivers flowing within the basin are seasonal rivers and all river water is constrained by topography and flowed into lakes or wetlands within the basin which converge internally within the idb the major direction of groundwater flow in the idb for the tabora region is from southwest to northeast and the water balance is completed within the basin fig 1 jica 2008 in addition groundwater flow in the fractured zone in the ltb and idb is regulated by fracture networks therefore groundwater flow in the ltb and idb is complex and different from the major flow directions described above 2 2 methodology in the first step of the analysis it compiled survey data for 137 boreholes and results of water quality analyses conducted in the laboratory which formed parts of two projects conducted by jica and the ministry of water and irrigation mowi in the tabora region of tanzania from 2009 to 2017 fig 3 according to the reports from these projects groundwater in the target area was contaminated with geogenic fluoride however it was not possible to determine the mechanism of this fluoride contamination therefore this study focused on the difference in the fluoride contamination level at a basin scale which is directly connected to groundwater recharge in the water balance rather than by district or regional boundary divisions selinus et al 2005 toth 1963 the fluoride contamination mechanism of groundwater was analysed according to the flowchart shown in fig 3 seven parameters table 1 from the two projects were used for analysis 1 fluoride concentration 2 well yield potential 3 resistivity value 4 water strike depth 5 geology 6 intake aquifer and 7 basin classification fluoride concentration was determined by water quality analyses performed in the laboratory mowi 2017 the well yield potential based on the pumping tests the resistivity value based on electrical logs the water strike depth geology and intake aquifer were obtained from each geological column and borehole drilling record jica 2011 mowi 2017 nakayama et al 2021 the water strike depth intake aquifer and geology have been identified by the position where groundwater gushed out during the borehole drilling in the second step basin classification spatial analysis was performed using a geographic information system gis namely arcgis provided by the environmental systems research institute esri eze and kumahor 2019 mcbratney and webster 1986 webster and oliver 2007 to determine whether a well belonged to the ltb or idb in the third step the borehole survey data were divided into the three groups depending on whether the borehole penetrated the weathered zone fractured zone or the combined zone among the 137 boreholes that were surveyed data from 78 boreholes were obtained from zones with both weathering and fracturing or missing data category three and data from 59 boreholes were from either a weathered zone or a fractured zone table 1 in the fourth step boreholes that belonged to both weathered and fractured were omitted from the analysis this step was essential to clarify the fluoride contamination mechanism of groundwater because for the remaining 59 boreholes the aquifers were clearly identified as classifying in either a weathered zone or a fractured zone after the second through fourth steps were completed data from the 59 boreholes were analysed based on the following relationships see 5 1 to 5 4 below in the fifth step fig 3 to understand how fluoride concentration in groundwater is related to the physical properties of the rock mass 5 1 relationship between resistivity based on the electrical logging and the well yield potential 5 2 relationship between resistivity based on the electrical logging and the fluoride concentration 5 3 relationship between the well yield potential and the fluoride concentration 5 4 relationship between the water strike depth and the fluoride concentration because some of the parameters for some wells were erroneous due to human error some data could not be used in the above analyses and for this reason some wells analysed had a smaller component of data therefore part of the analysis was limited to understanding specific trends rather than correlations the analysis referred to in 5 1 examines whether a logarithmic relationship exists between the resistivity value based on the electrical logging and the well yield potential as shown in nakayama et al 2021 similarly the analysis in 5 2 confirms whether there is a relationship between the fluoride concentration and resistivity an autocorrelation structure was used when drawing the fluoride distribution on the electrical logging figs 6 and 8 using the open source code statistical software r and a gaussian model was the optimal statistical model the figures were drawn using the kriging interpolation function in arcgis and the parameters calculated by r the analysis in 5 3 reveals the relationship between the fluoride concentration and the well yield potential and through the analysis in 5 4 the relationship between the fluoride concentration and the water strike depth based on the borehole logging was determined based on the analysis results of all steps fig 3 this study discusses the mechanism of groundwater fluoride contamination in the weathered and fractured zones of the two basins 3 results among the 137 boreholes surveyed 78 were in both weathered and fractured zones or missing data and 59 boreholes were located either the weathered zone or the fractured zone to clarify the fluoride contamination mechanism of groundwater only the data from the 59 boreholes table 1 where it was clear whether the aquifer was in the weathered zone or fractured zone were analysed table 1 shows seven parameters used in the analysis in this study table 2 shows the statistical values of the fluoride concentration in each intake aquifer weathered or fractured classified for each basin used in the study 3 1 resistivity based on electrical logging and the well yield potential of aquifers we hypothesized that resistivity based on electrical logging and the well yield potential of an aquifer can be used as indicators of the degree of weathering and or fracturing in the hard rock layer tsukamoto et al 2010 similar to nakayama et al 2021 the resistivity based on electrical logging and the well yield potential of aquifers which deals with only fractured zone are inversely proportional to each other when expressed as logarithmic relationships in the tabora region the relationship is similar in both the fractured zone fig 4a and the weathered zone fig 4b where the well yield potential increases the resistivity decreases in both zones when the resistivity value is approximately 200 o m or lower the well yield potential tends to increase sharply in the weathered zone the difference due to geology in terms of the relationship between the well yield potential and resistivity could not be determined because only weathered granite was examined in the fractured zone however it is possible that the well yield potential of hard shale is higher than that of granite and granodiorite however it is difficult to determine the difference due to geology with respect to the relationship between the well yield potential and resistivity because of an inadequate number of samples 3 2 relationship between the fluoride concentration in groundwater and the electrical resistivity of the aquifer 3 2 1 weathered zone as shown in fig 5 the groundwater fluoride concentration in the weathered zone of the granite tends to decrease as the electrical resistivity increases in both the idb and ltb in the idb the correlation coefficient r between the fluoride concentration and the electrical resistivity is 0 671 there were fewer data points four in the ltb and all were distributed below 200 o m for this reason the r value 0 617 is unreliable however the lower resistivity of the weathered zone the higher fluoride concentration in the groundwater in both the idb and ltb the fluoride concentration in the idb ranges from 1 1 to 1 6 mg l compared with less than 1 2 mg l in the ltb the groundwater fluoride concentration in the weathered zone of the granite in the idb tends to be higher than that in the ltb fig 6 shows a spatial distribution of the resistivity and the groundwater fluoride concentration in the weathered zone using data from both the idb and ltb although the distribution was mainly determined from the idb data the locations with high fluoride concentration wells with red circles that exceed the who standard tends to be distributed in zones where the resistivity value is relatively low 3 2 2 fractured zone fig 7 shows the relationship between the resistivity based on electrical logging and the fluoride concentration of groundwater in the fractured zone in the idb and ltb in the fractured zone in the granite of the idb fig 7a the fluoride concentration of the groundwater has a weak correlation with the resistivity compared with a moderate correlation in the fractured zone for both the nw se fault system r 0 527 and the ne sw fault system r 0 665 in the granite of the ltb fig 7b in detail the wells along the nw se fault system tend to have a lower fluoride concentration than the wells along the ne sw fault system fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of the resistivity by electrical logging and the fluoride concentration in the groundwater in the fractured zone the spatial distribution indicates that the wells with a high fluoride concentration are distributed in the low resistivity area in the idb by contrast the groundwater fluoride concentration in the fractured zone in the ltb exhibits the tendency to be higher in wells in areas where the resistivity value is higher than that of the idb 3 3 relationship between the fluoride concentration in groundwater and the well yield potential of an aquifer 3 3 1 weathered zone as shown in fig 9 in the weathered zone the fluoride concentration in the groundwater increases as the well yield potential of an aquifer increases in both the idb and ltb therefore in the weathered zone of the granite the relationship between the fluoride concentration and the well yield potential fig 9 is the exact opposite of that between the fluoride concentration and the resistivity fig 5 3 3 2 fractured zone in the fractured zone of the idb even though the well yield potential increases the trend of the groundwater fluoride concentration versus the well yield potential is not clear because the former varied widely i e was scattered fig 10 a in the fractured zone of the ltb the well yield potential of the wells along the nw se fault system was mainly 2 m3 h or lower and the fluoride concentration in the groundwater ranged between 0 5 and 1 6 mg l fig 10b the fluoride concentration is negatively correlated with a well yield potential between 0 and 16 m3 h for the wells along the ne sw fault system r 0 778 3 4 relationship between the fluoride concentration in groundwater and the water strike depth the depth to the water vein that is the water strike depth is an important factor in groundwater development since this study attempts to understand the effects of fracturing or weathering on fluoride contamination on an aquifer by aquifer basis and is utilizing data from 59 wells targeting either the fractured zone or weathered zone however the 81 wells used in this section include wells pumping water from both aquifers 22 wells because this section examined trends in the idb and ltb weathered zone thickness fig 11 shows the distribution of the water strike depth for 81 wells pumped only in the weathered zones and in both weathered and fractured zones in the idb and ltb from almost all the water strike depth recorded in borehole logging it can be confirmed that the groundwater was pumped from the bottom of the weathered zone near the boundary between the weathered zone and fresh basement rock jones 1985 thus since it is considered that the water strike depth is the thickness of the weathered zone the thickness of the weathered zone in the idb varied widely between 20 m and 90 m whereas it was concentrated between 20 m and 50 m in the ltb table 3 shows the statistics of the water strike depth that is the thickness of the weathered zone in each basin the thickness of the weathered zone in the idb is greater than that in the ltb in this section the relationship between the fluoride concentration in the groundwater and the water strike depth is shown for the weathered and fractured zones 3 4 1 weathered zone in the weathered zone of both the idb and ltb the fluoride concentration in the groundwater tends to decrease as the water strike depth increases but the correlation is very weak or unclear fig 12 in the weathered zone of the idb the range of the water strike depth is widely distributed between 17 m and 81 m while the fluoride concentration falls in a narrow range between 1 2 and 1 6 mg l by contrast in the weathered zone of the ltb the water strike depth is concentrated around 30 m while the fluoride concentration ranges from 0 6 to 1 4 mg l 3 4 2 fractured zone in the fractured zone in the idb the fluoride concentration in the groundwater tends to increase as the water strike depth increases fig 13 a however the correlation between the two is weak in the granite in wells along both the nw se fault system and the ne sw fault system in the ltb the fluoride concentration in the groundwater tends to decrease as the water strike depth increases fig 13b moreover the fluoride concentration of the wells along the ne sw fault system maximum value 1 9 mg l tends to be systematically higher than that of the wells along the nw se fault system maximum value 1 6 mg l 4 discussion the results obtained in this study indicate that differences between local and regional groundwater circulation affect the fluoride contamination process in the weathered and fractured zones in hard rock aquifers this study clarified that not only electrical resistivity but also well yield potential can be regarded as representing the degree of weathering and or fracturing excluding the effect of geothermal and electrolyte water quality in both the idb and ltb fig 4 and nakayama et al 2021 here the degree of fracturing and or weathering is an important factor for fluoride leaching and deposition jacks et al 2005 and is essential for considering each relationship and mechanism henceforward first considering the relationships between the fluoride concentration in the groundwater the electrical resistivity value and the well yield potential in the weathered zone fig 4b 5 6 and 9 a low electrical resistivity zone is intimately connected to a high well yield potential and the groundwater of wells with a high well yield potential have higher fluoride concentrations this relationship was found in the weathered zones of both the idb and ltb in addition as shown in fig 5 the resistivity values in the weathered zone of the ltb are below 200 o m which ensures adequate pumping for water resource development and the fluoride concentration is below the who standard this study found that there is a weak negative correlation between the electrical logging and the fluoride concentration trends that can be used to foster the goal of better development of water resources fig 11 also shows that the thickness of the weathered zone in the ltb is mostly between 20 m and 30 m and fig 12 shows that the data is consistently concentrated between 20 m and 40 m therefore a drastic change in trend from fig 5 in this study is difficult to consider and although the analysis in this study is significant the number of weathered zone data in the ltb is small at present and is a little lacking in accuracy however the addition of data from water resource development in the tabora region in the future would create accuracy in the data through improved correlation coefficients according to the distribution of the weathered zone thickness directly estimated from water strike depth shown in fig 11 the idb weathered zone is thicker than that of the ltb and the groundwater fluoride concentration in the weathered zone of the idb is higher than that of the ltb as described above figs 5 and 9 jacks et al 2005 and jica 2008 reported that fluoride has been leached and concentrated in the groundwater of the weathered zone specific to the idb due to the hydrological cycle since precipitation preferentially infiltrates through flow paths in the weathered zone during its residence time from the recharge area to the pumping well fluoride will be more likely to leach into groundwater from the weathered zone however weak or negative correlations between the fluoride concentration and water strike depth were observed in both the idb and ltb fig 12 the regression line for the idb has a gentle slope of 0 00312 mg f l m r 0 432 while the regression line for the ltb exhibits a steeper slope of 0 0764 mg f l m r 0 482 thus the fluoride concentration in the groundwater in the weathered zone of both the idb and ltb does not appear to be related to the water strike depth therefore the key parameters for realistic estimation of the fluoride contamination in the weathered zone in a geophysical survey will be the electrical resistivity value as a substitute for the degree of weathering and the well yield potential which can also be estimated from electrical resistivity fig 14 shows schematics in the case of high electrical resistivity and a low well yield potential case 1 and low electrical resistivity and a high well yield potential case 2 case 2 corresponds to pumping water from a more strongly weathered zone the weathered part of the rocks in case 2 is very variable and fracturing promotes weathering based on the relationships between the fluoride concentration in the groundwater the electrical resistivity value and the well yield potential in the weathered zone the groundwater fluoride concentration tends to be low in case 1 and high in case 2 the decrease in electrical resistivity and the increase in the well yield potential in the weathered zone of both the idb and ltb indicate the progress of physical weathering over time based on the above the mechanism of increasing fluoride in the weathered zone can be summarized as follows physical weathering progresses in the hard rock layer and the fluoride concentration in the groundwater increases in the weathered zone of both the idb and ltb fig 14 next considering the relationships between the fluoride concentration in the groundwater the electrical resistivity value and the well yield potential in the fractured zone fig 4a 7 8 and 10 there is an intimate relation in which a low electrical resistivity zone reflects a high well yield potential and the groundwater of wells with a higher well yield potential indicate a lower fluoride concentration for the ne sw fault system in the fractured zone of the ltb however this relationship is not compatible for the fractured zone in the idb and the nw se fault system of the ltb or for the weathered zone in both the idb and ltb moreover in the relationship between the water strike depth and the fluoride concentration of groundwater in the fractured zone fig 13 the idb and ltb show opposite characteristics or tendencies i e as the water strike depth increases the fluoride concentration of the groundwater increases in the fractured zone of the idb while the fluoride concentration tends to decrease as the water strike depth increases in both the ne sw fault system and the nw se fault system of the ltb with respect to the groundwater residence time from the recharge area to the pumping well via the fractured zone fluoride is more likely to leach into groundwater mainly in the fractured zone fig 14a this may be evidenced by the positive correlation between the fluoride concentration and the water strike depth in the fractured zone of the idb fig 13a however the mechanism through which fluoride leaches into groundwater mainly in the fractured zone does not hold for the fractured zone in both fault systems of the ltb it appears that some other mechanism that decreases the fluoride concentration operates as the water strike depth increases in both fault systems of the ltb kagabu et al 2016 conducted hydrological research using an isotopic tracer and a dating tracer in groundwater and reported that the recharge area of well water in the fractured zone around the tabora region in the ltb fig 1 is quite far from the pumping wells in the ltb and the groundwater flows from higher altitude locations according to kagabu et al 2016 one of the candidates for the recharge area must be the western kihama district in the shinyanga region kigosi and moyowosi game reserves occupy a large area in the western kihama district fig 1 which is a low fluoride area fluoride concentration for all sampling data of the shinyanga region in the ltb less than 1 5 mg l based on shedafa and johnston 2013 with a high altitude jica 2008 and the groundwater must flow from the recharge area as regional groundwater flow via fault systems figs 1 and 15 based on the mechanism described above groundwater with a low fluoride concentration in a distant location that flows through fault systems is pumped from the wells in areas with a high fluoride concentration here the difference in the fluoride concentration in well water between the ne sw fault system and the nw se fault system depends on the groundwater fluoride concentration on the extension of the fault and lineament nakayama et al 2021 reported a multiple correlation equation to estimate the well yield potential from two surface geophysical data sets electrical resistivity tomography ert survey results and lengths of topographic lineaments in the tabora region these authors developed an equation that provides the electrical logging resistivity elr value as a function of electrical resistivity obtained from the surface ert therefore when surface explorations of ert and lineament are carried out the fluoride concentration in the groundwater of the weathered zone can be roughly estimated before boreholes are drilled this is achieved by applying the well yield potential obtained from the multiple correlation equation to the regression equation between the well yield potential and the fluoride concentration shown in fig 9 moreover the spatial distribution of the fluoride concentration in the groundwater of the fractured zone along a fault can be roughly estimated before boreholes are drilled by applying the elr obtained from the function expression equation of ert nakayama et al 2021 to the regression equation between the elr and the fluoride concentration shown in fig 7 however more reliable data need to be collected for improving the correlation factor in the relationship between well yield potential and elr fig 4 and for making a regression equation to estimate the fluoride concentration before drilling boreholes overall the three parameters used in this study are general data that are always found in geologic columns created when wells are drilled since these data can be obtained without any special surveys future improvements in accuracy can be expected to complement the data lacking in this study from a hydrogeological perspective the fractured zone is the main target for water resource development but the distribution of fluoride concentration is complex and has not been clarified this study has been able to identify trends in the distribution of fluoride concentrations in the tabora region therefore this study will contribute to the development of safe water resources in the future 5 summary in general weathered and fractured zones exhibit low electrical resistivity indicating that electrical resistance represents the degree of weathering and or fracturing in hard rocks excluding the effect of geothermal and electrolyte water quality in this study the mechanism of fluoride contamination in the groundwater of wells with a water strike depth less than 110 m was researched using field geophysical survey data for weathered and fractured zones mainly in the archean granite basement of the lake tanganyika basin ltb and an internal drainage basin idb the results and discussion are summarized below 1 the well yield potential increased as the electrical logging resistivity decreased in both weathered and fractured zones suggesting that physical weathering and fracturing in the hard rock layer increase the well yield potential 2 in the weathered zone in the hard rock granite of both the idb and ltb the fluoride concentration in the well water depended on the well yield potential the results suggest that as the physical weathering progresses the well yield potential increases but the fluoride concentration in groundwater increases since weathering process also triggers the leaching of fluoride from minerals due to increased contact area between water and rock considering the phenomena described in 1 the inconvenient environment is also induced that not only does the reservoir expand because of the progression of physical weathering but it also increases the fluoride content in the reservoir s groundwater 3 in the fractured zone in the hard rock granite of both the idb and ltb the fluoride concentration in the well water tended to decrease as the electrical logging resistivity decreased however in the idb the fluoride concentration did not depend on the well yield potential while in the ltb the fluoride concentration tended to decrease as the well yield potential increased therefore in the fractured zone in the idb a mechanism will be possible that increased residence time or flow length from the recharge zone through the fractured zone to the pumping screen enhances fluoride leaching based on the trend that the fluoride concentration increases with the water strike depth regardless of the amount of well yield potential however the mechanism is not applicable to the fractured zone of the ltb 4 in the fractured zone along the fault systems in the ltb the fluoride concentration in the well water decreased as the water strike depth increased as the water strike depth increased fluoride in groundwater is affected by groundwater flowing from a distance through the fault system regional groundwater flow the results suggest that the difference in the fluoride concentration in the well water between the ne sw fault system and the nw se fault system depends on the groundwater fluoride concentration on the extension of the faults and lineaments considering the above groundwater resources with a geogenic low fluoride concentration will be found in the low electrical resistivity area of the fractured zone along faults and lineaments in the ltb and idb the findings of this study will be useful for the identification of groundwater resources with low fluoride

3151,in the east african rift valley geogenic fluoride contamination of groundwater is particularly noticeable as a drinking water problem in the tabora region in the central part of tanzania which consists of two basins lake tanganyika basin ltb and an internal drainage basin idb within a semi arid region fluoride contaminated groundwater that exceeds the world health organization standards is pumped from many wells in the fractured and weathered zones of the granitic layer underlying these basins fluoride contamination of groundwater is heterogeneously distributed in the granitic layer posing an obstacle to groundwater development in this study a relationship between the fluoride concentration and the hydrogeological structure was investigated using geophysical survey data to achieve efficient groundwater development in geogenic contaminated areas based on the results the following two mechanisms have been determined regarding fluoride contamination in the tabora region 1 with respect to the weathered zones in both the ltb and idb the greater the extent of weathering the more readily fluoride leaches into groundwater this suggests that fluoride leaching due to the chemical weathering of minerals containing fluoride increases with the weathering of rocks in the field 2 with respect to the fractured zones in the ltb a large well yield potential and a deeper water strike depth to the water vein result in lower fluoride concentrations the suggested flow mechanism for the ltb is that water recharge in a groundwater depression area with a low fluoride concentration flow to substantial depth and over long distances through fault systems which form preferential flow paths this implies that the fractured zone along the fault system in the ltb is a high priority reservoir for the development of safe water resources in the tabora region the hydrogeological mechanisms discussed in this study provide a basis for establishing estimation methods for the prediction of safe groundwater resources before a borehole is drilled however more reliable data needs to be collected to clarify the effects of hydrogeology on groundwater fluoride contamination for the fractured zone in the idb data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction geogenic fluoride contamination of groundwater and surface water which are the main sources of drinking water for the inhabitants of water scarce areas is a problem throughout the world ali et al 2016 kim and jeong 2005 selinus et al 2005 viero et al 2009 if anthropogenic contamination is not considered the chemical constituents of igneous and sedimentary rocks are most likely to be leached from weathered and fractured zones into groundwater and surface water through various processes when the concentration of leached material increases many sources of water cannot be used for drinking purposes igneous rock especially granite may contain high concentrations of fluoride for example granite contains about 500 mg kg to 1 400 mg kg of fluoride average 810 mg kg kraukopf and bird 1995 koritnig 1978 wedepohl 1969 and mica and hornblende minerals in granite are rich sources of fluoride selinus et al 2005 which is leached from mica by weathering and hydrothermal processes gilkes and suddhiprakarn 1979 pozzuoli et al 1992 tsurumaki and sakuramoto 1985 watanabe et al 2005 in the case of fluoride contamination due to the influence of crystalline rocks including granite many research papers and reports have reported serious problems due to fluorosis in india hossain and patra 2020 mondal et al 2009 raju et al 2012 reddy et al 2009 sadashivaiah et al 2008 shekhar et al 2017 singaraja et al 2014 and jacks et al 2005 have shown that fluoride leaching into sediments by repeated evapotranspiration is a prominent mechanism in southern india additional research confirms high concentrations of fluoride in many countries with similar geological and climate conditions including ghana south africa and countries in the east african rift system bgs 2002 farooqi 2015 gaciri and davies 1992 kilham and hecky 1973 msonda et al 2007 selinus et al 2005 in these countries the fluoride concentration in the water source often does not meet the world health organization who standard 1 5 mg l who 2017 as a result of using drinking water with high fluoride concentrations for many years more than 80 million people in the countries that are part of the east african rift valley have dental and skeletal fluorosis bgs 2002 frencken 1990 there are many research papers and reports on the effects of drinking water with excessive fluoride on the human body bhatnagar et al 2011 farooqi 2015 fawell et al 2006 tanzania fig 1 is one of the countries with fluoride contamination in the east african rift valley region and the fluoride in water sources is particularly high in the northern to the central part of tanzania pittalis 2010 fluoride concentrations ranging from 759 to 1 980 mg l have been detected in lake magadi located west of arusha in northern tanzania jones et al 1977 and up to 690 mg l in lakes and rivers of the surrounding area nanyaro et al 1984 in addition a survey conducted in the internal drainage basin idb by the japan international cooperation agency jica jica 2008 also found concentrations of fluoride that exceeded the who standard in many water sources regardless of the water s origin jica 2008 reported that spring samples had a maximum fluoride concentration of 66 mg l and shallow and deep wells had a maximum fluoride concentration of 30 mg l due to the use of these high fluoride water sources as drinking water numerous young inhabitants with fluorosis symptoms have been found in the study area of the basin especially in the arusha region bgs 2002 jica 2008 the tabora region located in central tanzania is no exception and a maximum concentration of 10 3 mg l of fluoride has been detected in deep wells in the igunga district fig 1 based on an inventory survey jica 2008 fluoride detection surveys have only been conducted sporadically in the igunga and nzega districts fig 1 kagabu et al 2016 reported that water particularly fissure water was sampled from wells and that tracer analysis was carried out on the samples in the tabora region due to the altitude effect there is a negative correlation between altitude and stable oxygen or hydrogen isotope ratio in meteoric water the stable oxygen isotope ratio is low at high altitudes this allows for the possibility that the recharge area is far away and at a higher altitude in addition the electrical conductivity ec of fissure water in the basement rock in the tabora region tends to increase at lower altitudes and from the relationship between the apparent groundwater residence time obtained from the chlorofluorocarbon cfc 12 concentration and ec the residence time tends to increase as the ec increases furthermore the tabora region is almost entirely underlain by granite fig 1 and to supply safe water to the inhabitant drinking water is mainly taken from deep wells targeting weathered zones fractured zones or both time and money are required to investigate potential source areas and drill boreholes to obtain sufficient well yields from the aquifer because groundwater is unevenly distributed in weathered and fractured zones the problem is exacerbated because boreholes cannot be used as production wells and are abandoned if they do not meet the who standard due to the problem of fluoride contamination in fact a similar situation occurred in the jica project implemented between 2013 and 2017 mowi 2017 there is currently no suitable study to solve this problem in this study areas with a low fluoride concentration in the tabora region were identified through analysis of the jica survey data jica 2011 mowi 2017 to efficiently improve the success rate of acquiring drinkable water supplies the purpose of this study is to understand the hydrogeological mechanisms of fluoride contamination in the tabora region by using geophysical survey data to fill up the gap of the ambiguous knowledge in the survey steps which will lead to the next step i e establishing a method to easily estimate fluoride contamination this study is intended to elucidate the fluoride contamination mechanism from a hydrogeological point of view based on geophysical exploration and well drilling data as physical weathering and fracturing of hard rock should promote the leaching of fluoride contained in hard rock to groundwater in water rock interaction 2 site description and methodology 2 1 study area the tabora region is located on a plateau in central tanzania from 4 to 7 s latitude and 31 34 e longitude covering an area of approximately 76 700 km2 the altitude ranges from approximately 1 000 m to 1 600 m and the slope gradually decreases from north to south but the highest hills with an altitude of 1 600 m are in the south eastern part of the region fig 2 the tabora region is covered by three basins lake tanganyika basin ltb an internal drainage basin idb and lake rukwa basin and their areas account for 68 28 and 4 of the total respectively jica 2011 this study focuses on the ltb and idb because of they cover most of the tabora region and the distribution of analysed wells figs 1 and 2 the climate in the ltb and idb is semi arid to arid and the annual rainfall is approximately 1 000 mm which is equivalent to the mean annual precipitation of tanzania according to bgs 2002 and jica 2011 the rainy season extends from october to may rainfall is concentrated from november to april and the dry season is from june to september the temperature peaks at approximately 32 2 c from september to october and at approximately 14 7 c from june to july the sunshine duration is between 10 2 h which is the longest in july in the dry season and 7 6 h the shortest in january in the rainy season evapotranspiration is estimated to be 150 mm month in the rainy season and 250 mm month in the dry season according to onodera et al 1996 the amount of recharge in dodoma the capital of tanzania which has slightly less precipitation but the same geology and hydrological cycle as the tabora region is approximately 3 20 of the annual precipitation based on these results jica 2011 estimated that the annual recharge in the tabora region is in the approximate range 50 200 mm year from analyses of both the water balance analysis and the tank model the geology of the tabora region is characterized by archean plutonic rocks and metamorphic rocks that are widely distributed as basement rocks these are covered by terrestrial sedimentary rocks of paleozoic to cenozoic age lacustrine sediment and alluvium deposited in order from the bottom the weathered zone and fractured zone which are the targets of deep wells consist mainly of archean plutonic and metamorphic rocks such as granite granodiorite gneiss amphibolite migmatite and schist structurally fig 1 fault systems developed in the north south direction and the northwest southeast direction i e parallel to the east african rift valley and several subsidiary faults extend from the main faults in a northeast southwest direction bgs 2002 jica 2011 although weathered zone thickness varies from place to place throughout the tabora region basically the depth of tens of meters below the surface of the archean volcanic and metamorphic rocks shown in fig 1 is a weathered zone the thickness of the fractured zone varies with the size of each lineament and fault and the parts along the lineaments and faults shown in fig 1 indicate the fractured zones the aquifers in the study area can be divided into two main groups the alluvium and the pleistocene strata and the fissure water in bedrock that flows through the lineaments and faults and groundwater stored in the weathered zones of the bedrock fig 1 however the extent of the alluvium and pleistocene strata is very narrow and limited in the study area modified groundwater contours are shown in fig 1 by integrating the well data used in this study with groundwater contours analysed and created by jica 2011 based on the static water levels total water head for deep wells groundwater recharge areas in the ltb are particularly concentrated during the rainy season when seasonal rivers appear at low elevations along topographic features formed by faults and lineaments providing a source of recharge to the weathered and fractured zone river water collects into the malagarasi river fig 1 and discharges into the lake tanganyika via various branches of the malagarasi river which flows primarily through the northern and north western parts of the tabora region the major groundwater flow direction is from northeast to southwest fig 1 jica 2011 in the idb groundwater recharge occurs primarily during the rainy season like in the ltb around lakes and in the northern part of the basin mountainous areas most of the rivers flowing within the basin are seasonal rivers and all river water is constrained by topography and flowed into lakes or wetlands within the basin which converge internally within the idb the major direction of groundwater flow in the idb for the tabora region is from southwest to northeast and the water balance is completed within the basin fig 1 jica 2008 in addition groundwater flow in the fractured zone in the ltb and idb is regulated by fracture networks therefore groundwater flow in the ltb and idb is complex and different from the major flow directions described above 2 2 methodology in the first step of the analysis it compiled survey data for 137 boreholes and results of water quality analyses conducted in the laboratory which formed parts of two projects conducted by jica and the ministry of water and irrigation mowi in the tabora region of tanzania from 2009 to 2017 fig 3 according to the reports from these projects groundwater in the target area was contaminated with geogenic fluoride however it was not possible to determine the mechanism of this fluoride contamination therefore this study focused on the difference in the fluoride contamination level at a basin scale which is directly connected to groundwater recharge in the water balance rather than by district or regional boundary divisions selinus et al 2005 toth 1963 the fluoride contamination mechanism of groundwater was analysed according to the flowchart shown in fig 3 seven parameters table 1 from the two projects were used for analysis 1 fluoride concentration 2 well yield potential 3 resistivity value 4 water strike depth 5 geology 6 intake aquifer and 7 basin classification fluoride concentration was determined by water quality analyses performed in the laboratory mowi 2017 the well yield potential based on the pumping tests the resistivity value based on electrical logs the water strike depth geology and intake aquifer were obtained from each geological column and borehole drilling record jica 2011 mowi 2017 nakayama et al 2021 the water strike depth intake aquifer and geology have been identified by the position where groundwater gushed out during the borehole drilling in the second step basin classification spatial analysis was performed using a geographic information system gis namely arcgis provided by the environmental systems research institute esri eze and kumahor 2019 mcbratney and webster 1986 webster and oliver 2007 to determine whether a well belonged to the ltb or idb in the third step the borehole survey data were divided into the three groups depending on whether the borehole penetrated the weathered zone fractured zone or the combined zone among the 137 boreholes that were surveyed data from 78 boreholes were obtained from zones with both weathering and fracturing or missing data category three and data from 59 boreholes were from either a weathered zone or a fractured zone table 1 in the fourth step boreholes that belonged to both weathered and fractured were omitted from the analysis this step was essential to clarify the fluoride contamination mechanism of groundwater because for the remaining 59 boreholes the aquifers were clearly identified as classifying in either a weathered zone or a fractured zone after the second through fourth steps were completed data from the 59 boreholes were analysed based on the following relationships see 5 1 to 5 4 below in the fifth step fig 3 to understand how fluoride concentration in groundwater is related to the physical properties of the rock mass 5 1 relationship between resistivity based on the electrical logging and the well yield potential 5 2 relationship between resistivity based on the electrical logging and the fluoride concentration 5 3 relationship between the well yield potential and the fluoride concentration 5 4 relationship between the water strike depth and the fluoride concentration because some of the parameters for some wells were erroneous due to human error some data could not be used in the above analyses and for this reason some wells analysed had a smaller component of data therefore part of the analysis was limited to understanding specific trends rather than correlations the analysis referred to in 5 1 examines whether a logarithmic relationship exists between the resistivity value based on the electrical logging and the well yield potential as shown in nakayama et al 2021 similarly the analysis in 5 2 confirms whether there is a relationship between the fluoride concentration and resistivity an autocorrelation structure was used when drawing the fluoride distribution on the electrical logging figs 6 and 8 using the open source code statistical software r and a gaussian model was the optimal statistical model the figures were drawn using the kriging interpolation function in arcgis and the parameters calculated by r the analysis in 5 3 reveals the relationship between the fluoride concentration and the well yield potential and through the analysis in 5 4 the relationship between the fluoride concentration and the water strike depth based on the borehole logging was determined based on the analysis results of all steps fig 3 this study discusses the mechanism of groundwater fluoride contamination in the weathered and fractured zones of the two basins 3 results among the 137 boreholes surveyed 78 were in both weathered and fractured zones or missing data and 59 boreholes were located either the weathered zone or the fractured zone to clarify the fluoride contamination mechanism of groundwater only the data from the 59 boreholes table 1 where it was clear whether the aquifer was in the weathered zone or fractured zone were analysed table 1 shows seven parameters used in the analysis in this study table 2 shows the statistical values of the fluoride concentration in each intake aquifer weathered or fractured classified for each basin used in the study 3 1 resistivity based on electrical logging and the well yield potential of aquifers we hypothesized that resistivity based on electrical logging and the well yield potential of an aquifer can be used as indicators of the degree of weathering and or fracturing in the hard rock layer tsukamoto et al 2010 similar to nakayama et al 2021 the resistivity based on electrical logging and the well yield potential of aquifers which deals with only fractured zone are inversely proportional to each other when expressed as logarithmic relationships in the tabora region the relationship is similar in both the fractured zone fig 4a and the weathered zone fig 4b where the well yield potential increases the resistivity decreases in both zones when the resistivity value is approximately 200 o m or lower the well yield potential tends to increase sharply in the weathered zone the difference due to geology in terms of the relationship between the well yield potential and resistivity could not be determined because only weathered granite was examined in the fractured zone however it is possible that the well yield potential of hard shale is higher than that of granite and granodiorite however it is difficult to determine the difference due to geology with respect to the relationship between the well yield potential and resistivity because of an inadequate number of samples 3 2 relationship between the fluoride concentration in groundwater and the electrical resistivity of the aquifer 3 2 1 weathered zone as shown in fig 5 the groundwater fluoride concentration in the weathered zone of the granite tends to decrease as the electrical resistivity increases in both the idb and ltb in the idb the correlation coefficient r between the fluoride concentration and the electrical resistivity is 0 671 there were fewer data points four in the ltb and all were distributed below 200 o m for this reason the r value 0 617 is unreliable however the lower resistivity of the weathered zone the higher fluoride concentration in the groundwater in both the idb and ltb the fluoride concentration in the idb ranges from 1 1 to 1 6 mg l compared with less than 1 2 mg l in the ltb the groundwater fluoride concentration in the weathered zone of the granite in the idb tends to be higher than that in the ltb fig 6 shows a spatial distribution of the resistivity and the groundwater fluoride concentration in the weathered zone using data from both the idb and ltb although the distribution was mainly determined from the idb data the locations with high fluoride concentration wells with red circles that exceed the who standard tends to be distributed in zones where the resistivity value is relatively low 3 2 2 fractured zone fig 7 shows the relationship between the resistivity based on electrical logging and the fluoride concentration of groundwater in the fractured zone in the idb and ltb in the fractured zone in the granite of the idb fig 7a the fluoride concentration of the groundwater has a weak correlation with the resistivity compared with a moderate correlation in the fractured zone for both the nw se fault system r 0 527 and the ne sw fault system r 0 665 in the granite of the ltb fig 7b in detail the wells along the nw se fault system tend to have a lower fluoride concentration than the wells along the ne sw fault system fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of the resistivity by electrical logging and the fluoride concentration in the groundwater in the fractured zone the spatial distribution indicates that the wells with a high fluoride concentration are distributed in the low resistivity area in the idb by contrast the groundwater fluoride concentration in the fractured zone in the ltb exhibits the tendency to be higher in wells in areas where the resistivity value is higher than that of the idb 3 3 relationship between the fluoride concentration in groundwater and the well yield potential of an aquifer 3 3 1 weathered zone as shown in fig 9 in the weathered zone the fluoride concentration in the groundwater increases as the well yield potential of an aquifer increases in both the idb and ltb therefore in the weathered zone of the granite the relationship between the fluoride concentration and the well yield potential fig 9 is the exact opposite of that between the fluoride concentration and the resistivity fig 5 3 3 2 fractured zone in the fractured zone of the idb even though the well yield potential increases the trend of the groundwater fluoride concentration versus the well yield potential is not clear because the former varied widely i e was scattered fig 10 a in the fractured zone of the ltb the well yield potential of the wells along the nw se fault system was mainly 2 m3 h or lower and the fluoride concentration in the groundwater ranged between 0 5 and 1 6 mg l fig 10b the fluoride concentration is negatively correlated with a well yield potential between 0 and 16 m3 h for the wells along the ne sw fault system r 0 778 3 4 relationship between the fluoride concentration in groundwater and the water strike depth the depth to the water vein that is the water strike depth is an important factor in groundwater development since this study attempts to understand the effects of fracturing or weathering on fluoride contamination on an aquifer by aquifer basis and is utilizing data from 59 wells targeting either the fractured zone or weathered zone however the 81 wells used in this section include wells pumping water from both aquifers 22 wells because this section examined trends in the idb and ltb weathered zone thickness fig 11 shows the distribution of the water strike depth for 81 wells pumped only in the weathered zones and in both weathered and fractured zones in the idb and ltb from almost all the water strike depth recorded in borehole logging it can be confirmed that the groundwater was pumped from the bottom of the weathered zone near the boundary between the weathered zone and fresh basement rock jones 1985 thus since it is considered that the water strike depth is the thickness of the weathered zone the thickness of the weathered zone in the idb varied widely between 20 m and 90 m whereas it was concentrated between 20 m and 50 m in the ltb table 3 shows the statistics of the water strike depth that is the thickness of the weathered zone in each basin the thickness of the weathered zone in the idb is greater than that in the ltb in this section the relationship between the fluoride concentration in the groundwater and the water strike depth is shown for the weathered and fractured zones 3 4 1 weathered zone in the weathered zone of both the idb and ltb the fluoride concentration in the groundwater tends to decrease as the water strike depth increases but the correlation is very weak or unclear fig 12 in the weathered zone of the idb the range of the water strike depth is widely distributed between 17 m and 81 m while the fluoride concentration falls in a narrow range between 1 2 and 1 6 mg l by contrast in the weathered zone of the ltb the water strike depth is concentrated around 30 m while the fluoride concentration ranges from 0 6 to 1 4 mg l 3 4 2 fractured zone in the fractured zone in the idb the fluoride concentration in the groundwater tends to increase as the water strike depth increases fig 13 a however the correlation between the two is weak in the granite in wells along both the nw se fault system and the ne sw fault system in the ltb the fluoride concentration in the groundwater tends to decrease as the water strike depth increases fig 13b moreover the fluoride concentration of the wells along the ne sw fault system maximum value 1 9 mg l tends to be systematically higher than that of the wells along the nw se fault system maximum value 1 6 mg l 4 discussion the results obtained in this study indicate that differences between local and regional groundwater circulation affect the fluoride contamination process in the weathered and fractured zones in hard rock aquifers this study clarified that not only electrical resistivity but also well yield potential can be regarded as representing the degree of weathering and or fracturing excluding the effect of geothermal and electrolyte water quality in both the idb and ltb fig 4 and nakayama et al 2021 here the degree of fracturing and or weathering is an important factor for fluoride leaching and deposition jacks et al 2005 and is essential for considering each relationship and mechanism henceforward first considering the relationships between the fluoride concentration in the groundwater the electrical resistivity value and the well yield potential in the weathered zone fig 4b 5 6 and 9 a low electrical resistivity zone is intimately connected to a high well yield potential and the groundwater of wells with a high well yield potential have higher fluoride concentrations this relationship was found in the weathered zones of both the idb and ltb in addition as shown in fig 5 the resistivity values in the weathered zone of the ltb are below 200 o m which ensures adequate pumping for water resource development and the fluoride concentration is below the who standard this study found that there is a weak negative correlation between the electrical logging and the fluoride concentration trends that can be used to foster the goal of better development of water resources fig 11 also shows that the thickness of the weathered zone in the ltb is mostly between 20 m and 30 m and fig 12 shows that the data is consistently concentrated between 20 m and 40 m therefore a drastic change in trend from fig 5 in this study is difficult to consider and although the analysis in this study is significant the number of weathered zone data in the ltb is small at present and is a little lacking in accuracy however the addition of data from water resource development in the tabora region in the future would create accuracy in the data through improved correlation coefficients according to the distribution of the weathered zone thickness directly estimated from water strike depth shown in fig 11 the idb weathered zone is thicker than that of the ltb and the groundwater fluoride concentration in the weathered zone of the idb is higher than that of the ltb as described above figs 5 and 9 jacks et al 2005 and jica 2008 reported that fluoride has been leached and concentrated in the groundwater of the weathered zone specific to the idb due to the hydrological cycle since precipitation preferentially infiltrates through flow paths in the weathered zone during its residence time from the recharge area to the pumping well fluoride will be more likely to leach into groundwater from the weathered zone however weak or negative correlations between the fluoride concentration and water strike depth were observed in both the idb and ltb fig 12 the regression line for the idb has a gentle slope of 0 00312 mg f l m r 0 432 while the regression line for the ltb exhibits a steeper slope of 0 0764 mg f l m r 0 482 thus the fluoride concentration in the groundwater in the weathered zone of both the idb and ltb does not appear to be related to the water strike depth therefore the key parameters for realistic estimation of the fluoride contamination in the weathered zone in a geophysical survey will be the electrical resistivity value as a substitute for the degree of weathering and the well yield potential which can also be estimated from electrical resistivity fig 14 shows schematics in the case of high electrical resistivity and a low well yield potential case 1 and low electrical resistivity and a high well yield potential case 2 case 2 corresponds to pumping water from a more strongly weathered zone the weathered part of the rocks in case 2 is very variable and fracturing promotes weathering based on the relationships between the fluoride concentration in the groundwater the electrical resistivity value and the well yield potential in the weathered zone the groundwater fluoride concentration tends to be low in case 1 and high in case 2 the decrease in electrical resistivity and the increase in the well yield potential in the weathered zone of both the idb and ltb indicate the progress of physical weathering over time based on the above the mechanism of increasing fluoride in the weathered zone can be summarized as follows physical weathering progresses in the hard rock layer and the fluoride concentration in the groundwater increases in the weathered zone of both the idb and ltb fig 14 next considering the relationships between the fluoride concentration in the groundwater the electrical resistivity value and the well yield potential in the fractured zone fig 4a 7 8 and 10 there is an intimate relation in which a low electrical resistivity zone reflects a high well yield potential and the groundwater of wells with a higher well yield potential indicate a lower fluoride concentration for the ne sw fault system in the fractured zone of the ltb however this relationship is not compatible for the fractured zone in the idb and the nw se fault system of the ltb or for the weathered zone in both the idb and ltb moreover in the relationship between the water strike depth and the fluoride concentration of groundwater in the fractured zone fig 13 the idb and ltb show opposite characteristics or tendencies i e as the water strike depth increases the fluoride concentration of the groundwater increases in the fractured zone of the idb while the fluoride concentration tends to decrease as the water strike depth increases in both the ne sw fault system and the nw se fault system of the ltb with respect to the groundwater residence time from the recharge area to the pumping well via the fractured zone fluoride is more likely to leach into groundwater mainly in the fractured zone fig 14a this may be evidenced by the positive correlation between the fluoride concentration and the water strike depth in the fractured zone of the idb fig 13a however the mechanism through which fluoride leaches into groundwater mainly in the fractured zone does not hold for the fractured zone in both fault systems of the ltb it appears that some other mechanism that decreases the fluoride concentration operates as the water strike depth increases in both fault systems of the ltb kagabu et al 2016 conducted hydrological research using an isotopic tracer and a dating tracer in groundwater and reported that the recharge area of well water in the fractured zone around the tabora region in the ltb fig 1 is quite far from the pumping wells in the ltb and the groundwater flows from higher altitude locations according to kagabu et al 2016 one of the candidates for the recharge area must be the western kihama district in the shinyanga region kigosi and moyowosi game reserves occupy a large area in the western kihama district fig 1 which is a low fluoride area fluoride concentration for all sampling data of the shinyanga region in the ltb less than 1 5 mg l based on shedafa and johnston 2013 with a high altitude jica 2008 and the groundwater must flow from the recharge area as regional groundwater flow via fault systems figs 1 and 15 based on the mechanism described above groundwater with a low fluoride concentration in a distant location that flows through fault systems is pumped from the wells in areas with a high fluoride concentration here the difference in the fluoride concentration in well water between the ne sw fault system and the nw se fault system depends on the groundwater fluoride concentration on the extension of the fault and lineament nakayama et al 2021 reported a multiple correlation equation to estimate the well yield potential from two surface geophysical data sets electrical resistivity tomography ert survey results and lengths of topographic lineaments in the tabora region these authors developed an equation that provides the electrical logging resistivity elr value as a function of electrical resistivity obtained from the surface ert therefore when surface explorations of ert and lineament are carried out the fluoride concentration in the groundwater of the weathered zone can be roughly estimated before boreholes are drilled this is achieved by applying the well yield potential obtained from the multiple correlation equation to the regression equation between the well yield potential and the fluoride concentration shown in fig 9 moreover the spatial distribution of the fluoride concentration in the groundwater of the fractured zone along a fault can be roughly estimated before boreholes are drilled by applying the elr obtained from the function expression equation of ert nakayama et al 2021 to the regression equation between the elr and the fluoride concentration shown in fig 7 however more reliable data need to be collected for improving the correlation factor in the relationship between well yield potential and elr fig 4 and for making a regression equation to estimate the fluoride concentration before drilling boreholes overall the three parameters used in this study are general data that are always found in geologic columns created when wells are drilled since these data can be obtained without any special surveys future improvements in accuracy can be expected to complement the data lacking in this study from a hydrogeological perspective the fractured zone is the main target for water resource development but the distribution of fluoride concentration is complex and has not been clarified this study has been able to identify trends in the distribution of fluoride concentrations in the tabora region therefore this study will contribute to the development of safe water resources in the future 5 summary in general weathered and fractured zones exhibit low electrical resistivity indicating that electrical resistance represents the degree of weathering and or fracturing in hard rocks excluding the effect of geothermal and electrolyte water quality in this study the mechanism of fluoride contamination in the groundwater of wells with a water strike depth less than 110 m was researched using field geophysical survey data for weathered and fractured zones mainly in the archean granite basement of the lake tanganyika basin ltb and an internal drainage basin idb the results and discussion are summarized below 1 the well yield potential increased as the electrical logging resistivity decreased in both weathered and fractured zones suggesting that physical weathering and fracturing in the hard rock layer increase the well yield potential 2 in the weathered zone in the hard rock granite of both the idb and ltb the fluoride concentration in the well water depended on the well yield potential the results suggest that as the physical weathering progresses the well yield potential increases but the fluoride concentration in groundwater increases since weathering process also triggers the leaching of fluoride from minerals due to increased contact area between water and rock considering the phenomena described in 1 the inconvenient environment is also induced that not only does the reservoir expand because of the progression of physical weathering but it also increases the fluoride content in the reservoir s groundwater 3 in the fractured zone in the hard rock granite of both the idb and ltb the fluoride concentration in the well water tended to decrease as the electrical logging resistivity decreased however in the idb the fluoride concentration did not depend on the well yield potential while in the ltb the fluoride concentration tended to decrease as the well yield potential increased therefore in the fractured zone in the idb a mechanism will be possible that increased residence time or flow length from the recharge zone through the fractured zone to the pumping screen enhances fluoride leaching based on the trend that the fluoride concentration increases with the water strike depth regardless of the amount of well yield potential however the mechanism is not applicable to the fractured zone of the ltb 4 in the fractured zone along the fault systems in the ltb the fluoride concentration in the well water decreased as the water strike depth increased as the water strike depth increased fluoride in groundwater is affected by groundwater flowing from a distance through the fault system regional groundwater flow the results suggest that the difference in the fluoride concentration in the well water between the ne sw fault system and the nw se fault system depends on the groundwater fluoride concentration on the extension of the faults and lineaments considering the above groundwater resources with a geogenic low fluoride concentration will be found in the low electrical resistivity area of the fractured zone along faults and lineaments in the ltb and idb the findings of this study will be useful for the identification of groundwater resources with low fluoride

3152,in this research the main flow behaviors in the meandering compound channels with different densities of two side blocks on the floodplains were investigated by using laboratory experiments at the three relative depths of 0 29 0 39 and 0 49 and the corresponding discharges the results show that the blocks density on the floodplain has a significant effect on the flow behavior in the main channel so that the smooth channel efficiently conveys 100 more water on average than that conveyed in the case with maximum blocks density for the case with smooth floodplains the qmc q ratios of main channel discharge to total discharge increases continuously by reducing the flow depth reaching 47 for dr 0 29 dr is the relative depth by contrast qmc q in the channel with maximum blocks density peaks at 70 50 showing that the main channel controls the capacity of compound channel conveyance because the blocks occupy most of the cross sectional area of the floodplain when dr 0 29 in cases with blocks densities of 6 2 and less in floodplain the manning n decreases by increasing the relative depth dr in cases with blocks densities of 9 7 and 23 7 the manning n increases by increment the relative depth in addition in cross over sections of the case with smooth floodplains a steep gradient of velocity in the vertical direction appears from the dense contour lines around the bankfull level near the right hand sidewall indicating that a considerable effect occurs from the upstream flow instead for channel with maximum blocks density an apparent lateral velocity gradient was located in the central region in cross over sections the maximum shear stress of the bed at the apex section for all channels occurs near the convex side and the amount of bed shear stress at all sections decreases with reducing the relative depth in the cross over sections due to the increase of the flow angle between the main channel and the floodplain the effect of the

the evidences show that 53 large floods occurred from 2003 to 2008 has affected more than 1 800 cities in 40 countries around the world a part of the problem is that many cities were originally built near rivers and coastlines in other words 860 million people live in flood prone urban areas worldwide kocornik mina et al 2020 most natural rivers consist of a meandering main channel and one or two corresponding floodplains those rivers are named as meandering compound channels when the discharge is low the current flows in the main channel only while during a flood the water surface level exceeds the main channel and the flow enters to the floodplains which convey the extra flow at the downstream the flow characteristics in a curved compound channel are different from those in the straight channel one liu et al 2014 because of a considerable variation in roughness flow depth and cross sectional shapes a large velocity difference appears between the main channel and floodplain inducing a significant lateral momentum exchange from the main channel to the floodplains ismail 2007 this generates a complicated flow structure and enhances bed shear stresses in the mixing regions and decreases the conveyance capacity of the channel shiono and muto 1998 in addition the water flowing in the floodplains passes over the water flowing in the main channel which results in more interaction and exchange between the main channel and floodplains in a meandering compound channel the effects of centrifugal force and upstream floodplain flow causes to strengthen the secondary flow in the meandering main channel which may affect lateral sediment transport and longitudinal bed morphology shiono and muto 1998 and liu et al 2014 especially the flood flows experience extreme variations by passing through the urban rivers that surrounded by the buildings such as urban and rural residential houses recreational and tourist camps located in the floodplains for example lyness et al 2001 compared the flow behavior in straight and meandering channels with similar geometries floodplain roughness and mobile main channel bed material they reported that the meandering compound channel with roughened floodplains shows a large scour area at bend apexes and deposition at crossovers also the findings of ibrahim et al 2019 showed that sedimentation increased by 45 while erosion decreased by about 31 because the left hand side lhs riparian zone was roughened by vegetation accordingly it is necessary to evaluate the flood flow structures in the meandering compound channels with different densities of two side blocks on the floodplains to determine sediment transport channel morphology as well as bank erosion in recent decades many researchers have extensively investigated the complex flow mechanism of meandering compound channels using the physical modeling the depth averaged velocity distribution and bed shear stress along with secondary flow cells to achieve turbulent flow structure in meandering compound channels have been developed by many researches findings of toebes and sooky 1967 ervine et al 1993 shiono and muto 1998 spooner 2001 and else indicated that a new secondary flow creates at the exit section of a meander bend gradually expands in the following sections and fully develops at the apex sections also a considerable increase in energy loss may occur under overbank flow conditions that deposition and scour patterns reverse in the meandering compound channels with respect to the straight compound channels sellin and willetts 1996 concluded that the location of maximum velocity in a meandering compound channel occurs near the inner bend above the bankfull level however it moves towards the outer bend and the values reduce findings of shiono and muto 1998 showed that the strong vertical shear layer generated by the floodplain flow crossing over the main channel flow is controlled by the angle between the meandering channel and the floodplain wall and water depth shiono et al 1999 measured boundary shear stress in meandering compound channels for overbank flow by using a preston tube and heated thin film sensor techniques measurements of secondary flow were also carried out by using a lda the distributions of boundary stress and secondary flow cells along the meandering channels for over bank flow show that the locations of peak and dip on the boundary shear stress distribution well correspond to those of the secondary flow downwards and upwards motions respectively knight and macdonald 1979 ishigaki et al 1996 mohammadi 2001 and else measured the boundary shear stress using the preston tube technique and investigated its distribution with respect to an aspect ratio in straight open channels knight et al 1984 measured the boundary shear stress in strong secondary flow regions in a relatively large meandering channel their results indicate that an undulation of the boundary shear stress distribution is closely related to the secondary flow structure the downwards motion of secondary flow is generally related to larger boundary shear stress on the other hand the upwards motion is related to smaller boundary shear stress khatua and patra 2007 investigated the distribution of shear stress in the main channel and floodplain of meandering and straight compound channels based on the experimental results of boundary shear they predict the distribution of boundary shear carried by main channel and floodplain sub sections five dimensionless parameters are used to form equations representing the total shear force percentage carried by floodplains furthermore the turbulent transfer is also an important phenomenon in compound channels and based on the results of studies shiono and muto 1998 shukla and shiono 2008 moncho esteve et al 2018 vojoudi mehrabani et al 2020 the turbulence intensity in the meandering channel is more than straight channel and its maximum value occurs at the junction of main channel and floodplain in the inner bend wang et al 2007 theoretically derived the expression of momentum transfer coefficient under the boussinesq assumption and through analyzing the characteristics of velocity distribution in the interacting region between the main channel and its associated flood plain in natural rivers vegetation often presents in the floodplain areas and influences on the flow structures the presence of floodplain roughness e g grass verdure canebrake shrubbery bramble etc increases flow resistance on the floodplain and reduces the flow velocity and thus affect the river system indeed laboratory researches were performed in the curved channels with fixed mobile bed and floodplain roughness according to those studies on vegetation the drag force due to rigid vegetation depends mainly on geometry displacement and roughness density for instance james et al 2001 concluded that vegetation can increase resistance through stem drag but may also decrease resistance by reducing separation at tight bends jarvela 2002 studied how the type density and placement of vegetation influence flow resistance as vegetation density increases the velocity difference between vegetated and non vegetated areas increases tsujimoto 1992 in a straight compound channel the maximum velocity point moves to the rightward in the main channel the opposite side of the floodplain edge as the vegetation density increases in the floodplain lateral displacement is caused by secondary currents in the main channel which increase in strength as the vegetation density increases in the floodplain kang and choi 2006 cao et al 2006 presented new formulations for flow resistance and momentum flux in compound channels as implemented in the st venant equation those formulations facilitate a physically enhanced approach to evaluating conveyance roughness stage discharge relationship and unsteady flood routing in compound channels ismail 2007 and ismail and shiono 2008 conducted laboratory experiments in a meandering channel with simulated non vegetated and vegetated floodplains to investigate how the density and arrangement of floodplain vegetation influence the stage discharge relation flow resistance and sediment transport as the floodplain roughness increases multiple secondary currents occur along the meandering channel at deeper water depths these currents also create a series of wavy bed forms along the meandering channel shiono et al 2009 nayak et al 2009 made an investigation concerning the variation of roughness coefficients for simple meandering channels with slope sinuosity and geometry the loss of energy in terms of manning s n chezy s c and darcy weisbach coefficient f were evaluated by them sanjou and nezu 2010 investigated the impacts of trees and shrubs in floodplain edge in natural rivers on hydrodynamic characteristics they found that in particular spanwise profile of streamwise velocity component is influenced by the drag force of the trees and consequently the streamwise velocity decreases locally behind trees and near the junction between the main channel and the floodplain yang 2010 derived equations of the depth averaged shear stress in typical open channels based on a theoretical relation between the depth averaged shear stress or depth averaged velocity and boundary shear stress equation of depth mean velocity in a rough channel is also obtained and the effects of water surface or dip phenomenon and roughness are included experimental data available in the literature used for verification which shows that the model reasonably agrees with the measured data camporeale and ridolfi 2010 found that the increment of vegetation biomass is not simply equal to the increment of the river length based on an artificial neural network ann model liu and james 2000 used flow depth vegetation density channel sinuosity transverse floodplain slope and floodplain bend tightness to successfully describe the discharge in meandering compound channels liu et al 2016 found that the existence of flexible grass in the floodplain increased the streamwise velocity and conveyance in the main channel along a meander in the vegetated floodplain the secondary flow at the apex section was generally stronger than those of the smooth cases although it is weaker near the middle cross over section shan et al 2018 predicted depth averaged flow angle along a bend in smooth and vegetated meandering compound channel their results showed that with the presence of vegetation in the floodplain the height of the secondary flow cell in the main channel increases and the flow direction angle depends on the height of the secondary flow cell pan et al 2019 examined the velocity distribution characteristics in meandering compound channels with one sided vegetated floodplains the results showed that the flow velocity in the section with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain is higher than the section with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain the deflection degrees near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are smaller than those no blocks in floodplains condition by contrast the deflection degrees near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain are obviously larger than the corresponding values under smooth floodplain conditions near the bending apexes the longitudinal depth averaged velocities are higher close to the main channel convex side and lower adjacent to the concave side due to the formation of most cities and villages along rivers and the construction of buildings in their floodplains in times of floods the flow pattern of rivers always changes so it seems necessary to study the interaction of flood currents in meandering compound channels for these areas in this research using laboratory experiments the flow behavior in the meandering compound channels with smooth and blocks floodplains has been investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental methods the experiments were performed in a 16 m long 2 07 m wide and 0 4 m high flume at the research laboratory of hydraulics and river engineering urmia university iran fig 1 to investigate the effect of floodplain buildings on the flow characteristics of main channel 18 runs were conducted in meandering compound channel with different densities of buildings located on the floodplain six channels with different blocks densities at three different relative depths fig 1 shows the channels with different blocks densities in this study non submerged blocks with a square cross section 10 cm 10 cm are used to model the blocks density to measure the flow discharge a rectangular weir was installed at the end of flume the stage discharge curves in the channel were measured for a range of relative flow depths dr h h h where h was the flow depth and h 0 1 m was the bankfull height the shape of the main channel was rectangular and based on the sinuosity s of natural rivers s 1 21 was used in this meandering main channel fig 2 the total width of compound channel was b 2 07 m and the main channel width was b 0 5 m consequently an aspect ratio b h was equal to 5 fig 3 the bottom longitudinal slope of the flume was s0 0 001 the flume was constructed of concrete and bed surface of the main channel and floodplain

the smooth floodplain according to fig 2 the flow direction in the meandering main channel is parallel with the wall of the main channel therefore the direction along the meander main channel wall was defined as the streamwise coordinate x and that perpendicular to x as the lateral coordinate y the aims of this research were to examine the effect of density of the floodplain blocks on the change of flow characteristics in the main channel therefore no measurements were carried out on the floodplain it is noting that due to locating blocks on the floodplain especially in the high density and shallow water on the floodplain 4 1 9 5 cm an accurate measurement of flow parameters was not possible in the floodplain ismail 2007 all experimental data were recorded at cs1 to cs7 perpendicular to the primary flow direction in the main channel in the meandering main channel 11 vertical measurement lines were arranged and separated by a lateral interval of 4 5 cm from the left hand wall y 0 m to the right hand wall y 0 5 m these measurement lines in cs1 7 were numbered sequentially from 1 to 11 fig 2 also identical measurement intervals of 1 5 cm between two vertical points were also defined in the main channel fig 2 2 2 calculation methods of hydraulic parameters although there are various ways to determine bed and wall shear stress preston tube method as an indirect estimate is mainly used for laboratorial observations in this study measurements of local boundary shear stress were taken using a preston tube having a 3 mm outer diameter a preston tube consists of two isolated tubes the static tube and a dynamic tube the static tube was fixed in the bottom of the channel and measured by measuring the pressure due to the static head of the flow the dynamic tube was placed within the boundary shear layer facing into the flow and measured the dynamic pressure head for measuring local shear stress on smooth boundaries preston 1954 extended a simple method using a pitot tube in contact with the surface his technique was based on the assumption of an inner law relating the boundary shear stress to the velocity distribution near the wall preston suggested a non dimensional equation between the preston tube differential pressure δp and the boundary shear stress τ0 of the form 2 τ 0 d 2 4 ρ ϑ 2 f δ p d 2 4 ρ ϑ 2 where d is the outer diameter of the preston tube υ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid ρ is the mass density of the fluid and f is an empirical function patel 1965 further developed the studies and his calibration as two dimensionless parameters x and y are used to convert pressure measurements to boundary shear stress where 3 x l o g δ p d 2 4 ρ ϑ 2 4 y l o g τ 0 d 2 4 ρ ϑ 2 in the form y 0 5 x 0 037 for y 1 5 y 0 8287 0 1381 x 0 1437 x 2 0 006 x 3

preston tube d and the kinematic viscosity and mass density of the fluid the dimensionless parameters x is calculated then the dimensionless parameters y is calculated if the assumptions of eqs 5 7 satisfy value of y is acceptable and then bed shear stress is calculated based on the y patel 1965 in this study measurements of the velocity distribution were done using an l3 mm diameter miniature

between the stage and discharge for rivers or floodplains which are called the stage discharge curves or rating curves is very important stage discharge curves are usually found by collecting data from gauges along the channel the stage discharge curves are critical for flood forecasting because they convert discharge at a certain point into stage values for issuing public forecasts fig 4 gives the stage discharge relations of the compound channel under the conditions of without and with blocks in floodplains according to fig 4a the discharge increases by increasing the flow depth both in without and with blocks in floodplains and the additional resistance produced by the model blocks has the most significant effect on discharge capacity of the compound channel when dr is large and a slight change in discharge causes a significant change in the dr fig 4b the discharge increases by rising flow depth in two distinct phases in smooth and block channels the first phase corresponds to dr 0 36 where steep inclines are observed whereas in the second phase dr 0 36 the discharge increases slowly by rising flow depth it can be seen that the stage discharge curve grows almost linearly for the relative depths 0 36 dr 0 36 those results are in good agreement with the finding of shiono et al 2009 liu et al 2016 and pan et al 2019 at low relative depths dr 0 36 the main source of flow resistance is the bed roughness of the floodplains skin friction with increasing relative depth dr 0 36 the effect of floodplain bed roughness on flow resistance decreases and the resistance is mainly due to buildings blocks located in floodplains including drag force around buildings due to acceleration deceleration and blocks wakes ismail 2007 comparing the smooth and roughened floodplain cases shows that the rate of divergence between the smooth and blocks floodplains is significant by increasing the density of the buildings the slope of inclines increases and the conveyance efficiency reduces at higher flow stages the higher stages with the greater densities for a given discharge due to blocks in floodplains condition the dr is larger than that of no blocks in the floodplains in case mbt mft it can be clearly seen that the stage becomes higher at the same flow discharge when the blocks density increases the channel without blocks is more efficient for conveying water i e conveying 100 more water on average than that conveyed in the channel with maximum blocks density mft shiono et al 2009 and liu et al 2016 reported that the smooth channel is conveying 50 and 30 respectively more water on average than that conveyed in the channel with submerged floodplain grass this shows that the additional resistance produced by the blocks in the floodplain has the greatest effect on the overall conveyance by increasing the water depth and the slight change in the discharge causes a significant change in dr therefore in terms of blocks floodplain roughness is a dominant factor attributed to the overall discharge conveyance ismail 2007 reported that a lower density of apex blocks convey water with greater efficiency compared to higher densities also as the block density increases the stage at the same discharge rate increases fig 5 shows the ratios of main channel discharge to total discharge qmc q both with and without blocks in floodplains the presence of blocks in floodplains significantly enhances the ratio of qmc q the largest main channel discharge always occurs at the apex whereas the smallest is often located near the middle cross over sections the main reason is that the processes of the upstream floodplain fluid towards the apex sections are dominated by the inertia effects and their transverse diffusions are retarded by the main channel flow which causes upstream floodplain fluid to converge at the apex sections also in the cross over sections due to the increase of the flow angle between the direction of the upstream floodplain flow and the edge of the meandering main channel the effect of the horizontal component of the floodplain flow ufp y ufpsinθ on the main channel is greater thus the secondary flow increases and the main channel discharge decreases the difference between the values of qmc q at the apex and cross over sections decreases considerably by decreasing dr whereas the values of qmc along a meander remain identical in bankfull and inbank cases i e dr 0 and the ratios of qmc q decrease as dr increases the sub area discharge directly reflects the effect of the blocks on the main channel conveyance capacity fig 6 shows ratio of the main channel discharge qmc or floodplain discharge qfp to the total discharge q for different densities of the floodplain blocks at three relative depths st is the percentage of density of the floodplain blocks for a given relative depth as density of the floodplain blocks increases ratio of the main channel discharge qmc to the total discharge q increases and discharge conveyance capacity of the floodplains is reduced also for a given block density with the increase of the relative depth the values of qmc q decrease and the values of qfp q increase the main channel conveys more water in the blocks runs than in no blocks runs however an identical flow discharge q in the roughened case is less than that with no blocks case for example at a large medium and small flow depths i e dr 0 49 0 39 0 29 qmc q is 33 39 and 47 in mat1 mat2 and mat3 indicating that the floodplain dominates the channel conveyance capability because qmc q 50 for the case of no blocks mat qmc q increases steadily by decreasing flow depth reaching 47 for dr 0 29 by increasing the water depth in the smooth case upstream floodplain flow passing over the main channel is strengthened and the secondary flow is enhanced significantly in the meandering main channel therefore the conveyance capability of main channel decreases by increasing the water depth liu et al 2016 by contrast qmc q in mft3 st 23 7 peaks at 70 50 indicating that the main channel controls the conveyance capacity of the compound channel because the blocks occupy most of the cross sectional area of the floodplain when dr 0 29 therefore water tends to flow downstream in the meandering main channel 3 2 resistance analysis the study of resistance due to the flow is very important in open channels much effort has been expanded by many researchers to develop means and formulae for calculating the relationship between different flow characteristics and the channel geometries the aim of this section is to relate the flow depth to the resistance coefficients for different densities of blocks in floodplains that is important in this study because of the distribution of density of the obstructions used in the floodplain to model the blocks or else constructed in the floodplains the most widely used formula for the calculation of velocity is manning s n resistance equation for this study it is very important to have a respectable understanding of manning s n in order to understand the effects caused by the presence of blocks this equation has proved most reliable in practice although it is applicable only in the fully rough zone henderson 1966 pointed out that manning s n is suitable for all fully rough flows as well as transitional flows the variation of manning s n in a meandering compound channel versus dr is shown plotted in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 by increasing the density of obstacles in the floodplain the amount of manning s n increases also for the case of no blocks mat the values of n in the floodplain decreases by increasing dr this is because by increasing dr the effect of floodplain bed roughness decreases in case of blocks mbt mct and mdt with densities of 6 2 and less in floodplain n values decrease by increasing dr but in met and mft cases with blocks densities of 9 7 and 23 7 the manning n increases by increasing dr because in floodplains with a higher blocks density due to the submerged part of the blocks the flow resistance increases at a higher depth also at higher dr the share of flow through the floodplain is high and it is due to the higher density of blocks so the flow resistance increases indeed 3 3 velocities figs 8 and 9 are plot the evolution of dimensionless longitudinal velocities umc um along half a meandering section cs1 7 at small and large flow depths with ratios dr 0 29 and 0 49 for both none and with blocks in floodplains cases herein z h 0 and z h 0 represent the distances above and below the bankfull level respectively as shown in the plotted figures dr and blocks in the floodplains conditions have significant influences on the longitudinal velocity distribution in the meandering main channel according to fig 8 for a low flow depth i e dr 0 29 by blocks densities of 6 2 and less the maximum velocity umc max um appears next to the inner sidewall y h 4 5 in cs1 2 and then it moves laterally to the center right y h 3 4 in cs3 and then moves laterally to the central region and center left y h 1 3 in cs4 and it ultimately occurs next to the corner of the left hand sidewall in cs5 7 for blocks in floodplains cases met3 and mft3 by blocks densities of 9 7 and higher umc max um in the main channel is observed near the corner of the inner sidewall in cs1 and then moves laterally to the center right y h 3 4 in cs2 in section cs3 umc max um occurs at the central region near the channel bed and then moves laterally to the center left y h 1 2 in cs4 and it ultimately occurs next to the corner of left hand sidewall in cs5 7 according to fig 9 for a higher flow depth i e by dr 0 49 in section cs1 the maximum flow velocity umc max um appears next to the inner sidewall y h 4 5 so that by increasing blocks density from 0 to 23 7 the velocity value increases from 1 4 to 2 15 in section cs2 for blocks density of 9 7 and less umc max um in the main channel is observed near the corner of the inner sidewall but for blocks density 23 7 mft1 umc max um occurs at the water surface on the center right y h 3 4 in cs3 section with increasing blocks density the maximum flow velocity in the right corner tends towards the central region near the channel bed so that for blocks density 23 7 mft1 the maximum flow velocity is observed at y h 2 5 and near the channel bed in cs4 section umc max um moves laterally to the central region and center left y h 1 3 and it ultimately umc max um occurs next to the corner of the left hand sidewall in cs5 7 in addition in case cs3 5 for case of no blocks in floodplains mat1 a steep velocity gradient in the vertical direction i e u m c z appears from the dense contour lines around the bankfull level near the right hand sidewall y h 3 5 indicating that a considerable effect occurs from the upstream flow however this phenomenon is not distinct in case mft1 instead there is an apparent lateral velocity gradient i e u m c y located in the central region in cs3 cs5 those dense contour lines in section cs3 cover the right half of the channel and in section cs4 they extend to the center of the channel and finally in section cs5 they cover the entire channel this is due to the blocks density resistance of the floodplain that is similar to the flow patterns experimentally observed by shiono and muto 1998 and liu et al 2016 the change in velocity gradient from vertical to lateral by increasing blocks density for cross over sections cs3 5 where that is clearly shown in fig 9 fig 10 shows the maximum longitudinal velocity in sections cs1 and cs7 relative to the blocks density at dr 0 49 in this figure st is the percentage of blocks density and umc max um is the maximum dimensionless longitudinal velocity in each section as shown in fig 10 in sections cs1 and cs7 the maximum flow velocity increases by increasing blocks density fig 11 shows the changes in flow velocity in the main channel for different blocks densities compared to the case of no blocks in floodplains mat in this figure ɛ is the percentage change in flow velocity in the blocks case compared to the no blocks in floodplains for a higher flow depth e g dr 0 49 in the test meander cs1 7 umc um in the blocks case mft1 is 61 greater than that of no blocks case mat1 as shown in fig 11 again according to fig 11 dr variation has little effects on the flow velocity in low density blocks cases and only in a case mft with dr increase from 0 29 to 0 49 the flow velocity increases by 25 3 4 bed shear stress in natural rivers the bed shear stress is important for determining the bed erosion and the sediment transport shan et al 2016 measurement of shear stress in a meandering compound channel flow helps in aspiring knowledge about shear bed load transport momentum transfer channel migration etc this section therefore presents the bed shear stress as an application of the initial step in the erosion processes fig 12 shows the distribution of the bed shear stress for six channels with different blocks densities at three different relative depths as shown in this figure the amount of bed shear stress in all sections decreases by decreasing dr according to fig 12 at three relative depths the maximum shear stress at cs1 2 sections for all blocks densities occurs near the convex side right wall in section cs3 the maximum shear stress moves from the convex side to the center and in cs4 section the maximum shear stress appears in the central area of the main channel in sections cs5 6 the maximum shear stress moves from the center to the left wall and finally for section cs7 the maximum shear stress occurs near the left wall convex side in section cs1 the amount of bed shear stress decreases with increasing blocks density to 6 2 in mdt and then increases with increasing blocks density in sections cs2 3 for the case with maximum blocks density in floodplains mft the amount of bed shear stress is higher than the other cases in sections cs4 5 6 by increasing blocks density the bed shear stress decreases in all cases except mft in section cs7 for the case with maximum blocks density in floodplain mft the amount of bed shear stress is higher than other cases in all cases the shear stress decreases by decreasing dr and flow velocity in sections cs1 and cs7 due to the symmetrical flow condition in a meandering compound channel the shear stress distribution is symmetric 3 5 darcy weisbach friction factor coefficient f as it is found by mohammadi 1998 and else the amount of friction factor f is more sensitive than the other resistance coefficients e g manning s n so the evaluation of f gives more resistance definitions fig 13 shows the darcy wiesbach friction coefficient f for the main channel at different sections due to changes in blocks density for dr 0 49 it can be seen from this figure the values of f increases by increasing blocks density in floodplains so that most changes occur in the cross over sections i e cs3 4 5 as the blocks density increases the flow resistance increases and then the flow velocity decreases thus the darcy wiesbach f increasing anyway in cross over sections due to increasing the flow angle between main channel and floodplain the effect of secondary flow is stronger and the flow velocity decreases some more so that the darcy wiesbach f increases more in this area 4 conclusions in this research a series of laboratory experiments were conducted in a meandering compound channel with and without blocks in floodplains detailed measurements were acquired in 7 sections along half a meandering channel for low medium and high relative depths i e dr 0 29 0 39 0 49 respectively the findings in this research help readers to understand the direct impacts of blocks in floodplains on the hydraulics characteristics in a meandering channel main conclusions are drawn as 1 the smooth channel efficiently conveys 100 more water on average than that conveyed in the case with maximum building density st 23 7 2 the discharge increases by rising flow depth in two distinct phases in smooth and block channels the first phase corresponds to dr 0 36 where steep inclines are observed whereas in the second phase dr 0 36 the discharge increases slowly by rising flow depth it can be seen that the stage discharge curve grows linearly for the relative depths 0 36 dr 0 36 by increasing the density of the buildings the slope of inclines increases and the conveyance efficiency reduces at higher flow stages the higher stages with the greater densities 3 at low relative depths dr 0 36 the main source of flow resistance is the bed roughness of the floodplains skin friction with increasing relative depth dr 0 36 the effect of floodplain bed roughness on flow resistance decreases and the resistance is mainly due to buildings blocks located in floodplains including drag force around buildings due to acceleration deceleration and blocks wakes ismail 2007 4 the presence of blocks in floodplains significantly enhances the ratio of main channel discharge to total discharge qmc q the largest main channel discharge always occurs at the apex whereas the smallest one is often located near the mid cross over sections 5 for a given relative depth as density of the floodplain blocks increases ratio of the main channel discharge qmc to the total discharge q increases and discharge conveyance capacity of the floodplains is reduced 6 by increasing the density of blocks in floodplains the amount of manning s n increases for the case of no blocks in floodplains mat the n values in the floodplain decreases by increasing dr in case of blocks in floodplains with blocks densities of 6 2 and less the values of n decrease by increasing dr but in cases met and mft with blocks densities of 9 7 and 23 7 the n values increase by increasing dr 7 in the cross over sections i e cs3 5 for no blocks in floodplains steep velocity gradients in the vertical direction appear from the dense contour lines around the bankfull level near the right hand sidewall indicating that a considerable effect occurs from the upstream flow instead for a channel with maximum blocks density an apparent lateral velocity gradient located in the central region in cs3 cs5 sections those dense contour lines in the cs3 section cover the right half of the channel and in section cs4 they extend to the center of the channel and finally in section cs5 they cover the entire channel section 8 the maximum amount of bed shear stress at the apex section for all channel sections occurs near the convex side and it decreases at all sections by decreasing dr 9 in the cross over sections due to the increase of the flow angle between main channel and floodplain the effect of secondary flow sells is stronger and the flow velocity decreases some more by the way the darcy wiesbach f increases more in this area 5 ethics approval consent to participate consent for publication the authors confirm that

3152,in this research the main flow behaviors in the meandering compound channels with different densities of two side blocks on the floodplains were investigated by using laboratory experiments at the three relative depths of 0 29 0 39 and 0 49 and the corresponding discharges the results show that the blocks density on the floodplain has a significant effect on the flow behavior in the main channel so that the smooth channel efficiently conveys 100 more water on average than that conveyed in the case with maximum blocks density for the case with smooth floodplains the qmc q ratios of main channel discharge to total discharge increases continuously by reducing the flow depth reaching 47 for dr 0 29 dr is the relative depth by contrast qmc q in the channel with maximum blocks density peaks at 70 50 showing that the main channel controls the capacity of compound channel conveyance because the blocks occupy most of the cross sectional area of the floodplain when dr 0 29 in cases with blocks densities of 6 2 and less in floodplain the manning n decreases by increasing the relative depth dr in cases with blocks densities of 9 7 and 23 7 the manning n increases by increment the relative depth in addition in cross over sections of the case with smooth floodplains a steep gradient of velocity in the vertical direction appears from the dense contour lines around the bankfull level near the right hand sidewall indicating that a considerable effect occurs from the upstream flow instead for channel with maximum blocks density an apparent lateral velocity gradient was located in the central region in cross over sections the maximum shear stress of the bed at the apex section for all channels occurs near the convex side and the amount of bed shear stress at all sections decreases with reducing the relative depth in the cross over sections due to the increase of the flow angle between the main channel and the floodplain the effect of the secondary flow is stronger and the flow velocity decreases more so the darcy weisbach coefficient increases more in this area keywords meandering compound channel blocks density discharge manning

the evidences show that 53 large floods occurred from 2003 to 2008 has affected more than 1 800 cities in 40 countries around the world a part of the problem is that many cities were originally built near rivers and coastlines in other words 860 million people live in flood prone urban areas worldwide kocornik mina et al 2020 most natural rivers consist of a meandering main channel and one or two corresponding floodplains those rivers are named as meandering compound channels when the discharge is low the current flows in the main channel only while during a flood the water surface level exceeds the main channel and the flow enters to the floodplains which convey the extra flow at the downstream the flow characteristics in a curved compound channel are different from those in the straight channel one liu et al 2014 because of a considerable variation in roughness flow depth and cross sectional shapes a large velocity difference appears between the main channel and floodplain inducing a significant lateral momentum exchange from the main channel to the floodplains ismail 2007 this generates a complicated flow structure and enhances bed shear stresses in the mixing regions and decreases the conveyance capacity of the channel shiono and muto 1998 in addition the water flowing in the floodplains passes over the water flowing in the main channel which results in more interaction and exchange between the main channel and floodplains in a meandering compound channel the effects of centrifugal force and upstream floodplain flow causes to strengthen the secondary flow in the meandering main channel which may affect lateral sediment transport and longitudinal bed morphology shiono and muto 1998 and liu et al 2014 especially the flood flows experience extreme variations by passing through the urban rivers that surrounded by the buildings such as urban and rural residential houses recreational and tourist camps located in the floodplains for example lyness et al 2001 compared the flow behavior in straight and meandering channels with similar geometries floodplain roughness and mobile main channel bed material they reported that the meandering compound channel with roughened floodplains shows a large scour area at bend apexes and deposition at crossovers also the findings of ibrahim et al 2019 showed that sedimentation increased by 45 while erosion decreased by about 31 because the left hand side lhs riparian zone was roughened by vegetation accordingly it is necessary to evaluate the flood flow structures in the meandering compound channels with different densities of two side blocks on the floodplains to determine sediment transport channel morphology as well as bank erosion in recent decades many researchers have extensively investigated the complex flow mechanism of meandering compound channels using the physical modeling the depth averaged velocity distribution and bed shear stress along with secondary flow cells to achieve turbulent flow structure in meandering compound channels have been developed by many researches findings of toebes and sooky 1967 ervine et al 1993 shiono and muto 1998 spooner 2001 and else indicated that a new secondary flow creates at the exit section of a meander bend gradually expands in the following sections and fully develops at the apex sections also a considerable increase in energy loss may occur under overbank flow conditions that deposition and scour patterns reverse in the meandering compound channels with respect to the straight compound channels sellin and willetts 1996 concluded that the location of maximum velocity in a meandering compound channel occurs near the inner bend above the bankfull level however it moves towards the outer bend and the values reduce findings of shiono and muto 1998 showed that the strong vertical shear layer generated by the floodplain flow crossing over the main channel flow is controlled by the angle between the meandering channel and the floodplain wall and water depth shiono et al 1999 measured boundary shear stress in meandering compound channels for overbank flow by using a preston tube and heated thin film sensor techniques measurements of secondary flow were also carried out by using a lda the distributions of boundary stress and secondary flow cells along the meandering channels for over bank flow show that the locations of peak and dip on the boundary shear stress distribution well correspond to those of the secondary flow downwards and upwards motions respectively knight and macdonald 1979 ishigaki et al 1996 mohammadi 2001 and else measured the boundary shear stress using the preston tube technique and investigated its distribution with respect to an aspect ratio in straight open channels knight et al 1984 measured the boundary shear stress in strong secondary flow regions in a relatively large meandering channel their results indicate that an undulation of the boundary shear stress distribution is closely related to the secondary flow structure the downwards motion of secondary flow is generally related to larger boundary shear stress on the other hand the upwards motion is related to smaller boundary shear stress khatua and patra 2007 investigated the distribution of shear stress in the main channel and floodplain of meandering and straight compound channels based on the experimental results of boundary shear they predict the distribution of boundary shear carried by main channel and floodplain sub sections five dimensionless parameters are used to form equations representing the total shear force percentage carried by floodplains furthermore the turbulent transfer is also an important phenomenon in compound channels and based on the results of studies shiono and muto 1998 shukla and shiono 2008 moncho esteve et al 2018 vojoudi mehrabani et al 2020 the turbulence intensity in the meandering channel is more than straight channel and its maximum value occurs at the junction of main channel and floodplain in the inner bend wang et al 2007 theoretically derived the expression of momentum transfer coefficient under the boussinesq assumption and through analyzing the characteristics of velocity distribution in the interacting region between the main channel and its associated flood plain in natural rivers vegetation often presents in the floodplain areas and influences on the flow structures the presence of floodplain roughness e g grass verdure canebrake shrubbery bramble etc increases flow resistance on the floodplain and reduces the flow velocity and thus affect the river system indeed laboratory researches were performed in the curved channels with fixed mobile bed and floodplain roughness according to those studies on vegetation the drag force due to rigid vegetation depends mainly on geometry displacement and roughness density for instance james et al 2001 concluded that vegetation can increase resistance through stem drag but may also decrease resistance by reducing separation at tight bends jarvela 2002 studied how the type density and placement of vegetation influence flow resistance as vegetation density increases the velocity difference between vegetated and non vegetated areas increases tsujimoto 1992 in a straight compound channel the maximum velocity point moves to the rightward in the main channel the opposite side of the floodplain edge as the vegetation density increases in the floodplain lateral displacement is caused by secondary currents in the main channel which increase in strength as the vegetation density increases in the floodplain kang and choi 2006 cao et al 2006 presented new formulations for flow resistance and momentum flux in compound channels as implemented in the st venant equation those formulations facilitate a physically enhanced approach to evaluating conveyance roughness stage discharge relationship and unsteady flood routing in compound channels ismail 2007 and ismail and shiono 2008 conducted laboratory experiments in a meandering channel with simulated non vegetated and vegetated floodplains to investigate how the density and arrangement of floodplain vegetation influence the stage discharge relation flow resistance and sediment transport as the floodplain roughness increases multiple secondary currents occur along the meandering channel at deeper water depths these currents also create a series of wavy bed forms along the meandering channel shiono et al 2009 nayak et al 2009 made an investigation concerning the variation of roughness coefficients for simple meandering channels with slope sinuosity and geometry the loss of energy in terms of manning s n chezy s c and darcy weisbach coefficient f were evaluated by them sanjou and nezu 2010 investigated the impacts of trees and shrubs in floodplain edge in natural rivers on hydrodynamic characteristics they found that in particular spanwise profile of streamwise velocity component is influenced by the drag force of the trees and consequently the streamwise velocity decreases locally behind trees and near the junction between the main channel and the floodplain yang 2010 derived equations of the depth averaged shear stress in typical open channels based on a theoretical relation between the depth averaged shear stress or depth averaged velocity and boundary shear stress equation of depth mean velocity in a rough channel is also obtained and the effects of water surface or dip phenomenon and roughness are included experimental data available in the literature used for verification which shows that the model reasonably agrees with the measured data camporeale and ridolfi 2010 found that the increment of vegetation biomass is not simply equal to the increment of the river length based on an artificial neural network ann model liu and james 2000 used flow depth vegetation density channel sinuosity transverse floodplain slope and floodplain bend tightness to successfully describe the discharge in meandering compound channels liu et al 2016 found that the existence of flexible grass in the floodplain increased the streamwise velocity and conveyance in the main channel along a meander in the vegetated floodplain the secondary flow at the apex section was generally stronger than those of the smooth cases although it is weaker near the middle cross over section shan et al 2018 predicted depth averaged flow angle along a bend in smooth and vegetated meandering compound channel their results showed that with the presence of vegetation in the floodplain the height of the secondary flow cell in the main channel increases and the flow direction angle depends on the height of the secondary flow cell pan et al 2019 examined the velocity distribution characteristics in meandering compound channels with one sided vegetated floodplains the results showed that the flow velocity in the section with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain is higher than the section with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain the deflection degrees near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are smaller than those no blocks in floodplains condition by contrast the deflection degrees near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain are obviously larger than the corresponding values under smooth floodplain conditions near the bending apexes the longitudinal depth averaged velocities are higher close to the main channel convex side and lower adjacent to the concave side due to the formation of most cities and villages along rivers and the construction of buildings in their floodplains in times of floods the flow pattern of rivers always changes so it seems necessary to study the interaction of flood currents in meandering compound channels for these areas in this research using laboratory experiments the flow behavior in the meandering compound channels with smooth and blocks floodplains has been investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental methods the experiments were performed in a 16 m long 2 07 m wide and 0 4 m high flume at the research laboratory of hydraulics and river engineering urmia university iran fig 1 to investigate the effect of floodplain buildings on the flow characteristics of main channel 18 runs were conducted in meandering compound channel with different densities of buildings located on the floodplain six channels with different blocks densities at three different relative depths fig 1 shows the channels with different blocks densities in this study non submerged blocks with a square cross section 10 cm 10 cm are used to model the blocks density to measure the flow discharge a rectangular weir was installed at the end of flume the stage discharge curves in the channel were measured for a range of relative flow depths dr h h h where h was the flow depth and h 0 1 m was the bankfull height the shape of the main channel was rectangular and based on the sinuosity s of natural rivers s 1 21 was used in this meandering main channel fig 2 the total width of compound channel was b 2 07 m and the main channel width was b 0 5 m consequently an aspect ratio b h was equal to 5 fig 3 the bottom longitudinal slope of the flume was s0 0 001 the flume was constructed of concrete and bed surface of the main channel and floodplain was smooth the overall manning s coefficient was determined by n 1 u m r 2 3 s 0 1 2 in which um is the average velocity at the apex section q a q was the total discharge and a was the cross sectional area at the bend apex r is the hydraulic radius of the apexes and s0 is the bottom longitudinal slope of the flume a summary of the experimental parameters is presented in table 1 in table 1 st fr and re are the percentage of floodplain blocks density froude number and reynolds number respectively all experiments were run under a steady uniform flow condition and uniform flow was controlled manually by adjustable tailgate at the downstream end of the flume also all data were acquired under the fully developed turbulent flow conditions re 6900 31000 an average relative error value ɛ as eq

measured data e g streamwise velocity umc in the main channel for the blocks and smooth cases respectively index st is the percentage of density of the floodplain blocks and index s is the case with the smooth floodplain according to fig 2 the flow direction in the meandering main channel is parallel with the wall of the main channel therefore the direction along the meander main channel wall was defined as the streamwise coordinate x and that perpendicular to x as the lateral coordinate y the aims of this research were to examine the effect of density of the floodplain blocks on the change of flow characteristics in the main channel therefore no measurements were carried out on the floodplain it is noting that due to locating blocks on the floodplain especially in the high density and shallow water on the floodplain 4 1 9 5 cm an accurate measurement of flow parameters was not possible in the floodplain ismail 2007 all experimental data were recorded at cs1 to cs7 perpendicular to the primary flow direction in the main channel in the meandering main channel 11 vertical measurement lines were arranged and separated by a lateral interval of 4 5 cm from the left hand wall y 0 m to the right hand wall y 0 5 m these measurement lines in cs1 7 were numbered sequentially from 1 to 11 fig 2 also identical measurement intervals of 1 5 cm between two vertical points were also defined in the main channel fig 2 2 2 calculation methods of hydraulic parameters although there are various ways to determine bed and wall shear stress preston tube method as an indirect estimate is mainly used for laboratorial observations in this study measurements of local boundary shear stress were taken using a preston tube having a 3 mm outer diameter a preston tube consists of two isolated tubes the static tube and a dynamic tube the static tube was fixed in the bottom of the channel and measured by measuring the pressure due to the static head of the flow the dynamic tube was placed within the boundary shear layer facing into the flow and measured the dynamic pressure head for measuring local shear stress on smooth boundaries preston 1954 extended a simple method using a pitot tube in contact with the surface his technique was based on the assumption of an inner law relating the boundary shear stress to the velocity distribution near the wall preston suggested a non dimensional equation between the preston tube differential pressure δp and the boundary shear stress τ0 of the form 2 τ 0 d 2 4 ρ ϑ 2 f δ p d 2 4 ρ ϑ 2 where d is the outer diameter of the preston tube υ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid ρ is the mass density of the fluid and f is an empirical function patel 1965 further developed the studies and his calibration as two dimensionless parameters x and y are used to convert pressure measurements to boundary shear stress where 3 x l o g δ p d 2 4 ρ ϑ 2 4 y l o g τ 0 d 2 4 ρ ϑ 2 in the form y 0 5 x 0 037 for y 1 5 y 0 8287 0 1381 x 0 1437 x 2 0 006 x 3 for 1 5 y 3 5 x y 2 l o g 1 95 y 4 1 for 3 5 y 5 3 these equations are used to calculate the bed shear stress first according to the preston tube differential pressure δp the outer diameter of the preston tube d and the kinematic viscosity and mass density of the fluid the dimensionless parameters x is calculated then the dimensionless parameters y is calculated if the assumptions of eqs 5 7 satisfy value of y is acceptable and then bed shear stress is calculated based on the y patel 1965 in this study measurements of the velocity distribution were done using an l3 mm diameter miniature propeller current meter depth averaged velocity ud cross sectional average velocity of the main channel umc and main channel discharge qmc are estimated by equations 8 to 10 u d 1 h 0 h u i d z 9 u mc

coefficient f is calculated according to eq 11 11 f 8 τ 0 ρ u d 2 3 results and discussions 3 1 stage discharge curves and main channel discharge capacities accurate estimation of the relationship between the stage and discharge for rivers or floodplains which are called the stage discharge curves or rating curves is very important stage discharge curves are usually found by collecting data from gauges along the channel the stage discharge curves are critical for flood forecasting because they convert discharge at a certain point into stage values for issuing public forecasts fig 4 gives the stage discharge relations of the compound channel under the conditions of without and with blocks in floodplains according to fig 4a the discharge increases by increasing the flow depth both in without and with blocks in floodplains and the additional resistance produced by the model blocks has the most significant effect on discharge capacity of the compound channel when dr is large and a slight change in discharge causes a significant change in the dr fig 4b the discharge increases by rising flow depth in two distinct phases in smooth and block channels the first phase corresponds to dr 0 36 where steep inclines are observed whereas in the second phase dr 0 36 the discharge increases slowly by rising flow depth it can be seen that the stage discharge curve grows almost linearly for the relative depths 0 36 dr 0 36 those results are in good agreement with the finding of shiono et al 2009 liu et al 2016 and pan et al 2019 at low relative depths dr 0 36 the main source of flow resistance is the bed roughness of the floodplains skin friction with increasing relative depth dr 0 36 the effect of floodplain bed roughness on flow resistance decreases and the resistance is mainly due to buildings blocks located in floodplains including drag force around buildings due to acceleration deceleration and blocks wakes ismail 2007 comparing the smooth and roughened floodplain cases shows that the rate of divergence between the smooth and blocks floodplains is significant by increasing the density of the buildings the slope of inclines increases and the conveyance efficiency reduces at higher flow stages the higher stages with the greater densities for a given discharge due to blocks in floodplains condition the dr is larger than that of no blocks in the floodplains in case mbt mft it can be clearly seen that the stage becomes higher at the same flow discharge when the blocks density increases the channel without blocks is more efficient for conveying water i e conveying 100 more water on average than that conveyed in the channel with maximum blocks density mft shiono et al 2009 and liu et al 2016 reported that the smooth channel is conveying 50 and 30 respectively more water on average than that conveyed in the channel with submerged floodplain grass this shows that the additional resistance produced by the blocks in the floodplain has the greatest effect on the overall conveyance by increasing the water depth and the slight change in the discharge causes a significant change in dr therefore in terms of blocks floodplain roughness is a dominant factor attributed to the overall discharge conveyance ismail 2007 reported that a lower density of apex blocks convey water with greater efficiency compared to higher densities also as the block density increases the stage at the same discharge rate increases fig 5 shows the ratios of main channel discharge to total discharge qmc q both with and without blocks in floodplains the presence of blocks in floodplains significantly enhances the ratio of qmc q the largest main channel discharge always occurs at the apex whereas the smallest is often located near the middle cross over sections the main reason is that the processes of the upstream floodplain fluid towards the apex sections are dominated by the inertia effects and their transverse diffusions are retarded by the main channel flow which causes upstream floodplain fluid to converge at the apex sections also in the cross over sections due to the increase of the flow angle between the direction of the upstream floodplain flow and the edge of the meandering main channel the effect of the horizontal component of the floodplain flow ufp y ufpsinθ on the main channel is greater thus the secondary flow increases and the main channel discharge decreases the difference between the values of qmc q at the apex and cross over sections decreases considerably by decreasing dr whereas the values of qmc along a meander remain identical in bankfull and inbank cases i e dr 0 and the ratios of qmc q decrease as dr increases the sub area discharge directly reflects the effect of the blocks on the main channel conveyance capacity fig 6 shows ratio of the main channel discharge qmc or floodplain discharge qfp to the total discharge q for different densities of the floodplain blocks at three relative depths st is the percentage of density of the floodplain blocks for a given relative depth as density of the floodplain blocks increases ratio of the main channel discharge qmc to the total discharge q increases and discharge conveyance capacity of the floodplains is reduced also for a given block density with the increase of the relative depth the values of qmc q decrease and the values of qfp q increase the main channel conveys more water in the blocks runs than in no blocks runs however an identical flow discharge q in the roughened case is less than that with no blocks case for example at a large medium and small flow depths i e dr 0 49 0 39 0 29 qmc q is 33 39 and 47 in mat1 mat2 and mat3 indicating that the floodplain dominates the channel conveyance capability because qmc q 50 for the case of no blocks mat qmc q increases steadily by decreasing flow depth reaching 47 for dr 0 29 by increasing the water depth in the smooth case upstream floodplain flow passing over the main channel is strengthened and the secondary flow is enhanced significantly in the meandering main channel therefore the conveyance capability of main channel decreases by increasing the water depth liu et al 2016 by contrast qmc q in mft3 st 23 7 peaks at 70 50 indicating that the main channel controls the conveyance capacity of the compound channel because the blocks occupy most of the cross sectional area of the floodplain when dr 0 29 therefore water tends to flow downstream in the meandering main channel 3 2 resistance analysis the study of resistance due to the flow is very important in open channels much effort has been expanded by many researchers to develop means and formulae for calculating the relationship between different flow characteristics and the channel geometries the aim of this section is to relate the flow depth to the resistance coefficients for different densities of blocks in floodplains that is important in this study because of the distribution of density of the obstructions used in the floodplain to model the blocks or else constructed in the floodplains the most widely used formula for the calculation of velocity is manning s n resistance equation for this study it is very important to have a respectable understanding of manning s n in order to understand the effects caused by the presence of blocks this equation has proved most reliable in practice although it is applicable only in the fully rough zone henderson 1966 pointed out that manning s n is suitable for all fully rough flows as well as transitional flows the variation of manning s n in a meandering compound channel versus dr is shown plotted in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 by increasing the density of obstacles in the floodplain the amount of manning s n increases also for the case of no blocks mat the values of n in the floodplain decreases by increasing dr this is because by increasing dr the effect of floodplain bed roughness decreases in case of blocks mbt mct and mdt with densities of 6 2 and less in floodplain n values decrease by increasing dr but in met and mft cases with blocks densities of 9 7 and 23 7 the manning n increases by increasing dr because in floodplains with a higher blocks density due to the submerged part of the blocks the flow resistance increases at a higher depth also at higher dr the share of flow through the floodplain is high and it is due to the higher density of blocks so the flow resistance increases indeed 3 3 velocities figs 8 and 9 are plot the evolution of dimensionless longitudinal velocities umc um along half a meandering section cs1 7 at small and large flow depths with ratios dr 0 29 and 0 49 for both none and with blocks in floodplains cases herein z h 0 and z h 0 represent the distances above and below the bankfull level respectively as shown in the plotted figures dr and blocks in the floodplains conditions have significant influences on the longitudinal velocity distribution in the meandering main channel according to fig 8 for a low flow depth i e dr 0 29 by blocks densities of 6 2 and less the maximum velocity umc max um appears next to the inner sidewall y h 4 5 in cs1 2 and then it moves laterally to the center right y h 3 4 in cs3 and then moves laterally to the central region and center left y h 1 3 in cs4 and it ultimately occurs next to the corner of the left hand sidewall in cs5 7 for blocks in floodplains cases met3 and mft3 by blocks densities of 9 7 and higher umc max um in the main channel is observed near the corner of the inner sidewall in cs1 and then moves laterally to the center right y h 3 4 in cs2 in section cs3 umc max um occurs at the central region near the channel bed and then moves laterally to the center left y h 1 2 in cs4 and it ultimately occurs next to the corner of left hand sidewall in cs5 7 according to fig 9 for a higher flow depth i e by dr 0 49 in section cs1 the maximum flow velocity umc max um appears next to the inner sidewall y h 4 5 so that by increasing blocks density from 0 to 23 7 the velocity value increases from 1 4 to 2 15 in section cs2 for blocks density of 9 7 and less umc max um in the main channel is observed near the corner of the inner sidewall but for blocks density 23 7 mft1 umc max um occurs at the water surface on the center right y h 3 4 in cs3 section with increasing blocks density the maximum flow velocity in the right corner tends towards the central region near the channel bed so that for blocks density 23 7 mft1 the maximum flow velocity is observed at y h 2 5 and near the channel bed in cs4 section umc max um moves laterally to the central region and center left y h 1 3 and it ultimately umc max um occurs next to the corner of the left hand sidewall in cs5 7 in addition in case cs3 5 for case of no blocks in floodplains mat1 a steep velocity gradient in the vertical direction i e u m c z appears from the dense contour lines around the bankfull level near the right hand sidewall y h 3 5 indicating that a considerable effect occurs from the upstream flow however this phenomenon is not distinct in case mft1 instead there is an apparent lateral velocity gradient i e u m c y located in the central region in cs3 cs5 those dense contour lines in section cs3 cover the right half of the channel and in section cs4 they extend to the center of the channel and finally in section cs5 they cover the entire channel this is due to the blocks density resistance of the floodplain that is similar to the flow patterns experimentally observed by shiono and muto 1998 and liu et al 2016 the change in velocity gradient from vertical to lateral by increasing blocks density for cross over sections cs3 5 where that is clearly shown in fig 9 fig 10 shows the maximum longitudinal velocity in sections cs1 and cs7 relative to the blocks density at dr 0 49 in this figure st is the percentage of blocks density and umc max um is the maximum dimensionless longitudinal velocity in each section as shown in fig 10 in sections cs1 and cs7 the maximum flow velocity increases by increasing blocks density fig 11 shows the changes in flow velocity in the main channel for different blocks densities compared to the case of no blocks in floodplains mat in this figure ɛ is the percentage change in flow velocity in the blocks case compared to the no blocks in floodplains for a higher flow depth e g dr 0 49 in the test meander cs1 7 umc um in the blocks case mft1 is 61 greater than that of no blocks case mat1 as shown in fig 11 again according to fig 11 dr variation has little effects on the flow velocity in low density blocks cases and only in a case mft with dr increase from 0 29 to 0 49 the flow velocity increases by 25 3 4 bed shear stress in natural rivers the bed shear stress is important for determining the bed erosion and the sediment transport shan et al 2016 measurement of shear stress in a meandering compound channel flow helps in aspiring knowledge about shear bed load transport momentum transfer channel migration etc this section therefore presents the bed shear stress as an application of the initial step in the erosion processes fig 12 shows the distribution of the bed shear stress for six channels with different blocks densities at three different relative depths as shown in this figure the amount of bed shear stress in all sections decreases by decreasing dr according to fig 12 at three relative depths the maximum shear stress at cs1 2 sections for all blocks densities occurs near the convex side right wall in section cs3 the maximum shear stress moves from the convex side to the center and in cs4 section the maximum shear stress appears in the central area of the main channel in sections cs5 6 the maximum shear stress moves from the center to the left wall and finally for section cs7 the maximum shear stress occurs near the left wall convex side in section cs1 the amount of bed shear stress decreases with increasing blocks density to 6 2 in mdt and then increases with increasing blocks density in sections cs2 3 for the case with maximum blocks density in floodplains mft the amount of bed shear stress is higher than the other cases in sections cs4 5 6 by increasing blocks density the bed shear stress decreases in all cases except mft in section cs7 for the case with maximum blocks density in floodplain mft the amount of bed shear stress is higher than other cases in all cases the shear stress decreases by decreasing dr and flow velocity in sections cs1 and cs7 due to the symmetrical flow condition in a meandering compound channel the shear stress distribution is symmetric 3 5 darcy weisbach friction factor coefficient f as it is found by mohammadi 1998 and else the amount of friction factor f is more sensitive than the other resistance coefficients e g manning s n so the evaluation of f gives more resistance definitions fig 13 shows the darcy wiesbach friction coefficient f for the main channel at different sections due to changes in blocks density for dr 0 49 it can be seen from this figure the values of f increases by increasing blocks density in floodplains so that most changes occur in the cross over sections i e cs3 4 5 as the blocks density increases the flow resistance increases and then the flow velocity decreases thus the darcy wiesbach f increasing anyway in cross over sections due to increasing the flow angle between main channel and floodplain the effect of secondary flow is stronger and the flow velocity decreases some more so that the darcy wiesbach f increases more in this area 4 conclusions in this research a series of laboratory experiments were conducted in a meandering compound channel with and without blocks in floodplains detailed measurements were acquired in 7 sections along half a meandering channel for low medium and high relative depths i e dr 0 29 0 39 0 49 respectively the findings in this research help readers to understand the direct impacts of blocks in floodplains on the hydraulics characteristics in a meandering channel main conclusions are drawn as 1 the smooth channel efficiently conveys 100 more water on average than that conveyed in the case with maximum building density st 23 7 2 the discharge increases by rising flow depth in two distinct phases in smooth and block channels the first phase corresponds to dr 0 36 where steep inclines are observed whereas in the second phase dr 0 36 the discharge increases slowly by rising flow depth it can be seen that the stage discharge curve grows linearly for the relative depths 0 36 dr 0 36 by increasing the density of the buildings the slope of inclines increases and the conveyance efficiency reduces at higher flow stages the higher stages with the greater densities 3 at low relative depths dr 0 36 the main source of flow resistance is the bed roughness of the floodplains skin friction with increasing relative depth dr 0 36 the effect of floodplain bed roughness on flow resistance decreases and the resistance is mainly due to buildings blocks located in floodplains including drag force around buildings due to acceleration deceleration and blocks wakes ismail 2007 4 the presence of blocks in floodplains significantly enhances the ratio of main channel discharge to total discharge qmc q the largest main channel discharge always occurs at the apex whereas the smallest one is often located near the mid cross over sections 5 for a given relative depth as density of the floodplain blocks increases ratio of the main channel discharge qmc to the total discharge q increases and discharge conveyance capacity of the floodplains is reduced 6 by increasing the density of blocks in floodplains the amount of manning s n increases for the case of no blocks in floodplains mat the n values in the floodplain decreases by increasing dr in case of blocks in floodplains with blocks densities of 6 2 and less the values of n decrease by increasing dr but in cases met and mft with blocks densities of 9 7 and 23 7 the n values increase by increasing dr 7 in the cross over sections i e cs3 5 for no blocks in floodplains steep velocity gradients in the vertical direction appear from the dense contour lines around the bankfull level near the right hand sidewall indicating that a considerable effect occurs from the upstream flow instead for a channel with maximum blocks density an apparent lateral velocity gradient located in the central region in cs3 cs5 sections those dense contour lines in the cs3 section cover the right half of the channel and in section cs4 they extend to the center of the channel and finally in section cs5 they cover the entire channel section 8 the maximum amount of bed shear stress at the apex section for all channel sections occurs near the convex side and it decreases at all sections by decreasing dr 9 in the cross over sections due to the increase of the flow angle between main channel and floodplain the effect of secondary flow sells is stronger and the flow velocity decreases some more by the way the darcy wiesbach f increases more in this area 5 ethics approval consent to participate consent for publication the authors confirm that

3153,mixed hydraulic barriers is an effective method to control seawater intrusion swi particularly in regions that suffer from water shortages however determining the optimal well locations and rates for injection and abstraction is challenging due to the computational burden resulting from the huge number of calls for the high fidelity hydrogeological simulation model to alleviate this issue we utilized a constrained multi objective bayesian optimization bo approach to optimize rates and locations of the hydraulic barriers to minimize total cost aquifer salinity and salt wedge intrusion length while satisfying regional abstractions with acceptable salinity levels bo is useful for optimizing computationally expensive problems in few iterations by using a surrogate model and an acquisition function despite being an efficient optimization tool the use of bo in the field of coastal aquifer management has not been explored the proposed framework was evaluated on an unconfined aquifer subjected to three management scenarios considering different physical and technical constraints and was benchmarked against the widely used robust nsga ii non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii method the results proved the effectiveness of bo in achieving an optimum mixed hydraulic barriers design in much fewer runs of the variable density aquifer model bo with 350 evaluations yielded comparable results to 4150 evaluations using nsga ii bo solutions were spatially well distributed along the approximated pareto front for the same number of evaluations the hypervolume obtained by bo was larger by 30 based on different scenarios the average amount of water required for abstraction ranged from 1 5 to 25 of that for injection the injection has a significant impact on swi management but the abstracted water provides an alternative source of water a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the optimization problem to illustrate its efficiency by omitting the barriers one at a time and assessing impacts on objective and constraint functions keywords seawater intrusion coastal aquifer management gaussian processes surrogate model hydraulic barriers computationally expensive 1 introduction groundwater is an essential source of freshwater accounting for about 30 1 of the world s available freshwater herrera franco et al 2022 given its relatively stable yield of high quality water groundwater has emerged as a vital water resource to meet domestic industrial agricultural and environmental demands howard 2015 although groundwater is often relatively well protected from pollution poor management has resulted in negative impacts such as declining aquifer heads groundwater quality deterioration lower yields land subsidence and more notably seawater intrusion bachtouli and comte 2019 van ty et al 2021 the literature shows that intensive research has been carried out on how to control swi in aquifers implementing a mixed hydraulic barrier remediation system a combination of negative and positive barriers was proved to be more efficient than single barrier systems in controlling swi ebeling et al 2019 shi et al 2020 however given the complexity of the mixed barrier systems the design of such a system called for evaluating several design parameters including pumping flow rates and positioning abstraction injection wells within an aquifer generally the optimum configuration and rates are found by applying a numerical model that captures the groundwater flow pattern in the area followed by an optimization technique to achieve the best design for a system of wells however building a variable density dependent groundwater flow and mass transport simulation model is computationally expensive asher et al 2015 alternatively recent research studies shifted into using a surrogate model to replace the high fidelity simulation model surrogate models have proven to be able to capture the dynamic behavior of swi at a significantly less computational cost kopsiaftis et al 2019 rajabi and ketabchi 2017 roy and datta 2020 a surrogate model can be defined as a model of the model where it is a statistical data driven model describing the relationship between model adjustable parameters inputs and the response surface of the simulation model outputs wang et al 2014 many response surface approximation techniques have been utilized as surrogate models to replace the high fidelity groundwater simulation models artificial neural network ann gaussian process regression gpr radial basis function rbf polynomials etc although no approximation technique performs best universally and the results rely on many factors such as its structure parameters size of the training set and data sampling method there is a general agreement on the strength of gpr also known as kriging and rbf based optimization frameworks asher et al 2015 jones et al 1998 razavi et al 2012 the gpr model parameters are learned in a bayesian scheme thus predicting unobserved inputs needs to integrate over all parameter values weighted by their probability distribution given the training data accordingly gpr can estimate the uncertainty in the predictions of the surrogate model rasmussen and williams 2006 it considers the deterministic response of the simulation model as a realization of a stochastic process razavi et al 2012 few studies have used gpr as a data driven surrogate model in swi management for example rajabi and ketabchi 2017 used gpr as a surrogate model to replace the 3d density dependent sutra simulation model the trained gpr model was coupled with monte carlo simulation to generate probability distributions of salinity concentrations in the observation wells these probability distributions were passed to the continuous ant colony optimization algorithm to optimize the extraction rates in the wells under constraints related to swi extent kopsiaftis et al 2019 investigated the capacity of substituting the gpr as a surrogate model for variable density models to predict the swi extent the study compared the obtained results with other methods the results proved that gpr was more efficient in terms of different statistical indicators however it was more time consuming bayesian optimization bo can provide optimum solutions using the least number of expensive evaluations jones et al 1998 yang et al 2019b this feature makes bo a powerful tool for solving design problems in a wide range of fields shahriari et al 2016 additionally it has emerged as a green artificial intelligence approach it can save the energy consumed for training and validating hence reducing the emission of carbon dioxide candelieri et al 2021 bo addresses the problem of searching for the global optimum by learning from the previous evaluations to suggest the next promising point to sample jones et al 1998 all available information on the objective functions that can be provided before evaluating them at any sampling point is specified through a prior probability distribution a probabilistic model e g gpr sets this prior distribution over the optimization function which is conditioned using previous evaluations to provide a posterior distribution the posterior is updated iteratively by the latest sampled function evaluation to represent our updated belief on the function given the observed data bo uses the probabilistic surrogate models to design an acquisition function the acquisition function is a pre selection computationally inexpensive function that can be evaluated at a given point to estimate the improvement in the performance considering the uncertainty in the posterior thus on its optimization it can guide to the new input location in which the objective functions should be evaluated in each iteration bo has been applied in some groundwater modeling applications for example pirot et al 2019 applied the bo to identify the contaminant source characteristics in an aquifer with a high degree of heterogeneity and different connectivity patterns the study aimed to minimize an objective function that describes the temporally variable misfit between observed and simulated contaminant levels at 25 monitoring wells a significant decrease in the required number of function evaluations for convergence was observed at 50 evaluations instead of more than 2600 that would have been needed to perform an exhaustive evaluation of points over the discrete domain krityakierne and baowan 2020 proposed an aggregate gaussian process gp model with an expected improvement criterion to construct a simulation based optimization algorithm to identify the location of the contaminant source an aggregated gp model approximates the exact gp model which enables the handling of many input data points pourmohamad and lee 2021 presented a bo approach that links gpr surrogate modeling with barrier functions to solve the problem of controlling the migration of two plumes of chlorinated contaminants with the minimization of the pump and treat remediation cost they used the barrier functions aiming to reduce the objective function while satisfying the constraint space despite these studies limited information is established in the literature regarding the implementation of bo to solve multi objective optimization problems in groundwater applications a multi objective optimization problem is a challenge of maximizing minimizing the utility values of multiple typically conflicting objective functions simultaneously the goal is to identify the set of pareto optimal solutions in which any improvement in one objective causes deterioration to another the hypervolume measure indicates the size of the dominated region of the objective space by the pareto optimal set it is widely used in designing and assessing the performance of multi objective optimization techniques li and yao 2019 in the context of bo emmerich et al 2006 proposed the expected hypervolume improvement ehvi as a measurement of the hypervolume improvement resulting from evaluating a new candidate point taking into consideration the uncertainty of the prediction ehvi has been a commonly used criterion whereby in comparison to other criteria it achieves good convergence and diversity to a true pareto front luo et al 2014 yang et al 2019a and yields excellent results when applied as an acquisition function in bo studies balandat et al 2020 yang et al 2019b however its calculation was criticized for its high computational complexity daulton et al 2020 yang et al 2019b to calculate it the first method was suggested by emmerich et al 2006 using monte carlo mc integration method efficient ehvi computation has been the subject of a large body of research e g emmerich et al 2011 hupkens et al 2015 yang et al 2019a yang et al 2019b recently a batch version of ehvi called q expected hypervolume improvement qehvi was proposed in daulton et al 2020 study the qehvi provides the closed form of ehvi with monte carlo mc approximation and can handle q points in parallel daulton et al 2020 specifically qehvi enhances the efficiency of the computations by calculating the exact gradients of the mc estimator using the auto differentiation method and then optimizing ehvi using the gradient information this study aims to 1 introduce the application of bo in solving swi management problems and 2 evaluate its performance against the nsga ii optimization approach which is considered a robust multi objective optimizer yet well known for its requirement of many function evaluations deb et al 2002 and 3 test its robustness on different management scenarios to obtain the optimum locations and rates for the mixed hydraulic barriers through a constrained multi objective methodology the methodology involves minimization of the average intrusion length the total salt mass within the aquifer and the total cost subject to the supply of the required demand with permissible salinity concentration the optimization algorithm is based on gpr and the qehvi the developed management model will be applied to an aquifer that is threatened by lateral seawater intrusion due to overexploitation the model incorporates 3d density dependent miscible flow and transport of seawater 2 methodology 2 1 density dependent flow and transport simulation model a three dimensional transient density dependent flow and mass transport finite element model was developed using feflow software diersch 1988 and used to simulate the swi in a coastal aquifer under the influence of regional pumping in the present study the porous medium is considered fully saturated oberbeck boussinesq approximation for the nonlinearity in the fluid density is used boussinesq 1903 where density variations induced by variations in solute concentration are all neglected except for the buoyancy term in the momentum equation the viscosity is considered to be independent of the concentration and thermal effects are neglected the governing equations of coupled groundwater flow and salt mass transport describing the seawater intrusion phenomenon can be found in detailed descriptions on diersch 2013 2 2 design of experiments doe latin hypercube and quasi monte carlo are commonly used in surrogate modeling based optimization as a space filling design due to their flexible sample sizes good distribution on the whole space with a relatively small number of sample points wang et al 2014 in this work latin hypercube sampling lhs and conditioned latin hypercube sampling clhs methods are employed the former method was used to generate different realizations for abstraction injection rates while the latter was utilized for the spatial coordinates sampling at a selected number of abstraction and injection barrier wells lhs is a stratified random procedure that generates sampling variables from their multidimensional distributions it provides full coverage of each variable range by dividing it into a number of strata equal to the sample size and the probability of the sample falling in each stratum is one over the sample size mckay et al 1979 the clhs is a sampling strategy of an area with prior information expressed as ancillary data the search algorithm aims to select optimal sampling locations through the ancillary data while obtaining a latin hypercube of the variables distributions minasny and mcbratney 2006 normally the aquifer domain has an irregular spatial boundary or has some locations that need to be excluded from the sampling selection due to either their subsurface geological formations i e ophiolite or the land cover occupied by water bodies buildings roads etc these considerations can be taken into account using clhs for spatial locations sampling however lhs stratifies each variable independently which may result in combinations of the variables values that are not related to any existing point in reality the training data set d x y g x r n d y r n m g r n g of size n with d decision variables m objective functions and g constraint functions defines the input output pairs which are used to train the proposed surrogate model abstraction injection rates and spatial locations at a required number of hydraulic barrier wells are the inputs to the numerical simulation model and represent the decision variables they were used to obtain the total salt mass within the aquifer the average inland length of the saltwater wedge intrusion measured from the coastline and the salinity at each regional abstraction well these simulation results in addition to the total cost of the management scenario and other environmental physical constraints described in section 2 5 are considered as the outputs constituting the objective and constraint functions 2 3 surrogate assisted simulation optimization model in this study a surrogate model based optimization of abstraction injection rates and well locations in mixed hydraulic barrier systems in coastal aquifers is performed feflow is integrated with the bayesian optimization model using custom python scripts for optimizing the proposed coastal management strategy this coupling is done automatically in a dynamic manner as the python script calls feflow to pass the information back and forth for each iteration the bo approach is implemented in botorch open source library balandat et al 2020 2 3 1 bayesian optimization bayesian optimization is effective for optimizing functions that are time consuming to evaluate lack an analytical expression and are subject to noise in their evaluations jones et al 1998 such objective functions without analytical formulations are black box functions garrido merchán and hernández lobato 2020 in this work the objective and constraint functions f in which their values are obtained by calling the feflow simulator are black box bo is then used to find the optimal design variables the bo algorithm is an adaptive sequential design algorithm it consists of two iterative operations 1 building probabilistic models on the training dataset d that substitute the high fidelity numerical simulation model to describe the objectives and constraint functions in this work gpr models described in section 2 3 2 are built for each function 2 finding new promising sample s or decision vectors by using these models to optimize the acquisition function also known as an infill criterion in this work we use the qehvi with the probability of feasibility to handle constraints as the acquisition function described in section 2 3 3 the new promising sample s are re evaluated with the expensive functions by calling the simulation model the new data is then appended to the existing training dataset and gpr models are re trained this process is continued until a termination criterion usually a maximum number of expensive evaluations is met the non dominated solutions from all expensive evaluations are then used as the final solutions a flow chart of the surrogate assisted simulation optimization model using bayesian optimization with gaussian process framework is presented in fig 1 2 3 2 gaussian process regression gpr is a distribution for each black box function f where f x of each point x has a prior multivariate normal distribution and any finite number of these random points x has a joint gaussian distribution thereby gpr is a collection of functions o hagan 2006 rasmussen and williams 2006 this distribution is defined by the mean function that describes the approximated function trend and the covariance function that describes the prior belief of the unknown function that needs to be modeled such as its smoothness amplitude etc a gpr defines a prior over an infinite number of functions that are defined by the covariance function given the observed data of the training dataset d it is converted to a posterior distribution p f d over possible functions that fit the observed data it reflects the uncertainty in the model estimations arising from the choice of the design parameters that define the model the observed data restrict the joint distribution to contain only those functions which agree with the observations rasmussen and williams 2006 providing such predictive distribution is explicitly available in some function approximation techniques e g in polynomials gpr random forests and gaussian radial basis function models razavi et al 2012 gpr is chosen in this study for the following reasons 1 it is a probabilistic approach and can estimate the uncertainty in the prediction rasmussen and williams 2006 which makes them more useful than other regression methods such as neural networks 2 it is a non parametric model and doesn t depend on user specified parameters e g number of hidden layers and nodes in the neural network a gpr model can be fully specified by mean and covariance functions which leads to a simple structure described below o hagan 2006 rasmussen and williams 2006 3 it is analytically tractable o hagan 2006 rasmussen and williams 2006 4 it can incorporate prior knowledge of the outputs in the surrogate construction process o hagan 2006 rasmussen and williams 2006 5 it has shown its potential in capturing swi behavior with high accuracy kopsiaftis et al 2019 lal and datta 2020 rajabi and ketabchi 2017 for each objective function and constraint function we build a gpr model let us denote the function values for the i th objective function or constraint function with y a gp is then a multivariate normal distribution 1 y n μ k where μ is the mean and k is the covariance matrix the mean function is unknown priorly but is assumed as constant in this study the covariance matrix k measures the correlations between different points in the data set the covariance matrix relies on the covariance function or kernel function which provides a pair wise correlation between two data points in the data set there are many covariance functions used in the gpr e g gaussian kernel also known as radial basis function kernel and squared exponential kernel matern kernel and periodic kernel this work used the matern 5 2 covariance function which is recommended for modeling realistic functions snoek et al 2012 it depends solely on the euclidean distance between observations made at two decision vectors training of the gpr model incorporates finding the optimal values of the design parameters hyperparameters upon which the covariance functions depend to allow a better fit of the data the hyperparameters vector includes the amplitude length scales and the standard deviation of the noise in the observations for more details on these parameters and their significance refer to rasmussen and williams 2006 the log marginal likelihood function is maximized to estimate these parameters see rasmussen and williams 2006 this completes the building of a gpr model this model is then used to get the posterior distribution i e approximations and their uncertainty in gpr the posterior distribution is also gaussian for a new set x the posterior distribution is given by 2 p y x x y θ n k x x k x x σ n 2 i 1 y k x x k x x t k x x σ n 2 i 1 k x x where x y are the matrics of input output pairs forming the training data set θ is the estimated hyperparameters vector σ n is the standard deviation of the noise in the observations i is the identity matrix and k represents the covariance matrix in the equation above k x x k x x σ n 2 i 1 y are the posterior means or point approximations and k x x k x x t k x x σ n 2 i 1 k x x is the covariance matrix representing the uncertainty in approximations the uncertainty can be obtained by taking the square root of diagonal elements in this matrix in this work this posterior predictive distribution is used when maximizing the qehvi to find promising decision vectors further information on the used matern covariance function and the log marginal likelihood function can be found in supplementary data s1 2 3 3 acquisition function differentiable q expected hypervolume improvement expected hypervolume improvement ehvi is based on the hypervolume indicator to indicate the quality of a solution set in multi objective problems the hypervolume is the only known strict pareto compliance that measures both convergence and diversity among the set of nondominated solutions zitzler et al 2007 it measures the size or hypervolume of the space dominated by a finite approximate pareto set ƥ and bounded below by a reference point r r is chosen to satisfy the condition that all the solutions of the pareto front approximation sets that might occur during the optimization process are to be dominated ehvi needs to be evaluated many times in the process of searching for the optimal point based on the gpr models the algorithm becomes computationally expensive to evaluate when it is not expressed in a closed form analytical expression daulton et al 2020 yang et al 2019b additionally the computational complexity is increased when it relies on gradient free or approximated gradients for its optimization daulton et al 2020 qehvi recently derived by daulton et al 2020 overcomes these limitations by providing the closed form and computing the exact gradient of the monte carlo mc estimator using auto differentiation auto differentiation makes using gradient based optimization for complex acquisition functions and objectives straightforward in addition qehvi provides the benefit of evaluating multiple samples q in parallel evaluating samples is important especially when parallel processing units or computers are available further details on qehvi can be found in daulton et al 2020 and the ehvi acquisition function is described briefly in the supplementary data s2 the constraints are introduced to the optimization by assuming them as black box functions the feasible pareto set is identified as the pareto set that satisfies g x 0 and the qehvi acquisition function handles them through weighting the hypervolume improvement of the objective vectors by the probability of feasibility 0 and 1 for infeasible and feasible solutions respectively 2 4 direct simulation optimization model this work also used the nsga ii deb et al 2002 to solve the given multi objective optimization problem through the direct simulation optimization framework nsga ii is an elitist multi objective evolutionary algorithm based on non dominated sorting approach nsga ii seeks pareto optimal solutions by directing nondominated solutions in a particular generation toward pareto optimal solutions while maintaining diversity among the solutions with the aid of the crowding distance to handle the constraints in nsga ii we used the approach proposed in deb et al 2002 the numerical simulation model was directly linked with the optimization model the optimization search process was performed by iterating between feflow simulation model and nsga ii optimization model fig 2 presents the developed methodology of nsga ii 2 5 multi objective optimization problem formulation and constraints in the present work the problem of optimization of wells locations and injection abstraction rates of the proposed management model is considered as a non linear multi objective constrained optimization problem and is expressed as follows 3 f 1 maximize s ε c d v 4 f 2 maximize a v g i 1 n c l 50 5 f 3 maximize i 1 n w abs ξ abs q i abs i 1 n w inj ξ inj q i inj i 1 n w ξ construction d i 6 s t g 1 c i pw c ucl 7 g 2 i 1 n w abs q i abs q abs 8 g 3 i 1 n w inj q i inj q max inj the negative sign in the objective function is because the goal of the management is to minimize and the used library botorch assumes maximization the decision variables take values in the d dimensional continuous space l u r d in which they are treated as continuous variables rather than discrete ones they are described as follows q m i n q i q m a x i 1 n w x m i n x i x m a x i 1 n w 9 y m i n y i y m a x i 1 n w in the above equations s ε c d v is the total salt mass within

of the negative barrier and negative in the case of the positive barrier m3 day x i y i are the and y coordinates of ith hydraulic barrier well m the imposed environmental constraints are to ensure that the salinity at the regional abstraction wells the total amounts of injection of positive hydraulic barriers the total amounts of abstraction from negative hydraulic barriers and either abstraction or recharge rate per each barrier are within the permissible limits 2 6 coastal aquifer management scenarios for each management scenario the remediation management started when the salinity concentration of the pumped water at any regional pumping well exceeded the upper concentration limit cucl in this study the upper concentration limit cucl is considered 1000 mg l to comply with the acceptable limit for total dissolved salts in the drinking water and irrigation uses ayers et al 1985 world health organization 2004 the optimization problems of three different management scenarios were solved to 1 test the robustness and performance of the bayesian optimization approach and 2 formulate some of the realistic physical and environmental site specific conditions management scenario 1 full supply for regional abstractions was maintained management scenario 2 regional abstractions stopped management scenario 3 constraints were imposed on the allowable locations for abstraction hydraulic barriers and the minimum volume to be abstracted by them to feed a desalination plant in addition to the full supply for the current regional abstractions the rates and locations of the injection abstraction hydraulic barriers were optimized to achieve the management objectives subject to the above mentioned constraints for management scenarios 1 and 2 however for management scenario 3 a constraint was added to force the abstraction barriers to be located near the initial toe location along the aquifer width or further seaward the goals of management scenario 3 were to supply freshwater to the regional abstractions supply brackish water to feed the desalination plant and mitigate the swi this scenario addresses the problem of satisfying conflicting requirements such as swi management desalination of brackish water and aquaculture industry which was recorded in different aquifers e g park and shi 2015 moreover site requirements may impose constraints on the potential locations for the hydraulic barriers in advance accordingly this constraint is added to test the robustness of the bo algorithm for handling this constraint 10 g 4 1 x toe i 1 n w abs max x i x toe 0 x toe is the initial toe coordinate in the x direction m 3 evaluation of the proposed methodology on a case study our goals were to examine the effectiveness of using the bo approach in the convergence towards the approximated pareto front under a restricted computational effort in the coastal management problems and to compare the performance of bo against nsga ii however the nsga ii model was run under a very large of simulations 4000 simulations in order for its results to be used as a baseline the relatively short simulation time compared to the real world problems makes the illustrative case study suitable for the current study the computational time required for one run using the numerical simulation model is approximately 7 min on a desktop pc with a 3 4 ghz intel i5 processor and 8 gb of ram the assumption of imposing strong restrictions on the possible number of simulations using a high fidelity model in real world coastal aquifer management problems is more realistic and practical christelis et al 2018 the aquifer considered is an unconfined anisotropic homogenous shallow coastal aquifer the model boundary has a rectangular shape the horizontal dimensions are 5000 m y 2500 m and the vertical dimension is z 25 m below the sea level where the aquifer base is located the regional abstractions are supplied by 8 fully penetrating pumping wells placed between 1000 and 3000 m from the shoreline representing the regional pumping field with a total water demand of 4000 m3 day equally distributed among them the injected water of the positive hydraulic barriers to recharge the aquifer is considered the effluent of tertiary treated wastewater and its salinity is considered 500 mg l metcalf et al 2014 the spatial and temporal discretizations of the numerical model are further discussed in the supplementary data s3 the management period is considered 10 years ebeling et al 2019 i e all the objectives and constraints values were determined at the end of this period table 1 shows the considered hydrogeological parameters in the simulation model the 3d view of the coastal aquifer model with the imposed flow and transport boundary conditions the initial hydraulic head and salinity distributions just before the management started are presented in fig 3 the number of decision variables is 18 corresponding to the rates x and y coordinates of 6 nw potential fully penetrating hydraulic barriers the lower and upper permissible limits for the rates and coordinates variable of each hydraulic barrier for the management scenarios are shown in table 2 and further discussed in the supplementary material s4 the potential locations for the barriers were selected from the shoreline to 1930 m inland horizontally in the x axis direction and along the whole aquifer in the y axis direction to accommodate the saline wedge and extend into the regional pumping field the imposed constraints for each management scenario are shown in table 2 the average initial coordinate of the toe is 4215 m the cost coefficients were assumed for the sake of simplicity to be equal to the unity ξ abs ξ inj a n d ξ construction however in reality they have to be estimated using more complex formulae the reference point r is taken in this work as 2 2 1011 g 500 m 8000 for the three objectives total mass of salt the average intrusion length of 50 and the total cost respectively which are considered as the minimum acceptable value for each objective an initial doe of size 150 is considered and 200 points are added in the bo process 100 iterations and q 2 therefore the total number of expensive function evaluations was 350 in bo the model runs were parallelized over two cores of the used machine four cores parallelization can achieve enhanced performance and faster convergence daulton et al 2020 the control parameters of nsga ii algorithm were selected as initial training sample size 150 population size 20 the maximum number of generations 200 crossover probability 0 8 and mutation probability 1 no of decision variables 0 056 for a fair comparison the initial population generation for nsga ii was set the training dataset of doe the total number of expensive function evaluations was 4150 in nsga ii 4 results this section is composed of three subsections in section 4 1 the performance of the bo approach was explored and compared against nsga ii to investigate the quality of the solutions obtained by the bo approach in management scenario 1 in section 4 2 the pareto optimal front resulted from the optimal locations and rates of the mixed hydraulic barriers for the three management scenarios introduced in section 2 6 were presented finally in section 4 3 the effectiveness of the optimal mixed hydraulic barrier remediation system in mitigating the swi was evaluated for a randomly selected pareto solution for management scenario 1 and compared to the natural intrusion condition furthermore the efficiency of the optimization process is assessed by the omission of each of the hydraulic barriers successively from the system and testing its impact on the objective and constraint functions 4 1 bayesian optimization and nsga ii the optimization problem of management scenario 1 using the proposed approaches of bo and nsga ii was solved the optimal well locations and optimal rates for the mixed hydraulic barriers remediation system were obtained to investigate the quality of the obtained solutions by both approaches the pareto fronts of the feasible solutions solutions that satisfy the constraints are plotted for the bo and nsga ii models in fig 4 the conflicting nature between the third objective total cost and either the first objective total salt mass or the second objective the average intrusion length of 50 can be concluded from the plots the first and second objectives were not in conflict with each other they were adopted to ensure that the management strategy is capable of the toe repulsion as well as mitigating the risk of increasing the total aquifer salinity due to trapping the salt landside at the end of the management period hence placing the positive barrier within the saltwater wedge may pose the potential of landside salt trapping ebeling et al 2019 moreover the salinity of the water used for injection may exaggerate this potential of salt trapping in fig 4 the bo approach succeeded to identify solutions on the pareto front in an exceptionally low number of function evaluations moreover the solutions with bo were well distributed along the approximated pareto front to evaluate the performance of bo against nsga ii quantitively three data analysis methods were used 1 calculating the hypervolume hv and generational distance gd which are the performance indicators for measuring convergence and diversity and for measuring how the current non dominated solutions are near to the optimal pareto front respectively 2 performing the one way analysis of variance anova test which provides evidence if there is a relationship between the means of the two pareto solution sets and 3 comparing between the data distribution of each approach by focusing on the spread a plot of hv with the number of expensive evaluations or simulations is shown in fig 5 a as can be seen despite nsga ii initially performing better than bo at a few learning cycles bo took the lead at the end of the bo optimization process of 350 evaluations 150 initial training data set 100 2 iterations the bo obtained better hypervolume which shows an increase of about 30 compared to nsga ii for a similar hypervolume the bo used 200 function evaluations which is very low compared to 2400 evaluations by nsga ii gd is based on calculating the sum of adjacent distances of solution sets obtained by each approach to the reference points liu et al 2019 the reference points represent the optimal pareto front which is not known a priori therefore all solutions attained by the two approaches were considered to find non dominated solutions these solutions were used as reference points for gd calculations song et al 2018 bo can efficiently improve the solutions without sacrificing the accuracy of pareto optimal solutions while maintaining good convergence and diversity as shown by its high hv and minimum gd values fig 5b anova test was executed for the solutions on the pareto optimal objective functions sets and the p value was calculated using scippy library the smaller the p value the more the null hypothesis is considered not likely to be true and is significant to reject our null hypothesis is that the sample bo approach results was derived from the parent population nsga ii approach in fisher s approach the threshold p value is considered 0 05 fisher 1992 the calculated p values for the three objectives were 0 37 0 43 and 0 34 respectively the p values are greater than 0 05 which illustrates that it is not statistically significant to reject the null hypothesis and there is convincing evidence to retain it the third data analysis was to explore the spread out of the bo feasible solutions on the approximated pareto front of the three objective functions relative to the nsga ii approach the ranges of the objectives that were obtained by nsga ii were from 22 to 205 tons for the total salt mass 0 to 433 m for the average intrusion length and 2187 to 7880 for the total cost similarly the ranges obtained by bo were 46 to 212 tons 0 to 477 m and 1879 to 7372 for the three objectives the analysis revealed that even though the number of solutions that were obtained by the bo approach was less than that in the nsga ii approach fig 4 the bo solutions could cover approximately the entire range of each objective the main purpose of using a surrogate model in conjunction with bo is to quickly converge to an approximate region of pareto optimal solutions allowing the needed computational time to be drastically reduced the nsga ii took about 371 h for 4000 evaluations and bo took only 19 34 h for 2 100 evaluations parallel computing to obtain approximately similar solutions and thus showing the efficiency and potential of bo in solving computationally expensive optimization problems however on the other side more computations were considered by bo for one iteration bo took around double the time invested by nsga ii table 3 shows the comparison between bo and nsga ii approaches in terms of the computational time performance indicators and the range of objectives values obtained by the pareto solution sets both approaches nsga ii and bo were able to find feasible solutions near the approximated pareto front the main advantage of bo is that it found feasible solutions in a very low number of function evaluations the search behavior of both approaches feasible and infeasible regions were illustrated in the supplementary material s5 4 2 different optimal management scenarios in this subsection we present the results of the three management scenarios the approximated pareto fronts achieved by the three management scenarios using the bo approach are presented in fig 6 it is worth mentioning that the number of attained optimal solutions for each management is different which corresponds to the complexity of the optimization problem the search on the rugged landscape and the wideness of the decision variable space the size of the non dominated feasible solution set of management scenario 2 is the largest and in contrast management scenario 1 has few optimal solutions the results show that management scenario 2 no regional abstractions outperforms the other two management scenarios in terms of the total cost which is expected because overexploitation is the main driver for swi management scenario 3 which forced the remediation management to extract a minimum amount of brackish water within the intrusion wedge led to an increase in the total cost compared to unrestricted wells rates in management scenario 1 the obtained results endorse the robustness of the bo approach and prove its capabilities to capture the behavior of swi under different management scenarios handle the constraints and provide optimal solutions fig 7 demonstrates the upper and lower bounds and the medians for the x coordinate y coordinate and the total flow q total inj q total abs for the injection and abstraction barriers obtained for each management scenario the x coordinate of the injection barriers fig 7a and the y coordinate of both injection and abstraction barriers for all the management scenarios showed no location prevalence such that the solutions took on different values covering the whole range of the variable fig 7b on the other hand the x coordinate of the abstraction hydraulic barriers for the optimal solutions of management scenarios 1 and 3 were obtained close to the sea fig 7a this result agrees with the literature that the abstraction barriers should be placed near the sea for more effective remediation ebeling et al 2019 mahesha 1996 pool and carrera 2010 however the results of management scenario 2 showed that the abstraction barriers can be located at different places covering roughly the whole design space fig 7a 7b this indicates that the feasible region is large which is the direct consequence of no abstractions the results of the total injection and abstraction rates showed that the injection has a greater influence on the efficiency of the mixed barrier remediation system than the abstraction fig 7c this is consistent with the findings of previous studies ebeling et al 2019 pool and carrera 2010 shi et al 2020 the required total discharge and recharge rates of the barriers for management scenario 2 are fairly low the medians are 20 and 564 m3 hr respectively fig 7c ceasing reducing the abstraction is the most beneficial and cost effective countermeasure to prevent further swi 4 3 analysis of approximated pareto optimal solution for management scenario 1 a solution from the approximated pareto front by bo of management scenario 1 was randomly selected with objective function values 79 4 109 g 128 76 m 4261 8 to evaluate the effectiveness of the optimized mixed hydraulic barriers remediation system to control swi fig 8 presents the concentration distribution at the bottom of the aquifer at the start and the end of the management period the salinity concentration at the locations of regional pumping wells did not exceed the imposed concentration constraint significant repulsion for the toe interface took place after the implementation of the optimal remediation measure the spatial distribution of the abstraction and injection hydraulic barriers is shown in fig 8 the injection barriers were placed within the saline wedge around the initial 50 isochlor with 85 of the total injected flow and the rest was injected inland away from the initial toe interface the abstraction barrier was close to the sea the velocity vectors emphasize the ability of the remediation system to shift back the hydraulic gradient towards the sea the injection has a significant contribution to the management strategy the rates of the hydraulic barriers are presented in table 4 two indices were calculated to quantify the transient remediation progress the 50 isochlor relative repulsion index ri50 and the relative total salt mass index mi ebeling et al 2019 ri50 calculates the incurred transient repulsion due to the remediation measure relative to the natural intrusion mi estimates the obtained reduction in the total salt mass relative to the natural total salt mass in the aquifer these indices can take positive values up to 1 which means reaching the natural intrusion condition while negative values indicate more deterioration in terms of saline water volume or further seawater encroachment and 0 refers to the initial condition just before the management starts their equations are expressed as 11 ri 50 l 0 l t l 0 l n 12 mi m 0 m t m 0 m n where l0 m0 lt mt ln mn are the intrusion length and the total salt mass at the start of remediation at time t from the start of remediation and under the natural condition respectively in the early stage the water level increased in the aquifer due to the injected water part of the flow retreated the intrusion and the other part flowed inland diluting the saline water however there was still an inland lateral flow from the sea this resulted in increasing the total salt mass within the aquifer until the overall flow turned towards the sea fig 9 the mixed hydraulic barriers system precluded further swi advances pushed the saline wedge towards the sea and succeeded to repel the intrusion to reach an average length that exceeded the natural intrusion condition by 21 3 of its length fig 9 after approximately 1 year from the implementation of the management strategy the system could generate a seaward hydraulic gradient and by the end of the management period the aquifer recovered from the salinization by 79 2 to achieve the natural condition the efficiency of the optimization is assessed by analyzing the adverse effect on the remediation measure of removing each barrier successively from the mixed hydraulic barriers system this provides a measure of the contribution of each barrier to the improvement of the remediation table 4 illustrates the impact on the total salt mass the intrusion length and the maximum salinity at the regional pumping wells caused by the omission of each barrier bw2 injection barrier with the highest rate had the strongest influence on swi mitigation while the bw6 abstraction barrier had the least effect the resulting evolution of the salinity at the hydraulic barriers due to the application of the remediation system and when the barrier is omitted is presented in fig 10 it can be seen from fig 10 and table 4 that bw 1 is capable of reducing the aquifer salinity and pushing the seawater interface towards the coast such that on its removal the salinity increased by 23 and seawater invasion expanded by 24 fig 10a however the quality of the used treated wastewater caused contamination to the aquifer where its salinity is higher than the natural groundwater salinity the influence of each positive barrier corresponds to its rate the higher the injection rate the greater the improvement is as shown for bw 2 fig 10b bw 3 fig 10c bw 4 fig 10d and bw 5 fig 10e the negative barrier bw 6 experienced a relatively sharp decline in the early stage of its operation fig 10f however after a short period the salinity rose again then it showed a similar decline trend in the salinity to that of the scenario of its removal from the remediation system with a slight decrease the later rise in the salinity is due to the depression cone generated by the pumping where at a certain point with further drawdown it withdrew seawater causing more contamination this phenomenon was also reported by pool and carrera 2010 in their study of using double negative barriers as a corrective measure to control swi in low dynamic aquifers the lateral seawater flux resulting from the drawdowns of the pumping wells reduces the system s efficiency at the late remediation stage the positive barrier has a relatively small impact on the remediation improvement by less than 5 in terms of the salinity volume and impeding the intrusion the assessment proved that the solution is efficiently optimized since deterioration was observed after discarding any of the barriers 5 discussion evolutionary algorithms and bayesian optimization are two well known research fields in optimization they have a similar structure including initialization evaluation of the black box function at a given sample point and update to the current search seeking improvement in the next iteration the process is repeated until reaching the termination criterion the difference between them is in the update strategy to the search nsga ii which belongs to evolutionary algorithms uses a population based search that relies on crossover and mutation operators and diversity mechanisms to avoid getting trapped in local minima deb et al 2002 this results in nsga ii tending to need a huge number of evaluations to converge to the exact pareto front bo is based on learning from the previous samples and selecting the next samples by the optimization of the acquisition function jones et al 1998 bo requires only a few expensive evaluations compared to nsga ii yang et al 2019a this is due to its reliance on gpr and the acquisition function gpr is a machine learning probabilistic model that replaces the high fidelity simulation model learns from previous evaluations about the relationship between the evaluation functions and the decision vectors and allows fast evaluations of a great number of candidates within the optimization process of the acquisition function the acquisition function uses the gpr models evaluations and the associated uncertainty to evaluate the performance improvement and guides the choice of the next samples via its optimization therefore it is suitable for optimizing swi management problems that rely on computationally expensive functions the hv and gd indicators as performance indicators showed the superiority of the bo compared to nsga ii at the later stage of the search under a few evaluations fig 5 therefore the main benefits of the bo approach are 1 accounting for the uncertainty in the predictions that offers a search efficient alternative through exploration searching unexplored regions where the prediction has high uncertainty and exploitation searching regions where the prediction is minimum when selecting the new promising sample shahriari et al 2016 by the acquisition function and 2 providing solutions on the approximated pareto front with the least number of expensive evaluations conversely the consumed time for generating candidate solutions by bo is significantly higher than nsga ii for each iteration table 3 maximizing the acquisition function to generate candidate solutions is a time consuming procedure daulton et al 2020 yang et al 2019b however this time is relatively insignificant compared to the simulation time required for evaluating the expensive black box functions nsga ii took a fixed amount of time because it required less computation than bo per iteration the drawback of the proposed algorithm is the pre assignment for the required number of hydraulic barriers i e the number of hydraulic barriers is not a decision variable the traditional gp based bo cannot be implemented when the optimization function is based on a variant number of decision vectors however swi management problems often have the total cost as one of the objective functions and it relies on the number of hydraulic barriers recently chugh and ymeraj 2022 proposed an extension to the applicability of multi objective bayesian optimization to overcome this limitation based on the results of three different management scenarios it was shown that there are no specific spatial configurations for wells and pumping injection rates that can be provided as a one solution fits all fig 7 this agrees with the literature where placing the abstraction hydraulic barriers seaside and the injection barriers inland e g shi et al 2020 or vice versa e g ebeling et al 2019 were both used for the injection abstraction remediation system a well designed mixed barrier system taking into consideration the hydrogeological and geological aquifer conditions needs many combinations of the barrier rates and locations to choose the best one among them consequently it is necessary to identify an optimal management strategy instead of testing limited combinations as has been done in previous studies 6 conclusions this study evaluated the application of a constrained multi objective bayesian optimization approach to control seawater intrusion in a coastal aquifer the approach was based on both gpr as a surrogate model for each objective and constraint function and qehvi as an acquisition function to find the optimal well locations and rates for the mixed hydraulic barriers system to mitigate the swi the main conclusions that can be deduced from the results of the optimization approach are as follows 1 the bo approach minimized the objective functions and satisfied the constraints with a limited number of simulations providing a high quality pareto solution set which is comparable to nsga ii results under relatively unrestricted computational effort in terms of the hypervolume and the diversity of the pareto solutions such performance led to a 95 saving in the computational runtime this proves its applicability to real world coastal aquifer management problems which involve computationally expensive variable density groundwater models 2 for a similar number of evaluations bo is better in terms of data efficiency where it has a higher rate of hypervolume improvement and or lower generational distance i e a better quality of the pareto solutions however more computation time per evaluation is required as a result it is good to use evolutionary algorithms for problems where evaluating candidate solutions takes minimal time and bos for more computationally expensive problems 3 the optimal locations and rates for the abstraction and injection wells of mixed hydraulic barriers can take on different values within the entire design space efficient optimization can identify the best locations and rates considering the aquifer characteristics the main findings from the implementation of different management scenarios for the design of the mixed hydraulic barriers are as follows 1 the injection barriers offer higher control over the remediation measure in terms of the intrusion length and the total salt mass in the aquifer the higher the injection rate the greater the influence is on the swi mitigation 2 attention should be paid to the quality of the injected water and the location of the injection recharging the aquifer with treated wastewater which has a salinity that exceeds the salinity of natural groundwater would lead to the contamination of the freshwater even though it may repel the swi a constraint needs to be imposed on the potential locations for the injection barriers in the proposed management to avoid the risk of local contamination 3 the main advantage of the abstraction of brackish water is its role as an alternative freshwater resource where the abstracted water can be desalinated at less cost than seawater 4 the abstraction barriers seem to be more effective in the early stage of the implementation rather than at a later stage when the generated depression cones may start to withdraw seawater causing saltwater to flow laterally inland and increase the salinity in summary the bayesian optimization approach proved to be a reliable and accurate approach for seawater intrusion control models and could be incorporated into the simulation optimization framework of coastal management problems future research will focus on the application of the bo approach to real world coastal management optimization problems credit authorship contribution statement samia saad

3153,mixed hydraulic barriers is an effective method to control seawater intrusion swi particularly in regions that suffer from water shortages however determining the optimal well locations and rates for injection and abstraction is challenging due to the computational burden resulting from the huge number of calls for the high fidelity hydrogeological simulation model to alleviate this issue we utilized a constrained multi objective bayesian optimization bo approach to optimize rates and locations of the hydraulic barriers to minimize total cost aquifer salinity and salt wedge intrusion length while satisfying regional abstractions with acceptable salinity levels bo is useful for optimizing computationally expensive problems in few iterations by using a surrogate model and an acquisition function despite being an efficient optimization tool the use of bo in the field of coastal aquifer management has not been explored the proposed framework was evaluated on an unconfined aquifer subjected to three management scenarios considering different physical and technical constraints and was benchmarked against the widely used robust nsga ii non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii method the results proved the effectiveness of bo in achieving an optimum mixed hydraulic barriers design in much fewer runs of the variable density aquifer model bo with 350 evaluations yielded comparable results to 4150 evaluations using nsga ii bo solutions were spatially well distributed along the approximated pareto front for the same number of evaluations the hypervolume obtained by bo was larger by 30 based on different scenarios the average amount of water required for abstraction ranged from 1 5 to 25 of that for injection the injection has a significant impact on swi management but the abstracted water provides an alternative source of water a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the optimization problem to illustrate its efficiency by omitting the barriers one at a time and assessing impacts on objective and constraint functions keywords seawater intrusion coastal aquifer management gaussian processes surrogate model hydraulic barriers computationally expensive 1 introduction groundwater is an essential source of freshwater accounting for about 30 1 of the world s available freshwater herrera franco et al 2022 given its relatively stable yield of high quality water groundwater has emerged as a vital water resource to meet domestic industrial agricultural and environmental demands howard 2015 although groundwater is often relatively well protected from pollution poor management has resulted in negative impacts such as declining aquifer heads groundwater quality deterioration lower yields land subsidence and more notably seawater intrusion bachtouli and comte 2019 van ty et al 2021 the literature shows that intensive research has been carried out on how to control swi in aquifers implementing a mixed hydraulic barrier remediation system a combination of negative and positive barriers was proved to be more efficient than single barrier systems in controlling swi ebeling et al 2019 shi et al 2020 however given the complexity of the mixed barrier systems the design of such a system called for evaluating several design parameters including pumping flow rates and positioning abstraction injection wells within an aquifer generally the optimum configuration and rates are found by applying a numerical model that captures the groundwater flow pattern in the area followed by an optimization technique to achieve the best design for a system of wells however building a variable density dependent groundwater flow and mass transport simulation model is computationally expensive asher et al 2015 alternatively recent research studies shifted into using a surrogate model to replace the high fidelity simulation model surrogate models have proven to be able to capture the dynamic behavior of swi at a significantly less computational cost kopsiaftis et al 2019 rajabi and ketabchi 2017 roy and datta 2020 a surrogate model can be defined as a model of the model where it is a statistical data driven model describing the relationship between model adjustable parameters inputs and the response surface of the simulation model outputs wang et al 2014 many response surface approximation techniques have been utilized as surrogate models to replace the high fidelity groundwater simulation models artificial neural network ann gaussian process regression gpr radial basis function rbf polynomials etc although no approximation technique performs best universally and the results rely on many factors such as its structure parameters size of the training set and data sampling method there is a general agreement on the strength of gpr also known as kriging and rbf based optimization frameworks asher et al 2015 jones et al 1998 razavi et al 2012 the gpr model parameters are learned in a bayesian scheme thus predicting unobserved inputs needs to integrate over all parameter values weighted by their probability distribution given the training data accordingly gpr can estimate the uncertainty in the predictions of the surrogate model rasmussen and williams 2006 it considers the deterministic response of the simulation model as a realization of a stochastic process razavi et al 2012 few studies have used gpr as a data driven surrogate model in swi management for example rajabi and ketabchi 2017 used gpr as a surrogate model to replace the 3d density dependent sutra simulation model the trained gpr model was coupled with monte carlo simulation to generate probability distributions of salinity concentrations in the observation wells these probability distributions were passed to the continuous ant colony optimization algorithm to optimize the extraction rates in the wells under constraints related to swi extent kopsiaftis et al 2019 investigated the capacity of substituting the gpr as a surrogate model for variable density models to predict the swi extent the study compared the obtained results with other methods the results proved that gpr was more efficient in terms of different statistical indicators however it was more time consuming bayesian optimization bo can provide optimum solutions using the least number of expensive evaluations jones et al 1998 yang et al 2019b this feature makes bo a powerful tool for solving design problems in a wide range of fields shahriari et al 2016 additionally it has emerged as a green artificial intelligence approach it can save the energy consumed for training and validating hence reducing the emission of carbon dioxide candelieri et al 2021 bo addresses the problem of searching for the global optimum by learning from the previous evaluations to suggest the next promising point to sample jones et al 1998 all available information on the objective functions that can be provided before evaluating them at any sampling point is specified through a prior probability distribution a probabilistic model e g gpr sets this prior distribution over the optimization function which is conditioned using previous evaluations to provide a posterior distribution the posterior is updated iteratively by the latest sampled function evaluation to represent our updated belief on the function given the observed data bo uses the probabilistic surrogate models to design an acquisition function the acquisition function is a pre selection computationally inexpensive function that can be evaluated at a given point to estimate the improvement in the performance considering the uncertainty in the posterior thus on its optimization it can guide to the new input location in which the objective functions should be evaluated in each iteration bo has been applied in some groundwater modeling applications for example pirot et al 2019 applied the bo to identify the contaminant source characteristics in an aquifer with a high degree of heterogeneity and different connectivity patterns the study aimed to minimize an objective function that describes the temporally variable misfit between observed and simulated contaminant levels at 25 monitoring wells a significant decrease in the required number of function evaluations for convergence was observed at 50 evaluations instead of more than 2600 that would have been needed to perform an exhaustive evaluation of points over the discrete domain krityakierne and baowan 2020 proposed an aggregate gaussian process gp model with an expected improvement criterion to construct a simulation based optimization algorithm to identify the location of the contaminant source an aggregated gp model approximates the exact gp model which enables the handling of many input data points pourmohamad and lee 2021 presented a bo approach that links gpr surrogate modeling with barrier functions to solve the problem of controlling the migration of two plumes of chlorinated contaminants with the minimization of the pump and treat remediation cost they used the barrier functions aiming to reduce the objective function while satisfying the constraint space despite these studies limited information is established in the literature regarding the implementation of bo to solve multi objective optimization problems in groundwater applications a multi objective optimization problem is a challenge of maximizing minimizing the utility values of multiple typically conflicting objective functions simultaneously the goal is to identify the set of pareto optimal solutions in which any improvement in one objective causes deterioration to another the hypervolume measure indicates the size of the dominated region of the objective space by the pareto optimal set it is widely used in designing and assessing the performance of multi objective optimization techniques li and yao 2019 in the context of bo emmerich et al 2006 proposed the expected hypervolume improvement ehvi as a measurement of the hypervolume improvement resulting from evaluating a new candidate point taking into consideration the uncertainty of the prediction ehvi has been a commonly used criterion whereby in comparison to other criteria it achieves good convergence and diversity to a true pareto front luo et al 2014 yang et al 2019a and yields excellent results when applied as an acquisition function in bo studies balandat et al 2020 yang et al 2019b however its calculation was criticized for its high computational complexity daulton et al 2020 yang et al 2019b to calculate it the first method was suggested by emmerich et al 2006 using monte carlo mc integration method efficient ehvi computation has been the subject of a large body of research e g emmerich et al 2011 hupkens et al 2015 yang et al 2019a yang et al 2019b recently a batch version of ehvi called q expected hypervolume improvement qehvi was proposed in daulton et al 2020 study the qehvi provides the closed form of ehvi with monte carlo mc approximation and can handle q points in parallel daulton et al 2020 specifically qehvi enhances the efficiency of the computations by calculating the exact gradients of the mc estimator using the auto differentiation method and then optimizing ehvi using the gradient information this study aims to 1 introduce the application of bo in solving swi management problems and 2 evaluate its performance against the nsga ii optimization approach which is considered a robust multi objective optimizer yet well known for its requirement of many function evaluations deb et al 2002 and 3 test its robustness on different management scenarios to obtain the optimum locations and rates for the mixed hydraulic barriers through a constrained multi objective methodology the methodology involves minimization of the average intrusion length the total salt mass within the aquifer and the total cost subject to the supply of the required demand with permissible salinity concentration the optimization algorithm is based on gpr and the qehvi the developed management model will be applied to an aquifer that is threatened by lateral seawater intrusion due to overexploitation the model incorporates 3d density dependent miscible flow and transport of seawater 2 methodology 2 1 density dependent flow and transport simulation model a three dimensional transient density dependent flow and mass transport finite element model was developed using feflow software diersch 1988 and used to simulate the swi in a coastal aquifer under the influence of regional pumping in the present study the porous medium is considered fully saturated oberbeck boussinesq approximation for the nonlinearity in the fluid density is used boussinesq 1903 where density variations induced by variations in solute concentration are all neglected except for the buoyancy term in the momentum equation the viscosity is considered to be independent of the concentration and thermal effects are neglected the governing equations of coupled groundwater flow and salt mass transport describing the seawater intrusion phenomenon can be found in detailed descriptions on diersch 2013 2 2 design of experiments doe latin hypercube and quasi monte carlo are commonly used in surrogate modeling based optimization as a space filling design due to their flexible sample sizes good distribution on the whole space with a relatively small number of sample points wang et al 2014 in this work latin hypercube sampling lhs and conditioned latin hypercube sampling clhs methods are employed the former method was used to generate different realizations for abstraction injection rates while the latter was utilized for the spatial coordinates sampling at a selected number of abstraction and injection barrier wells lhs is a stratified random procedure that generates sampling variables from their multidimensional distributions it provides full coverage of each variable range by dividing it into a number of strata equal to the sample size and the probability of the sample falling in each stratum is one over the sample size mckay et al 1979 the clhs is a sampling strategy of an area with prior information expressed as ancillary data the search algorithm aims to select optimal sampling locations through the ancillary data while obtaining a latin hypercube of the variables distributions minasny and mcbratney 2006 normally the aquifer domain has an irregular spatial boundary or has some locations that need to be excluded from the sampling selection due to either their subsurface geological formations i e ophiolite or the land cover occupied by water bodies buildings roads etc these considerations can be taken into account using clhs for spatial locations sampling however lhs stratifies each variable independently which may result in combinations of the variables values that are not related to any existing point in reality the training data set d x y g x r n d y r n m g r n g of size n with d decision variables m objective functions and g constraint functions defines the input output pairs which are used to train the proposed surrogate model abstraction injection rates and spatial locations at a required number of hydraulic barrier wells are the inputs to the numerical simulation model and represent the decision variables they were used to obtain the total salt mass within the aquifer the average inland length of the saltwater wedge intrusion measured from the coastline and the salinity at each regional abstraction well these simulation results in addition to the total cost of the management scenario and other environmental physical constraints described in section 2 5 are considered as the outputs constituting the objective and constraint functions 2 3 surrogate assisted simulation optimization model in this study a surrogate model based optimization of abstraction injection rates and well locations in mixed hydraulic barrier systems in coastal aquifers is performed feflow is integrated with the bayesian optimization model using custom python scripts for optimizing the proposed coastal management strategy this coupling is done automatically in a dynamic manner as the python script calls feflow to pass the information back and forth for each iteration the bo approach is implemented in botorch open source library balandat et al 2020 2 3 1 bayesian optimization bayesian optimization is effective for optimizing functions that are time consuming to evaluate lack an analytical expression and are subject to noise in their evaluations jones et al 1998 such objective functions without analytical formulations are black box functions garrido merchán and hernández lobato 2020 in this work the objective and constraint functions f in which their values are obtained by calling the feflow simulator are black box bo is then used to find the optimal design variables the bo algorithm is an adaptive sequential design algorithm it consists of two iterative operations 1 building probabilistic models on the training dataset d that substitute the high fidelity numerical simulation model to describe the objectives and constraint functions in this work gpr models described in section 2 3 2 are built for each function 2 finding new promising sample s or decision vectors by using these models to optimize the acquisition function also known as an infill criterion in this work we use the qehvi with the probability of feasibility to handle constraints as the acquisition function described in section 2 3 3 the new promising sample s are re evaluated with the expensive functions by calling the simulation model the new data is then appended to the existing training dataset and gpr models are re trained this process is continued until a termination criterion usually a maximum number of expensive evaluations is met the non dominated solutions from all expensive evaluations are then used as the final solutions a flow chart of the surrogate assisted simulation optimization model using bayesian optimization with gaussian process framework is presented in fig 1 2 3 2 gaussian process regression gpr is a distribution for each black box function f where f x of each point x has a prior multivariate normal distribution and any finite number of these random points x has a joint gaussian distribution thereby gpr is a collection of functions o hagan 2006 rasmussen and williams 2006 this distribution is defined by the mean function that describes the approximated function trend and the covariance function that describes the prior belief of the unknown function that needs to be modeled such as its smoothness amplitude etc a gpr defines a prior over an infinite number of functions that are defined by the covariance function given the observed data of the training dataset d it is converted to a posterior distribution p f d over possible functions that fit the observed data it reflects the uncertainty in the model estimations arising from the choice of the design parameters that define the model the observed data restrict the joint distribution to contain only those functions which agree with the observations rasmussen and williams 2006 providing such predictive distribution is explicitly available in some function approximation techniques e g in polynomials gpr random forests and gaussian radial basis function models razavi et al 2012 gpr is chosen in this study for the following reasons 1 it is a probabilistic approach and can estimate the uncertainty in the prediction rasmussen and williams 2006 which makes them more useful than other regression methods such as neural networks 2 it is a non parametric model and doesn t depend on user specified parameters e g number of hidden layers and nodes in the neural network a gpr model can be fully specified by mean and covariance functions which leads to a simple structure described below o hagan 2006 rasmussen and williams 2006 3 it is analytically tractable o hagan 2006 rasmussen and williams 2006 4 it can incorporate prior knowledge of the outputs in the surrogate construction process o hagan 2006 rasmussen and williams 2006 5 it has shown its potential in capturing swi behavior with high accuracy kopsiaftis et al 2019 lal and datta 2020 rajabi and ketabchi 2017 for each objective function and constraint function we build a gpr model let us denote the function values for the i th objective function or constraint function with y a gp is then a multivariate normal distribution 1 y n μ k where μ is the mean and k is the covariance matrix the mean function is unknown priorly but is assumed as constant in this study the covariance matrix k measures the correlations between different points in the data set the covariance matrix relies on the covariance function or kernel function which provides a pair wise correlation between two data points in the data set there are many covariance functions used in the gpr e g gaussian kernel also known as radial basis function kernel and squared exponential kernel matern kernel and periodic kernel this work used the matern 5 2 covariance function which is recommended for modeling realistic functions snoek et al 2012 it depends solely on the euclidean distance between observations made at two decision vectors training of the gpr model incorporates finding the optimal values of the design parameters hyperparameters upon which the covariance functions depend to allow a better fit of the data the hyperparameters vector includes the amplitude length scales and the standard deviation of the noise in the observations for more details on these parameters and their significance refer to rasmussen and williams 2006 the log marginal likelihood function is maximized to estimate these parameters see rasmussen and williams 2006 this completes the building of a gpr model this model is then used to get the posterior distribution i e approximations and their uncertainty in gpr the posterior distribution is also gaussian for a new set x the posterior distribution is given by 2 p y x x y θ n k x x k x x σ n 2 i 1 y k x x k x x t k x x σ n 2 i 1 k x x where x y are the matrics of input output pairs forming the training data set θ is the estimated hyperparameters vector σ n is the standard deviation of the noise in the observations i is the identity matrix and k represents the covariance matrix in the equation above k x x k x x σ n 2 i 1 y are the posterior means or point approximations and k x x k x x t k x x σ n 2 i 1 k x x is the covariance matrix representing the uncertainty in approximations the uncertainty can be obtained by taking the square root of diagonal elements in this matrix in this work this posterior predictive distribution is used when maximizing the qehvi to find promising decision vectors further information on the used matern covariance function and the log marginal likelihood function can be found in supplementary data s1 2 3 3 acquisition function differentiable q expected hypervolume improvement expected hypervolume improvement ehvi is based on the hypervolume indicator to indicate the quality of a solution set in multi objective problems the hypervolume is the only known strict pareto compliance that measures both convergence and diversity among the set of nondominated solutions zitzler et al 2007 it measures the size or hypervolume of the space dominated by a finite approximate pareto set ƥ and bounded below by a reference point r r is chosen to satisfy the condition that all the solutions of the pareto front approximation sets that might occur during the optimization process are to be dominated ehvi needs to be evaluated many times in the process of searching for the optimal point based on the gpr models the algorithm becomes computationally expensive to evaluate when it is not expressed in a closed form analytical expression daulton et al 2020 yang et al 2019b additionally the computational complexity is increased when it relies on gradient free or approximated gradients for its optimization daulton et al 2020 qehvi recently derived by daulton et al 2020 overcomes these limitations by providing the closed form and computing the exact gradient of the monte carlo mc estimator using auto differentiation auto differentiation makes using gradient based optimization for complex acquisition functions and objectives straightforward in addition qehvi provides the benefit of evaluating multiple samples q in parallel evaluating samples is important especially when parallel processing units or computers are available further details on qehvi can be found in daulton et al 2020 and the ehvi acquisition function is described briefly in the supplementary data s2 the constraints are introduced to the optimization by assuming them as black box functions the feasible pareto set is identified as the pareto set that satisfies g x 0 and the qehvi acquisition function handles them through weighting the hypervolume improvement of the objective vectors by the probability of feasibility 0 and 1 for infeasible and feasible solutions respectively 2 4 direct simulation optimization model this work also used the nsga ii deb et al 2002 to solve the given multi objective optimization problem through the direct simulation optimization framework nsga ii is an elitist multi objective evolutionary algorithm based on non dominated sorting approach nsga ii seeks pareto optimal solutions by directing nondominated solutions in a particular generation toward pareto optimal solutions while maintaining diversity among the solutions with the aid of the crowding distance to handle the constraints in nsga ii we used the approach proposed in deb et al 2002 the numerical simulation model was directly linked with the optimization model the optimization search process was performed by iterating between feflow simulation model and nsga ii optimization model fig 2 presents the developed methodology of nsga ii 2 5 multi objective optimization problem formulation and constraints in the present work the problem of optimization of wells locations and injection abstraction rates of the proposed management model is considered as a non linear multi objective constrained optimization problem and is expressed as follows 3 f 1 maximize s ε c d v 4 f 2 maximize a v g i 1 n c l 50 5 f 3 maximize i 1 n w abs ξ abs q i abs i 1 n w inj ξ inj q i inj i 1 n w ξ construction d i 6 s t g 1 c i pw c ucl 7 g 2 i 1 n w abs q i abs q abs 8 g 3 i 1 n w inj q i inj q max inj the negative sign in the objective function is because the goal of the management is to minimize and the used library botorch assumes maximization the decision variables take values in the d dimensional continuous space l u r d in which they are treated as continuous variables rather than discrete ones they are described as follows q m i n q i q m a x i 1 n w x m i n x i x m a x i 1 n w 9 y m i n y i y m a x i 1 n w in the above equations s ε c d v is the total salt mass within

of the negative barrier and negative in the case of the positive barrier m3 day x i y i are the and y coordinates of ith hydraulic barrier well m the imposed environmental constraints are to ensure that the salinity at the regional abstraction wells the total amounts of injection of positive hydraulic barriers the total amounts of abstraction from negative hydraulic barriers and either abstraction or recharge rate per each barrier are within the permissible limits 2 6 coastal aquifer management scenarios for each management scenario the remediation management started when the salinity concentration of the pumped water at any regional pumping well exceeded the upper concentration limit cucl in this study the upper concentration limit cucl is considered 1000 mg l to comply with the acceptable limit for total dissolved salts in the drinking water and irrigation uses ayers et al 1985 world health organization 2004 the optimization problems of three different management scenarios were solved to 1 test the robustness and performance of the bayesian optimization approach and 2 formulate some of the realistic physical and environmental site specific conditions management scenario 1 full supply for regional abstractions was maintained management scenario 2 regional abstractions stopped management scenario 3 constraints were imposed on the allowable locations for abstraction hydraulic barriers and the minimum volume to be abstracted by them to feed a desalination plant in addition to the full supply for the current regional abstractions the rates and locations of the injection abstraction hydraulic barriers were optimized to achieve the management objectives subject to the above mentioned constraints for management scenarios 1 and 2 however for management scenario 3 a constraint was added to force the abstraction barriers to be located near the initial toe location along the aquifer width or further seaward the goals of management scenario 3 were to supply freshwater to the regional abstractions supply brackish water to feed the desalination plant and mitigate the swi this scenario addresses the problem of satisfying conflicting requirements such as swi management desalination of brackish water and aquaculture industry which was recorded in different aquifers e g park and shi 2015 moreover site requirements may impose constraints on the potential locations for the hydraulic barriers in advance accordingly this constraint is added to test the robustness of the bo algorithm for handling this constraint 10 g 4 1 x toe i 1 n w abs max x i x toe 0 x toe is the initial toe coordinate in the x direction m 3 evaluation of the proposed methodology on a case study our goals were to examine the effectiveness of using the bo approach in the convergence towards the approximated pareto front under a restricted computational effort in the coastal management problems and to compare the performance of bo against nsga ii however the nsga ii model was run under a very large of simulations 4000 simulations in order for its results to be used as a baseline the relatively short simulation time compared to the real world problems makes the illustrative case study suitable for the current study the computational time required for one run using the numerical simulation model is approximately 7 min on a desktop pc with a 3 4 ghz intel i5 processor and 8 gb of ram the assumption of imposing strong restrictions on the possible number of simulations using a high fidelity model in real world coastal aquifer management problems is more realistic and practical christelis et al 2018 the aquifer considered is an unconfined anisotropic homogenous shallow coastal aquifer the model boundary has a rectangular shape the horizontal dimensions are 5000 m y 2500 m and the vertical dimension is z 25 m below the sea level where the aquifer base is located the regional abstractions are supplied by 8 fully penetrating pumping wells placed between 1000 and 3000 m from the shoreline representing the regional pumping field with a total water demand of 4000 m3 day equally distributed among them the injected water of the positive hydraulic barriers to recharge the aquifer is considered the effluent of tertiary treated wastewater and its salinity is considered 500 mg l metcalf et al 2014 the spatial and temporal discretizations of the numerical model are further discussed in the supplementary data s3 the management period is considered 10 years ebeling et al 2019 i e all the objectives and constraints values were determined at the end of this period table 1 shows the considered hydrogeological parameters in the simulation model the 3d view of the coastal aquifer model with the imposed flow and transport boundary conditions the initial hydraulic head and salinity distributions just before the management started are presented in fig 3 the number of decision variables is 18 corresponding to the rates x and y coordinates of 6 nw potential fully penetrating hydraulic barriers the lower and upper permissible limits for the rates and coordinates variable of each hydraulic barrier for the management scenarios are shown in table 2 and further discussed in the supplementary material s4 the potential locations for the barriers were selected from the shoreline to 1930 m inland horizontally in the x axis direction and along the whole aquifer in the y axis direction to accommodate the saline wedge and extend into the regional pumping field the imposed constraints for each management scenario are shown in table 2 the average initial coordinate of the toe is 4215 m the cost coefficients were assumed for the sake of simplicity to be equal to the unity ξ abs ξ inj a n d ξ construction however in reality they have to be estimated using more complex formulae the reference point r is taken in this work as 2 2 1011 g 500 m 8000 for the three objectives total mass of salt the average intrusion length of 50 and the total cost respectively which are considered as the minimum acceptable value for each objective an initial doe of size 150 is considered and 200 points are added in the bo process 100 iterations and q 2 therefore the total number of expensive function evaluations was 350 in bo the model runs were parallelized over two cores of the used machine four cores parallelization can achieve enhanced performance and faster convergence daulton et al 2020 the control parameters of nsga ii algorithm were selected as initial training sample size 150 population size 20 the maximum number of generations 200 crossover probability 0 8 and mutation probability 1 no of decision variables 0 056 for a fair comparison the initial population generation for nsga ii was set the training dataset of doe the total number of expensive function evaluations was 4150 in nsga ii 4 results this section is composed of three subsections in section 4 1 the performance of the bo approach was explored and compared against nsga ii to investigate the quality of the solutions obtained by the bo approach in management scenario 1 in section 4 2 the pareto optimal front resulted from the optimal locations and rates of the mixed hydraulic barriers for the three management scenarios introduced in section 2 6 were presented finally in section 4 3 the effectiveness of the optimal mixed hydraulic barrier remediation system in mitigating the swi was evaluated for a randomly selected pareto solution for management scenario 1 and compared to the natural intrusion condition furthermore the efficiency of the optimization process is assessed by the omission of each of the hydraulic barriers successively from the system and testing its impact on the objective and constraint functions 4 1 bayesian optimization and nsga ii the optimization problem of management scenario 1 using the proposed approaches of bo and nsga ii was solved the optimal well locations and optimal rates for the mixed hydraulic barriers remediation system were obtained to investigate the quality of the obtained solutions by both approaches the pareto fronts of the feasible solutions solutions that satisfy the constraints are plotted for the bo and nsga ii models in fig 4 the conflicting nature between the third objective total cost and either the first objective total salt mass or the second objective the average intrusion length of 50 can be concluded from the plots the first and second objectives were not in conflict with each other they were adopted to ensure that the management strategy is capable of the toe repulsion as well as mitigating the risk of increasing the total aquifer salinity due to trapping the salt landside at the end of the management period hence placing the positive barrier within the saltwater wedge may pose the potential of landside salt trapping ebeling et al 2019 moreover the salinity of the water used for injection may exaggerate this potential of salt trapping in fig 4 the bo approach succeeded to identify solutions on the pareto front in an exceptionally low number of function evaluations moreover the solutions with bo were well distributed along the approximated pareto front to evaluate the performance of bo against nsga ii quantitively three data analysis methods were used 1 calculating the hypervolume hv and generational distance gd which are the performance indicators for measuring convergence and diversity and for measuring how the current non dominated solutions are near to the optimal pareto front respectively 2 performing the one way analysis of variance anova test which provides evidence if there is a relationship between the means of the two pareto solution sets and 3 comparing between the data distribution of each approach by focusing on the spread a plot of hv with the number of expensive evaluations or simulations is shown in fig 5 a as can be seen despite nsga ii initially performing better than bo at a few learning cycles bo took the lead at the end of the bo optimization process of 350 evaluations 150 initial training data set 100 2 iterations the bo obtained better hypervolume which shows an increase of about 30 compared to nsga ii for a similar hypervolume the bo used 200 function evaluations which is very low compared to 2400 evaluations by nsga ii gd is based on calculating the sum of adjacent distances of solution sets obtained by each approach to the reference points liu et al 2019 the reference points represent the optimal pareto front which is not known a priori therefore all solutions attained by the two approaches were considered to find non dominated solutions these solutions were used as reference points for gd calculations song et al 2018 bo can efficiently improve the solutions without sacrificing the accuracy of pareto optimal solutions while maintaining good convergence and diversity as shown by its high hv and minimum gd values fig 5b anova test was executed for the solutions on the pareto optimal objective functions sets and the p value was calculated using scippy library the smaller the p value the more the null hypothesis is considered not likely to be true and is significant to reject our null hypothesis is that the sample bo approach results was derived from the parent population nsga ii approach in fisher s approach the threshold p value is considered 0 05 fisher 1992 the calculated p values for the three objectives were 0 37 0 43 and 0 34 respectively the p values are greater than 0 05 which illustrates that it is not statistically significant to reject the null hypothesis and there is convincing evidence to retain it the third data analysis was to explore the spread out of the bo feasible solutions on the approximated pareto front of the three objective functions relative to the nsga ii approach the ranges of the objectives that were obtained by nsga ii were from 22 to 205 tons for the total salt mass 0 to 433 m for the average intrusion length and 2187 to 7880 for the total cost similarly the ranges obtained by bo were 46 to 212 tons 0 to 477 m and 1879 to 7372 for the three objectives the analysis revealed that even though the number of solutions that were obtained by the bo approach was less than that in the nsga ii approach fig 4 the bo solutions could cover approximately the entire range of each objective the main purpose of using a surrogate model in conjunction with bo is to quickly converge to an approximate region of pareto optimal solutions allowing the needed computational time to be drastically reduced the nsga ii took about 371 h for 4000 evaluations and bo took only 19 34 h for 2 100 evaluations parallel computing to obtain approximately similar solutions and thus showing the efficiency and potential of bo in solving computationally expensive optimization problems however on the other side more computations were considered by bo for one iteration bo took around double the time invested by nsga ii table 3 shows the comparison between bo and nsga ii approaches in terms of the computational time performance indicators and the range of objectives values obtained by the pareto solution sets both approaches nsga ii and bo were able to find feasible solutions near the approximated pareto front the main advantage of bo is that it found feasible solutions in a very low number of function evaluations the search behavior of both approaches feasible and infeasible regions were illustrated in the supplementary material s5 4 2 different optimal management scenarios in this subsection we present the results of the three management scenarios the approximated pareto fronts achieved by the three management scenarios using the bo approach are presented in fig 6 it is worth mentioning that the number of attained optimal solutions for each management is different which corresponds to the complexity of the optimization problem the search on the rugged landscape and the wideness of the decision variable space the size of the non dominated feasible solution set of management scenario 2 is the largest and in contrast management scenario 1 has few optimal solutions the results show that management scenario 2 no regional abstractions outperforms the other two management scenarios in terms of the total cost which is expected because overexploitation is the main driver for swi management scenario 3 which forced the remediation management to extract a minimum amount of brackish water within the intrusion wedge led to an increase in the total cost compared to unrestricted wells rates in management scenario 1 the obtained results endorse the robustness of the bo approach and prove its capabilities to capture the behavior of swi under different management scenarios handle the constraints and provide optimal solutions fig 7 demonstrates the upper and lower bounds and the medians for the x coordinate y coordinate and the total flow q total inj q total abs for the injection and abstraction barriers obtained for each management scenario the x coordinate of the injection barriers fig 7a and the y coordinate of both injection and abstraction barriers for all the management scenarios showed no location prevalence such that the solutions took on different values covering the whole range of the variable fig 7b on the other hand the x coordinate of the abstraction hydraulic barriers for the optimal solutions of management scenarios 1 and 3 were obtained close to the sea fig 7a this result agrees with the literature that the abstraction barriers should be placed near the sea for more effective remediation ebeling et al 2019 mahesha 1996 pool and carrera 2010 however the results of management scenario 2 showed that the abstraction barriers can be located at different places covering roughly the whole design space fig 7a 7b this indicates that the feasible region is large which is the direct consequence of no abstractions the results of the total injection and abstraction rates showed that the injection has a greater influence on the efficiency of the mixed barrier remediation system than the abstraction fig 7c this is consistent with the findings of previous studies ebeling et al 2019 pool and carrera 2010 shi et al 2020 the required total discharge and recharge rates of the barriers for management scenario 2 are fairly low the medians are 20 and 564 m3 hr respectively fig 7c ceasing reducing the abstraction is the most beneficial and cost effective countermeasure to prevent further swi 4 3 analysis of approximated pareto optimal solution for management scenario 1 a solution from the approximated pareto front by bo of management scenario 1 was randomly selected with objective function values 79 4 109 g 128 76 m 4261 8 to evaluate the effectiveness of the optimized mixed hydraulic barriers remediation system to control swi fig 8 presents the concentration distribution at the bottom of the aquifer at the start and the end of the management period the salinity concentration at the locations of regional pumping wells did not exceed the imposed concentration constraint significant repulsion for the toe interface took place after the implementation of the optimal remediation measure the spatial distribution of the abstraction and injection hydraulic barriers is shown in fig 8 the injection barriers were placed within the saline wedge around the initial 50 isochlor with 85 of the total injected flow and the rest was injected inland away from the initial toe interface the abstraction barrier was close to the sea the velocity vectors emphasize the ability of the remediation system to shift back the hydraulic gradient towards the sea the injection has a significant contribution to the management strategy the rates of the hydraulic barriers are presented in table 4 two indices were calculated to quantify the transient remediation progress the 50 isochlor relative repulsion index ri50 and the relative total salt mass index mi ebeling et al 2019 ri50 calculates the incurred transient repulsion due to the remediation measure relative to the natural intrusion mi estimates the obtained reduction in the total salt mass relative to the natural total salt mass in the aquifer these indices can take positive values up to 1 which means reaching the natural intrusion condition while negative values indicate more deterioration in terms of saline water volume or further seawater encroachment and 0 refers to the initial condition just before the management starts their equations are expressed as 11 ri 50 l 0 l t l 0 l n 12 mi m 0 m t m 0 m n where l0 m0 lt mt ln mn are the intrusion length and the total salt mass at the start of remediation at time t from the start of remediation and under the natural condition respectively in the early stage the water level increased in the aquifer due to the injected water part of the flow retreated the intrusion and the other part flowed inland diluting the saline water however there was still an inland lateral flow from the sea this resulted in increasing the total salt mass within the aquifer until the overall flow turned towards the sea fig 9 the mixed hydraulic barriers system precluded further swi advances pushed the saline wedge towards the sea and succeeded to repel the intrusion to reach an average length that exceeded the natural intrusion condition by 21 3 of its length fig 9 after approximately 1 year from the implementation of the management strategy the system could generate a seaward hydraulic gradient and by the end of the management period the aquifer recovered from the salinization by 79 2 to achieve the natural condition the efficiency of the optimization is assessed by analyzing the adverse effect on the remediation measure of removing each barrier successively from the mixed hydraulic barriers system this provides a measure of the contribution of each barrier to the improvement of the remediation table 4 illustrates the impact on the total salt mass the intrusion length and the maximum salinity at the regional pumping wells caused by the omission of each barrier bw2 injection barrier with the highest rate had the strongest influence on swi mitigation while the bw6 abstraction barrier had the least effect the resulting evolution of the salinity at the hydraulic barriers due to the application of the remediation system and when the barrier is omitted is presented in fig 10 it can be seen from fig 10 and table 4 that bw 1 is capable of reducing the aquifer salinity and pushing the seawater interface towards the coast such that on its removal the salinity increased by 23 and seawater invasion expanded by 24 fig 10a however the quality of the used treated wastewater caused contamination to the aquifer where its salinity is higher than the natural groundwater salinity the influence of each positive barrier corresponds to its rate the higher the injection rate the greater the improvement is as shown for bw 2 fig 10b bw 3 fig 10c bw 4 fig 10d and bw 5 fig 10e the negative barrier bw 6 experienced a relatively sharp decline in the early stage of its operation fig 10f however after a short period the salinity rose again then it showed a similar decline trend in the salinity to that of the scenario of its removal from the remediation system with a slight decrease the later rise in the salinity is due to the depression cone generated by the pumping where at a certain point with further drawdown it withdrew seawater causing more contamination this phenomenon was also reported by pool and carrera 2010 in their study of using double negative barriers as a corrective measure to control swi in low dynamic aquifers the lateral seawater flux resulting from the drawdowns of the pumping wells reduces the system s efficiency at the late remediation stage the positive barrier has a relatively small impact on the remediation improvement by less than 5 in terms of the salinity volume and impeding the intrusion the assessment proved that the solution is efficiently optimized since deterioration was observed after discarding any of the barriers 5 discussion evolutionary algorithms and bayesian optimization are two well known research fields in optimization they have a similar structure including initialization evaluation of the black box function at a given sample point and update to the current search seeking improvement in the next iteration the process is repeated until reaching the termination criterion the difference between them is in the update strategy to the search nsga ii which belongs to evolutionary algorithms uses a population based search that relies on crossover and mutation operators and diversity mechanisms to avoid getting trapped in local minima deb et al 2002 this results in nsga ii tending to need a huge number of evaluations to converge to the exact pareto front bo is based on learning from the previous samples and selecting the next samples by the optimization of the acquisition function jones et al 1998 bo requires only a few expensive evaluations compared to nsga ii yang et al 2019a this is due to its reliance on gpr and the acquisition function gpr is a machine learning probabilistic model that replaces the high fidelity simulation model learns from previous evaluations about the relationship between the evaluation functions and the decision vectors and allows fast evaluations of a great number of candidates within the optimization process of the acquisition function the acquisition function uses the gpr models evaluations and the associated uncertainty to evaluate the performance improvement and guides the choice of the next samples via its optimization therefore it is suitable for optimizing swi management problems that rely on computationally expensive functions the hv and gd indicators as performance indicators showed the superiority of the bo compared to nsga ii at the later stage of the search under a few evaluations fig 5 therefore the main benefits of the bo approach are 1 accounting for the uncertainty in the predictions that offers a search efficient alternative through exploration searching unexplored regions where the prediction has high uncertainty and exploitation searching regions where the prediction is minimum when selecting the new promising sample shahriari et al 2016 by the acquisition function and 2 providing solutions on the approximated pareto front with the least number of expensive evaluations conversely the consumed time for generating candidate solutions by bo is significantly higher than nsga ii for each iteration table 3 maximizing the acquisition function to generate candidate solutions is a time consuming procedure daulton et al 2020 yang et al 2019b however this time is relatively insignificant compared to the simulation time required for evaluating the expensive black box functions nsga ii took a fixed amount of time because it required less computation than bo per iteration the drawback of the proposed algorithm is the pre assignment for the required number of hydraulic barriers i e the number of hydraulic barriers is not a decision variable the traditional gp based bo cannot be implemented when the optimization function is based on a variant number of decision vectors however swi management problems often have the total cost as one of the objective functions and it relies on the number of hydraulic barriers recently chugh and ymeraj 2022 proposed an extension to the applicability of multi objective bayesian optimization to overcome this limitation based on the results of three different management scenarios it was shown that there are no specific spatial configurations for wells and pumping injection rates that can be provided as a one solution fits all fig 7 this agrees with the literature where placing the abstraction hydraulic barriers seaside and the injection barriers inland e g shi et al 2020 or vice versa e g ebeling et al 2019 were both used for the injection abstraction remediation system a well designed mixed barrier system taking into consideration the hydrogeological and geological aquifer conditions needs many combinations of the barrier rates and locations to choose the best one among them consequently it is necessary to identify an optimal management strategy instead of testing limited combinations as has been done in previous studies 6 conclusions this study evaluated the application of a constrained multi objective bayesian optimization approach to control seawater intrusion in a coastal aquifer the approach was based on both gpr as a surrogate model for each objective and constraint function and qehvi as an acquisition function to find the optimal well locations and rates for the mixed hydraulic barriers system to mitigate the swi the main conclusions that can be deduced from the results of the optimization approach are as follows 1 the bo approach minimized the objective functions and satisfied the constraints with a limited number of simulations providing a high quality pareto solution set which is comparable to nsga ii results under relatively unrestricted computational effort in terms of the hypervolume and the diversity of the pareto solutions such performance led to a 95 saving in the computational runtime this proves its applicability to real world coastal aquifer management problems which involve computationally expensive variable density groundwater models 2 for a similar number of evaluations bo is better in terms of data efficiency where it has a higher rate of hypervolume improvement and or lower generational distance i e a better quality of the pareto solutions however more computation time per evaluation is required as a result it is good to use evolutionary algorithms for problems where evaluating candidate solutions takes minimal time and bos for more computationally expensive problems 3 the optimal locations and rates for the abstraction and injection wells of mixed hydraulic barriers can take on different values within the entire design space efficient optimization can identify the best locations and rates considering the aquifer characteristics the main findings from the implementation of different management scenarios for the design of the mixed hydraulic barriers are as follows 1 the injection barriers offer higher control over the remediation measure in terms of the intrusion length and the total salt mass in the aquifer the higher the injection rate the greater the influence is on the swi mitigation 2 attention should be paid to the quality of the injected water and the location of the injection recharging the aquifer with treated wastewater which has a salinity that exceeds the salinity of natural groundwater would lead to the contamination of the freshwater even though it may repel the swi a constraint needs to be imposed on the potential locations for the injection barriers in the proposed management to avoid the risk of local contamination 3 the main advantage of the abstraction of brackish water is its role as an alternative freshwater resource where the abstracted water can be desalinated at less cost than seawater 4 the abstraction barriers seem to be more effective in the early stage of the implementation rather than at a later stage when the generated depression cones may start to withdraw seawater causing saltwater to flow laterally inland and increase the salinity in summary the bayesian optimization approach proved to be a reliable and accurate approach for seawater intrusion control models and could be incorporated into the simulation optimization framework of coastal management problems future research will focus on the application of the bo approach to real world coastal management optimization problems credit authorship contribution statement samia saad

3154,sustainable urban drainage is an economically expensive necessity partially due to the operation of water pumps reliable forecasting of stormwater response following a rainfall event has the potential to reduce those expenses because it can be used in model predictive control schemes that optimize the energy consumption of pumps significantly better than the commonly applied real time control systems urban drainage systems are traditionally designed around highly complex deterministic models where an assessment of the uncertainty of the stormwater forecast is either absent or relies on computation heavy simulations with offset in a danish stormwater tunnel we propose a much faster but reliable non linear continuous discrete time state space model based on stochastic differential equations which can generate probabilistic forecasts that contain complete information about the distribution of uncertainty we explain step by step how the model structure is built from simple physical assumptions then how the parameters are estimated from maximum likelihood principles and finally we demonstrate the forecasting capabilities of the model we believe this model would be well suited for a subsequent model predictive control scheme keywords stormwater forecasting non linear stochastic differential equations linear reservoir models probabilistic forecasting urban

crucial for the prevention of floods caused by heavy rainfall events adams 2000 if the dynamics of water flow in a system is well described it is possible to design the system in such a way that the expected abundance of flood is minimized to some level deemed acceptable e g to a 10 year event or 100 year event schmitt et al 2004 however there are considerable financial costs associated with the management of stormwater for example the costs of stormwater management in california have been estimated to 700 million annually efc sacramento 2020 a significant part of the costs can be attributed to the energy consumption for operation of drain pumps goldstein and smith 2002 fecarotta et al 2018 which is usually governed by real time control schemes that act based on the current state of the system schütze et al 2002 however this practice is neither optimal with respect to energy consumption nor the price dynamics of the energy market instead forecasting based control schemes like model predictive control mpc morari and lee 1999 may be applied to reduce operational costs staden 2011 lund et al 2018 such schemes require reliable forecasting of the timing and scales of stormwater events and hence there is a great potential in developing forecasting models for stormwater systems in practice state of the art modeling of urban drainage and sewer systems features deterministic methods implemented in software solutions like mike urban wolfgang rauch et al 2002 in such frameworks a large set of partial differential equations describing the complex system of often thousands of sewer links manholes and basins is solved numerically however this approach has a few obvious drawbacks first it is computationally expensive which is a problem in the case where updated forecasts are requested more frequently than model output can be computed hansen et al 2014 therefore it might be beneficial to look for computationally cheaper options in the form of much simpler models secondly a deterministic forecast does not carry any immediate information about the uncertainty this is not ideal because a proper modelling of the uncertainty has the potential to dramatically reduce the risk of making a wrong decision hsu et al 2012 deterministic methods can handle this by feeding a range of perturbed inputs to the model and letting it propagate through time thus generating a set of scenarios to represent the uncertainty borup et al 2015 however this solution obviously suffers inherently from run time issues alternatively stochastic differential equations sdes can be used to model the uncertainty as well as the physical aspects of the system at the same time and thus constitute a method for probabilistic forecasting bechmann et al 2000 in this paper we will consider the damhus tunnel system a danish stormwater tunnel not separated from the local wastewater sewer system jensen and bering 2017 based on ideas of breinholt et al 2011 our key contribution is the development of a non linear sde based state space model for probabilistic forecasting of the stormwater response in the damhus tunnel that can be used as a base for applied mpc in future studies section 2 describes materials and methods section 3 explains the modelling process including choice of model structure estimation forecasting and forecast evaluation with respect to a prominent deterministic method in section 4 the results are presented a discussion of the results follows in section 5 and finally section 6 concludes 2 materials and methods this case study features the damhus tunnel in copenhagen that accumulates stormwater from an approximately 47 km 2 large area called the damhus catchment for the future simply referred to as the tunnel and the catchment respectively previously the drainage system of the catchment consisted solely of combined sewers which insufficient maximum capacity occasionally led to very expensive floods e g in july 2011 therefore the damhus tunnel was constructed in 2017 to counter such events offering an extra capacity of 29000 m 3 it is connected to the combined sewer system via an overflow structure named the middle link a simplified description of the full system in consideration is shown in fig 1 and further elaborated on in section 3 this system has previously been used for development of a data assimilation scheme for urban drainage tunnels palmitessa et al 2021 2 1 data the data used for modelling includes measurements from the damhus tunnel of water levels in meters above sea level m dvr and pump flows in m 3 min as well as rainfall measured in μ m s from two rain gauges installed at two different locations in the catchment see table 1 and fig 1 this data set spans five months of 2018 from august 1st to december 31st and contains 7 rainfall events where stormwater appeared in the tunnel all the time series are available in 1 min resolution furthermore we have access to a highly complex mike urban model of the entire catchment that enables simulation of deterministic rainfall response for comparison more details about the tunnel the rainfall events and the mike urban model are included in supplementary material 2 2 methods the modelling framework consists of model structure selection parameter estimation forecasting forecast evaluation and finally an assessment of the advantages and disadvantages associated with the proposed model throughout the case study we apply stochastic differential equations sdes øksendal 2003 as the building blocks for any model in consideration a generic sde describing the evolution of a state variable x t can be formulated 1 d x t f x t u t t d t g x t t d w t where f is called the drift term g is called the diffusion term u t is the vector of inputs and w t is a standard wiener process wiener 1923 it is often necessary to model more than one state variable in which case several sdes are formulated and coupled to form a set of sdes the dynamics of the system is conveniently described in continuous time by the set of sdes whereas the data is almost always available in discrete time most often also only a subset of or a function h of the states are measured which gives rise the observation equation 2 y k h x t k e k e k n 0 σ e where y k is the observation at time t k together the set of sdes and the observation equation constitute a continuous discrete time state space model johansson et al 1999 which we will commonly refer to as an sde model we use the open software ctsm r for estimation of the parameters of the model which is based on the log likelihood and the extended kalman filter juhl 2020 we also apply the lamperti transform to the system of sdes prior to estimation in order to be able to let g x t t in eq 1 be state dependent because ctsm r only accepts additive and state independent system noise møller and madsen 2010 for forecasting of y at time k l i e y k l k we use the estimated sde model to propagate forward in time with stochastic euler simulation pardoux and talay 1985 this is repeated m times such that an m dimensional ensemble is created this ensemble is then considered a representation of the forecast distribution zhu 2005 and is effectively a probabilistic forecast gneiting and katzfuss 2014 the performance of the probabilistic forecasts issued by the sde model is then evaluated against the corresponding deterministic forecasts generated from the mike urban model 3 modelling 3 1 physical drainage system overview the full process of rainfall runoff from precipitation to accumulated waste and stormwater at the wastewater treatment plant wwtp can be divided into 6 steps 1 the water hits the ground surface in the catchment 2 it runs off along the ground surface to reach the combined sewer system 3 it flows through the combined sewer system to reach the overflow structure middle link 4 if the water in the overflow structure is above a certain crest level it flows into the tunnel otherwise it continues downstream through the combined sewer towards the sarcophagus 5 water that has entered the tunnel flows downstream to the storage tower at the end bottle bridge 6 the water is pumped from the downstream end of the tunnel to the sarcophagus where it is merged with the sewage from the combined sewer cf step 4 and everything then flows towards the wwtp this breakdown of the process already reveals two important features of the system firstly there are several different time constants reflecting how long it takes for the stormwater to discharge through the different phases secondly the crest in step 4 introduces a non linearity to the system because it means that only sufficiently strong rain events will cause water to enter the tunnel while minor rain events will not 3 2 water volume as response variable ultimately the water level in the tunnel must be controlled such that flooding events are prevented hence the immediate idea would be to model the water level at any given time an approach well demonstrated by breinholt et al 2011 however water levels are not conserved in an intuitive way between different parts of the physical system but water volumes are since the volume is proportional to the mass choosing water volume as the response variable makes it straight forward to base the model on mass balance equations which have a very intuitive physical interpretation from a time series of minutely water level measurements where the completely filled tunnel was being fully emptied we know very precisely the relationship between the water level and volume in the tunnel making transformation between these two domains easy see fig 2 hence the water level can always be reconstructed whenever it is needed furthermore all water volumes will be modelled in units of 1000 m 3 because estimation of the sde model tends to be easier when the order of magnitude of the numbers concerned is not too high 3 3 continuous discrete time state space model we shall formulate a continuous discrete time state space model johansson et al 1999 that can be estimated from the available data first consider an arbitrary sewer pipe let x i t be a random variable that represents water volume at location i in the pipe at time t and let k be an associated time constant i e the average time it takes the water to flow from one end of the pipe to the other then the flow may be described by a linear reservoir model lrm pedersen et al 1980 of order n where the pipe is represented by a series of n reservoirs with the water content of each reservoir being a state the water then flows from one state to the next with the rate n k see fig 3 ideally the system consists of an infinite number of infinitely small reservoirs but in practice only a limited number of reservoirs is needed because we are modelling water volumes the dynamics of the i th reservoir can now be described by a mass balance equation typically formulated as 3 d x i t n k x i 1 t n k x i t d t in order to model the entire damhus system we will consider the ground surface the combined sewer and the tunnel as three different pipes each characterized by a time constant k 1 k 2 and k 3 respectively and use this idea to construct a state space model consisting of three connected lrms each with 2 states amounting to a total of 6 states the decision on the number of states per lrm was based on preliminary studies the time variable is considered in units of hours and hence the three time constants also have units of hours regarding the input to the system it is assumed that the amount of stormwater reaching the ground surface at time t is proportional to the rainfall intensity u t with the proportionality constant being the effective area a so the inflow is au t this assumption was shown to be reliable by breinholt et al 2011 the mass balance for the first state x 1 of the lrm representing the ground surface thus becomes 4 d x 1 t au t 2 k 1 x 1 t d t here a and u t are given in units of km 2 and mm h respectively and hence au t is in units of 1000 m 3 h as desired u t is taken as the average of the rainfall at the two measurement locations at time t converted to mm h see table 1 the mass balances for x 2 and x 3 inherit the form in eq 3 at x 4 which represents the volume in the overflow structure we address the non linearity caused by the crest between the combined sewer and the tunnel the discharge from x 4 should reflect that only if the amount of water exceeds some threshold corresponding to the crest level water will start flowing rapidly into the tunnel this can be accomplished by attributing a special time constant k 0 to the overflow and multiplying the overflow specific discharge 1 k 0 x 4 t with a sigmoid function 5 q x 1 1 exp α x β where α determines the sharpness such that for α q x approaches a step function and β is the threshold where the step occurs meanwhile some discharge from x 4 downstream to the sarcophagus will always take place which is attributed to k 2 hence we get 6 d x 4 t 2 k 2 x 3 t 2 k 2 q x 4 t 1 k 0 x 4 t d t the mass balance for x 5 which represents the upstream part of the tunnel inherits the form in eq 3 except the inflow is multiplied by 1 k 0 q x 4 t 7 d x 5 t 1 k 0 q x 4 t x 4 t 1 k 3 x 5 t d t the last state x 6 represents the water volume at the end of the tunnel here there is no discharge and the water accumulates until it is pumped out or the tunnel is filled the mass balance equation is 8 d x 6 t 1 k 3 x 5 t p t d t where p t is the pumping intensity at time t this is an input signal which depends on several factors in the real system for this study we use the pumping data at hand as a simplification i e p t is taken as the total pump flow at time t converted to 1000 m 3 h see table 1 this has the awkward drawback of allowing the water volume to drop below 0 in order to ensure that such an occurrence never happens p t is multiplied by q x 6 t with α 200 and β 0 05 cf eq 5 we denote this function q p x finally the diffusion terms in eq 1 must be selected the simplest option is additive diffusion i e g i x i t σ i for all i however breinholt et al 2011 demonstrated that state proportional diffusion is the better option for flow modelling i e g i x i t σ i x i this causes the system noise to grow with larger volumes and converge to zero for smaller volumes consequently no water volume state can attain any negative values which keeps the system consistent with physics therefore the latter option is chosen the diffusion constants σ i may be modelled as unique for each i or with some of them being identical to one another here the distinction is made based on physical assumptions about the sources of system noise firstly it is assumed a part of the system noise is attributed to the rainfall input which enters the system in eq 4 for this reason σ 1 is considered to be unique secondly the remaining system noise is assumed to be attributed to random variation in the water flow which is not captured by the drift term of the model we assume that this source of system noise is approximately the same throughout the entire drainage process and is hence only characterized by one diffusion constant σ 2 hence the full system description becomes 9 d x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 t au t 2 k 1 x 1 t 2 k 1 x 1 t 2 k 1 x 2 t 2 k 1 x

table 2 of section 4 3 4 estimation for estimation of parameters we base our approach on the commonly applied minimization of the negative log likelihood madsen and thyregod 2010 11 ℓ θ y n 1 2 log 2 π 1 2 k 0 n 1 log σ k 1 k 2 y k 1 y k 1 k σ k 1 k 2 where θ a α β k 0 k 1 k 2 k 3 σ 1 σ 2 σ e is the vector of model parameters first of all we consider a 5 min resolution of the data set instead of 1 min resolution preliminary studies have shown that the resulting estimates do not change significantly and the computational time gain is huge secondly instead of minimizing the regular log likelihood we make two suitable changes the first change is attributed to the impact of small observations while the data contain a lot of observations with values close to 0 we are primarily concerned about obtaining a model that can accurately predict the system load when water is present and therefore we want to put less emphasis on prediction of the former this is accomplished by adding a variance contribution to σ k 1 k 2 that has the largest effect on small observations 12 σ k 1 k 2 σ k 1 k 2 a y k 1 k b where a and b are both chosen to be 0 1 the second change aims to give special attention to an accurate modelling of the stormwater response time i e the delay from rainfall to measurable water in the tunnel during optimization the regular log likelihood may very well compromise w r t this feature for the sake of a seemingly better fit overall and therefore we add an extra penalty to eq 11 of the form y k 1 y k 1 k 2 y k 1 c with c 0 01 which penalizes a misspecified response time hard the purpose of c is to avoid division by zero hence the modified negative log likelihood becomes 13 ℓ θ y n 1 2 log 2 π 1 2 k 0 n 1 log σ k 1 k 2 y k 1 y k 1 k 2 σ k 1 k 2 y k 1 y k 1 k 2 y k 1 c the total data set includes 7 rain events from 2018 cf section 2 for estimation we select 6 events deemed sufficient to span the variation of the system and one event for subsequent evaluation of the estimated model prior to estimation based on the 6 training events we apply leave one out cross validation cawley et al 2003 to ensure approximately unbiased parameter estimates to obtain the 1 step predictions needed for the log likelihood function it is necessary to apply an extended kalman filter brok et al 2018 however because the extended kalman filter in ctsm r only accepts additive and state independent diffusion the form in eq 9 can not be estimated instead let z z 1 z 6 be a new multivariate random variable we then apply a lamperti transform møller and madsen 2010 to the system such that 14 z i log x i i hence we get a new system description of the form 15 d z t f d t g d w t with 16 f au t e z 1 t 2 k 1 σ 1 2 2 2 k 1 e z 1 t z 2 t 2 k 1 σ 2 2 2 2 k 1 e z 2 t z 3 t 2 k 2 σ 2

except with no x i thus the diffusion of eq 15 is additive and allows for application of the extended kalman filter the physical parameters are invariant under this transformation hence they can be estimated as in eq 16 and the fitted values of z i can be back transformed to x i by 17 x i e z i i a detailed calculation of the lamperti transform can be found in the supplementary material finally the modified negative log likelihood in eq 13 is optimized using the nlminb function in r such optimization routines tend to converge more robustly if all the parameters are on a similar scale for this reason we let nlminb optimize over the log transformed parameters the parameter estimates in the original domain can thus be restored by taking the exponential of the result of the optimization see the supplementary material for a summary of the estimation framework in the form of r code 3 5 forecasting and forecast evaluation the fitted sde model is now evaluated by letting it forecast the stormwater response in the test event we shall use two different forecasting setups the first setup features probabilistic forecasts with a moving l step horizon which is the setup we have in mind for an mpc application in future studies the second setup is a forecast of the full scenario given only the rainfall input and the initial conditions the purpose of this is to compare the performance of the probabilistic sde model to the deterministic mike urban model first we cover the moving l step forecasts based on the fitted sde model using an extended kalman filter we can reconstruct the full time series for all 6 states these can then be used as initial conditions for forward euler simulation of the model using the input series of the test set we then save all the l step forecasts generated this way as a single series of l step forecasts by repeating that exercise m times an ensemble of m members is obtained from which predictive distributions can be extracted and used as probabilistic forecasts bjerregård et al 2021 secondly we would like to evaluate the sde model against the mike urban model however we can not directly compare with the moving l step forecasts from the sde model because mike urban just simulates the full event based on rainfall input and can not benefit from new observations or start the simulation in the middle of the event instead to ensure the most fair comparison we let the sde model forecast the full event with no extended kalman filter updates and hence it only depends on the rainfall input like mike urban furthermore we remove the pumping signal from the scenario i e set p t 0 for all t which is equivalent to forecasting the accumulated inflow of stormwater this is due to the fact that the real pumping signal is not properly modelled in either model so forecasting the instantaneous stormwater volume is not practical under these conditions we generate a deterministic forecast series with mike urban and a probabilistic forecast series with the sde model in order to evaluate the two competing models we introduce the continuous ranked probability score crps matheson and winkler 1976 18 crps f l 0 y l f l 0 x i x y l 2 d x with f l 0 being the empirical cumulative distribution function c d f pitman 1999 of the forecast and i being the indicator function this metric is usually applied to probabilistic forecasts but is equally applicable to deterministic forecasts as well gneiting and raftery 2007 in the latter case the c d f becomes a step function the overall crps is obtained by applying eq 18 to every l step forecast and compute the average as a second metric we use the well known root mean square error rmse 19 rmse y l 0 y l 1 n l 1 n y l y l 0 2 when applying rmse to a probabilistic forecast y l 0 in eq 19 is taken as the mean of the m ensemble members summarized we use the fitted sde model to generate probabilistic forecasts of both the actual stormwater response and the accumulated inflow the former are moving l step forecasts based on adaptive state estimation intended for integration into an mpc framework the latter constitute a full event simulation which is used for evaluation against the deterministic mike urban model under the crps and rmse metrics 4 results the parameter estimates of eq 9 with 95 confidence intervals cis are listed in table 2 notably a 6 02 km 2 is reasonable w r t to the total catchment area of 47 km 2 because only hard surfaces like roads and roofs really contribute to the sewer inflow while green areas like parks and gardens do not the sum of the four time constants is 3 57 h and is interpreted as the total travel time of rainfall runoff which is also reasonable see fig 4 the 95 cis were first computed as symmetric wald confidence intervals in the logarithmic domain where the parameters were estimated and were then converted to 95 cis in the original parameter domain by taking the exponential the standard errors of the parameter estimates in the logarithmic domain were derived from the diagonal elements of the inverse hessian of the modified negative log likelihood under the assumption that the latter can be approximated by a second order polynomial around the optimum madsen and thyregod 2010 this assumption only holds true for parameter estimates not on the boundary hence some of the standard errors could not be estimated and we have simply reported the associated 95 cis as na a probabilistic forecast series of the stormwater response in the test event is shown in fig 4 top it is generated by m 10000 realizations of the fitted sde model and the forecast horizon is 1 h i e l 12 fig 4 center displays a full simulation of the accumulated stormwater inflow in the same test event based on rainfall input only it features a comparison of the probabilistic sde model forecasts with the deterministic mike urban forecasts the sde model is here represented by the mean and 95 prediction interval of the forecast series the sample size is again m 10000 the crps and rmse of the two forecasting models are listed in table 3 the sde model scores slightly better than mike urban under the rmse and clearly better under the crps the rainfall series of the test event is shown in fig 4 bottom run time considerations and tests are included in the supplementary material 5 discussion in this paper we have motivated developed and estimated an sde based linear reservoir model with a non linear extension we have used the estimated model to forecast the stormwater response in the damhus tunnel for a rainfall event unknown to the estimation process for this test case we have found that the model performs promisingly at 1 h ahead forecasting and that it is competitive with respect to the mike urban model of the damhus system when full event simulations are compared the 1 h ahead forecasts are strong in the sense that the observations generally fall within the 95 prediction interval while the forecast distributions are reasonably sharp at the same time hence the uncertainty of the forecasts is well captured at this horizon the reasoning behind the choice of horizon is linked to the future goal of being able to apply mpc to the system the mpc could take advantage of the hourly changes in energy market prices when optimizing the timing and intensity of the pumping activity for a proof of concept 1 h horizons are therefore considered to be relevant but future studies may very well reveal shorter or longer horizons to be of higher importance more details on the forecast horizons of interest are included in the supplementary material every 1 h ahead probabilistic forecast was generated in less than a second which makes the model very feasible for non linear mpc because a control scheme would rely on minutely or coarser data updates the full event simulation setup shows that the response dynamics of the sde model can compete with the much more complex mike urban model both the sde model and mike urban hit the response time from rainfall to stormwater in the tunnel convincingly however they also both overestimate the accumulated response which could be an indication that the rainfall input series is over representing the actual rainfall event when compared to the performance of the moving l step setup this really emphasizes the strength of being able to adaptively estimate the states of the system because over or underpredicted rainfall responses can be corrected for according to the rmse and crps the sde model outperforms mike urban at least in this particular test event the difference is most noticeable under the crps which is a consequence of the sde model taking the uncertainty into account this again goes to show the potential of probabilistic forecasts over deterministic forecasts it is a key finding that the introduction of a simple sigmoid function to resemble the crest at the overflow structure is enough to account for the otherwise strong non linearity although the crest volume itself has proven somewhat tricky to estimate the biggest liability with respect to estimation of the model in its current shape is the input since the catchment area is relatively large and the amount of rainfall sensors limited the measured input is not guaranteed to be proportional to the actual input which in turn makes the effective catchment area and the overflow crest difficult to estimate from data consistently across different rainfall events this problem could either be solved by increasing the number and spread of rain gauges in the catchment or by introducing considerable noise on the input as already discussed however adaptive state estimation alone can compensate for input uncertainties quite well another potential improvement would be to include additional observations at other locations in the system to increase the level of information especially measurements reflecting some of the states upstream of the tunnel could be useful as in the current setup there is no information about the upstream states as long as no water has overflowed to the tunnel this may also help estimating the crest volume more reliably furthermore to keep it simple the tunnel as modelled is not bounded from above even though the physical tunnel does have a maximum capacity indeed in the full event simulation the upper sections in the uncertainty band of the sde forecasts tend to exceed the maximum capacity of 29000 m 3 long term in a control scheme a forecast that exceeds the physical upper bound should then translate into the same control action that a forecast equal to the physical bound would in this study we have restricted ourselves to a model with a fixed set of parameters where the success criterion is a model fit that is capable of producing reasonable probabilistic forecasts a future study focusing on analysis of the parameters could lead to a deeper understanding of the capabilities and shortcomings of the model and hence be grounds for improvements some examples of such analyses are the influence of the individual parameters assessment of which parameters can be neglected as well as comparison with analogous parameters in other stormwater models generalization of the model framework to other sewer systems should be possible although the specific model developed in this paper is tailored to the damhus case it is built from flexible and case independent principles porting the model framework to a new sewer system would require an initial qualified guess on the number of reservoirs time constants and crest functions it would also require a basic physical understanding on how to properly embed these building bricks in the sdes along with precipitation and pumping inputs we believe that finding inspiration in our case specific model would go a long way in accomplishing the above all in all the damhus case definitely demonstrates that linear reservoir models can be generalized to non linear systems and coupled with the sde structure we have provided the first stepping stone towards a smarter pumping control scheme in the damhus system 6 conclusion we have successfully developed a non linear continuous discrete time state space model for forecasting of rainfall response in a stormwater tunnel the model is built from stochastic differential equations and is thus capable of producing probabilistic forecasts when compared with deterministic forecasts from the mike urban software the probabilistic forecasts generated by the sde model are very competitive we have also demonstrated that the sde model performs promisingly on 1 h horizons thanks to the adaptive state estimation by the extended kalman filter further since the probabilistic forecasts provide complete information about the uncertainty and can be generated in a matter of seconds we believe this model is well suited for integration with a future model predictive control scheme for the associated pumping system

3154,sustainable urban drainage is an economically expensive necessity partially due to the operation of water pumps reliable forecasting of stormwater response following a rainfall event has the potential to reduce those expenses because it can be used in model predictive control schemes that optimize the energy consumption of pumps significantly better than the commonly applied real time control systems urban drainage systems are traditionally designed around highly complex deterministic models where an assessment of the uncertainty of the stormwater forecast is either absent or relies on computation heavy simulations with offset in a danish stormwater tunnel we propose a much faster but reliable non linear continuous discrete time state space model based on stochastic differential equations which can generate probabilistic forecasts that contain complete information about the distribution of uncertainty we explain step by step how the model structure is built from simple physical assumptions then how the parameters are estimated from maximum likelihood principles and finally we demonstrate the forecasting capabilities of the model we believe this model would be

crucial for the prevention of floods caused by heavy rainfall events adams 2000 if the dynamics of water flow in a system is well described it is possible to design the system in such a way that the expected abundance of flood is minimized to some level deemed acceptable e g to a 10 year event or 100 year event schmitt et al 2004 however there are considerable financial costs associated with the management of stormwater for example the costs of stormwater management in california have been estimated to 700 million annually efc sacramento 2020 a significant part of the costs can be attributed to the energy consumption for operation of drain pumps goldstein and smith 2002 fecarotta et al 2018 which is usually governed by real time control schemes that act based on the current state of the system schütze et al 2002 however this practice is neither optimal with respect to energy consumption nor the price dynamics of the energy market instead forecasting based control schemes like model predictive control mpc morari and lee 1999 may be applied to reduce operational costs staden 2011 lund et al 2018 such schemes require reliable forecasting of the timing and scales of stormwater events and hence there is a great potential in developing forecasting models for stormwater systems in practice state of the art modeling of urban drainage and sewer systems features deterministic methods implemented in software solutions like mike urban wolfgang rauch et al 2002 in such frameworks a large set of partial differential equations describing the complex system of often thousands of sewer links manholes and basins is solved numerically however this approach has a few obvious drawbacks first it is computationally expensive which is a problem in the case where updated forecasts are requested more frequently than model output can be computed hansen et al 2014 therefore it might be beneficial to look for computationally cheaper options in the form of much simpler models secondly a deterministic forecast does not carry any immediate information about the uncertainty this is not ideal because a proper modelling of the uncertainty has the potential to dramatically reduce the risk of making a wrong decision hsu et al 2012 deterministic methods can handle this by feeding a range of perturbed inputs to the model and letting it propagate through time thus generating a set of scenarios to represent the uncertainty borup et al 2015 however this solution obviously suffers inherently from run time issues alternatively stochastic differential equations sdes can be used to model the uncertainty as well as the physical aspects of the system at the same time and thus constitute a method for probabilistic forecasting bechmann et al 2000 in this paper we will consider the damhus tunnel system a danish stormwater tunnel not separated from the local wastewater sewer system jensen and bering 2017 based on ideas of breinholt et al 2011 our key contribution is the development of a non linear sde based state space model for probabilistic forecasting of the stormwater response in the damhus tunnel that can be used as a base for applied mpc in future studies section 2 describes materials and methods section 3 explains the modelling process including choice of model structure estimation forecasting and forecast evaluation with respect to a prominent deterministic method in section 4 the results are presented a discussion of the results follows in section 5 and finally section 6 concludes 2 materials and methods this case study features the damhus tunnel in copenhagen that accumulates stormwater from an approximately 47 km 2 large area called the damhus catchment for the future simply referred to as the tunnel and the catchment respectively previously the drainage system of the catchment consisted solely of combined sewers which insufficient maximum capacity occasionally led to very expensive floods e g in july 2011 therefore the damhus tunnel was constructed in 2017 to counter such events offering an extra capacity of 29000 m 3 it is connected to the combined sewer system via an overflow structure named the middle link a simplified description of the full system in consideration is shown in fig 1 and further elaborated on in section 3 this system has previously been used for development of a data assimilation scheme for urban drainage tunnels palmitessa et al 2021 2 1 data the data used for modelling includes measurements from the damhus tunnel of water levels in meters above sea level m dvr and pump flows in m 3 min as well as rainfall measured in μ m s from two rain gauges installed at two different locations in the catchment see table 1 and fig 1 this data set spans five months of 2018 from august 1st to december 31st and contains 7 rainfall events where stormwater appeared in the tunnel all the time series are available in 1 min resolution furthermore we have access to a highly complex mike urban model of the entire catchment that enables simulation of deterministic rainfall response for comparison more details about the tunnel the rainfall events and the mike urban model are included in supplementary material 2 2 methods the modelling framework consists of model structure selection parameter estimation forecasting forecast evaluation and finally an assessment of the advantages and disadvantages associated with the proposed model throughout the case study we apply stochastic differential equations sdes øksendal 2003 as the building blocks for any model in consideration a generic sde describing the evolution of a state variable x t can be formulated 1 d x t f x t u t t d t g x t t d w t where f is called the drift term g is called the diffusion term u t is the vector of inputs and w t is a standard wiener process wiener 1923 it is often necessary to model more than one state variable in which case several sdes are formulated and coupled to form a set of sdes the dynamics of the system is conveniently described in continuous time by the set of sdes whereas the data is almost always available in discrete time most often also only a subset of or a function h of the states are measured which gives rise the observation equation 2 y k h x t k e k e k n 0 σ e where y k is the observation at time t k together the set of sdes and the observation equation constitute a continuous discrete time state space model johansson et al 1999 which we will commonly refer to as an sde model we use the open software ctsm r for estimation of the parameters of the model which is based on the log likelihood and the extended kalman filter juhl 2020 we also apply the lamperti transform to the system of sdes prior to estimation in order to be able to let g x t t in eq 1 be state dependent because ctsm r only accepts additive and state independent system noise møller and madsen 2010 for forecasting of y at time k l i e y k l k we use the estimated sde model to propagate forward in time with stochastic euler simulation pardoux and talay 1985 this is repeated m times such that an m dimensional ensemble is created this ensemble is then considered a representation of the forecast distribution zhu 2005 and is effectively a probabilistic forecast gneiting and katzfuss 2014 the performance of the probabilistic forecasts issued by the sde model is then evaluated against the corresponding deterministic forecasts generated from the mike urban model 3 modelling 3 1 physical drainage system overview the full process of rainfall runoff from precipitation to accumulated waste and stormwater at the wastewater treatment plant wwtp can be divided into 6 steps 1 the water hits the ground surface in the catchment 2 it runs off along the ground surface to reach the combined sewer system 3 it flows through the combined sewer system to reach the overflow structure middle link 4 if the water in the overflow structure is above a certain crest level it flows into the tunnel otherwise it continues downstream through the combined sewer towards the sarcophagus 5 water that has entered the tunnel flows downstream to the storage tower at the end bottle bridge 6 the water is pumped from the downstream end of the tunnel to the sarcophagus where it is merged with the sewage from the combined sewer cf step 4 and everything then flows towards the wwtp this breakdown of the process already reveals two important features of the system firstly there are several different time constants reflecting how long it takes for the stormwater to discharge through the different phases secondly the crest in step 4 introduces a non linearity to the system because it means that only sufficiently strong rain events will cause water to enter the tunnel while minor rain events will not 3 2 water volume as response variable ultimately the water level in the tunnel must be controlled such that flooding events are prevented hence the immediate idea would be to model the water level at any given time an approach well demonstrated by breinholt et al 2011 however water levels are not conserved in an intuitive way between different parts of the physical system but water volumes are since the volume is proportional to the mass choosing water volume as the response variable makes it straight forward to base the model on mass balance equations which have a very intuitive physical interpretation from a time series of minutely water level measurements where the completely filled tunnel was being fully emptied we know very precisely the relationship between the water level and volume in the tunnel making transformation between these two domains easy see fig 2 hence the water level can always be reconstructed whenever it is needed furthermore all water volumes will be modelled in units of 1000 m 3 because estimation of the sde model tends to be easier when the order of magnitude of the numbers concerned is not too high 3 3 continuous discrete time state space model we shall formulate a continuous discrete time state space model johansson et al 1999 that can be estimated from the available data first consider an arbitrary sewer pipe let x i t be a random variable that represents water volume at location i in the pipe at time t and let k be an associated time constant i e the average time it takes the water to flow from one end of the pipe to the other then the flow may be described by a linear reservoir model lrm pedersen et al 1980 of order n where the pipe is represented by a series of n reservoirs with the water content of each reservoir being a state the water then flows from one state to the next with the rate n k see fig 3 ideally the system consists of an infinite number of infinitely small reservoirs but in practice only a limited number of reservoirs is needed because we are modelling water volumes the dynamics of the i th reservoir can now be described by a mass balance equation typically formulated as 3 d x i t n k x i 1 t n k x i t d t in order to model the entire damhus system we will consider the ground surface the combined sewer and the tunnel as three different pipes each characterized by a time constant k 1 k 2 and k 3 respectively and use this idea to construct a state space model consisting of three connected lrms each with 2 states amounting to a total of 6 states the decision on the number of states per lrm was based on preliminary studies the time variable is considered in units of hours and hence the three time constants also have units of hours regarding the input to the system it is assumed that the amount of stormwater reaching the ground surface at time t is proportional to the rainfall intensity u t with the proportionality constant being the effective area a so the inflow is au t this assumption was shown to be reliable by breinholt et al 2011 the mass balance for the first state x 1 of the lrm representing the ground surface thus becomes 4 d x 1 t au t 2 k 1 x 1 t d t here a and u t are given in units of km 2 and mm h respectively and hence au t is in units of 1000 m 3 h as desired u t is taken as the average of the rainfall at the two measurement locations at time t converted to mm h see table 1 the mass balances for x 2 and x 3 inherit the form in eq 3 at x 4 which represents the volume in the overflow structure we address the non linearity caused by the crest between the combined sewer and the tunnel the discharge from x 4 should reflect that only if the amount of water exceeds some threshold corresponding to the crest level water will start flowing rapidly into the tunnel this can be accomplished by attributing a special time constant k 0 to the overflow and multiplying the overflow specific discharge 1 k 0 x 4 t with a sigmoid function 5 q x 1 1 exp α x β where α determines the sharpness such that for α q x approaches a step function and β is the threshold where the step occurs meanwhile some discharge from x 4 downstream to the sarcophagus will always take place which is attributed to k 2 hence we get 6 d x 4 t 2 k 2 x 3 t 2 k 2 q x 4 t 1 k 0 x 4 t d t the mass balance for x 5 which represents the upstream part of the

here there is no discharge and the water accumulates until it is pumped out or the tunnel is filled the mass balance equation is 8 d x 6 t 1 k 3 x 5 t p t d t where p t is the pumping intensity at time t this is an input signal which depends on several factors in the real system for this study we use the pumping data at hand as a simplification i e p t is taken as the total pump flow at time t converted to 1000 m 3 h see table 1 this has the awkward drawback of allowing the water volume to drop below 0 in order to ensure that such an occurrence never happens p t is multiplied by q x 6 t with α 200 and β 0 05 cf eq 5 we denote this function q p x finally the diffusion terms in eq 1 must be selected the simplest option is additive diffusion i e g i x i t σ i for all i however breinholt et al 2011 demonstrated that state proportional diffusion is the better option for flow modelling i e g i x i t σ i x i this causes the system noise to grow with larger volumes and converge to zero for smaller volumes consequently no water volume state can attain any negative values which keeps the system consistent with physics therefore the latter option is chosen the diffusion constants σ i may be modelled as unique for each i or with some of them being identical to one another here the distinction is made based on physical assumptions about the sources of system noise firstly it is assumed a part of the system noise is attributed to the rainfall input which enters the system in eq 4 for this reason σ 1 is considered to be unique secondly the remaining system noise is assumed to be attributed to random variation in the water flow which is not captured by the drift term of the model we assume that this source of system noise is approximately the same throughout the entire drainage process and is hence only characterized by one diffusion constant σ 2 hence the full system description becomes 9 d x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 t au t 2 k 1 x 1 t 2 k 1 x 1 t 2 k 1 x 2 t 2 k 1 x

table 2 of section 4 3 4 estimation for estimation of parameters we base our approach on the commonly applied minimization of the negative log likelihood madsen and thyregod 2010 11 ℓ θ y n 1 2 log 2 π 1 2 k 0 n 1 log σ k 1 k 2 y k 1 y k 1 k σ k 1 k 2 where θ a α β k 0 k 1 k 2 k 3 σ 1 σ 2 σ e is the vector of model parameters first of all we consider a 5 min resolution of the data set instead of 1 min resolution preliminary studies have shown that the resulting estimates do not change significantly and the computational time gain is huge secondly instead of minimizing the regular log likelihood we make two suitable changes the first change is attributed to the impact of small observations while the data contain a lot of observations with values close to 0 we are primarily concerned about obtaining a model that can accurately predict the system load when water is present and therefore we want to put less emphasis on prediction of the former this is accomplished by adding a variance contribution to σ k 1 k 2 that has the largest effect on small observations 12 σ k 1 k 2 σ k 1 k 2 a y k 1 k b where a and b are both chosen to be 0 1 the second change aims to give special attention to an accurate modelling of the stormwater response time i e the delay from rainfall to measurable water in the tunnel during optimization the regular log likelihood may very well compromise w r t this feature for the sake of a seemingly better fit overall and therefore we add an extra penalty to eq 11 of the form y k 1 y k 1 k 2 y k 1 c with c 0 01 which penalizes a misspecified response time hard the purpose of c is to avoid division by zero hence the modified negative log likelihood becomes 13 ℓ θ y n 1 2 log 2 π 1 2 k 0 n 1 log σ k 1 k 2 y k 1 y k 1 k 2 σ k 1 k 2 y k 1 y k 1 k 2 y k 1 c the total data set includes 7 rain events from 2018 cf section 2 for estimation we select 6 events deemed sufficient to span the variation of the system and one event for subsequent evaluation of the estimated model prior to estimation based on the 6 training events we apply leave one out cross validation cawley et al 2003 to ensure approximately unbiased parameter estimates to obtain the 1 step predictions needed for the log likelihood function it is necessary to apply an extended kalman filter brok et al 2018 however because the extended kalman filter in ctsm r only accepts additive and state independent diffusion the form in eq 9 can not be estimated instead let z z 1 z 6 be a new multivariate random variable we then apply a lamperti transform møller and madsen 2010 to the system such that 14 z i log x i i hence we get a new system description of the form 15 d z t f d t g d w t with 16 f au t e z 1 t 2 k 1 σ 1 2 2 2 k 1 e z 1 t z 2 t 2 k 1 σ 2 2 2 2 k 1 e z 2 t z 3 t 2 k 2 σ 2

except with no x i thus the diffusion of eq 15 is additive and allows for application of the extended kalman filter the physical parameters are invariant under this transformation hence they can be estimated as in eq 16 and the fitted values of z i can be back transformed to x i by 17 x i e z i i a detailed calculation of the lamperti transform can be found in the supplementary material finally the modified negative log likelihood in eq 13 is optimized using the nlminb function in r such optimization routines tend to converge more robustly if all the parameters are on a similar scale for this reason we let nlminb optimize over the log transformed parameters the parameter estimates in the original domain can thus be restored by taking the exponential of the result of the optimization see the supplementary material for a summary of the estimation framework in the form of r code 3 5 forecasting and forecast evaluation the fitted sde model is now evaluated by letting it forecast the stormwater response in the test event we shall use two different forecasting setups the first setup features probabilistic forecasts with a moving l step horizon which is the setup we have in mind for an mpc application in future studies the second setup is a forecast of the full scenario given only the rainfall input and the initial conditions the purpose of this is to compare the performance of the probabilistic sde model to the deterministic mike urban model first we cover the moving l step forecasts based on the fitted sde model using an extended kalman filter we can reconstruct the full time series for all 6 states these can then be used as initial conditions for forward euler simulation of the model using the input series of the test set we then save all the l step forecasts generated this way as a single series of l step forecasts by repeating that exercise m times an ensemble of m members is obtained from which predictive distributions can be extracted and used as probabilistic forecasts bjerregård et al 2021 secondly we would like to evaluate the sde model against the mike urban model however we can not directly compare with the moving l step forecasts from the sde model because mike urban just simulates the full event based on rainfall input and can not benefit from new observations or start the simulation in the middle of the event instead to ensure the most fair comparison we let the sde model forecast the full event with no extended kalman filter updates and hence it only depends on the rainfall input like mike urban furthermore we remove the pumping signal from the scenario i e set p t 0 for all t which is equivalent to forecasting the accumulated inflow of stormwater this is due to the fact that the real pumping signal is not properly modelled in either model so forecasting the instantaneous stormwater volume is not practical under these conditions we generate a deterministic forecast series with mike urban and a probabilistic forecast series with the sde model in order to evaluate the two competing models we introduce the continuous ranked probability score crps matheson and winkler 1976 18 crps f l 0 y l f l 0 x i x y l 2 d x with f l 0 being the empirical cumulative distribution function c d f pitman 1999 of the forecast and i being the indicator function this metric is usually applied to probabilistic forecasts but is equally applicable to deterministic forecasts as well gneiting and raftery 2007 in the latter case the c d f becomes a step function the overall crps is obtained by applying eq 18 to every l step forecast and compute the average as a second metric we use the well known root mean square error rmse 19 rmse y l 0 y l 1 n l 1 n y l y l 0 2 when applying rmse to a probabilistic forecast y l 0 in eq 19 is taken as the mean of the m ensemble members summarized we use the fitted sde model to generate probabilistic forecasts of both the actual stormwater response and the accumulated inflow the former are moving l step forecasts based on adaptive state estimation intended for integration into an mpc framework the latter constitute a full event simulation which is used for evaluation against the deterministic mike urban model under the crps and rmse metrics 4 results the parameter estimates of eq 9 with 95 confidence intervals cis are listed in table 2 notably a 6 02 km 2 is reasonable w r t to the total catchment area of 47 km 2 because only hard surfaces like roads and roofs really contribute to the sewer inflow while green areas like parks and gardens do not the sum of the four time constants is 3 57 h and is interpreted as the total travel time of rainfall runoff which is also reasonable see fig 4 the 95 cis were first computed as symmetric wald confidence intervals in the logarithmic domain where the parameters were estimated and were then converted to 95 cis in the original parameter domain by taking the exponential the standard errors of the parameter estimates in the logarithmic domain were derived from the diagonal elements of the inverse hessian of the modified negative log likelihood under the assumption that the latter can be approximated by a second order polynomial around the optimum madsen and thyregod 2010 this assumption only holds true for parameter estimates not on the boundary hence some of the standard errors could not be estimated and we have simply reported the associated 95 cis as na a probabilistic forecast series of the stormwater response in the test event is shown in fig 4 top it is generated by m 10000 realizations of the fitted sde model and the forecast horizon is 1 h i e l 12 fig 4 center displays a full simulation of the accumulated stormwater inflow in the same test event based on rainfall input only it features a comparison of the probabilistic sde model forecasts with the deterministic mike urban forecasts the sde model is here represented by the mean and 95 prediction interval of the forecast series the sample size is again m 10000 the crps and rmse of the two forecasting models are listed in table 3 the sde model scores slightly better than mike urban under the rmse and clearly better under the crps the rainfall series of the test event is shown in fig 4 bottom run time considerations and tests are included in the supplementary material 5 discussion in this paper we have motivated developed and estimated an sde based linear reservoir model with a non linear extension we have used the estimated model to forecast the stormwater response in the damhus tunnel for a rainfall event unknown to the estimation process for this test case we have found that the model performs promisingly at 1 h ahead forecasting and that it is competitive with respect to the mike urban model of the damhus system when full event simulations are compared the 1 h ahead forecasts are strong in the sense that the observations generally fall within the 95 prediction interval while the forecast distributions are reasonably sharp at the same time hence the uncertainty of the forecasts is well captured at this horizon the reasoning behind the choice of horizon is linked to the future goal of being able to apply mpc to the system the mpc could take advantage of the hourly changes in energy market prices when optimizing the timing and intensity of the pumping activity for a proof of concept 1 h horizons are therefore considered to be relevant but future studies may very well reveal shorter or longer horizons to be of higher importance more details on the forecast horizons of interest are included in the supplementary material every 1 h ahead probabilistic forecast was generated in less than a second which makes the model very feasible for non linear mpc because a control scheme would rely on minutely or coarser data updates the full event simulation setup shows that the response dynamics of the sde model can compete with the much more complex mike urban model both the sde model and mike urban hit the response time from rainfall to stormwater in the tunnel convincingly however they also both overestimate the accumulated response which could be an indication that the rainfall input series is over representing the actual rainfall event when compared to the performance of the moving l step setup this really emphasizes the strength of being able to adaptively estimate the states of the system because over or underpredicted rainfall responses can be corrected for according to the rmse and crps the sde model outperforms mike urban at least in this particular test event the difference is most noticeable under the crps which is a consequence of the sde model taking the uncertainty into account this again goes to show the potential of probabilistic forecasts over deterministic forecasts it is a key finding that the introduction of a simple sigmoid function to resemble the crest at the overflow structure is enough to account for the otherwise strong non linearity although the crest volume itself has proven somewhat tricky to estimate the biggest liability with respect to estimation of the model in its current shape is the input since the catchment area is relatively large and the amount of rainfall sensors limited the measured input is not guaranteed to be proportional to the actual input which in turn makes the effective catchment area and the overflow crest difficult to estimate from data consistently across different rainfall events this problem could either be solved by increasing the number and spread of rain gauges in the catchment or by introducing considerable noise on the input as already discussed however adaptive state estimation alone can compensate for input uncertainties quite well another potential improvement would be to include additional observations at other locations in the system to increase the level of information especially measurements reflecting some of the states upstream of the tunnel could be useful as in the current setup there is no information about the upstream states as long as no water has overflowed to the tunnel this may also help estimating the crest volume more reliably furthermore to keep it simple the tunnel as modelled is not bounded from above even though the physical tunnel does have a maximum capacity indeed in the full event simulation the upper sections in the uncertainty band of the sde forecasts tend to exceed the maximum capacity of 29000 m 3 long term in a control scheme a forecast that exceeds the physical upper bound should then translate into the same control action that a forecast equal to the physical bound would in this study we have restricted ourselves to a model with a fixed set of parameters where the success criterion is a model fit that is capable of producing reasonable probabilistic forecasts a future study focusing on analysis of the parameters could lead to a deeper understanding of the capabilities and shortcomings of the model and hence be grounds for improvements some examples of such analyses are the influence of the individual parameters assessment of which parameters can be neglected as well as comparison with analogous parameters in other stormwater models generalization of the model framework to other sewer systems should be possible although the specific model developed in this paper is tailored to the damhus case it is built from flexible and case independent principles porting the model framework to a new sewer system would require an initial qualified guess on the number of reservoirs time constants and crest functions it would also require a basic physical understanding on how to properly embed these building bricks in the sdes along with precipitation and pumping inputs we believe that finding inspiration in our case specific model would go a long way in accomplishing the above all in all the damhus case definitely demonstrates that linear reservoir models can be generalized to non linear systems and coupled with the sde structure we have provided the first stepping stone towards a smarter pumping control scheme in the damhus system 6 conclusion we have successfully developed a non linear continuous discrete time state space model for forecasting of rainfall response in a stormwater tunnel the model is built from stochastic differential equations and is thus capable of producing probabilistic forecasts when compared with deterministic forecasts from the mike urban software the probabilistic forecasts generated by the sde model are very competitive we have also demonstrated that the sde model performs promisingly on 1 h horizons thanks to the adaptive state estimation by the extended kalman filter further since the probabilistic forecasts provide complete information about the uncertainty and can be generated in a matter of seconds we believe this model is well suited for integration with a future model predictive control scheme for the associated pumping system
