23120,multiple concentric perforated cylindrical walls are newly suggested for the protection of both the internal cylinder and themselves the porosity parameter is introduced to measure the ability of the perforated wall in dissipating the energy when the fluid passes through it the 3 dimension linear potential theory based upon the eigenfunction matching method considering the nonlinear boundary conditions is used for the hydrodynamic analysis of the structures the wave forces on the inner cylinder and protective walls are calculated considering various porosity parameters and radius ratios the wave elevations at the free surface in the fluid domain for a considered parameter proportion and radius ratio with various numbers of porous walls are further examined the numerical results are vividly depicted and show that the wave loads on the inner cylinder can be highly reduced by setting one or more porous walls externally when there is only one perforated wall whether it is fully or partially perforated at the upper part has little influence in reducing the wave loads on the inner cylinder in this case the frequencies where the wave excitation forces approach zero on the outer wall and approach maximum on the inner cylinder are explained by introducing the sloshing problem and further confirmed by the analytical formulas more numbers of protective walls can better balance the wave elevations and excitation forces on themselves by adjusting the porosity parameter proportions and radius ratios of them keywords multiple permeable walls porosity parameter radius ratio eigen function sloshing problem 1 introduction perforated breakwater has been applied to the reduction of the wave excitation forces on the protected structure and also have been usually port and coastal engineering structures for their significant effect on defensing the waves maintaining the waters in harbor smooth protecting the engineering buildings and ensuring the safety of ships entering and leaving berthing loading and unloading in addition they can also prevent floating chunks of ice and enhance the water quality with minimum environmental impact by allowing water circulation one famous example of permeable breakwater being applied is the gravity offshore structure ekofisk see fig 1 located in the north sea 1973 owing to its scientific and engineering significance wave interaction with porous structures such as porous plates slotted walls and perforated wall caisson type breakwaters has attracted considerable attentions of many research scholars the pioneer work on the porous medium was described by the darcy s law darcy 1856 and further modified by sollitt and cross they proposed the matches boundary conditions of water passing through the perforated walls based upon the solution method for the wave interaction with circular cylinder maccamy and fuchs 1954 later in 1961 jarlan put the former approximations into practice by introducing the principle of an energy dissipating chamber with a single perforated front wall since then so many theoretical and experimental studies on the wave action with perforated structures and the performance of perforated breakwaters or platforms have been carried out as an example of critical work a linearized porous wavemaker theory was proposed by chwang 1983 to analyze the small amplitude surface waves produced by horizontal oscillations of a porous vertical plate and the influences of dimensionless newly introduced porosity effect parameters are also discussed similar theoretical reports about reducing the wave actions and wave loads on the structures by using perforated walls are also given by chwang and li 1983 twu and lin 1991 lee and chwang 2000 li et al 2006 cho and kim 2008 zhu and zhu 2010 park et al 2012 ni et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 the reason why perforated breakwater is effective in reducing the wave actions and wave loads according to the numerical results referenced above because of the special boundary condition where the waves transmit over the porous surfaces in such case so many laboratorial studies are carried out to verify the existing and propose the new boundary theories as an example anh et al 2007 investigated the interaction between wave reflection and caisson breakwaters with three shapes of perforated wave chamber such as vertical slit horizontal slit circle holes as well as different size of wave chamber through laboratory experiments a quadratic not linear law relating the pressure differential to the traversing velocity at the porous boundary is proposed by molin 2011 in the experimental model with its openings are supposed to be infinitely small and numerous nejadkazem and gharabaghi 2013 modified the porous boundary matching method and verified the numerical method based upon the traditional eigenfunction expansion method through experiments of a jarlan type breakwater with a rock filled chamber further studies on the performance of wave reflection and wave loads on two or more perforated structures are reported by lee and shin 2014 ji et al 2014 the majority of perforated breakwaters referenced here are assumed to be thin barriers and the flow through the permeable breakwater is assumed to be proportional to the pressure gradient therefore a semi analytical solution based upon the eigenfunction matching methods can be applied in such case a concentric bottom mounted porous cylindrical structure is studied intensively considering the inner cylinder porous or impenetrable and the outer thin cylindrical wall partially or fully porous wang and ren 1994 studied the wave interaction with a concentric surface piercing porous outer cylinder protecting an impermeable inner cylinder by solving the velocity potential in the inner domain with bessel functions the same case was also carried out analytically and similar results about the characteristics of outer porous wall are obtained by teng et al 2000 and li et al 2003 by employing hankel functions instead of bessel ones in the velocity potentials of inner domain further studies on the two concentric cylindrical structure with the outer one being perforated are conducted by zhong and wang 2006 song and tao 2007 liu et al 2012 very recently meng and zou 2012 put their theoretical boundaries of permeable wall into the bottom mounted uniform porous cylinder of arbitrary shape by using the scaled boundary finite element method sbfem based upon these theories multiple perforated walls have been considered to protect structures and reduce the wave actions as an example shown in fig 2 a critical review of the literature reinforces the fact that there is a response reduction of wave actions and forces on the protected members encompassed with perforated outer cover however another significant reinforced fact is that the wave forces on the protective member are really high especially for a larger porosity effect parameter since the forces on the component members are dependent on the physical characteristics of perforated covers it is necessary to investigate the characteristics of outer perforated covers such as single or multiple partially or fully perforated as shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively an analytical solution method based upon the eigenfunction matching method is used to analyze the hydrodynamics of the structure by dividing the domain around the cylinder into multiple cylindrical subdomains considering the porous boundary treatment method of li et al 2003 the velocity potentials of the subdomains and the wave excitation forces on the component members are analytically expressed after that the case of teng et al 2000 is employed to verify this solution method in this paper we focus on the multiple concentric perforated cylindrical walls which are the protection of both the internal cylinder and themselves the special wave oscillation frequencies where the wave forces on the cylinder are the same with those without perforated wall and the forces on the perforated wall are zero are obtained analytically and explained by introducing the sloshing mode further the impenetrable cylinder with single partially as well as multiple fully perforated walls are considered the wave elevations at the free surface and wave forces on the component members are considered numerical results are further illustrated and discussed 2 mathematical formulations 2 1 basic equation we define the cylindrical coordinated system r θ z by its origin located at the center of the impenetrable cylinder and on the mean plane of the free surface the axis oz is vertically upward by assuming that the fluid is perfect and flow irrotational fluid velocity v r θ z t can be represented by the gradient of a potential function φ r θ z t which satisfies the laplace s equation 1 2 φ r θ z t 0 in the fluid domain under the assumption of infinitesimal waves we consider only the linear potential proportional to the wave steepness furthermore an analysis in frequency domain is performed so that the factor exp iωt representing the time harmonic variation will be omitted in the following for the sake of simplicity on the mean free surface z 0 the combined kinematic and dynamic boundary condition is given by 2 ν φ z φ 0 in which ν ω 2 g with ω as wave frequency and g the acceleration due to gravity to ensure the uniqueness of the solution a radiation condition is often written as 3 lim r k r r φ φ 0 i k φ φ 0 0 in eq 3 φ 0 represents the velocity potential of the incoming waves and is given as 4 φ 0 r θ z a g ω l 0 φ 0 ℓ r z cos ℓ θ φ 0 ℓ r z ε ℓ z 0 k 0 z h j ℓ k 0 r z 0 k 0 z h cosh k 0 z h cosh k 0 h 2 k 0 h sinh 2 k 0 h here the symbols a ω and k 0 denote the amplitude frequency and wave number of the incident wave propagating along the positive x axis respectively j ℓ is the first kind bessel function of order ℓ ℓ 0 1 2 and ε ℓ is defined by ε 0 1 z 0 k 0 0 h and ε ℓ 2 i ℓ z 0 k 0 0 h for ℓ 1 the wave number k 0 can be calculated by k 0 tanh k 0 h ν obtained by satisfying the boundary condition at the free surface 2 2 velocity potentials expansions as illustrated on fig 3 we assume that there are m concentric porous walls around the internal impenetrable cylinder of radius r the radius of the walls is denoted as r m from within outward one by one in such case there will be m 1 cylindrical subdomains denoted by domain d 1 r r r 1 domain d m r m 1 r r m 2 m m and domain d m 1 r r m with the vertical range h 0 in the same way as the incident wave the velocity potential φ r θ z of the diffraction field caused by the fixed structures can be written in the form 5 φ 0 r θ z a g ω l 0 φ ℓ r z cos ℓ θ the appropriate expression of φ ℓ r z composed of eigenfunctions should be obtained by considering the boundary conditions in a cylindrical domain of fluid following chen et al 2015 the velocity potential in the inner domain d 1 is written as 6 φ d 1 ℓ r z α d 1 ℓ 0 z 0 k 0 z h j ℓ k 0 r j ℓ k 0 r h ℓ k 0 r h ℓ k 0 r n 1 α d 1 ℓ n z n k n z h i ℓ k n r i ℓ k n r k ℓ k n r k ℓ k n r in the middle subdomains d m 2 m m between the porous cylindrical walls the diffracted velocity potentials are generally written as 7 φ d m ℓ r z α d m ℓ 0 z 0 k 0 z h j ℓ k 0 r n 1 α d m ℓ n z n k n z h i ℓ k n r α d m ℓ 0 z 0 k 0 z h h ℓ k 0 r n 1 α d m ℓ n z n k n z h k ℓ k n r the velocity potentials in the outer domain d m 1 can also expressed as 8 φ d m 1 ℓ r z α d m 1 ℓ 0 z 0 k 0 z h h ℓ k 0 r n 1 α d m 1 ℓ n z n k n z h k ℓ k n r φ 0 ℓ z n k n z h cos k n z h cos k n h 2 k n h sin 2 k n h here the wave number k n is defined by k n tan k n h ν n 1 in the eigenfunction expansions for the velocity potentials h ℓ i ℓ a n d k ℓ are the first kind hankel function and second kind bessel function and the modified second kind bessel function of order ℓ separately 2 3 matching condition the generic boundary condition on the porous cylindrical hull of radius r can be written as 9 r φ r θ z v θ z using bernoulli equation the dynamic water pressure can be expressed by p ρ i ω φ following chwang et al the normal velocity of the fluid passing through the porous cylinder is linearly proportional to the pressure difference between the two sides of porous cylindrical wall 10 v θ z γ μ p p where p and p mean the pressure on the inner and outer side of the porous wall respectively the symbol μ denotes the dynamic viscosity and γ is a coefficient depends on the thickness and porosity of the m th wall the formula 10 applies to the porous wavemaker is made of material with very fine pores and for example fits for the case of sloshing analysis of too narrow water region between two adjacent porosity walls by introducing the dimensionless porous effect parameter τ μ k ρ γ ω and combining eq 9 the eq 10 can be rewrite as 11 τ r φ r θ z i k φ r θ z φ r θ z here k is the wave number and φ stands for φ at r respectively the porous effect parameters applied on the two porous cylinders are the function of z the case that τ z 0 φ φ stands for the full transparent condition and that τ z r φ 0 stands for the solid impermeable boundary condition applying eq 11 to the model in fig 3 and considering the continuous conditions of the fluid velocities passing through the porous hulls the boundary conditions on two porous walls can be written as 12 r φ d m r m z r φ d m 1 r m z i k 0 τ m z φ d m r m z φ d m 1 r m z 1 m m where τ m z is the porous effect parameter of the m th porous wall and r m r is the radius ratio from within outward one by one in such case the coefficients α d m ℓ 0 α d m ℓ n α d m ℓ 0 α d m ℓ n for 0 ℓ n 1 m m can be determined by the boundary conditions on each of the porous hulls 13 h 0 r φ d m ℓ r m z cosh k 0 z h cos k n z h d z h 0 r φ d m 1 ℓ r m z cosh k 0 z h cos k n z h d z h 0 τ m z r φ d m ℓ r m z cosh k 0 z h cos k n z h d z i k 0 h 0 φ d m ℓ r m z φ d m 1 ℓ r m z cosh k 0 z h cos k n z h d z 2 4 wave forcing and free surface elevations after having obtained the analytical solution of velocity potentials in different domains we can evaluate the linear wave loading by the direct integral of the hydrodynamic pressure on the cylindrical hulls the linear wave forces on the impenetrable cylinder the m th porous wall along the incident wave direction are given by 14 f i π ρ g a r h 0 φ d 1 1 r z d z f m i π ρ g a r m h 0 φ d m 1 1 r m z φ d m 1 r m z d z 1 m m further the wave elevation on the free surface can also be computed by the linear bernoulli equation 15 η i ω g φ r θ 0 3 verification of the solution method as mensioned before the model in fig 4 has been carried out by teng et al 2000 it s a special case of the model in fig 3 in which the porous effect parameters are defined by τ 1 τ 0 m 1 in such case there will be only one outer porous wall and only two subdomains d 1 and d 2 are remained which can be employed to verify the general solution method of perforated breakwater with multiple perforated walls in this paper linear wave forces on the outer porous wall and those on the inner impenetrable cylinder are depicted in fig 5 for the verification of the solution method respectively under the basic calculation parameters r 6 25 m r 1 12 5 m and h 12 5 m the numerical results are in good agreement with the evaluations by teng the linear wave force on the inner impenetrable cylinder reaches to maximum while that on the outer wall approaches minimum when k r 0 68 and 3 28 respectively at these two frequencies the wave forces on the innder cylinder are the same as those without the outer wall in fact the wave forces on the outer wall approach zero at the two frequencies in addition the wave loads on the inner cylinder attenuates rapidly in the presence of the outer porous wall at the other frequencies it means that the outer porous wall can effectively reduce the damage to the internal structure in fact the special frequencies where the wave forces on the inner cylinder are maxmum and those on the outer wall are minium can be analytically explained as the boundary conditions can not cause redistribution of the velocity potential in the vertical direction the velocity potentials in domain d 1 and d 2 can take their simplest forms without the components associated with evanescent waves in such case the unknown coefficients can be analytically obtained as follows 16 α d 1 ℓ 0 2 ε 0 ℓ h ℓ k 0 r 2 h ℓ k 0 r π τ e k 0 r 1 h ℓ k 0 r 1 ϒ ℓ k 0 r 1 r α d 2 ℓ 0 2 ε 0 ℓ ϒ ℓ k 0 r 1 r 2 h ℓ k 0 r π τ e k 0 a h ℓ k 0 r 1 ϒ ℓ k 0 r 1 r ε 0 ℓ j ℓ k 0 r 1 h ℓ k 0 r 1 here ϒ ℓ k 0 r 1 r j ℓ k 0 r 1 h ℓ k 0 r j ℓ k 0 r h ℓ k 0 r 1 thus the wave forces in the direction of incident wave on the inner cylinder and the outer wall given by eq 14 are now can be analytically written as 17 f i 4 ρ g a r 1 2 tanh k 0 h k 0 r 1 2 2 h 1 k 0 r π τ e k 0 r 1 h 1 k 0 r 1 ϒ 1 k 0 r 1 r f 1 i 4 π τ e ρ g a r 1 2 ϒ 1 k 0 r 1 r tanh k 0 h k 0 r 1 2 h 1 k 0 r π τ e k 0 r 1 h 1 k 0 r 1 ϒ 1 k 0 r 1 r in such case when ϒ 1 k 0 r 1 r 0 we can get the maxmum wave forces on the inner cylinder and minimum ones on the outer wall then if the geometries are given as teng s the frequencies can be calculated as k r 0 68 and 3 28 in addition if we introduce the sloshing problem fox et al 1983 into the domain surrounded by two impenetrable walls such as the domain d 1 in this case the velocity potential in this domain should satisfy the unpenetrable condition on the two walls i e r φ ℓ r z r φ ℓ r 1 z 0 then we have 18 j ℓ k 0 r 1 h ℓ k 0 r j ℓ k 0 r h ℓ k 0 r 1 0 this further confirms that the special frequencies can be obtained analytically and explained physically 4 numerical results 4 1 wave forcing 1 impenetrable cylinder with partially perforated wall as the previous conclusions the wave loads on the inner cylinder are highly depended on the porous effect parameter of the out wall in such case we might as well assume that the out wall is partially perforated such as the porous effect parameter being an piecewise function with the vertical coordinate as shown in fig 4 in this paper the outer wall is assumed to be porous at z t 0 i e τ 1 τ 0 and impermeable at z h t i e τ 1 the linear wave loads on the inner cylinder the outer wall and the whole structure the basic calculation parameters r 5 m h 20 m and τ 0 5 the parametric variation is the t h and r 1 r shown in figs 6 8 as shown in the left subgraphs in figs 6 8 the wave forces on the cylinder and the partial porous wall show the similar characteristics with oscillation attenuation to the those in the case of teng et al 2000 the special frequencies where the forces on the cylinder are at the crest and those on the porous wall are at in the trough can also be obtained from the analytical expressions or the sloshing mode however with the increasing r 1 r the first oscillating frequency and the frequency intervals of the forces on the cylinder and the porous wall both decrease it s remarkable that the peak values of all the considered wave forces in the first oscillating frequency interval also decrease with the increasing r 1 r explaining from a physical point of view is that the wave forces on the whole structures are larger than that on the impenetrable cylinder without outer wall however except at these special frequencies the wave forces on the impenetrable cylinder can be highly reduced especially when the radius of the outer wall is closed to that of the cylinder because of the porous wall also taking a considerable part of wave loads wave loads on the impenetrable cylinder the partial porous wall and the whole structures with r 1 r 2 0 considering the various t h are illustrated in the right subgraphs in figs 6 8 respectively the wave forces on the cylinder increase with the increasing t h at the frequencies between zero and the first peak frequency and then are nearly the same in all the oscillating intervals the forces on the outer partial porous wall and those on the whole structures show the same trend with frequencies they are same at the frequencies between zero and the frequency where the first peak values occur and then decrease with the increasing t h at the frequencies between the first peak frequency and the first special oscillating frequency and finally nearly stay the same in all the oscillating frequency intervals however the reduction of the forces on the porous wall and the whole structure at the first peak frequencies are not so obvious with the increasing t h explaining from a physical point of view is that the partial impenetrability of the outer wall is of less than perfect 2 impenetrable cylinder with two concentric perforated walls as mentioned before the outer single full or partial porous wall is not so desirable in weakening the wave forces on the inner cylinder conversely the outer wall is under considerable wave loads in such case this paper deals with not only reducing the wave forces on the protected cylinder but also propotionating those on the auxiliary porous walls by inserting one or more porous walls into the double walled column based upon the former results the porosity effect parameter ratios τ1 τ2 of the inner porous wall to the outer one are assumed to be various with the total τ0 the distance ratios δr r of the spacing between the two porous walls to the radius of the inner cylinder are also considered in this study the wave forces on the cylinder all the porous walls and the whole structure with τ0 20 and r 2 r 2 0 considering various τ1 τ2 and δr r are illustrated in figs 9 12 the geometrical parameters of the inner cylinder and the water depth here are the same as those in the former case as shown in the left subgraph in fig 9 the wave forces on the inner impenetrable cylinder with wave frequencies are smaller than those without the outer porous walls however they are the same at the frequencies satisfying the sloshing mode when the porosity parameter of either porous wall is zero the peak values of the forces on the cylinder with two porous walls are smaller than those with only one porous wall something is noticed that the frequencies where the peak values occur increase with the increasing proportion τ1 τ2 in addition the case that the two walls with the equivalent porous effect parameter seems to have a better effect in reducing the wave loads on the inner cylinder wave forces on the inner cylinder for various δr r are depicted in the right subgraph the frequencies where the peak values occur increase first and then decrease with the increasing δr r while the peak values show the inverse trend it means that the wave loads on the inner cylinder can be highly reduced by changing the geometrical parameters of the porous wall what we are concerned is not only the maximum forces on the cylinder but also the safety of the porous walls for protection in such case the wave forces on all the outer walls are also considered as shown in figs 10 and 11 as shown in the left subgraph in fig 10 the forces on the first perforated wall have minimum values zero at the frequencies which can be obtained by the analytical expressions or the sloshing mode as mentioned before particular attention should be paid to that with the increasing τ1 τ2 the forces on the inner porous wall increase on the contrary those on the outer wall decrease as shown in fig 11 the introduced sloshing mode is not applicative in the second or more column in the case of multiple porous walls something special is that the frequencies where the first troughs occur when neither of the parameters of the two walls is zero decrease with the increasing τ1 τ2 though the forces on the two porous walls have the contrary trends however the peak vaules variation of the forces on the outer wall is greater than that of those on the inner one it means that the load bearing capacity of the outer porous wall is more sensitive to the changes of τ1 τ2 thus a relatively larger τ1 τ2 will be responsible to equalize the wave loads on the two porous walls such as τ1 τ2 7 in this case the curves of the wave forces shown in the right subgraphs in figs 10 and 11 highlight the importance of the arrangements of the outer two porous walls with the total porosity parameter τ0 the increasing δr r can not only increase the frequencies where the values of the forces on the inner wall are zero but also decrease the peak values of them the wave forces on the outer porous wall show more sensitive to the changes of δr r especially evident at the peak values with the increasing δr r the peak values of the forces increase first rapidly and then slowly the forces on the whole structure with two porous walls for τ0 20 are shown in fig 12 as expected the forces associated with porous walls are larger than those on a single impenetrable cylinder special attention should be given to that the forces on the whole structure can be highly reduced with a higher τ1 τ2 though they are larger than those on a single cylinder without porous walls no matter how the τ1 τ2 changes however generally the relatively higher τ1 τ2 such as 7 in this case can not only reduce the forces on the inner cylinder but also balance the wave loads on the porous walls for protection the arrangements of the newly inserted porous wall seem to have no effects on the forces on the whole structure as shown in the right subgraph in fig 12 in such case when the porosity parameters of the porous walls are given the forces on the porous walls for protection can be further balanced by adjusting the spacing between the porous walls 4 2 wave elevations at the free surface the effect of the outer porous walls on the inner structure can also be obtained and explained by calculating the wave elevations at the free surface around the inner impenetrable cylinder the geometrical parameters and the environment variables are the same as those in the former case the total porosity parameters of the additional porous walls is τ0 6 i e j 1 m τ j 6 the wave frequency kr is set to be0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively in this section the outermost porous wall has the radius of 2r and the other walls divide the surrounded column along the radial direction as shown in fig 13 the wave elevations at the free surface around a single impenetrable cylinder are obtained the elevations at the free surface near the cylinder are really high however when there are outer concentric porous walls around the cylinder as shown in figs 14 16 the elevations near the cylinder surface are highly reduced special attention should be given to the elevations on the double sides of the porous wall as shown in fig 14 when there is only one porous wall although the elevations on the cylinder surface are really small their differences between two sides of the wall are very large however if we insert another porous wall into the column and they have the same total τ0 the elevations on the cylinder surface are still small and their differences between two sides of each wall become smaller as shown in fig 15 similar conclusions can also be obtained considering there are three concentric porous walls as depicted in fig 16 these results about the elevations can further illustrate that porous walls can reduce the wave loads on the inner structure in addition the more the number of the porous walls the more the inner cylinder and the porous walls for protection will be safe 5 conclusions and discussions this paper commits itself to the wave diffraction from a bottom mounted impenetrable cylinder with multiple concentric perforated cylindrical walls in a quantitative manner using the semi analytical solution method based upon the plane wave theory firstly the non linear boundary conditions at the perforated walls are reasonably analyzed by introducing a porosity parameter τ which represents the ability to dissipate energy when the fluid passes through the perforated wall then the accuracy of the general solution method for cylinder with multiple porous walls are demonstrated by the excellent agreements of wave interactions for an impenetrable cylinder and a single porous wall using other numerical method after that the wave forces on the structures for a impenetrable cylinder with a single partial porous wall considering various radius ratio and porosity parameters or multiple porous walls considering various porosity parameter proportions are calculated finally the wave elevations at the free surface are further calculated and analyzed considering various porous walls the results obtained from the present study are summarized as follows 1 the wave frequencies where the wave forces on the cylinder are at the peak and those on the outer single porous wall are at the trough can be derived by the analytical formulas and explained by the sloshing mode the validity of the conclusion means that it s an efficient way to reduce the wave loads on the inner cylinder by adjusting the cylinder s geometrical parameters to avoid the peak values 2 when there is only one porous wall whether if it is full perforated or partially porous at the upper part has little influence in reducing the wave loads on the inner protected cylinder when the radius ratio of the outer wall to the inner cylinder is small the forces on the inner cylinder the outer wall and the whole structure as well as the wave elevations at their surfaces are all highly reduced 3 for the case with an impenetrable and multiple concentric porous walls the proportional relationship of the porosity parameter and the arrangements of the porous walls have a great influence in reducing the forces on the inner cylinder and balancing those on the porous walls for protection the validity of the conclusion means that it s effective in protecting the inner cylinder by increasing the porosity parameter of the porous wall form external to internal and decreasing the spacing between the adjacent porous walls 4 from the comparison between the wave elevations around the cylinder without wall and those with one or more porous walls it is found that the externally attached structure may be effective in protecting the inner structure comparing the elevations at the surfaces of the porous walls more quantities of walls can be able to balance the wabe loads on the protective porous walls acknowledgement this paper is financially supported by the national natural science foundation no 51509048 no 51679044 and no

23120,multiple concentric perforated cylindrical walls are newly suggested for the protection of both the internal cylinder and themselves the porosity parameter is introduced to measure the ability of the perforated wall in dissipating the energy when the fluid passes through it the 3 dimension linear potential theory based upon the eigenfunction matching method considering the nonlinear boundary conditions is used for the hydrodynamic analysis of the structures the wave forces on the inner cylinder and protective walls are calculated considering various porosity parameters and radius ratios the wave elevations at the free surface in the fluid domain for a considered parameter proportion and radius ratio with various numbers of porous walls are further examined the numerical results are vividly depicted and show that the wave loads on the inner cylinder can be highly reduced by setting one or more porous walls externally when there is only one perforated wall whether it is fully or partially perforated at the upper part has little influence in reducing the wave loads on the inner cylinder in this case the frequencies where the wave excitation forces approach zero on the outer wall and approach maximum on the inner cylinder are explained by introducing the sloshing problem and further confirmed by the analytical formulas more numbers of protective walls can better balance the wave elevations and excitation forces on themselves by adjusting the porosity parameter proportions and radius ratios of them keywords multiple permeable walls porosity parameter radius ratio eigen function sloshing problem 1 introduction perforated breakwater has been applied to the reduction of the wave excitation forces on the protected structure and also have been usually port and coastal engineering structures for their significant effect on defensing the waves maintaining the waters in harbor smooth protecting the engineering buildings and ensuring the safety of ships entering and leaving berthing loading and unloading in addition they can also prevent floating chunks of ice and enhance the water quality with minimum environmental impact by allowing water circulation one famous example of permeable breakwater being applied is the gravity offshore structure ekofisk see fig 1 located in the north sea 1973 owing to its scientific and engineering significance wave interaction with porous structures such as porous plates slotted walls and perforated wall caisson type breakwaters has attracted considerable attentions of many research scholars the pioneer work on the porous medium was described by the darcy s law darcy 1856 and further modified by sollitt and cross they proposed the matches boundary conditions of water passing through the perforated walls based upon the solution method for the wave interaction with circular cylinder maccamy and fuchs 1954 later in 1961 jarlan put the former approximations into practice by introducing the principle of an energy dissipating chamber with a single perforated front wall since then so many theoretical and experimental studies on the wave action with perforated structures and the performance of perforated breakwaters or platforms have been carried out as an example of critical work a linearized porous wavemaker theory was proposed by chwang 1983 to analyze the small amplitude surface waves produced by horizontal oscillations of a porous vertical plate and the influences of dimensionless newly introduced porosity effect parameters are also discussed similar theoretical reports about reducing the wave actions and wave loads on the structures by using perforated walls are also given by chwang and li 1983 twu and lin 1991 lee and chwang 2000 li et al 2006 cho and kim 2008 zhu and zhu 2010 park et al 2012 ni et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 the reason why perforated breakwater is effective in reducing the wave actions and wave loads according to the numerical results referenced above because of the special boundary condition where the waves transmit over the porous surfaces in such case so many laboratorial studies are carried out to verify the existing and propose the new boundary theories as an example anh et al 2007 investigated the interaction between wave reflection and caisson breakwaters with three shapes of perforated wave chamber such as vertical slit horizontal slit circle holes as well as different size of wave chamber through laboratory experiments a quadratic not linear law relating the pressure differential to the traversing velocity at the porous boundary is proposed by molin 2011 in the experimental model with its openings are supposed to be infinitely small and numerous nejadkazem and gharabaghi 2013 modified the porous boundary matching method and verified the numerical method based upon the traditional eigenfunction expansion method through experiments of a jarlan type breakwater with a rock filled chamber further studies on the performance of wave reflection and wave loads on two or more perforated structures are reported by lee and shin 2014 ji et al 2014 the majority of perforated breakwaters referenced here are assumed to be thin barriers and the flow through the permeable breakwater is assumed to be proportional to the pressure gradient therefore a semi analytical solution based upon the eigenfunction matching methods can be applied in such case a concentric bottom mounted porous cylindrical structure is studied intensively considering the inner cylinder porous or impenetrable and the outer thin cylindrical wall partially or fully porous wang and ren 1994 studied the wave interaction with a concentric surface piercing porous outer cylinder protecting an impermeable inner cylinder by solving the velocity potential in the inner domain with bessel functions the same case was also carried out analytically and similar results about the characteristics of outer porous wall are obtained by teng et al 2000 and li et al 2003 by employing hankel functions instead of bessel ones in the velocity potentials of inner domain further studies on the two concentric cylindrical structure with the outer one being perforated are conducted by zhong and wang 2006 song and tao 2007 liu et al 2012 very recently meng and zou 2012 put their theoretical boundaries of permeable wall into the bottom mounted uniform porous cylinder of arbitrary shape by using the scaled boundary finite element method sbfem based upon these theories multiple perforated walls have been considered to protect structures and reduce the wave actions as an example shown in fig 2 a critical review of the literature reinforces the fact that there is a response reduction of wave actions and forces on the protected members encompassed with perforated outer cover however another significant reinforced fact is that the wave forces on the protective member are really high especially for a larger porosity effect parameter since the forces on the component members are dependent on the physical characteristics of perforated covers it is necessary to investigate the characteristics of outer perforated covers such as single or multiple partially or fully perforated as shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively an analytical solution method based upon the eigenfunction matching method is used to analyze the hydrodynamics of the structure by dividing the domain around the cylinder into multiple cylindrical subdomains considering the porous boundary treatment method of li et al 2003 the velocity potentials of the subdomains and the wave excitation forces on the component members are analytically expressed after that the case of teng et al 2000 is employed to verify this solution method in this paper we focus on the multiple concentric perforated cylindrical walls which are the protection of both the internal cylinder and themselves the special wave oscillation frequencies where the wave forces on the cylinder are the same with those without perforated wall and the forces on the perforated wall are zero are obtained analytically and explained by introducing the sloshing mode further the impenetrable cylinder with single partially as well as multiple fully perforated walls are considered the wave elevations at the free surface and wave forces on the component members are considered numerical results are further illustrated and discussed 2 mathematical formulations 2 1 basic equation we define the cylindrical coordinated system r θ z by its origin located at the center of the impenetrable cylinder and on the mean plane of the free surface the axis oz is vertically upward by assuming that the fluid is perfect and flow irrotational fluid velocity v r θ z t can be represented by the gradient of a potential function φ r θ z t which satisfies the laplace s equation 1 2 φ r θ z t 0 in the fluid domain under the assumption of infinitesimal waves we consider only the linear potential proportional to the wave steepness furthermore an analysis in frequency domain is performed so that the factor exp iωt representing the time harmonic variation will be omitted in the following for the sake of simplicity on the mean free surface z 0 the combined kinematic and dynamic boundary condition is given by 2 ν φ z φ 0 in which ν ω 2 g with ω as wave frequency and g the acceleration due to gravity to ensure the uniqueness of the solution a radiation condition is often written as 3 lim r k r r φ φ 0 i k φ φ 0 0 in eq 3 φ 0 represents the velocity potential of the incoming waves and is given as 4 φ 0 r θ z a g ω l 0 φ 0 ℓ r z cos ℓ θ φ 0 ℓ r z ε ℓ z 0 k 0 z h j ℓ k 0 r z 0 k 0 z h cosh k 0 z h cosh k 0 h 2 k 0 h sinh 2 k 0 h here the symbols a ω and k 0 denote the amplitude frequency and wave number of the incident wave propagating along the positive x axis respectively j ℓ is the first kind bessel function of order ℓ ℓ 0 1 2 and ε ℓ is defined by ε 0 1 z 0 k 0 0 h and ε ℓ 2 i ℓ z 0 k 0 0 h for ℓ 1 the wave number k 0 can be calculated by k 0 tanh k 0 h ν obtained by satisfying the boundary condition at the free surface 2 2 velocity potentials expansions as illustrated on fig 3 we assume that there are m concentric porous walls around the internal impenetrable cylinder of radius r the radius of the walls is denoted as r m from within outward one by one in such case there will be m 1 cylindrical subdomains denoted by domain d 1 r r r 1 domain d m r m 1 r r m 2 m m and domain d m 1 r r m with the vertical range h 0 in the same way as the incident wave the velocity potential φ r θ z of the diffraction field caused by the fixed structures can be written in the form 5 φ 0 r θ z a g ω l 0 φ ℓ r z cos ℓ θ the appropriate expression of φ ℓ r z composed of eigenfunctions should be obtained by considering the boundary conditions in a cylindrical domain of fluid following chen et al 2015 the velocity potential in the inner domain d 1 is written as 6 φ d 1 ℓ r z α d 1 ℓ 0 z 0 k 0 z h j ℓ k 0 r j ℓ k 0 r h ℓ k 0 r h ℓ k 0 r n 1 α d 1 ℓ n z n k n z h i ℓ k n r i ℓ k n r k ℓ k n r k ℓ k n r in the middle subdomains d m 2 m m between the porous cylindrical walls the diffracted velocity potentials are generally written as 7 φ d m ℓ r z α d m ℓ 0 z 0 k 0 z h j ℓ k 0 r n 1 α d m ℓ n z n k n z h i ℓ k n r α d m ℓ 0 z 0 k 0 z h h ℓ k 0 r n 1 α d m ℓ n z n k n z h k ℓ k n r the velocity potentials in the outer domain d m 1 can also expressed as 8 φ d m 1 ℓ r z α d m 1 ℓ 0 z 0 k 0 z h h ℓ k 0 r n 1 α d m 1 ℓ n z n k n z h k ℓ k n r φ 0 ℓ z n k n z h cos k n z h cos k n h 2 k n h sin 2 k n h here the wave number k n is defined by k n tan k n h ν n 1 in the eigenfunction expansions for the velocity potentials h ℓ i ℓ a n d k ℓ are the first kind hankel function and second kind bessel function and the modified second kind bessel function of order ℓ separately 2 3 matching condition the generic boundary condition on the porous cylindrical hull of radius r can be written as 9 r φ r θ z v θ z using bernoulli equation the dynamic water pressure can be expressed by p ρ i ω φ following chwang et al the normal velocity of the fluid passing through the porous cylinder is linearly proportional to the pressure difference between the two sides of porous cylindrical wall 10 v θ z γ μ p p where p and p mean the pressure on the inner and outer side of the porous wall respectively the symbol μ denotes the dynamic viscosity and γ is a coefficient depends on the thickness and porosity of the m th wall the formula 10 applies to the porous wavemaker is made of material with very fine pores and for example fits for the case of sloshing analysis of too narrow water region between two adjacent porosity walls by introducing the dimensionless porous effect parameter τ μ k ρ γ ω and combining eq 9 the eq 10 can be rewrite as 11 τ r φ r θ z i k φ r θ z φ r θ z here k is the wave number and φ stands for φ at r respectively the porous effect parameters applied on the two porous cylinders are the function of z the case that τ z 0 φ φ stands for the full transparent condition and that τ z r φ 0 stands for the solid impermeable boundary condition applying eq 11 to the model in fig 3 and considering the continuous conditions of the fluid velocities passing through the porous hulls the boundary conditions on two porous walls can be written as 12 r φ d m r m z r φ d m 1 r m z i k 0 τ m z φ d m r m z φ d m 1 r m z 1 m m where τ m z is the porous effect parameter of the m th porous wall and r m r is the radius ratio from within outward one by one in such case the coefficients α d m ℓ 0 α d m ℓ n α d m ℓ 0 α d m ℓ n for 0 ℓ n 1 m m can be determined by the boundary conditions on each of the porous hulls 13 h 0 r φ d m

k n z h d z 2 4 wave forcing and free surface elevations after having obtained the analytical solution of velocity potentials in different domains we can evaluate the linear wave loading by the direct integral of the hydrodynamic pressure on the cylindrical hulls the linear wave forces on the impenetrable cylinder the m th porous wall along the incident wave direction are given by 14 f i π ρ g a r h 0 φ d 1 1 r z d z f m i π ρ g a r m h 0 φ d m 1 1 r m z φ d m 1 r m z d z 1 m m further the wave elevation on the free surface can also be computed by the linear bernoulli equation 15 η i ω g φ r θ 0 3 verification of the solution method as mensioned before the model in fig 4 has been carried out by teng et al 2000 it s a special case of the model in fig 3 in which the porous effect parameters are defined by τ 1 τ 0 m 1 in such case there will be only one outer porous wall and only two subdomains d 1 and d 2 are remained which can be employed to verify the general solution method of perforated breakwater with multiple perforated walls in this paper linear wave forces on the outer porous wall and those on the inner impenetrable cylinder are depicted in fig 5 for the verification of the solution method respectively under the basic calculation parameters r 6 25 m r 1 12 5 m and h 12 5 m the numerical results are in good agreement with the evaluations by teng the linear wave force on the inner impenetrable cylinder reaches to maximum while that on the outer wall approaches minimum when k r 0 68 and 3 28 respectively at these two frequencies the wave forces on the innder cylinder are the same as those without the outer wall in fact the wave forces on the outer wall approach zero at the two frequencies in addition the wave loads on the inner cylinder attenuates rapidly in the presence of the outer porous wall at the other frequencies it means that the outer porous wall can effectively reduce the damage to the internal structure in fact the special frequencies where the wave forces on the inner cylinder are maxmum and those on the outer wall are minium can be analytically explained as the boundary conditions can not cause redistribution of the velocity potential in the vertical direction the velocity potentials in domain d 1 and d 2 can take their simplest forms without the components associated with evanescent waves in such case the unknown coefficients can be analytically obtained as follows 16 α d 1 ℓ 0 2 ε 0 ℓ h ℓ k 0 r 2 h ℓ k 0 r π τ e k 0 r 1 h ℓ k 0 r 1 ϒ ℓ k 0 r 1 r α d 2 ℓ 0 2 ε 0 ℓ ϒ ℓ k 0 r 1 r 2 h ℓ k 0 r π τ e k 0 a h ℓ k 0 r 1 ϒ ℓ k 0 r 1 r ε 0 ℓ j ℓ k 0 r 1 h ℓ k 0 r 1 here ϒ ℓ k 0 r 1 r j ℓ k 0 r 1 h ℓ k 0 r j ℓ k 0 r h ℓ k 0 r 1 thus the wave forces in the direction of incident wave on the inner cylinder and the outer wall given by eq 14 are now can be analytically written as 17 f i 4 ρ g a r 1 2 tanh k 0 h k 0 r 1 2 2 h 1 k 0 r π τ e k 0 r 1 h 1 k 0 r 1 ϒ 1 k 0 r 1 r f 1 i 4 π τ e ρ g a r 1 2 ϒ 1 k 0 r 1 r tanh k 0 h k 0 r 1 2 h 1 k 0 r π τ e k 0 r 1 h 1 k 0 r 1 ϒ 1 k 0 r 1 r in such case when ϒ 1 k 0 r 1 r 0 we can get the maxmum wave forces on the inner cylinder and minimum ones on the outer wall then if the geometries are given as teng s the frequencies can be calculated as k r 0 68 and 3 28 in addition if we introduce the sloshing problem fox et al 1983 into the domain surrounded by two impenetrable walls such as the domain d 1 in this case the velocity potential in this domain should satisfy the unpenetrable condition on the two walls i e r φ ℓ r z r φ ℓ r 1 z 0 then we have 18 j ℓ k 0 r 1 h ℓ k 0 r j ℓ k 0 r h ℓ k 0 r 1 0 this further confirms that the special frequencies can be obtained analytically and explained physically 4 numerical results 4 1 wave forcing 1 impenetrable cylinder with partially perforated wall as the previous conclusions the wave loads on the inner cylinder are highly depended on the porous effect parameter of the out wall in such case we might as well assume that the out wall is partially perforated such as the porous effect parameter being an piecewise function with the vertical coordinate as shown in fig 4 in this paper the outer wall is assumed to be porous at z t 0 i e τ 1 τ 0 and impermeable at z h t i e τ 1 the linear wave loads on the inner cylinder the outer wall and the whole structure the basic calculation parameters r 5 m h 20 m and τ 0 5 the parametric variation is the t h and r 1 r shown in figs 6 8 as shown in the left subgraphs in figs 6 8 the wave forces on the cylinder and the partial porous wall show the similar characteristics with oscillation attenuation to the those in the case of teng et al 2000 the special frequencies where the forces on the cylinder are at the crest and those on the porous wall are at in the trough can also be obtained from the analytical expressions or the sloshing mode however with the increasing r 1 r the first oscillating frequency and the frequency intervals of the forces on the cylinder and the porous wall both decrease it s remarkable that the peak values of all the considered wave forces in the first oscillating frequency interval also decrease with the increasing r 1 r explaining from a physical point of view is that the wave forces on the whole structures are larger than that on the impenetrable cylinder without outer wall however except at these special frequencies the wave forces on the impenetrable cylinder can be highly reduced especially when the radius of the outer wall is closed to that of the cylinder because of the porous wall also taking a considerable part of wave loads wave loads on the impenetrable cylinder the partial porous wall and the whole structures with r 1 r 2 0 considering the various t h are illustrated in the right subgraphs in figs 6 8 respectively the wave forces on the cylinder increase with the increasing t h at the frequencies between zero and the first peak frequency and then are nearly the same in all the oscillating intervals the forces on the outer partial porous wall and those on the whole structures show the same trend with frequencies they are same at the frequencies between zero and the frequency where the first peak values occur and then decrease with the increasing t h at the frequencies between the first peak frequency and the first special oscillating frequency and finally nearly stay the same in all the oscillating frequency intervals however the reduction of the forces on the porous wall and the whole structure at the first peak frequencies are not so obvious with the increasing t h explaining from a physical point of view is that the partial impenetrability of the outer wall is of less than perfect 2 impenetrable cylinder with two concentric perforated walls as mentioned before the outer single full or partial porous wall is not so desirable in weakening the wave forces on the inner cylinder conversely the outer wall is under considerable wave loads in such case this paper deals with not only reducing the wave forces on the protected cylinder but also propotionating those on the auxiliary porous walls by inserting one or more porous walls into the double walled column based upon the former results the porosity effect parameter ratios τ1 τ2 of the inner porous wall to the outer one are assumed to be various with the total τ0 the distance ratios δr r of the spacing between the two porous walls to the radius of the inner cylinder are also considered in this study the wave forces on the cylinder all the porous walls and the whole structure with τ0 20 and r 2 r 2 0 considering various τ1 τ2 and δr r are illustrated in figs 9 12 the geometrical parameters of the inner cylinder and the water depth here are the same as those in the former case as shown in the left subgraph in fig 9 the wave forces on the inner impenetrable cylinder with wave frequencies are smaller than those without the outer porous walls however they are the same at the frequencies satisfying the sloshing mode when the porosity parameter of either porous wall is zero the peak values of the forces on the cylinder with two porous walls are smaller than those with only one porous wall something is noticed that the frequencies where the peak values occur increase with the increasing proportion τ1 τ2 in addition the case that the two walls with the equivalent porous effect parameter seems to have a better effect in reducing the wave loads on the inner cylinder wave forces on the inner cylinder for various δr r are depicted in the right subgraph the frequencies where the peak values occur increase first and then decrease with the increasing δr r while the peak values show the inverse trend it means that the wave loads on the inner cylinder can be highly reduced by changing the geometrical parameters of the porous wall what we are concerned is not only the maximum forces on the cylinder but also the safety of the porous walls for protection in such case the wave forces on all the outer walls are also considered as shown in figs 10 and 11 as shown in the left subgraph in fig 10 the forces on the first perforated wall have minimum values zero at the frequencies which can be obtained by the analytical expressions or the sloshing mode as mentioned before particular attention should be paid to that with the increasing τ1 τ2 the forces on the inner porous wall increase on the contrary those on the outer wall decrease as shown in fig 11 the introduced sloshing mode is not applicative in the second or more column in the case of multiple porous walls something special is that the frequencies where the first troughs occur when neither of the parameters of the two walls is zero decrease with the increasing τ1 τ2 though the forces on the two porous walls have the contrary trends however the peak vaules variation of the forces on the outer wall is greater than that of those on the inner one it means that the load bearing capacity of the outer porous wall is more sensitive to the changes of τ1 τ2 thus a relatively larger τ1 τ2 will be responsible to equalize the wave loads on the two porous walls such as τ1 τ2 7 in this case the curves of the wave forces shown in the right subgraphs in figs 10 and 11 highlight the importance of the arrangements of the outer two porous walls with the total porosity parameter τ0 the increasing δr r can not only increase the frequencies where the values of the forces on the inner wall are zero but also decrease the peak values of them the wave forces on the outer porous wall show more sensitive to the changes of δr r especially evident at the peak values with the increasing δr r the peak values of the forces increase first rapidly and then slowly the forces on the whole structure with two porous walls for τ0 20 are shown in fig 12 as expected the forces associated with porous walls are larger than those on a single impenetrable cylinder special attention should be given to that the forces on the whole structure can be highly reduced with a higher τ1 τ2 though they are larger than those on a single cylinder without porous walls no matter how the τ1 τ2 changes however generally the relatively higher τ1 τ2 such as 7 in this case can not only reduce the forces on the inner cylinder but also balance the wave loads on the porous walls for protection the arrangements of the newly inserted porous wall seem to have no effects on the forces on the whole structure as shown in the right subgraph in fig 12 in such case when the porosity parameters of the porous walls are given the forces on the porous walls for protection can be further balanced by adjusting the spacing between the porous walls 4 2 wave elevations at the free surface the effect of the outer porous walls on the inner structure can also be obtained and explained by calculating the wave elevations at the free surface around the inner impenetrable cylinder the geometrical parameters and the environment variables are the same as those in the former case the total porosity parameters of the additional porous walls is τ0 6 i e j 1 m τ j 6 the wave frequency kr is set to be0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively in this section the outermost porous wall has the radius of 2r and the other walls divide the surrounded column along the radial direction as shown in fig 13 the wave elevations at the free surface around a single impenetrable cylinder are obtained the elevations at the free surface near the cylinder are really high however when there are outer concentric porous walls around the cylinder as shown in figs 14 16 the elevations near the cylinder surface are highly reduced special attention should be given to the elevations on the double sides of the porous wall as shown in fig 14 when there is only one porous wall although the elevations on the cylinder surface are really small their differences between two sides of the wall are very large however if we insert another porous wall into the column and they have the same total τ0 the elevations on the cylinder surface are still small and their differences between two sides of each wall become smaller as shown in fig 15 similar conclusions can also be obtained considering there are three concentric porous walls as depicted in fig 16 these results about the elevations can further illustrate that porous walls can reduce the wave loads on the inner structure in addition the more the number of the porous walls the more the inner cylinder and the porous walls for protection will be safe 5 conclusions and discussions this paper commits itself to the wave diffraction from a bottom mounted impenetrable cylinder with multiple concentric perforated cylindrical walls in a quantitative manner using the semi analytical solution method based upon the plane wave theory firstly the non linear boundary conditions at the perforated walls are reasonably analyzed by introducing a porosity parameter τ which represents the ability to dissipate energy when the fluid passes through the perforated wall then the accuracy of the general solution method for cylinder with multiple porous walls are demonstrated by the excellent agreements of wave interactions for an impenetrable cylinder and a single porous wall using other numerical method after that the wave forces on the structures for a impenetrable cylinder with a single partial porous wall considering various radius ratio and porosity parameters or multiple porous walls considering various porosity parameter proportions are calculated finally the wave elevations at the free surface are further calculated and analyzed considering various porous walls the results obtained from the present study are summarized as follows 1 the wave frequencies where the wave forces on the cylinder are at the peak and those on the outer single porous wall are at the trough can be derived by the analytical formulas and explained by the sloshing mode the validity of the conclusion means that it s an efficient way to reduce the wave loads on the inner cylinder by adjusting the cylinder s geometrical parameters to avoid the peak values 2 when there is only one porous wall whether if it is full perforated or partially porous at the upper part has little influence in reducing the wave loads on the inner protected cylinder when the radius ratio of the outer wall to the inner cylinder is small the forces on the inner cylinder the outer wall and the whole structure as well as the wave elevations at their surfaces are all highly reduced 3 for the case with an impenetrable and multiple concentric porous walls the proportional relationship of the porosity parameter and the arrangements of the porous walls have a great influence in reducing the forces on the inner cylinder and balancing those on the porous walls for protection the validity of the conclusion means that it s effective in protecting the inner cylinder by increasing the porosity parameter of the porous wall form external to internal and decreasing the spacing between the adjacent porous walls 4 from the comparison between the wave elevations around the cylinder without wall and those with one or more porous walls it is found that the externally attached structure may be effective in protecting the inner structure comparing the elevations at the surfaces of the porous walls more quantities of walls can be able to balance the wabe loads on the protective porous walls acknowledgement this paper is financially supported by the national natural science foundation no 51509048 no 51679044 and no

23121,experiments have been conducted on a low mass ratio flexible cylinder with two and three start helical strakes which was free to vibrate in both in line and transverse water flow directions under the subcritical reynolds number the studied parameters included the cross flow amplitude response the frequency response in the in line and cross flow directions and the mean drag coefficient the effects of different helical strakes heights h 0 05 d 0 10 d and 0 15 d and pitches p 5 d 10 d 15 d were investigated for five different configurations in two and three start helical strakes respectively the present study has indicated that the strakes pitch changes the occurrence of the lock in region but only the three start p 10d model can suppress the high mode frequency strakes height is one of the important variables in reducing the amplitude responses of a cylinder while the number of helix is the most significant variable in affecting the performance of helical strakes the less effectiveness of two start helical strakes is due to the strakes coverage that is inadequate to disrupt the regular vortices efficiently the most effective helical strake configuration based on the configurations that are examined in the present study is the three start p 10 d h 0 15 d model keywords helical strakes vortex induced vibration flexible cylinder suppression low mass ratio 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv which is one of the most critical issues that cause fatigue damage in risers have received substantial attention during the last few decades because of the high demand for oil and gas resources vandiver and tae 1988 huera huarte and bearman 2009 song et al 2011 han et al 2017 domala and sharma 2017 many attempts have been made to understand the viv phenomenon for example raghavan and bernitsas 2011 reported that the reynolds number was a major parameter in influencing the viv response and character chen et al 2012 revealed the viv amplitude depended on the wave number the axial tension and the stiffness of the riser lee et al 2013 used a numerical model to simulate the vortex shedding and discovered that the vorticity moved further from the cylinder as the velocity increased because the exploration of hydrocarbon has moved into deeper ground water a longer flexible riser with a higher aspect ratio is required which induces higher viv risk particularly at high velocity the possibility of viv significantly increases if the structure has a low mass and damping ratio khalak and williamson 1999 in other words an effective suppression device that suits the long flexible riser with a low mass ratio is notably necessary however most previous studies on passive suppression techniques focused on short and rigid cylinders assi et al 2010 huang 2011 korkischko and meneghini 2010 the features that differentiate the rigid and flexible cylinder are that bending is not allowed for a rigid cylinder and the aspect ratio is usually small the aspect ratio is defined as the length over the diameter of the structure on the other hand the aspect ratio of a flexible cylinder is usually high and hence able to be bending in both in line il and cross flow cf directions where the il movement is parallel to the flow direction therefore a better understanding of this matter is necessary to ensure the safety of the long structure and to suppress the viv suppression devices are required some researchers have examined the suppression devices that modify the boundary layer separation and vortex wake these devices can be grouped as active or passive control devices because of the low manufacturing cost simple manufacturing process and simple installation passive control devices are satisfactory and commonly used zdravkovich 1981 classified the technique of passive control into several types among these techniques controlling the boundary layer of fluid using surface protrusion such as tripping wire helical strakes and fins are found to be more effective kim et al 2009 zhou et al 2011 although several of passive suppression devices are available only helical strake is discussed in the present study because it is proven as one of the most effective devices that can be implemented in various applications to suppress viv allen et al 2008 in general helical strakes with three start helix are the commercial model that is implemented in the offshore industries the change of the helix number has gained less attention in the investigation in the recent study of highway lighting towers nchrp 2012 it was reported that two start helical strakes were very effective in reducing the viv compared to a single start helical strakes zdravkovich 1981 also reported that strakes with single and eight starts were less efficient in reducing the viv in the viv study in water on the other hand baarholm and lie 2005 had studied the suppression efficiency between 3 start and 4 start strakes the efficiency of both configurations were almost the same however the mean drag coefficient increased as the start number increased therefore they proposed that 3 start helical strakes was preferable compare to a 4 start strakes besides halkyard et al 2006 also discovered that three start helical strakes were more practical compared to four start helical strakes to the best of our knowledge the response of the two start helical strakes in reducing the viv in water is still unexplored in fact it has the advantage of lesser weight and is easier to be manufactured compare to three start helical strakes besides good performance was found in the application of wind based structure therefore it gains our interest to investigate the effects of two start helical strakes towards the suppression of the viv of a flexible cylinder in water in addition the force responses of two start helical strakes are inaccessible publically the force responses are very important as excessive force especially at the well head joint of flexible riser will result fracture on the structure hence the hydrodynamic response of a flexible cylinder with low mass ratio fitted with two and three start helical strakes is presented in the present study to shed some light on this issue the main objective of the present study is to identify the effectiveness of the two start and three start helical strakes in suppressing the vortex induced vibration viv of a long flexible cylinder with low mass ratio under uniform current it is believed that outputs of the present work is useful in reducing viv and fatigue life of riser three different strakes heights and three different strakes pitches are tested separately on two start and three start helical strakes to identify the parameter that has more contributions in suppressing the viv of cylinder the vibration amplitude the frequency response and the mean drag coefficient are of interest in the following sections the experimental details and the identified parameters are carefully discussed before drawing a conclusion 2 methodology the experiment was conducted in the towing tank of the department of naval architecture and ocean engineering of osaka university the experiment basin is 100 m in length 7 8 m in width and 4 35 m in depth the cylinders were submerged 0 35 m from the still water level to avoid the free surface effects on the response of the cylinders the cylinders were horizontally towed by the carriage to produce a uniform flow the towing speed was varied from 0 1 m s to 1 m s at intervals of 0 03 m s so that the reynolds number was between 1380 and 13800 as shown in table 1 fig 1 shows the layout of the experiment where it comprised of the mounting frame tensioning system and universal joints the details of the experimental facility can be referred to sanaati and kato 2012a the polyvinyl chloride pvc cylinder with a diameter d of 18 mm and a length l of 2 92 m which results in an aspect ratio of 162 offers high flexibility with low bending dependence the helical strakes were made of rubber fig 2 a and designed to have either two start or three start helical pattern as shown in fig 2 b three different helical strakes heights h 0 05 d 0 10 d and 0 15 d and three pitches p 5 d 10 d and 15 d were examined where d is the diameter of the cylinder an adhesive was used to attach the strakes onto the cylinder the mass ratio of the cylinder is relatively low where m 1 17 when the cylinder is filled with water both ends of the cylinder were pinned with universal joints to allow the cylinder to bend in the il and cf directions but the cylinder was constrained in torsion the directions of il and cf are represented as y and x axis respectively in fig 3 a moveable sliding end in the axial direction was designed at one end of the cylinder with an initial tension of 147 n a spring with a stiffness of 6 5 n mm was attached between the universal joint and the sliding end to prevent excessive tensile stress from accumulating when the water current flows around the cylinder the schematic diagram of the explained model set up is shown in fig 3 the test cases were named based on the pitch size and the strake height there were five strake arrangements based on the strake configurations pitch p 10 d height h 0 05 d p 10 d h 0 10 d p 10 d h 0 15 d p 5 d h 0 10 d and p 15 d h 0 10 d a total of 308 runs were performed for these experimental cases starting from still water 75 s of measurements were recorded for each run of the cases however only the data with a constant speed were analysed to ensure the consistency of the outputs to avoid the flow transient effects a rest interval of 10 min was implemented between each test due to the size of towing tank and the operational condition of the towing carriage only subcritical reynolds numbers can be examined in the study however it is expected that the finding can be applied to the real ocean structures of higher reynolds numbers re the performance of the helical strakes does not influenced by the higher re because according to korkischko et al 2007 the flow separation point of helical strakes are fixed besides it is proven by simantiras and willis 1999 that over various re the drag of the cylinder fitted with helical strakes was unchanged practically hence the outputs of the paper is believed to be applicable even for high re the variation of the tension was measured using a tension load cell which was installed between the spring and the adjustable end for pre tension adjustment two half bridge strain gauges are used to measure the hydrodynamic forces they are attached on the square cross section rod of fix end support of the cylinder between the universal joint and the mounting fix end as shown in fig 3 the sampling rate of the strain gauge is 200 hz and a 100 hz of cut off frequency is applied to filter unavoidable noises two ccd cameras were used to measure the vibrational amplitude in the cross flow cf directions the cameras were cantilevered on a strut which were approximately 20 diameters above and behind the cylinder five points with a centre to centre distance of 100 mm were indicated at the centre of the cylinder using fluorescent tapes as the target to be captured because only the response at the centre of the cylinder was captured the amplitude response of the cylinder during the dominance of the second vibration mode was small as shown in the following section the sampling rate of the camera was 30 hz the camera was calibrated in three dimensions within allowable motion which indicated a high accuracy in measuring the amplitude response the motion of the cylinder was simultaneously recorded by the above and below cameras then these videos were synchronised for the analysis using a commercial motion tracking software the reason of capturing the response at the centre of the cylinder is because the use of uniform flow current in the study it is expected that the maximum displacement especially the first vibration mode occurs at the centre of the cylinder rather than other locations the frequencies computed from a different location along the length of the cylinder is expected to be the same this can be proved by comparing the frequency responses obtained from the ccd camera and the tension load cell the load cell was installed at the end of the cylinder fig 3 and the tension signal is expected to capture the response along the length of the cylinder in fact based on fig 4 it can be clearly seen that the analysed frequencies responses from the camera are able to represent the dominant frequencies along the length of the cylinder as similar to load cell the free decay test in still water was performed by imposing an initial displacement on the cylinder and releasing it which yielded the first vibration mode of the natural frequency in still water for the bare cylinder and cylinders with strakes the measured natural frequency for bare cylinder is 2 91 hz while cylinders fitted with helical strakes are about 2 62 2 89 hz as shown in table 2 the natural frequency of the cylinder in still water can also be identified using the analytical method which was derived from the general equation of free vibration for an elastic beam sanaati and kato 2012b 1 n 2 2 t m l 2 n 2 π 2 2 e i m l 4 f n n 1 2 3 where t and l are the tension and the length of the cylinder respectively ei is the bending stiffness and m is the mass per unit length including the added mass m a where the added mass coefficient is assumed to be 1 the analytical natural frequency is shown in table 2 up to the fourth vibration mode the measured first mode natural frequencies are consistent with the first mode analytical values in this study the first mode of the analytical natural frequency with an added mass coefficient of 1 0 is used to define the nominal 3 results and discussions in general the dynamic responses of a cylinder can be represented by the non dimensional cross flow cf amplitude ratio a versus the nominal reduced velocity vrn where a can be obtained by dividing the standard deviation of the time series displacement by the cylinder diameter a astd d and vrn u f n d is the non dimensional velocity the natural frequency f n of the nominal reduced velocity is obtained through equation 1 with an added mass coefficient of 1 0 the standard deviation of the displacement astd is an important parameter to identify the level of the amplitude fluctuation the large amplitude fluctuation indicates the cylinder is experiencing significant vibration to verify the accuracy and reliability of the present study the amplitude ratio of the bare cylinder of the present study is compared with the previous studies cicolin and assi 2017 govardhan and williamson 2000 sanaati and kato 2012a b as shown in fig 5 a unlike the high mass ratio cylinder that displays only two branches an initial branch and a lower branch as reported by sumer and fredsoe 2006 a low mass ratio bare cylinder exhibits an additional upper branch as shown in fig 5 a the presence of these branches was also demonstrated by branković and bearman 2006 and korkischko and meneghini 2010 the clear typical amplitude response of fig 5 a which include the initial branch upper branch lower branch and desynchronization of a low mass ratio cylinder are noticed for all of the studies proofing the reliability of the present study fig 5 b and c shows the cf amplitude ratios of a low mass ratio cylinder and the cylinders of different strake configurations the maximum cf amplitude ratio of the bare cylinder and cylinders with two start and three start helical strakes occurs in the lock in region as indicated in fig 5 b and c the lock in region in the present study can be defined as the synchronisation of the vortex shedding frequency with the oscillating frequency of the cylinder fig 5 b indicates that increasing the strake pitch slightly delays the occurrence of lock in range from vrn 3 5 for the two start p 5 d model to vrn 5 2 for the three start p 15 d model the maximum standard deviation of amplitude for two start p 5d model is around 0 53 with the existence of upper branch this model fails to postpone the occurrence of the lock in where it follows the amplitude trend of the bare cylinder with slightly lower amplitude ratio the other two larger pitches two start 10d and two start 15d display their peak in the range of 0 3 0 4 without the presence of upper branch for three start helical strakes on the other hand the amplitude reduction is more significant however the difference between pitches is trivial varying the strake pitch does not significantly reduce the amplitude response because it only changes the strake coverage on the cylinder surface to reduce the amplitude responses the regular vortices behind a cylinder have to be disrupted by changing the separation of the boundary layer constantimides and oakley 2006 and creating the three dimensional vorticity characters the three dimensional vorticity prevents the shedding of vortices from correlating along the span korkischko and meneghini 2010 korkischko et al 2007 this procedure can be achieved by increasing the strake height as shown in fig 5 c where taller strakes correspond to more amplitude reduction for three start helical strakes strakes of p 10 d h 0 15 d is the most effective model with 71 5 of reduction although the increase of strakes height decrease the amplitude response for two start helical strakes the percentage of reduction is not substantial as for three start helical strakes to identify the performance of different helical strake configurations in suppressing the amplitude responses of the cylinder the percentage of amplitude reduction at the centre of the cylinder is calculated p e r c e n t a g e o f a m p l i t u d e r e d u c t i o n a s t d d m a x b a r e a s t d d m a x s t r a k e s a s t d d m a x b a r e x 100 only the amplitude response at the centre of the cylinder is measured for the maximum reduction multiple modes suppression is unable to be represented using this equation however the reduction of first mode vibration gives an idea on the effectiveness of the helical strakes as shown in table 3 the change of pitch configurations has small effects on the amplitude reduction to the best of the authors knowledge the effectiveness range of the pitch is wide from 5d to 17 5d based on the available literature trim et al 2005 sui et al 2016 the claim of the optimal pitch is varies based on the condition of the flow type and current the latest literature fang et al 2014 reported that pitch of 17 5d was the optimal pitch to be used in the industry however the higher the pitch the larger the drag coefficient therefore compromise should be done in between these two factors in the present study of a low mass ratio flexible cylinder p 10d and p 15d are found to be more effective as compare to p 5d where up to 30 of deviation is noticed for p 10 d and p 15 d the percentage of amplitude reduction is almost the same hence pitches of 10d and 15d are more recommended to be used for a low mass ratio flexible cylinder compare to 5d from the aspect of strakes height the maximum reductions in two start and three start helical strakes are found in h 0 15d model with 44 8 and 71 5 of decrement respectively up to 31 of deviation is found for strakes with different heights in fact the strake height must be larger than the boundary layer thickness 0 06 d to better suppress the viv the boundary layer thickness y can be calculated using the pohlausen s approximation schlichting 1968 by referring to the largest angle of separation point 103 14 as follows 2 v l y r u r ν where v l is the boundary layer velocity and r u and ν denote the cylinder radius the velocity and the kinematic viscosity respectively detail explanation on the thickness of laminar boundary layers can be referred to schlichting 1968 and quen et al 2014 based on fig 5 b and c the amplitude reduction of two start helical strakes is apparently lesser than the three start helical strakes this may be due to the coverage of the two start helical strakes that is inadequate to effectively disrupt the regular vortices sadeh and saharon 1982 reported that the separation point of a circular cylinder was depending on the turbulence condition and the reynolds number which ranged from 85 to 130 based on the leading edge of a cylinder the installation of helical strakes changes the separation point depended on the position of the strakes constantimides and oakley 2006 for two start helical strakes most of the cylinder surface is not covered with strakes as the angle between each strake is 180 therefore the separation of the boundary is mainly controlled by the bare region of the cylinder as a result the correlated cylinder wake pattern is highly retained the use of three start helical strakes improves the coverage of helical strakes into 120 for each strake allowing the boundary separation to be highly influenced by the strakes due to the change of the boundary separation along the cylinder spanwise three dimensionality of the flow is created constantimides and oakley 2006 and hence the regular vortex behind the cylinder is disrupted the outputs show that the number of helix plays an important role in suppressing the amplitude response of a flexible cylinder as it significantly affect the boundary separation of a cylinder figs 6 and 7 indicates the cross flow cf and in line il frequency response of a low mass ratio bare cylinder and the cylinders with different strake configurations respectively the cf and il frequency ratio are obtained by dividing the cf and il frequency responses with the still water natural frequency of the cylinder obtained using equation 1 respectively only the dominant frequency is considered in each case using a fast flourier transform fft based on the time series of the displacement data throughout the discussion the term mode used in the study indicates the vibration mode of the cylinder the reduced velocity vr can be obtained by vr u f x d where u is the flow velocity d is the cylinder diameter and f x is the crossflow cf response frequency by plotting a linear fit of the slope based on fig 6 a the 1 vr is found to be 0 158 this value is consistent with that found by huera huarte 2006 for a flexible cylinder based on fig 6 a unlike for a rigid cylinder the ratio of the synchronised cf shedding frequency with the still water natural frequency of the flexible cylinder during the lock in phenomenon from vrn 3 2 to 11 5 is not unity in fact for a low mass ratio cylinder the oscillating frequency is the effective natural frequency of the cylinder khalak and williamson 1999 which is defined as 3 f n v r 1 2 π k m c e a v r m d where m d denotes the displaced mass of the fluid m d πρd 2 l 4 and k denotes the spring stiffness c ea is the effective added mass coefficient which includes the force component with the body acceleration and can be obtained from the euler bernoulli beam equation assuming that the forces and the response are sinusoidal the details of the formulation of can be referred to tang et al 2011 as described by gabbai and benaroya 2005 and vikestad et al 2000 the effective added mass coefficient of a cylinder decreases with the nominal reduced velocity which increases the effective natural frequency according to khalak and williamson 1999 the c ea increases significantly as the mass ratio becomes smaller and hence resulting the non unity behaviour of cf frequency ratio during lock in to obtain the cf frequency ratio close to 1 they define the synchronisation occurs as the shedding frequency f s matches the body oscillation frequency f n v r not the natural frequency in still water f n through this definition cf frequency ratio during the lock in phenomenon will be close to 1 for the tested strakes the cf frequency ratio of the cylinder fitted with two start helical strakes of various pitches fig 6 a follow the cf frequency trend of bare cylinder very well while the three start strakes slightly reduce the linear fit slope when the strakes height increased fig 6 b both the two start and three start strakes show noticeable reduction on the linear fit slope the cf frequency response of two start h 0 15 d is found to have lower frequency values compare to three start h 0 05 d and h 0 10 d models indicating that the height of the strakes is one of the key parameter in suppressing the viv of a cylinder similar to the cf frequency response fig 7 a indicates that the il frequency ratio of two start straked cylinder of different pitches follows the il frequency trend of bare cylinder nevertheless dissimilar to the bare cylinder that vibrates at second mode in low reduced velocities the il frequency ratios of all cases of strakes are smaller during lock in vibrate at the first mode indicating all of the helical strakes are able to suppress high mode frequency in the lock in region however the timing of the switch into higher mode is not the same for different pitches of strakes two start p 5d model switches the earliest even earlier than the bare cylinder from the first mode to fourth mode and it is followed by two start p 15d and lastly two start p 10d model the same trend is found in three start cases the slower jump into high mode of p 10d shows that it is more operative comparing to the other pitch configuration in suppressing the high mode frequency for two start helical strakes of various strakes heights lower il frequency ratios are obtained in the lock in region fig 7 b as similar to the pitch cases although two start h 0 15 d is able to perform good suppression effect at low nominal reduced velocity it is unable to reduce viv of flexible cylinder at high vrn as secondary lock in is still noticed at vrn 15 8 this suggests that the two start p 0 15 d strakes may only be suitable in condition of low nominal reduced velocity range it is interesting that the three start p 10 d h 0 15 d model reduces the slope of 1 vr of the cylinder from 0 158 to nearly horizontal this suggests that the coherent vortex structures of the cylinder have been disrupted and the viv has been successfully suppressed in fact by referring to the oscillation of the cylinder in fig 8 the bare cylinder and cylinder fitted with two start p 10 d h 0 15 d model are oscillating in smooth cyclic form on the other hand irregular fluctuations are observed in three start p 10 d 0 15 d model this result indicates that the regular vortex shedding has been disrupted and is replaced by an incoherent vortex structure in fact choi et al 2008 reported that the correlated vortex shedding can be prevented along the span by helical strakes as it is classified as 3d forcing control korkischko and meneghini 2011 also stated that strakes are able to increase vortex formation length and hence reduce the vortex shedding frequency hydrodynamic coefficient is one of the important parameters that need to be considered in evaluating the viv of a flexible cylinder it is commonly weighed in term of drag force coefficient c d mean as expressed in equation 4 4 c d m e a n f d m e a n 0 5 ρ u 2 l d where f d mean denotes the mean drag force ρ u l and d represent the density the flow velocity the length of the cylinder and the diameter of the cylinder respectively the maximum c d mean of a bare flexible cylinder is observed in the lock in region as shown in fig 9 a and b the c d mean of the flexible cylinder is in good agreement with the experimental data of huera huarte and bearman 2009 sanaati and kato 2012b and huera huarte et al 2014 as shown in fig 10 the average c d mean of the bare cylinder throughout the entire reduced velocity range is 2 654 which is larger than those of short rigid cylinder that undergoing force and free motions the same condition was also reported by huera huarte et al 2014 where the c d mean of a flexible cylinder was larger than three under the stepped flow the c d mean of helical strakes in fig 9 a and b as overall is lower than the bare cylinder in the lock in region except for three start h 0 05 d model this finding is different from the well known fact that installation of helical strakes induces large drag penalty on the cylinder dnv rp f204 2010 however the recent study by triantafyllou et al 2016 presented an opposite output by comparing a same cylinder in three conditions stationary flexible and flexible cylinder with helical strakes the authors reported that the c d mean of a bare flexible cylinder was ranged from 1 8 to 3 depending on the flow while for a flexible cylinder fitted with helical strakes the c d mean was around 1 7 they suggested that the helical strakes was able to reduce the wake deficit of the flexible cylinder and hence reduce the drag comparing the drag of a stationary cylinder and flexible cylinder fitted with helical strakes the former had the lower drag value 1 2 as the wake deficit of the stationary cylinder was small this statement justifies that for a rigid cylinder the use of helical strakes increases the drag but a bare flexible cylinder will have a higher drag which is in line with the results of the present study in addition it is also reported by somerville 2007 that the drag coefficient of bare cylinder was around 2 5 while 1 4 1 6 for strakes of 16d pitch however since the performance of the helical strakes is mostly empirical study and the information of drag on a low mass ratio flexible cylinder is inaccessible publically further experimental investigation is highly required for verification among the straked cylinder of different pitches and heights in fig 9 a and b no obvious increment of c d mean is found except for three start p 10 d h 0 15 d model in the lock out region the average c d mean values throughout the entire reduced velocity range are varying from 1 4 to 1 9 for strakes with different configurations table 3 for the two start helical strakes the average c d mean values in overall are lower as the suppression effectiveness is lower but no exact correlation is found for the amplitude reduction and the drag coefficient the interesting point is that for strakes height of 0 05d the c d mean is much higher compare to other configurations in both two and three start cases this may be due to the insufficiency of the strakes thickness to disrupt the boundary separation and hence the drag is higher and closer to the bare cylinder to further investigate the c d mean the average c d mean is decomposed into two regions namely lock in 3 2 v rn 11 5 and lock out v rn 11 5 regions as shown in table 4 in general the c d mean of the helical strakes in the lock in region varies unpredictably regardless to the configuration of the strakes however by comparing in between the two and three start strakes the c d mean of two start in the lock in region is found to be smaller table 4 also summarizes that in the lock out region the drag of the helical strakes is much higher compare to the lock in region this condition validates that the present study is still following the drag penalty of a cylinder where the drag of a less vibrating cylinder in the lock out region is larger than in lock in region where the cylinder is vibrating for both three start and two start helical strakes the increase of the pitch increases the c d mean in the lock out region which is also reported by gopalakrishnakurup et al 2006 the higher value of c d mean of h 0 05d as reported previously indicates that this strakes configuration is failed to disrupt the boundary layer of the cylinder hence the drag is much higher compare to the other strakes configuration in both three and two start helical strakes the values of c d mean of helical strakes in the lock out region based on table 3 are closed to the rigid cylinder fitted with strakes boubenider et al 2008 suggesting that the c d mean of helical strakes is always around the range of 1 4 1 7 regardless to the flexibility of the cylinder the significant amplification of c d mean of three start p 10 d h 0 15d model starting from vrn 13 1 13 9 and v rn 15 2 16 fig 9 b suggested that the cylinder is experiencing galloping during this period in general galloping occurs on a bluff body with edges according to paidoussis et al 2011 the characteristic of galloping includes its occurrence at low frequency high nominal reduced velocity velocity dependent and is not self limited these features match the finding of the present study because the frequency response of the three start p 10d h 0 15d strakes is low 2 5 hz and this phenomenon occurs at high nominal reduced velocity range v rn 13 besides as explained in quen et al 2014 that the coherent vortex structures have been eliminated therefore self limiting process does not exist similar suspicion was also reported by constantimides and oakley 2006 based on the amplitude response of a straked cylinder at high nominal reduced velocity garcia et al 2014 described the instability of galloping can be found in circular cylinder fitted with helical strakes due to its asymmetric cross sections the authors suggested that small damping ratio is one of the contributions towards galloping where the present study matches this criteria therefore it can be concluded that the large fluctuating hydrodynamic force response may be highly due to galloping effect 4 conclusion the frequency the vibration amplitude and the drag force coefficient responses of a low mass ratio flexible cylinder fitted with different strake configurations in the subcritical reynolds number range have been discussed in detail the installation of helical strakes has been shown to suppress the viv of the cylinder for a flexible cylinder but its effectiveness is different based on its configuration the three start helical strakes can suppress the major amplitude of a low mass ratio cylinder with significant peaks into a single amplitude peak of minor value up to 71 5 of the reduction is achieved by the p 10 d h 0 15 d model suppression effects are also noticeable in the cylinder fitted with two start helical strakes however the effectiveness is lower than the three start helical strakes where the lock in region is failed to be eliminated the present study shows that the strake height must be larger than the boundary layer thickness of the cylinder to better suppress the viv a change in the strake pitch does not significantly suppress the vibration but it can delay the occurrence of lock in of the cylinder and reduce the high mode vibration frequency pitch of 5d is found to be ineffective for a low mass ratio flexible cylinder note that the strakes with configurations of three start p 10 d h 0 10 d and three start p 10 d h 0 15 d have successfully eliminated the high mode il frequency throughout the subcritical reynolds number range in the present study which indicates that these configurations are more practical to be implemented in the industry besides it is interesting to find that the c dmean for both two and three start helical strakes is lower than the bare cylinder this may be due to the change of the boundary separation that result in smaller wake higher rear pressure and hence lesser drag the unexpected large c dmean for the three start p 10 d h 0 15 d model is suspected to be galloping effect as it occurs at low frequency range high nominal reduced velocity and is not self limited the less effectiveness of two start helical strakes may be because of the strakes coverage that is inadequate to disrupt the regular vortices efficiently therefore helix number plays an important role in affecting the separation of boundary and reducing the viv response acknowledgements this research was financially supported by universiti teknologi malaysia under research

23121,experiments have been conducted on a low mass ratio flexible cylinder with two and three start helical strakes which was free to vibrate in both in line and transverse water flow directions under the subcritical reynolds number the studied parameters included the cross flow amplitude response the frequency response in the in line and cross flow directions and the mean drag coefficient the effects of different helical strakes heights h 0 05 d 0 10 d and 0 15 d and pitches p 5 d 10 d 15 d were investigated for five different configurations in two and three start helical strakes respectively the present study has indicated that the strakes pitch changes the occurrence of the lock in region but only the three start p 10d model can suppress the high mode frequency strakes height is one of the important variables in reducing the amplitude responses of a cylinder while the number of helix is the most significant variable in affecting the performance of helical strakes the less effectiveness of two start helical strakes is due to the strakes coverage that is inadequate to disrupt the regular vortices efficiently the most effective helical strake configuration based on the configurations that are examined in the present study is the three start p 10 d h 0 15 d model keywords helical strakes vortex induced vibration flexible cylinder suppression low mass ratio 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv which is one of the most critical issues that cause fatigue damage in risers have received substantial attention during the last few decades because of the high demand for oil and gas resources vandiver and tae 1988 huera huarte and bearman 2009 song et al 2011 han et al 2017 domala and sharma 2017 many attempts have been made to understand the viv phenomenon for example raghavan and bernitsas 2011 reported that the reynolds number was a major parameter in influencing the viv response and character chen et al 2012 revealed the viv amplitude depended on the wave number the axial tension and the stiffness of the riser lee et al 2013 used a numerical model to simulate the vortex shedding and discovered that the vorticity moved further from the cylinder as the velocity increased because the exploration of hydrocarbon has moved into deeper ground water a longer flexible riser with a higher aspect ratio is required which induces higher viv risk particularly at high velocity the possibility of viv significantly increases if the structure has a low mass and damping ratio khalak and williamson 1999 in other words an effective suppression device that suits the long flexible riser with a low mass ratio is notably necessary however most previous studies on passive suppression techniques focused on short and rigid cylinders assi et al 2010 huang 2011 korkischko and meneghini 2010 the features that differentiate the rigid and flexible cylinder are that bending is not allowed for a rigid cylinder and the aspect ratio is usually small the aspect ratio is defined as the length over the diameter of the structure on the other hand the aspect ratio of a flexible cylinder is usually high and hence able to be bending in both in line il and cross flow cf directions where the il movement is parallel to the flow direction therefore a better understanding of this matter is necessary to ensure the safety of the long structure and to suppress the viv suppression devices are required some researchers have examined the suppression devices that modify the boundary layer separation and vortex wake these devices can be grouped as active or passive control devices because of the low manufacturing cost simple manufacturing process and simple installation passive control devices are satisfactory and commonly used zdravkovich 1981 classified the technique of passive control into several types among these techniques controlling the boundary layer of fluid using surface protrusion such as tripping wire helical strakes and fins are found to be more effective kim et al 2009 zhou et al 2011 although several of passive suppression devices are available only helical strake is discussed in the present study because it is proven as one of the most effective devices that can be implemented in various applications to suppress viv allen et al 2008 in general helical strakes with three start helix are the commercial model that is implemented in the offshore industries the change of the helix number has gained less attention in the investigation in the recent study of highway lighting towers nchrp 2012 it was reported that two start helical strakes were very effective in reducing the viv compared to a single start helical strakes zdravkovich 1981 also reported that strakes with single and eight starts were less efficient in reducing the viv in the viv study in water on the other hand baarholm and lie 2005 had studied the suppression efficiency between 3 start and 4 start strakes the efficiency of both configurations were almost the same however the mean drag coefficient increased as the start number increased therefore they proposed that 3 start helical strakes was preferable compare to a 4 start strakes besides halkyard et al 2006 also discovered that three start helical strakes were more practical compared to four start helical strakes to the best of our knowledge the response of the two start helical strakes in reducing the viv in water is still unexplored in fact it has the advantage of lesser weight and is easier to be manufactured compare to three start helical strakes besides good performance was found in the application of wind based structure therefore it gains our interest to investigate the effects of two start helical strakes towards the suppression of the viv of a flexible cylinder in water in addition the force responses of two start helical strakes are inaccessible publically the force responses are very important as excessive force especially at the well head joint of flexible riser will result fracture on the structure hence the hydrodynamic response of a flexible cylinder with low mass ratio fitted with two and three start helical strakes is presented in the present study to shed some light on this issue the main objective of the present study is to identify the effectiveness of the two start and three start helical strakes in suppressing the vortex induced vibration viv of a long flexible cylinder with low mass ratio under uniform current it is believed that outputs of the present work is useful in reducing viv and fatigue life of riser three different strakes heights and three different strakes pitches are tested separately on two start and three start helical strakes to identify the parameter that has more contributions in suppressing the viv of cylinder the vibration amplitude the frequency response and the mean drag coefficient are of interest in the following sections the experimental details and the identified parameters are carefully discussed before drawing a conclusion 2 methodology the experiment was conducted in the towing tank of the department of naval architecture and ocean engineering of osaka university the experiment basin is 100 m in length 7 8 m in width and 4 35 m in depth the cylinders were submerged 0 35 m from the still water level to avoid the free surface effects on the response of the cylinders the cylinders were horizontally towed by the carriage to produce a uniform flow the towing speed was varied from 0 1 m s to 1 m s at intervals of 0 03 m s so that the reynolds number was between 1380 and 13800 as shown in table 1 fig 1 shows the layout of the experiment where it comprised of the mounting frame tensioning system and universal joints the details of the experimental facility can be referred to sanaati and kato 2012a the polyvinyl chloride pvc cylinder with a diameter d of 18 mm and a length l of 2 92 m which results in an aspect ratio of 162 offers high flexibility with low bending dependence the helical strakes were made of rubber fig 2 a and designed to have either two start or three start helical pattern as shown in fig 2 b three different helical strakes heights h 0 05 d 0 10 d and 0 15 d and three pitches p 5 d 10 d and 15 d were examined where d is the diameter of the cylinder an adhesive was used to attach the strakes onto the cylinder the mass ratio of the cylinder is relatively low where m 1 17 when the cylinder is filled with water both ends of the cylinder were pinned with universal joints to allow the cylinder to bend in the il and cf directions but the cylinder was constrained in torsion the directions of il and cf are represented as y and x axis respectively in fig 3 a moveable sliding end in the axial direction was designed at one end of the cylinder with an initial tension of 147 n a spring with a stiffness of 6 5 n mm was attached between the universal joint and the sliding end to prevent excessive tensile stress from accumulating when the water current flows around the cylinder the schematic diagram of the explained model set up is shown in fig 3 the test cases were named based on the pitch size and the strake height there were five strake arrangements based on the strake configurations pitch p 10 d height h 0 05 d p 10 d h 0 10 d p 10 d h 0 15 d p 5 d h 0 10 d and p 15 d h 0 10 d a total of 308 runs were performed for these experimental cases starting from still water 75 s of measurements were recorded for each run of the cases however only the data with a constant speed were analysed to ensure the consistency of the outputs to avoid the flow transient effects a rest interval of 10 min was implemented between each test due to the size of towing tank and the operational condition of the towing carriage only subcritical reynolds numbers can be examined in the study however it is expected that the finding can be applied to the real ocean structures of higher reynolds numbers re the performance of the helical strakes does not influenced by the higher re because according to korkischko et al 2007 the flow separation point of helical strakes are fixed besides it is proven by simantiras and willis 1999 that over various re the drag of the cylinder fitted with helical strakes was unchanged practically hence the outputs of the paper is believed to be applicable even for high re the variation of the tension was measured using a tension load cell which was installed between the spring and the adjustable end for pre tension adjustment two half bridge strain gauges are used to measure the hydrodynamic forces they are attached on the square cross section rod of fix end support of the cylinder between the universal joint and the mounting fix end as shown in fig 3 the sampling rate of the strain gauge is 200 hz and a 100 hz of cut off frequency is applied to filter unavoidable noises two ccd cameras were used to measure the vibrational amplitude in the cross flow cf directions the cameras were cantilevered on a strut which were approximately 20 diameters above and behind the cylinder five points with a centre to centre distance of 100 mm were indicated at the centre of the cylinder using fluorescent tapes as the target to be captured because only the response at the centre of the cylinder was captured the amplitude response of the cylinder during the dominance of the second vibration mode was small as shown in the following section the sampling rate of the camera was 30 hz the camera was calibrated in three dimensions within allowable motion which indicated a high accuracy in measuring the amplitude response the motion of the cylinder was simultaneously recorded by the above and below cameras then these videos were synchronised for the analysis using a commercial motion tracking software the reason of capturing the response at the centre of the cylinder is because the use of uniform flow current in the study it is expected that the maximum displacement especially the first vibration mode occurs at the centre of the cylinder rather than other locations the frequencies computed from a different location along the length of the cylinder is expected to be the same this can be proved by comparing the frequency responses obtained from the ccd camera and the tension load cell the load cell was installed at the end of the cylinder fig 3 and the tension signal is expected to capture the response along the length of the cylinder in fact based on fig 4 it can be clearly seen that the analysed frequencies responses from the camera are able to represent the dominant frequencies along the length of the cylinder as similar to load cell the free decay test in still water was performed by imposing an initial displacement on the cylinder and releasing it which yielded the first vibration mode of the natural frequency in still water for the bare cylinder and cylinders with strakes the measured natural frequency for bare cylinder is 2 91 hz while cylinders fitted with helical strakes are about 2 62 2 89 hz as shown in table 2 the natural frequency of the cylinder in still water can also be identified using the analytical method which was derived from the general equation of free vibration for an elastic beam sanaati and kato 2012b 1 n 2 2 t m l 2 n 2 π 2 2 e i m l 4 f n n 1 2 3 where t and l are the tension and the length of the cylinder respectively ei is the bending stiffness and m is the mass per unit length including the added mass m a where the added mass coefficient is assumed to be 1 the analytical natural frequency is shown in table 2 up to the fourth vibration mode the measured first mode natural frequencies are consistent with the first mode analytical values in this study the first mode of the analytical natural frequency with an added mass coefficient of 1 0 is used to define the nominal 3 results and discussions in general the dynamic responses of a cylinder can be represented by the non dimensional cross flow cf amplitude ratio a versus the nominal reduced velocity vrn where a can be obtained by dividing the standard deviation of the time series displacement by the cylinder diameter a astd d and vrn u f n d is the non dimensional velocity the natural frequency f n of the nominal reduced velocity is obtained through equation 1 with an added mass coefficient of 1 0 the standard deviation of the displacement astd is an important parameter to identify the level of the amplitude fluctuation the large amplitude fluctuation indicates the cylinder is experiencing significant vibration to verify the accuracy and reliability of the present study the amplitude ratio of the bare cylinder of the present study is compared with the previous studies cicolin and assi 2017 govardhan and williamson 2000 sanaati and kato 2012a b as shown in fig 5 a unlike the high mass ratio cylinder that displays only two branches an initial branch and a lower branch as reported by sumer and fredsoe 2006 a low mass ratio bare cylinder exhibits an additional upper branch as shown in fig 5 a the presence of these branches was also demonstrated by branković and bearman 2006 and korkischko and meneghini 2010 the clear typical amplitude response of fig 5 a which include the initial branch upper branch lower branch and desynchronization of a low mass ratio cylinder are noticed for all of the studies proofing the reliability of the present study fig 5 b and c shows the cf amplitude ratios of a low mass ratio cylinder and the cylinders of different strake configurations the maximum cf amplitude ratio of the bare cylinder and cylinders with two start and three start helical strakes occurs in the lock in region as indicated in fig 5 b and c the lock in region in the present study can be defined as the synchronisation of the vortex shedding frequency with the oscillating frequency of the cylinder fig 5 b indicates that increasing the strake pitch slightly delays the occurrence of lock in range from vrn 3 5 for the two start p 5 d model to vrn 5 2 for the three start p 15 d model the maximum standard deviation of amplitude for two start p 5d model is around 0 53 with the existence of upper branch this model fails to postpone the occurrence of the lock in where it follows the amplitude trend of the bare cylinder with slightly lower amplitude ratio the other two larger pitches two start 10d and two start 15d display their peak in the range of 0 3 0 4 without the presence of upper branch for three start helical strakes on the other hand the amplitude reduction is more significant however the difference between pitches is trivial varying the strake pitch does not significantly reduce the amplitude response because it only changes the strake coverage on the cylinder surface to reduce the amplitude responses the regular vortices behind a cylinder have to be disrupted by changing the separation of the boundary layer constantimides and oakley 2006 and creating the three dimensional vorticity characters the three dimensional vorticity prevents the shedding of vortices from correlating along the span korkischko and meneghini 2010 korkischko et al 2007 this procedure can be achieved by increasing the strake height as shown in fig 5 c where taller strakes correspond to more amplitude reduction for three start helical strakes strakes of p 10 d h 0 15 d is the most effective model with 71 5 of reduction although the increase of strakes height decrease the amplitude response for two start helical strakes the percentage of reduction is not substantial as for three start helical strakes to identify the performance of different helical strake configurations in suppressing the amplitude responses of the cylinder the percentage of amplitude reduction at the centre of the cylinder is calculated p e r c e n t a g e o f a m p l i t u d e r e d u c t i o n a s t d d m a x b a r e a s t d d m a x s t r a k e s a s t d d m a x b a r e x 100 only the amplitude response at the centre of the cylinder is measured for the maximum reduction multiple modes suppression is unable to be represented using this equation however the reduction of first mode vibration gives an idea on the effectiveness of the helical strakes as shown in table 3 the change of pitch configurations has small effects on the amplitude reduction to the best of the authors knowledge the effectiveness range of the pitch is wide from 5d to 17 5d based on the available literature trim et al 2005 sui et al 2016 the claim of the optimal pitch is varies based on the condition of the flow type and current the latest literature fang et al 2014 reported that pitch of 17 5d was the optimal pitch to be used in the industry however the higher the pitch the larger the drag coefficient therefore compromise should be done in between these two factors in the present study of a low mass ratio flexible cylinder p 10d and p 15d are found to be more effective as compare to p 5d where up to 30 of deviation is noticed for p 10 d and p 15 d the percentage of amplitude reduction is almost the same hence pitches of 10d and 15d are more recommended to be used for a low mass ratio flexible cylinder compare to 5d from the aspect of strakes height the maximum reductions in two start and three start helical strakes are found in h 0 15d model with 44 8 and 71 5 of decrement respectively up to 31 of deviation is found for strakes with different heights in fact the strake height must be larger than the boundary layer thickness 0 06 d to better suppress the viv the boundary layer thickness y can be calculated using the pohlausen s approximation schlichting 1968 by referring to the largest angle of separation point 103 14 as follows 2 v l y r u r ν where v l is the boundary layer velocity and r u and ν denote the cylinder radius the velocity and the kinematic viscosity respectively detail explanation on the thickness of laminar boundary layers can be referred to schlichting 1968 and quen et al 2014 based on fig 5 b and c the amplitude reduction of two start helical strakes is apparently lesser than the three start helical strakes this may be due to the coverage of the two start helical strakes that is inadequate to effectively disrupt the regular vortices sadeh and saharon 1982 reported that the separation point of a circular cylinder was depending on the turbulence condition and the reynolds number which ranged from 85 to 130 based on the leading edge of a cylinder the installation of helical strakes changes the separation point depended on the position of the strakes constantimides and oakley 2006 for two start helical strakes most of the cylinder surface is not covered with strakes as the angle between each strake is 180 therefore the separation of the boundary is mainly controlled by the bare region of the cylinder as a result the correlated cylinder wake pattern is highly retained the use of three start helical strakes improves the coverage of helical strakes into 120 for each strake allowing the boundary separation to be highly influenced by the strakes due to the change of the boundary separation along the cylinder spanwise three dimensionality of the flow is created constantimides and oakley 2006 and hence the regular vortex behind the cylinder is disrupted the outputs show that the number of helix plays an important role in suppressing the amplitude response of a flexible cylinder as it significantly affect the boundary separation of a cylinder figs 6 and 7 indicates the cross flow cf and in line il frequency response of a low mass ratio bare cylinder and the cylinders with different strake configurations respectively the cf and il frequency ratio are obtained by dividing the cf and il frequency responses with the still water natural frequency of the cylinder obtained using equation 1 respectively only the dominant frequency is considered in each case using a fast flourier transform fft based on the time series of the displacement data throughout the discussion the term mode used in the study indicates the vibration mode of the cylinder the reduced velocity vr can be obtained by vr u f x d where u is the flow velocity d is the cylinder diameter and f x is the crossflow cf response frequency by plotting a linear fit of the slope based on fig 6 a the 1 vr is found to be 0 158 this value is consistent with that found by huera huarte 2006 for a flexible cylinder based on fig 6 a unlike for a rigid cylinder the ratio of the synchronised cf shedding frequency with the still water natural frequency of the flexible cylinder during the lock in phenomenon from vrn 3 2 to 11 5 is not unity in fact for a low mass ratio cylinder the oscillating frequency is the effective natural frequency of the cylinder khalak and williamson 1999 which is defined as 3 f n v r 1 2 π k m c e a v r m d where m d denotes the displaced mass of the fluid m d πρd 2 l 4 and k denotes the spring stiffness c ea is the effective added mass coefficient which includes the force component with the body acceleration and can be obtained from the euler bernoulli beam equation assuming that the forces and the response are sinusoidal the details of the formulation of can be referred to tang et al 2011 as described by gabbai and benaroya 2005 and vikestad et al 2000 the effective added mass coefficient of a cylinder decreases with the nominal reduced velocity which increases the effective natural frequency according to khalak and williamson 1999 the c ea increases significantly as the mass ratio becomes smaller and hence resulting the non unity behaviour of cf frequency ratio during lock in to obtain the cf frequency ratio close to 1 they define the synchronisation occurs as the shedding frequency f s matches the body oscillation frequency f n v r not the natural frequency in still water f n through this definition cf frequency ratio during the lock in phenomenon will be close to 1 for the tested strakes the cf frequency ratio of the cylinder fitted with two start helical strakes of various pitches fig 6 a follow the cf frequency trend of bare cylinder very well while the three start strakes slightly reduce the linear fit slope when the strakes height increased fig 6 b both the two start and three start strakes show noticeable reduction on the linear fit slope the cf frequency response of two start h 0 15 d is found to have lower frequency values compare to three start h 0 05 d and h 0 10 d models indicating that the height of the strakes is one of the key parameter in suppressing the viv of a cylinder similar to the cf frequency response fig 7 a indicates that the il frequency ratio of two start straked cylinder of different pitches follows the il frequency trend of bare cylinder nevertheless dissimilar to the bare cylinder that vibrates at second mode in low reduced velocities the il frequency ratios of all cases of strakes are smaller during lock in vibrate at the first mode indicating all of the helical strakes are able to suppress high mode frequency in the lock in region however the timing of the switch into higher mode is not the same for different pitches of strakes two start p 5d model switches the earliest even earlier than the bare cylinder from the first mode to fourth mode and it is followed by two start p 15d and lastly two start p 10d model the same trend is found in three start cases the slower jump into high mode of p 10d shows that it is more operative comparing to the other pitch configuration in suppressing the high mode frequency for two start helical strakes of various strakes heights lower il frequency ratios are obtained in the lock in region fig 7 b as similar to the pitch cases although two start h 0 15 d is able to perform good suppression effect at low nominal reduced velocity it is unable to reduce viv of flexible cylinder at high vrn as secondary lock in is still noticed at vrn 15 8 this suggests that the two start p 0 15 d strakes may only be suitable in condition of low nominal reduced velocity range it is interesting that the three start p 10 d h 0 15 d model reduces the slope of 1 vr of the cylinder from 0 158 to nearly horizontal this suggests that the coherent vortex structures of the cylinder have been disrupted and the viv has been successfully suppressed in fact by referring to the oscillation of the cylinder in fig 8 the bare cylinder and cylinder fitted with two start p 10 d h 0 15 d model are oscillating in smooth cyclic form on the other hand irregular fluctuations are observed in three start p 10 d 0 15 d model this result indicates that the regular vortex shedding has been disrupted and is replaced by an incoherent vortex structure in fact choi et al 2008 reported that the correlated vortex shedding can be prevented along the span by helical strakes as it is classified as 3d forcing control korkischko and meneghini 2011 also stated that strakes are able to increase vortex formation length and hence reduce the vortex shedding frequency hydrodynamic coefficient is one of the important parameters that need to be considered in evaluating the viv of a flexible cylinder it is commonly weighed in term of drag force coefficient c d mean as expressed in equation 4 4 c d m e a n f d m e a n 0 5 ρ u 2 l d where f d mean denotes the mean drag force ρ u l and d represent the density the flow velocity the length of the cylinder and the diameter of the cylinder respectively the maximum c d mean of a bare flexible cylinder is observed in the lock in region as shown in fig 9 a and b the c d mean of the flexible cylinder is in good agreement with the experimental data of huera huarte and bearman 2009 sanaati and kato 2012b and huera huarte et al 2014 as shown in fig 10 the average c d mean of the bare cylinder throughout the entire reduced velocity range is 2 654 which is larger than those of short rigid cylinder that undergoing force and free motions the same condition was also reported by huera huarte et al 2014 where the c d mean of a flexible cylinder was larger than three under the stepped flow the c d mean of helical strakes in fig 9 a and b as overall is lower than the bare cylinder in the lock in region except for three start h 0 05 d model this finding is different from the well known fact that installation of helical strakes induces large drag penalty on the cylinder dnv rp f204 2010 however the recent study by triantafyllou et al 2016 presented an opposite output by comparing a same cylinder in three conditions stationary flexible and flexible cylinder with helical strakes the authors reported that the c d mean of a bare flexible cylinder was ranged from 1 8 to 3 depending on the flow while for a flexible cylinder fitted with helical strakes the c d mean was around 1 7 they suggested that the helical strakes was able to reduce the wake deficit of the flexible cylinder and hence reduce the drag comparing the drag of a stationary cylinder and flexible cylinder fitted with helical strakes the former had the lower drag value 1 2 as the wake deficit of the stationary cylinder was small this statement justifies that for a rigid cylinder the use of helical strakes increases the drag but a bare flexible cylinder will have a higher drag which is in line with the results of the present study in addition it is also reported by somerville 2007 that the drag coefficient of bare cylinder was around 2 5 while 1 4 1 6 for strakes of 16d pitch however since the performance of the helical strakes is mostly empirical study and the information of drag on a low mass ratio flexible cylinder is inaccessible publically further experimental investigation is highly required for verification among the straked cylinder of different pitches and heights in fig 9 a and b no obvious increment of c d mean is found except for three start p 10 d h 0 15 d model in the lock out region the average c d mean values throughout the entire reduced velocity range are varying from 1 4 to 1 9 for strakes with different configurations table 3 for the two start helical strakes the average c d mean values in overall are lower as the suppression effectiveness is lower but no exact correlation is found for the amplitude reduction and the drag coefficient the interesting point is that for strakes height of 0 05d the c d mean is much higher compare to other configurations in both two and three start cases this may be due to the insufficiency of the strakes thickness to disrupt the boundary separation and hence the drag is higher and closer to the bare cylinder to further investigate the c d mean the average c d mean is decomposed into two regions namely lock in 3 2 v rn 11 5 and lock out v rn 11 5 regions as shown in table 4 in general the c d mean of the helical strakes in the lock in region varies unpredictably regardless to the configuration of the strakes however by comparing in between the two and three start strakes the c d mean of two start in the lock in region is found to be smaller table 4 also summarizes that in the lock out region the drag of the helical strakes is much higher compare to the lock in region this condition validates that the present study is still following the drag penalty of a cylinder where the drag of a less vibrating cylinder in the lock out region is larger than in lock in region where the cylinder is vibrating for both three start and two start helical strakes the increase of the pitch increases the c d mean in the lock out region which is also reported by gopalakrishnakurup et al 2006 the higher value of c d mean of h 0 05d as reported previously indicates that this strakes configuration is failed to disrupt the boundary layer of the cylinder hence the drag is much higher compare to the other strakes configuration in both three and two start helical strakes the values of c d mean of helical strakes in the lock out region based on table 3 are closed to the rigid cylinder fitted with strakes boubenider et al 2008 suggesting that the c d mean of helical strakes is always around the range of 1 4 1 7 regardless to the flexibility of the cylinder the significant amplification of c d mean of three start p 10 d h 0 15d model starting from vrn 13 1 13 9 and v rn 15 2 16 fig 9 b suggested that the cylinder is experiencing galloping during this period in general galloping occurs on a bluff body with edges according to paidoussis et al 2011 the characteristic of galloping includes its occurrence at low frequency high nominal reduced velocity velocity dependent and is not self limited these features match the finding of the present study because the frequency response of the three start p 10d h 0 15d strakes is low 2 5 hz and this phenomenon occurs at high nominal reduced velocity range v rn 13 besides as explained in quen et al 2014 that the coherent vortex structures have been eliminated therefore self limiting process does not exist similar suspicion was also reported by constantimides and oakley 2006 based on the amplitude response of a straked cylinder at high nominal reduced velocity garcia et al 2014 described the instability of galloping can be found in circular cylinder fitted with helical strakes due to its asymmetric cross sections the authors suggested that small damping ratio is one of the contributions towards galloping where the present study matches this criteria therefore it can be concluded that the large fluctuating hydrodynamic force response may be highly due to galloping effect 4 conclusion the frequency the vibration amplitude and the drag force coefficient responses of a low mass ratio flexible cylinder fitted with different strake configurations in the subcritical reynolds number range have been discussed in detail the installation of helical strakes has been shown to suppress the viv of the cylinder for a flexible cylinder but its effectiveness is different based on its configuration the three start helical strakes can suppress the major amplitude of a low mass ratio cylinder with significant peaks into a single amplitude peak of minor value up to 71 5 of the reduction is achieved by the p 10 d h 0 15 d model suppression effects are also noticeable in the cylinder fitted with two start helical strakes however the effectiveness is lower than the three start helical strakes where the lock in region is failed to be eliminated the present study shows that the strake height must be larger than the boundary layer thickness of the cylinder to better suppress the viv a change in the strake pitch does not significantly suppress the vibration but it can delay the occurrence of lock in of the cylinder and reduce the high mode vibration frequency pitch of 5d is found to be ineffective for a low mass ratio flexible cylinder note that the strakes with configurations of three start p 10 d h 0 10 d and three start p 10 d h 0 15 d have successfully eliminated the high mode il frequency throughout the subcritical reynolds number range in the present study which indicates that these configurations are more practical to be implemented in the industry besides it is interesting to find that the c dmean for both two and three start helical strakes is lower than the bare cylinder this may be due to the change of the boundary separation that result in smaller wake higher rear pressure and hence lesser drag the unexpected large c dmean for the three start p 10 d h 0 15 d model is suspected to be galloping effect as it occurs at low frequency range high nominal reduced velocity and is not self limited the less effectiveness of two start helical strakes may be because of the strakes coverage that is inadequate to disrupt the regular vortices efficiently therefore helix number plays an important role in affecting the separation of boundary and reducing the viv response acknowledgements this research was financially supported by universiti teknologi malaysia under research

23122,adjective based design is a method that translates human perception into design parameters quantitatively in order to achieve better understanding between designers and clients in this approach adjectives are used to describe product designs which are generated via design parameters in terms of geometry as a requirement of the concept relations between hull adjectives e g comfortable and aesthetic and design parameters e g length and width are learned via a machine learning algorithm nevertheless the relations cannot be represented by some of the design parameters although they are in the learning process this issue shows that the parameters do not impact the adjective choices but add noises to the learning process therefore in this study visual evaluations are made using eye tracking technology for screening the parameters based on their attractiveness and establishing relations between the attractive ones and the adjectives to enhance quality of the relation representations eye tracking is used in perceptual research which proves the existence of correlations between gaze data and human preferences the main advantage of eye tracking is that reliable human perception data can more likely be collected compared to the user tests since the evaluation is based on subjects attention rather than applying solely questionnaires that are limited by the question content in light of the benefits and finding an eye tracking device is used to collect gaze data and then eye tracking tools such as area of interest aoi scan path and heat map are used to evaluate attractiveness of the design parameters finally regression analysis is used to represent relations between gaze data of design parameters and the adjectives keywords industrial design human factor in design adjective based design parametric design eye tracking generalized linear model glm 1 introduction 1 1 adjective based design product performance and qualities are not solely good enough criteria for clients as the market competition has already made them compulsory for products with high quality and good performance design is highly important for clients to make the final decision creusen and schoormans 2005 yamamoto and lambert 1994 however this criterion is not a clear target to be reached and is measured through client satisfaction which is highly related to human feelings therefore it is difficult to forecast this criterion beforehand dogan and gunpinar 2017 proposed the adjective based design method which quantizes human feelings and represents them as relations between adjectives e g charismatic and modern and design parameters that are geometrically defined on products e g lengths and widths such approach aims to provide better communication between designers and clients blijlevens et al 2009 in this method feelings about designs can be easily expressed using adjectives and their relations with design parameters are used as a guide by designers thus understanding clients and appealing them can be successfully achieved in relatively short times dogan and gunpinar 2017 applied the adjective based method to yacht hulls they first learned 10 hull adjectives using a survey method and defined design parameters on hull covering common hull features a second survey was then applied to eliminate irrelevant parameters searching whether the modifications of these parameters affect any of the adjective choices made by the subjects after the eliminations the remaining design parameters were used to generate hull designs via a novel parametric design framework which is also similar to the method proposed by khan et al 2017 then another survey was conducted where the designed hulls were matched with the hull adjectives to create a dataset that included corresponding parameter values and the matched adjectives for each hull finally a machine learning algorithm that used neural network was fed with the dataset to represent relations between the adjectives and the design parameters as mathematical models however some design parameters relations with the adjectives could not be established thus it was concluded that the design parameters did not affect the subjects adjective choices such noises are caused by unrelated parameters and need to be removed to raise the quality of relation representations in this study it is assumed that if an appearance feature of a product does not attract subjects the related design parameter with the feature is unattractive and irrelevant to the adjectives as well an eye tracking device is used to evaluate the degree of attractiveness of design parameters observing where the subjects attention is focused 1 2 eye tracking system eye tracking where eye movements of subjects are recorded as gaze points on given stimuli is a commonly used method in neuroscience psychology computer science industrial engineering and marketing duchowski 2002 in the eye tracking system illuminators are used to generate near infrared lights and images of their reflections from eyes are captured by cameras in addition an external processor is used to process the images to analyze the reflection patterns and generate a 3d model of the eye with its position in space the 3d eye model is then used to calculate locations of the gaze points on relevant stimuli eye movements are illustrated on stimuli via fixations which are a batch of gaze points accumulated within a predefined span in shape of circles and saccades are displayed via straight lines that show eye movements from one fixation to another fig 1 a in this study the attractiveness of target areas is analyzed through fixation locations and durations at the locations as well as scan paths noton and stark 1971 which are combinations of fixations and saccades fixations are widely analyzed using the area of interest aoi tool and heat maps blascheck et al 2014 using the aoi tool targets are surrounded with diverse shapes fig 1 b to perform quantitative analysis with various metrics such as fixation duration and visit count the heat map fig 1 c represents fixation accumulated areas based on a color scale where red indicates more attractive areas than the rest of the image one method to examine the scan path is defining aois see fig 1 d for yellow rectangular shapes on the path that needs to be searched and the transitions between the aois will indicate how often frequency the path is used a transition matrix is also used to summarize the transitions in matrix form as illustrated in fig 1 e 1 3 template learning survey tls design parameters can be classified as local and global parameters fig 2 according to their impact on hull appearance local parameters are the ones that have full control on the target shape such as radii of feature curves on the other hand global design parameters affect large areas e g lengths and widths and the recorded gaze data on these areas can be found in any shape related to the search behavior of subjects thus gaze points for global parameters first need to be identified according to the search behavior of subjects in order to analyze them with an appropriate strategy to do this a survey is used called tls where all the learned identifier information for the relevant parameter is named as template 1 4 proposed approach according to the flow of the proposed approach displayed in fig 3 the eye tracking aided survey etas is first applied where participants select appropriate adjectives from a given list for the hull images and gaze points of participants are recorded the local parameters are analyzed by defining aois while the global parameters are first applied tls to learn their templates to determine a suitable analysis method if a template of a global parameter shows the gaze points in the shape of accumulation in a particular area the parameter is also treated as the local parameter since it is searched locally on the other hand if the gaze data are spread out instead of being gathered in local areas scan path analysis is used relative time durations rtds are then calculated for local parameters with the outcome of aoi analysis and transition probabilities frequency of path usage are calculated for global parameters which are analyzed via the scan path in the end the two calculated metrics for the design parameters are used to compare their attractiveness finally relations between gaze data of attractive parameters and the responses adjective choices are searched using regression analysis 2 related work this study is related to the adjective based design method which is similar to other human oriented design studies such as kansei engineering nagamachi 2002 and semantic attribute based concepts chaudhuri et al 2013 since these design concepts put the human perception in the center of the design process this study is also related to the cognitive research conducted to learn human preferences we are specifically interested in the research where eye tracking systems are used 2 1 adjective based design literature covers several studies on human preferences to explore identify and convert human emotions into physical entities to estimate their possible preferences nagamachi 2002 for example yanagisawa et al 2016 created a model based design method that used kansei database to forecast customer preferences and obtain former understanding about human perception of the designs for the designers chen and chang 2009 proposed a method to extract appearance attributes and determine mathematical models correlating the attributes with customer responses in order to estimate their possible preferences about product designs chaudhuri et al 2013 proposed attribit which assembles 3d models where assembly parts are related to semantic attributes the relations are explored and the parts are ranked according to their degree of relevant attributes through surveys in a similar direction in our previous study the adjective based design method dogan and gunpinar 2017 is proposed and used in this study to develop a method for screening design parameters 2 2 eye tracking studies gaze data basically show the areas that have and those that have not caught the interest of subjects there are several studies using eye tracking systems that have found relations between gaze data and emotions and or preferences alshehri and alghowinem 2013 stated that eye movements are related to the emotional states of subjects as they have diverse reactions for pleasant and unpleasant media yousefi et al 2015 suggested the use of eye tracking for construction processes analyzing the relations between gaze data and user satisfaction mohammadpour et al 2015 applied user tests recording gaze data where building designs were evaluated by subjects and long fixation durations for attractive designs were measured kim et al 2013 examined correlations between nightscape preference degrees and gaze points and found that subjects spent more time on the preferred images noland et al 2017 used eye tracking in their survey which allowed qualitative and quantitative investigations of images related to urban planning the study results showed that cars and parking were ranked negatively while new urbanist parts of the images such as people and pedestrian features were mostly highly ranked this study is motivated to use eye tracking technology with these findings to evaluate the attractiveness of the design parameters 2 3 eye tracking studies for product design there are a few studies that use the eye tracking framework to particularly understand outstanding design features or how human aesthetic understanding is formed by product appearance kukkonen 2005 studied product designs with an example of mobile phones where gaze data of subjects were compared through a questionnaire and strong correlations were found between them in that study five mobile phones were shown in pairs to the subjects including designers and gaze data for product attitudes and preferences were analyzed köhler et al 2015 extended the well known kansei engineering method using eye tracking in order to evaluate product aesthetics from the perspective of human perception and validated the results using descriptive and statistical analysis procedures koivunen koivunen et al 2004 claimed that the way people look at designs is important and suggested strategies about first impression of the subjects which they thought can help designers du and macdonald 2014 also analyzed the relative importance of visual product attributes and the impact of the attributes sizes on human preferences by using an eye tracking device their study showed the existence of significant relations between the gaze data and attribute importance and used ordinal logistic regression to predict the importance of both attributes and their size changes khalighy et al 2015 formulated aesthetic understanding of subjects through the gaze data depending on beauty and attractiveness drivers they asserted that the aesthetic formula succeeds in estimating human preferences via gaze data the above studies aimed to learn important geometric features to help designers in understanding customer needs and desires our goal is in a similar direction however we go further and provide an adjective based design concept which is a kind of translator that converts adjectives which is the design aesthetic language of clients into design parameters which is the language of designers moreover the importance of design parameters over appearance features is found which are combination of design parameters a design framework is also proposed that works with the design parameters which means that the findings can be directly used by the design framework unless subjective decisions are required by designers besides all these benefits our screening method is conducted more systematically as an orthogonal array is used to sample designs having varied geometric features where the design parameter values are equally changed through the 54 hull designs it is believed that to get favorable results from the design evaluations such systematic approach is needed to observe real perceptions of humans when they see varied features to the best of our knowledge the existing product evaluation studies with eye tracking systems use limited number of existing design samples which may be good enough to propose their methods but cannot offer proper evaluation due to lack of systematically prepared enough design variations 3 experiment materials and setup the experiments were conducted with 54 hull design images and 10 adjectives which were obtained from dogan and gunpinar 2017 in that study frequently used adjectives were determined via a survey where participants were shown various yacht hull models and asked to describe them via adjectives social listening method was then used to enlarge the adjective dictionary and the retrospective think aloud method hyrskykari et al 2008 was used to validate the determined adjectives via subjects feedbacks finally the following 10 adjectives were determined strong a 1 speedy a 2 comfortable a 3 aesthetic a 4 usual common a 5 aggressive a 6 compact a 7 modern a 8 charismatic a 9 and cute a 10 before the surveys were conducted each participant was provided car images related to the adjectives for the illustration the reason for selecting cars rather than yachts was to not steer the subjects while they were matching adjectives with the hulls but only show them how an adjective can be related to a product design the car images were obtained from the web and are not shared with this paper due to copyright issues in addition dictionaries were used to standardize adjective definitions for the subjects in the end each participant was trained with several hull models for warming up purposes hull models were sampled using the taguchi experimental method taguchi and taguchi 1988 which suggests an l54 orthogonal array for 25 design parameters with three levels and one with two levels each level was assigned an appropriate value to determine dimensions for the 54 hulls the hull models were then generated via a novel parametric design framework proposed by khan et al 2017 where a hull is divided into three parts entrance section middle body section and run section fig 4 according to the framework the entrance section surface is obtained via loft operation between forward profile fp and entrance station profile sp e middle body section is generated by lofting between sp e and middle body station profile sp m and run section is generated by lofting between sp m and run station profile sp r note that the lofting processes between profiles were performed following top bottom and feature middle guide curves to control the surfaces furthermore only half of the model was first lofted and mirroring operation was then performed to obtain the full model the design parameters with their definitions are given in table 1 and the hull locations are illustrated in fig 4 3 1 etas etas questions were prepared using images of 54 hull models with the front top and side views providing the same pixel meter ratio based on lengths widths and depths to simplify the understanding of dimension changes and fair aoi definitions section 4 1 2 note that additional views were not used since they would add nothing to the three views in terms of showing design parameters but disperse the focus of the subjects to widen areas fig 5 a shows the experimental setup where the screen was 520 mm wide and 325 mm high 24 inch diagonal and the image one of the etas questions had 1920 1080 resolution a screen based eye tracking device tobii pro x3 120 was used with a sampling rate of 120 hz moreover participants were free to move their head within 500 mm width and 400 mm height according to the report of the producer owing to this setup the subjects were not disturbed by the device and hence could behave more naturally in addition the tracker had a reported accuracy of 0 4 and precision of 0 24 finally the distance between the participants and the tracker was set as 650 mm the etas question interface for a hull design is given in fig 5 b which shows the design with three views and the location of adjectives participants were asked to select at least two appropriate adjectives from the list in order to increase the time spent on the hull as time limitation was not applied for etas the responses were verbally expressed by the subjects and recorded by an operator via google form so that the subjects could keep looking at the screen and not interrupt the gaze recording this part is important for computing the rtds since each time a subject looks away from the screen to select an adjective leads to empty gaze data while the time period of the questionnaire is increasing before each experiment calibration was made using a calibration tool of the tracker software using nine dots etas was conducted in three sets where each set consists of 18 hull design images and three calibration images fig 5 c between hull images with equal intervals note that the calibration images were shown only for two seconds and were used to check if the calibration was missed during the survey data of two subjects tasks were discarded from the analysis due to the calibration problems which were detected via the calibration images total number of participants for this study were 24 including two females aged 20 and 42 with mean 24 21 and standard deviation 5 83 the nationalities of the participants were chinese japanese korean and malaysian each participant was given only two tasks out of four three etas sets and one tls and on average 13 subjects participated in each etas set and 10 in tls tasks a relevant council of the university of tokyo approved the surveys used in the study fig 6 shows some gaze plots and heat maps of etas results obtained via tobi pro software tobii pro software 2016 4 aoi based screening methods for design parameters as mentioned in the first section the local parameters are evaluated via the aoi tool and global parameters using scan path analysis the scan path analysis was also conducted by defining aois on the path and the transitions between the aois refer the usage frequency of the defined paths to prevent confusion the aois used for scan path are called as path aois in this section first design parameters will be classified as local and global based on their impact on the appearance and search areas using tls then aoi definitions and metrics that will be used will be explained 4 1 design parameter classification design parameters that have full control on the target shapes are classified as local parameters since their search area can be limited to particular areas without overlapping with other design parameters these parameters which have local impacts on target shape include minimum radii of feature curves r 1 e r 1 m r 1 r r 0 e r 0 m r 0 r r 4 r 5 bottom width of flat panel a 1 entrance angle β and upper depth parameters d 2 e d 2 m d 2 r note that the upper depth parameters are used to control the incline of the feature guide curve between the sections therefore the incline is analyzed via aoi to evaluate these parameters in addition to these fp parameters which are h and θ are also classified as local parameters to be evaluated via the aoi tool since the area covered by the profile is relatively small to use the scan path analysis h can be observed independently from all other parameters over the front view however over the side view overlapping between h and θ is inevitable due to sharing of the same geometric feature therefore an aoi is defined with fp label that covers the whole fp on the side view in other words feature based screening is performed for fp which is a combination of h and θ rather than parameter based on the other hand global design parameters include lengths l e l m l r widths b e b m b r and depths d 1 e d 1 m d 1 r since they impact large areas on the hull shape and angular parameters α α 2 which can be found anywhere through the inclined lines in brief we do not know how global parameters are searched by subjects therefore these design parameters first need to be identified based on their search area to determine the best strategy for them tls is suggested for the identification and to define templates according to the identities for each global design parameter here the template means the generalized output of tls for a design parameter that includes information of search area of the parameter whether local or global with size and location of the area note that all locally searched parameters are analyzed via the aoi tool even if they are classified as global design parameters due to their effects on the hull appearance 4 1 1 tls tls tasks are specialized to request participants search only one specific design parameter in order to record gaze data that belong only to this specific parameter tls tasks can be categorized into two types the first task aims to compare a design parameter by sections of one hull model to observe the search behavior of subjects through the hull fig 7 demonstrates a question example of such task where relevant design parameters are first introduced and the task is explained without time limitation whenever participants feel ready the calibration image is displayed for two seconds and a hull model is then shown for five seconds finally a question e g which section is shorter longer than the others is asked related to the task and after the subject answers the other hull model is shown after that the same task is repeated three more times with other hulls this task is suitable for lengths widths and depths as they are defined for each section separately the second task is to compare a design parameter on three different hulls and suitable to be used for all design parameters fig 8 shows that the task is similarly explained and a calibration image again appears for two seconds but this time all hull models are shown consequently and one question e g which model has wide narrow perpendicular angle is asked to compare three hull models for the relevant parameter the calibration images have extra goal in tls which forces participants to start at the same point to increase similarity of initial gaze points in order to get meaningful results for comparison in addition the question and answer options that are easy to remember and understand are chosen to enable participants easily focus on the main objective of the task for example sections are introduced as left middle and right for easy comparison rather than entrance middle body and run which are difficult to remember note that the answers given for the question tasks are not analyzed since their only aim is to give purpose to the subjects and do not add value for gaze data analysis all tls results are first visualized by heat maps to check whether the parameters are searched locally fixations are accumulated in particular area or in a spread out way and additional tools are then used to decide if they are suitable for analysis via aoi or scan path example tls outputs for globally searched design parameters are visualized by gaze plot and transition arrows between path aois which are shown in fig 9 a for the first task and in fig 9 b for the second task on the other hand example local parameter results are given in fig 10 a for the first task and in fig 10 b for the second task by evaluating the visual outputs l e l m and l r are classified as global parameters since they are searched horizontally in wide areas moreover b e b m b r and α 2 are classified as local parameters since they are searched on particular areas where aoi definitions are possible without overlapping meanwhile d 1 e d 1 m d 1 r and α parameters cannot be classified due to random gaze plots which are not suitable for both aoi and scan path analyses therefore they are kept out of the scope of this paper 4 1 2 preliminary search via heat map the heat map is a well known method to visualize aggregated gaze points of all subjects at a time on a stimulus using a color scale as illustrated in fig 1 c this visualization method gives a general idea about the areas that are attractive to the subjects and those that are completely neglected as bojko 2009 suggested instead of using the heat map for extensive analysis it is recommended to use as a visualization tool for planning the study mainly to learn where to define aois in order to gain time and increase efficiency another issue that needs to be considered is the use of relative durations of the total time spent by the subjects in case the time periods of the experiments differ from one subject to another the final suggestion is to set the total kernel size which is the diameter of the colored area around the fixation center with a larger value than the default to spread the colored area to provide higher confidence interval in terms of increasing the search area in our study the heat maps are generated via tobii software by applying i vt filtration olsen 2012 with default settings of tobii pro software tobii pro software 2016 according to relative durations furthermore although the default total kernel size of tobii pro software is 100 px which is determined according to the highest visual span of the human eye this value is set to 210 px to increase the confidence level of the investigated area finally the parameters that need quantitative examinations by aoi in the colored areas are determined for each image as mentioned in section 3 mirroring operation is used to obtain the final hull models which means the hull model is symmetrically generated due to this reason a half of the front and side views has the same design parameters as the other half however fig 11 shows three heat map results where the searching area of front and side views is indicated by arrow directions according to this figure and tls results fig 10 only half of the views are investigated by the participants therefore to simplify the study unnecessary aoi definitions are avoided based on heat map visualizations and define the aois for half of the views only 4 1 3 aois for local design parameters nineteen design parameters r 1 e r 1 m r 1 r r 0 e r 0 m r 0 r r 4 r 5 d 2 e d 2 m d 2 r α 2 β θ f p h a 1 b e b m and b r are analyzed quantitatively via aois since they are locally searched by the subjects ogama voßkühler et al 2008 is used to define elliptical aois for b e b m and b r since they are observed in an area close to ellipsoidal shape fig 10 and tetragonal aois for the remaining 16 design parameters the aoi definition for parametrically generated designs has a critical problem that the dimension of the relevant design parameter differs over the 54 hull models so the aois need to be arranged for each hull model parametrically three main issues are considered for aoi definition fair comparison aoi sizes need to be adjusted by the same proportion for each of the 54 hulls since comparison is performed between the parameters batch aoi definitions nineteen local design parameters for each of the 54 hull models require 1026 aoi definitions which is impractical to do manually so automation is needed to define aois avoid from overlapping when aois are adjusted for each hull there may be some circumstances that cause overlapped aois to avoid this problem the aois are defined on the center of the target geometric feature rather than the whole in other words the gaze points are sampled from the center of the target feature this may cause some gaze data loss decreases sensitivity but prevents the analysis of incorrect gaze data increases selectivity as the design parameters are compared with batch aoi definitions it is believed that such an approach is valid when aoi definition is made providing the fairness and necessity to define aois automatically without overlapping the volume of a 3d product design changes with its length width and depth parameters basic parameters therefore the aoi sizes are varied with equations making them dependent on the main construction parameters according to the view in other words size of an aoi defined for a hull parameter on side view is based on length and depth parameters while that of a top view parameter depends on width and length parameters first template elliptical aois are defined as covering the target areas which are learned from tls empirically on the other hand the templates of the tetragonal aois are defined via the oriented bounding box method barequet and har peled 2001 enclosing the target areas after that since the aois are managed via four handle points p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 the distances between the handle points of the template aois in x and y directions are divided by the relevant basic parameters to compute ratios finally the ratios are used to determine appropriate positions of the handle points for the 54 hulls in other words defined templates are reversed based on their hull models main dimensions and the handle points are relocated according to the new hull dimensions by the amount of the ratios note that a fixed reference point p r x is selected for each design parameter to compute the ratios and to relocate the handle points of the relevant aois there are several ways to define aois based on the basic parameters but the one that is used is illustrated in fig 12 where x and y coordinates of p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 for the elliptical aoi of b e is parametrically changed in proportion to the empirically found ratios via tls over width b e and lengths l 1 and l 2 according to reference point p r x note that the major axis of the elliptical aoi is computed in two parts based on l 1 and l 2 in proportions of the ratios and the minor axis is computed based on b e similar and suitable approaches are determined and applied to the other local parameters to parametrically modify and enable them to orient with the various dimensions of the 54 hulls 4 1 4 aois for global design parameters as seen in fig 9 the sequences of gaze fixations for the global parameters l e l m and l r are observed in the form of horizontal transitions along the hull on both side and top views our aim is to associate transitions made along the sections with the relevant length parameter for each section this can be done by defining path aois to construct a path similar to that observed in tls and counting the transitions between the path aois therefore eight path aois are defined four on the side view with labels a 1 s a 2 s a 3 s and a 4 s and four on top view with labels a 1 t a 2 t a 3 t and a 4 t fig 13 a in addition to these eight path aois two extra path aois are defined one for the front view of the hull and one for the whole adjective region in order to be used for transition probability calculation the reason for this will be explained later note that the distances p 0 1 y p 2 3 y of path aois are equal to the sum of maximum depth with cabin height on the side view and maximum width on the top view similar to the procedure for local parameters the handle points of the aois in the x direction are defined depending on length parameters and relocated through the 54 hull models using computed ratios furthermore the ogama software provides average loci similarities in percentages which depicts the proportion of the covered scan paths of the subjects by the defined path aois the ratios for path aois are computed taking the loci similarities into consideration 4 2 evaluation metrics two metrics are used in this study rtd for aoi analysis and transition probability for scan path analysis 4 2 1 rtd since there are 54 hulls with varied geometries the aoi sizes are parametrically adjusted for each hull however it is not fair to compare aois with different sizes holmqvist et al 2011 furthermore the time periods for etas are not fixed so the periods are different for each subject and the results can be dominated by the one who spends more time than the others to address these problems fixation durations are standardized to be relative to the time periods of subjects and the sizes of aois for each design parameter equation 1 calculates the relative times t a where t c is the period of a subject on the relevant hull image and t a indicates the time spent on a defined aoi for a parameter 1 t a t a t c equation 2 then normalizes the aoi size of the design parameter where the sum of relative times of all subjects s u b j e c t s t a is divided by aoi proportion of the design parameter to the whole question area k these computations are made for each of the 19 local design parameters to obtain the rtd s a 2 s a 1 k s u b j e c t s t a 4 2 2 transition probability as in rtds the transition counts need to be normalized for comparison of the global parameters of the 54 hulls to do this the transition counts are divided by total transitions made in the relevant hull image and the results are interpreted as transition probability ponsoda et al 1995 the general formula of transition probability p a i a j for a pair of path aois a i and a j is given in equation 3 where the transition count c a i a j is divided by the total count of transitions made on the hull image c a note that a here refers to a relevant aoi label 3 p a i a j c a i a j c a since more than 26 target design parameters can be observed by subjects on given stimuli many pointless transitions will be made for local parameters which should be avoided from total transitions therefore the path is constructed via 10 path aois covering the major transitions rather than the minors that are made on the image c a is the number of major transitions which are the ones among front view adjectives region entrance section middle body section and run section sections are defined for both top and side views minor transitions are assumed as transitions made on black areas of the image and self transitions a i a i are the ones made inside of the defined path aois which are usually short saccades and more likely belong to the local parameters fig 13 a shows the defined 10 path aois and fig 13 b displays the transition counts between the corresponding aois for both side and top views in the matrix form fig 13 c illustrates the transition probability computation equation 3 over the transition matrix of the top view where the transition probability between a 1 t and a 2 t p a 1 t a 2 t refers to that of the entrance section length p l e on the top view p a 2 t a 3 t is equal to p l m and p a 3 t a 4 t is equal to p l r the transition diagram in fig 13 c is also used to summarize the probabilities between the relevant aois where nowhere refers to aois other than a 1 t a 2 t a 3 t a 4 t similarly transition probabilities of four path aois a 1 s a 2 s a 3 s a 4 s are used to compute transition probabilities of the section lengths based on the side view front view and adjectives are other regions that are involved by the path as they are important stations for the subjects 5 results 5 1 screening based evaluation of design parameters 5 1 1 evaluation with rtd metric first the etas questions were roughly examined based on five significant areas front view adjectives entrance section middle body section and run section the sections are available for both side and top views fig 14 a via their total rtds computed for the 54 hulls s ˆ i 1 54 s a in fig 14 b s ˆ values for each area are represented via a pie chart in percentile which are relative to the sum of all note that percentages of sections were calculated according to sum of their computed durations on the side and top views according to the chart the regions ordered from the most attractive to the least attractive are as follows 37 of the total rtd of all 54 hull images for the middle body section 20 for the entrance section 19 for adjectives 18 for front view and 6 for the run section this analysis suggests that the middle body section is the first section that needs to be modified to appeal clients or achieve any design goals in terms of aesthetics since people quickly detect the modifications made in this section also the results show that dealing with run section modifications should be considered as last option since the clients will not pay attention to this section in the first place fig 14 c also shows the comparison of the view based results with the adjectives according to the comparison the side view of the hull design attracts most attention followed by the top view and then the front view which means that the side silhouette of the designs need to be studied on priority to appeal clients fine examination is performed with the 19 local design parameters via computed average rtds s a over the 54 hulls the distribution of s a values of the 19 parameters is represented via a box plot frigge et al 1989 in fig 15 a the box plot is composed of quartiles which are used to evaluate the attractiveness of the parameters in four levels accordingly the design parameters whose s a values are above than the third quartile q 3 are the most attractive ones level 1 among the 19 local parameters the parameters with s a values between median and q 3 are second level attractive parameters the other quartiles below the median value are determined as third and fourth degrees in terms of attractiveness the local parameters are illustrated in fig 15 a according to their attractiveness levels with different colors where green demonstrates the most attractive parameters level 1 which are listed as follows level 1 h b e d 2 m r 4 and r 1 m level 2 d 2 e a 1 b m r 5 r 0 m and fp level 3 β r 0 e r 1 e and d 2 r level 4 r 1 r b r r 0 r and α 2 since the attractiveness of the parameters is measured based on the gaze data the relations between the gaze data and the hull adjectives must be analyzed the idea is that if the gaze data have relations with the adjective choices the attractiveness results obtained will be related to the adjective based design concept since it shows that the participants looked at the parameter to select the adjectives otherwise the results will be unrelated to the adjective based design concept therefore level 1 and level 2 parameters are further analyzed via regression analysis to validate the attractiveness results the parameters lower than the median value are level 3 and level 4 parameters kept out of the regression analysis s proportions of each parameter relative to the sum of all s a i 1 19 s a are visualized in fig 15 b where the discarded parameters are surrounded by a red rectangle indicating the smallness of the area covered by them as compared to the rest 5 1 2 evaluation with transition probability transition probabilities of l e l m and l r parameters p l e p l m and p l r are calculated for each of the 54 hulls via scan path analysis and refer to the usage frequencies or densities of the relevant paths the average probabilities p l e p l m and p l r for the side and top views with sum of both are given by the bar chart in fig 16 a the results show that 2 5 of transitions are made for l m on the side view and 3 8 on the top view so the total transition percentage for this parameter is 6 3 p l m 0 063 the transition frequencies for l e on the side and top views are 1 6 and 1 3 so the total value is 2 9 p l e 0 029 finally l r transition frequency is calculated as 0 5 on the side view and 1 0 on the top view and total frequency of the transitions compared to whole transitions made on the question area is 1 5 p l r 0 015 it can be inferred from these results that the attractiveness order of lengths in other words priority of the length parameters for the adjective based design concept is l m l e l r fig 16 b also depicts the distributions of the 54 hulls transition probabilities of l e l m and l r sum of both side and top views for each hull model in the box plots each whisker shows the range where 25 of all probabilities are distributed while the box covers the remaining 50 comparing to the range of box plots and median values of l e l m and l r in order 0 03 0 06 and 0 01 a big portion of p l r values is distributed under p l e and p l m values in addition the run section has already been found unattractive bringing all the reasons together l r is also kept out from the regression analysis 5 2 relation analysis via regression analysis in this section the relations between gaze data and adjective choices are studied if some relations can be established they can be used to find unattractive design parameters for this purpose regression analysis is applied for estimating the relations between the gaze metrics as independent input variables and adjective selections as dependent response variables more specifically the input variables are the rtd s a and transition probability p they are denoted as x x i i 1 13 the response variables are 10 adjective selections strong a 1 speedy a 2 comfortable a 3 aesthetic a 4 usual common a 5 aggressive a 6 compact a 7 modern a 8 charismatic a 9 and cute a 10 they are denoted as y y i i 1 10 as shown in table 2 for each of the 54 hull designs relevant values for each of x i and y i are obtained with the user experiments described in section 4 the regression analysis is conducted on these input and response variables with values from the 54 observations for the hull design i d 1 54 first a dataset is prepared where input variables are assigned as gaze metrics and the response variables are defined by converting the adjective selections into levels next generalized linear model glm mccullagh 1984 is introduced as the regression analysis method a set of input variables called the regression model is used for the regression analysis the set x including all 13 input variables cannot be the best choice for the regression model but some subset of x is preferable thus the best subset selection method miller 2002 is used to determine the final regression model for each adjective in this method the residual sum of squares rss of all possible regression models is first calculated to determine the top models which are then evaluated according to the akaike information criteria aic akaike 1998 the aic values of the top models are compared according to the akaike weight ratios wagenmakers and farrell 2004 and d 2 guisan and zimmermann 2000 values finally the performance of the determined models for each adjective is measured via d 2 mean absolute percentage error mape and correlation analysis results 5 2 1 dataset organization and response variable determination the gaze data are input for regression analysis and represented by rtd for 11 attractive local parameters and transition probability for two attractive global parameters the adjective choices are converted into three levels according to the number of selections made by subjects and then used as response variables for the analysis table 2 displays dataset organization including input variables response variables and observations note that the levels represent the projected values of number of selections and will be analyzed as continuous variables rather than classes the values of the gaze metrics rtds and transition probabilities increase due to the attention of the subjects accordingly it is hypothesized that the number of selections of an adjective for a hull model is related to the increase in the metric values in other words if a design parameter is related to an adjective choice the value of the relevant metric for the design parameter is increased by the number of participants who select the adjective however the amount of increase in the metrics and the number of subjects is not expected to be detected clearly because each additional selection does not guarantee the increase in gaze metrics due to the unstable behavior of subjects during the survey to clarify the increase between them the number of selections are projected into levels which provide higher jumps between the selections therefore the increase will be easily related to the gaze data and the noises caused by ineffective selections are filtered as it is mentioned before each participant was given only two tasks out of four and some data were discarded due to calibration problems thus the number of participants namely the maximum possible number of selections are different for each etas set so the assignment of levels for the adjective choices must be done accordingly therefore instead of using the number of selections directly selection indexes are calculated dividing them by the number of subjects participating in the relevant set the 540 index values 54 hulls and 10 adjectives are plotted against the hull id using the histogram type graph to examine their distributions fig 17 the histogram is first was divided into two parts by a median value of 0 46 and it is seen that the upper portion is randomly distributed the stable part is then divided into two equal intervals as a consequence the levels are assigned using the following conditions level 1 i n d e x 0 23 level 2 0 23 i n d e x 0 46 level 3 i n d e x 0 46 5 2 2 glm in this study glm mccullagh 1984 is used for the regression analysis in addition as the response variables adjective levels are non negative continuous variables and limited between 1 and 3 which makes the distribution skewed since the bounds cannot be exceeded the gamma family venables and ripley 2013 is found suitable for the data distribution after comparing and testing with the other families e g gaussian poisson and quasi the general formula of glm is as follows 4 g e y i β 0 β 1 x 1 β k x k where e y i is estimation of the response value adjective choices corresponding to a 1 a 2 a 10 x 1 x k are independent input variables gaze metrics corresponding to s r 1 m s b e s b m s r 4 s r 5 s r 0 m s f p s h s a 1 s d 2 e s d 2 m p l e and p l m β 0 is intercept and β 1 β k are the coefficients for the estimation inverse link function g μ μ 1 venables and ripley 2013 is also used to relate the mean μ of the gamma distribution and the linear estimation model 5 2 3 best subset selection in general a regression deviation consists of two parts 5 r e g r e s s i o n d e v i a t i o n e x p l a i n e d v a r i a n c e r e s i d u a l s where variances are explained by the input variables gaze metrics and the residuals are remaining random variances that cannot be explained by the existing variables of the regression model it is clear that our target is to increase the explained variances as much as possible to decrease the residuals to do this the input variables which are unrelated to the relevant response variable need to be discarded from the regression model this can be achieved via the subset selection method miller 2002 one way to select the best subsets is calculating the rss via equation 6 for each of the possible regression models namely each x ˆ of the power set of x 2 x after that the first m best subsets which have the least rss values are found using an exhaustive search algorithm proposed by morgan and tatar 1972 rss is computed for each x ˆ of 2 x as follows 6 r s s n i 0 y i y ˆ i 2 where n is the number of observations 54 the number of hull designs y i is the observed response value and y ˆ i represents the estimated value via the subset x ˆ x ˆ 1 x ˆ 2 x ˆ m can be found having the smallest rss values then x ˆ 1 x ˆ 2 x ˆ m are further analyzed according to one of the quality measures i e aic akaike 1998 value 7 a i c 2 l n l 2 k for each x ˆ ε x ˆ 1 x ˆ 2 x ˆ m l is the value of maximized likelihood function l ψ x which is calculated by setting its derivative with respect to unknown parameter ψ to zero and solving the derived equation for ψ k is the cardinality of x ˆ since the aic value is a measure of information loss the model with the smallest aic is the best on the other hand in case the aic values are close to each other another model close to the best model having aic value close to smallest can be selected if it explains more portion of variance of the data d 2 equation 8a guisan and zimmermann 2000 is a measure of the explained variance for a glm model which is also equivalent to the well known measure r 2 the value of d 2 increases with the number of variables involved in the regression model and causes unfair comparison between the models having different numbers of variables therefore the regression models are compared via adjusted d 2 equation 8b guisan and zimmermann 2000 to eliminate this problem 8a d 2 1 r e s i d u a l d e v i a n c e n u l l d e v i a n c e 8b adjusted d 2 1 n 1 n k 1 d 2 where residual deviance refers to the residuals of the model including all model variables β 0 β 1 x 1 β k x k and null deviance is the residual of the intercept only model β 0 additionally the aic values of the models are compared via the following equation wagenmakers and farrell 2004 9 w i j l i l j k j k i where w i j is the ratio of akaike weights burnham and anderson 2003 which indicates how much i t h model x ˆ i is better in terms of minimization of the information loss over j t h model x ˆ j to sum up the subset selection starts with finding several best subsets which have the least rss values aic is then used to find the best among them which has the smallest aic value the best subsets having aic values close to the best model are then checked to see if their d 2 values are higher than those of the best model without dramatically raising w i j which is computed between the best model which has minimum aic value and the inquired model in the end if the increase in d 2 value is not sufficient to afford the increase in w i j the search is concluded 5 2 4 performance results of determined regression models to conduct the glm analysis supporting the subset selection method based on rss and aic values the best subset glm bestglm package is used proposed by mcleod and xu 2010 through r studio software team 2015 table 3 shows the summary of the results for the determined model for each adjective in matrix form where the first column represents the adjective labels the second column indicates mape which is computed via equation 10 to obtain the error between the estimated y ˆ i and observed y i response values scaling from 0 to 1 where 0 refers to 100 prediction accuracy 10 m a p e 1 n n i 0 y i y ˆ i y i next four columns represent correlation analysis results which are measured with 95 confidence level between the relevant adjective response of the data and fitted values of the models where cor represents correlation value c i l and c i u are lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval and p v a l u e is significance level of the correlation furthermore glm assumes that all input variables are independent this assumption is checked via a multicollinearity test where the generalized variance inflation factor gvif fox and monette 1992 values are used for the judgment the last row shows that the computed gvif values for each variable are less than 3 which indicates low correlation between the input variables namely their independency hair et al 2011 the results show that the ratio of explained variances d 2 which can be interpreted in percentile multiplying them by 100 ranges between 16 and 45 since the human perception is a complicated issue the collected data for social research are usually very noisy and the d 2 values even under 50 are acceptable in the context of the research chalmer 1986 also note that the regression analysis in this study is conducted to show the existence of correlation between gaze data and preferences but not for the prediction purposes moreover the computed mape values range between 0 16 and 0 39 which shows relatively good results to claim the existence of the relations considering the noisy data correlation values where 1 indicates perfect negative correlation and 0 depicts no correlation while 1 represents perfect positive correlation between the models and the responses are found between 0 37 and 0 67 which refer to positive correlations between the gaze data and the preferences the correlations for the a 4 a 5 and a 10 models are weak compared to the others but still show the existence of positive relations the p v a l u e s also indicate that all correlations are significant since all of them are lower than the 0 05 value according to 95 confidence level the overall performance results of the determined regression models validate the existence of relations between human preferences adjective choices and subject attention gaze data the parameters of the found regression models determined x ˆ subsets for each adjective are also represented in table 3 with black color which are highly related to the relevant adjectives in terms of attention for example the regression model variables of a 1 are r 1 m r 4 f p h d 2 e d 2 m and l m a designer can use these significant parameters in the first stage to get the hull model according to the desired adjective by modifying an existing hull model as they are attractive and have impact on the adjective choices note that the unattractive parameters determined in sections 5 1 1 and 5 1 2 were also analyzed via plots against residuals of the regression models fig 18 in order to check if the parameter can explain some portion of the residual part of the model however the residual plots show that the parameters have still totally random distributions which means they are not explanatory or the randomness is broken locally but the performance measures are not raised to be involved in the regression models for example the plot for r 0 e and β is relatively symmetric according to the line y 0 so it is not possible to estimate the residuals via them on the other hand in the plot of r 1 e some residuals can be estimated by the increase in this parameter however after adding the parameter to the relevant model the adjusted d 2 value decreases and mape value increases based on this it can be said that the previous determination of the unattractive parameters is valid since they failed to explain the variances 5 2 5 further analysis pearson s product moment correlation pearson 1896 is also used between time spent on each adjective each adjective was surrounded by an aoi separately and the adjective levels fig 17 such analysis can provide following information how comfortable the subjects are with the adjectives if the subjects spend more time on an adjective even it is not selected negative correlation is expected which means that the adjective is difficult to match with the hulls or somehow confusing which makes the subjects think more about it so in that case it can be concluded that it needs to be replaced with a better adjective in the future surveys consistency of gaze data and selection reliability of the responses can be confirmed in cases where positive correlations are observed however negative correlations do not indicate bad reliability table 4 shows the correlation results for the adjectives according to the results the correlations for speedy modern and cute are found insignificant as the p v a l u e s are lower than 0 05 which means the gaze data for them are random relative to the selections therefore nothing can be claimed about them on the other hand remaining adjectives have weak positive correlations 0 32 0 47 considering the noisy data that make the correlations weak it still validates that the adjectives are perceived by the subjects and they find the adjectives suitable to match with the hulls several correlation analyses are also conducted based on the time to first fixation ttff metric which indicate the time spent before the subjects first attention for a target aoi the analyses are made for the adjective selections to inquire their relations with each adjective s aois and with local design parameters however significant correlations are not found which means that subjects do not have specific parameter targets related to the adjectives to search in the first place but they examine the designs until finding meaningful reasons for their choices on the other hand the relation between ttff and rtd metrics of local design parameters is also checked and find interestingly significant correlations for r 4 c o r 0 40 p 0 05 t 3 1890 r 0 m c o r 0 33 p 0 05 t 2 5578 f p c o r 0 52 p 0 05 t 4 3646 and a 1 c o r 0 28 p 0 05 t 2 0723 see table 5 the existence of the correlation between rtd and ttff for the parameters is also represented by graphs in fig 19 with relation equations and r 2 values represents how much variance is covered by the equation although it cannot be claimed that they are more significant than the other parameters based on these results it is apparent that they require special attention in the design process 6 conclusion and discussion in this study the adjective based design concept is used where hulls are parameterized and the adjectives are related to the designs at the parametric level this provides relatively more detailed examination compared to the studies conducted with appearance features of designs which are obtained by a combination of varied values of relevant design parameters as the design elements are correlated to the targets at the parametric level such approach provides flexibility and more control on sampling designs that meet the targets specifically after the outcomes of this perception study are integrated into the design concept however working with the design parameters requires more attention as different dimension values and various combinations of the design parameters can be interpreted differently by subjects therefore the taguchi experimental method is also used to sample models where each design parameter value is shown to be able to cover various features equivalently in the same number of times tls is first proposed which is used to classify the global design parameters based on search behavior of the subjects one output of tls is a template which conveys the required information about aoi definitions based on search areas of the relevant design parameters an etas method was then utilized to collect gaze data which were evaluated via rtd and transition probability metrics the evaluations were conducted in three parts rough examination section based and view based fine examination design parameters and finally regression analysis rough examinations indicated the most attractive section as middle body section and view as side view such results can be used by designers to decrease labor times working only on the attractive areas fine examinations were first used to determine attractive parameters in four levels for local parameters and priorities for the global parameters interpreting a box plot the determined attractive parameters for fine examination results were then used in the regression analysis to validate that attractive parameters are really useful for the adjective based design concept glm with the best subset selection method was used to find regression models for each adjective depending on some performance measures d 2 to measure explained variance ratio and mape for accuracy check and best subset x ˆ determination criteria rss and aic in addition correlation analyses were conducted to confirm and measure levels of relations the results proved the existence of correlation between gaze data and adjective choices even though the performance measures were relatively low compared to the predictive models however our aim was not to get predictive models but to show the relations social science is complicated to study since the human understanding is difficult to estimate and this problem is getting even more complex with the unclear and varied targets 54 yacht hulls are studied which are generated by 26 design parameters and developed 26 targets from our viewpoint however there are even more targets for the subjects as a hull design has many more design details that can be detected moreover they are asked to match 10 adjectives with 54 hulls having all the design details that makes the problem even harder since the decision making mechanism is also developed and changed by seeing various hull models and unstable decisions noises are observed besides the useful data moreover they are not designers who change their decision criteria for no tangible reasons this has also been proved by kukkonen 2005 where gaze data correlations with the goals were very low for the subjects who were not designers and very high for designers after all of this despite the weakness of the performance measures compared to the predictive models significant results are found that validate the attractiveness of the design parameters determined by the gaze metrics specifically relevant design parameters which are variables of determined subsets have priorities to get desired adjective based design among all attractive design parameters which can be used by designers the results are suggested to be combined with the human oriented design dogan and gunpinar 2017 and parametric design khan et al 2017 approaches to generate an infinite number of design options related to the defined adjectives after that the product related requirements can be considered for filtering out the undesired design options in this study a yacht hull was used in which the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic performances are crucial as such performance properties in addition to aesthetic properties are important the aesthetics are handled first to be then combined with a performance based system which is considered as future work besides all benefits of the proposed method design parametrization and uniform design sampling are compulsory issues to benefit from the outcomes of this study otherwise the design parameter screening cannot be accomplished thoroughly and misleading results are more likely to be obtained we find it valuable to propose a technique that parametrizes designs and evaluates the parameters with automatically defined aois based on the parametrization doing that we would like to encourage industrial design area to use our method to get prominent designs with even less labor time and costs acknowledgment we would like to thank dr koichi ohtomi for his technical discussions and hiroyuki katayama for his help on experimental setup this paper is partially based on results obtained from delight design platform project under sip

23122,adjective based design is a method that translates human perception into design parameters quantitatively in order to achieve better understanding between designers and clients in this approach adjectives are used to describe product designs which are generated via design parameters in terms of geometry as a requirement of the concept relations between hull adjectives e g comfortable and aesthetic and design parameters e g length and width are learned via a machine learning algorithm nevertheless the relations cannot be represented by some of the design parameters although they are in the learning process this issue shows that the parameters do not impact the adjective choices but add noises to the learning process therefore in this study visual evaluations are made using eye tracking technology for screening the parameters based on their attractiveness and establishing relations between the attractive ones and the adjectives to enhance quality of the relation representations eye tracking is used in perceptual research which proves the existence of correlations between gaze data and human preferences the main advantage of eye tracking is that reliable human perception data can more likely be collected compared to the user tests since the evaluation is based on subjects attention rather than applying solely questionnaires that are limited by the question content in light of the benefits and finding an eye tracking device is used to collect gaze data and then eye tracking tools such as area of interest aoi scan path and heat map are used to evaluate attractiveness of the design parameters finally regression analysis is used to represent relations between gaze data of design parameters and the adjectives keywords industrial design human factor in design adjective based design parametric design eye tracking generalized linear model glm 1 introduction 1 1 adjective based design product performance and qualities are not solely good enough criteria for clients as the market competition has already made them compulsory for products with high quality and good performance design is highly important for clients to make the final decision creusen and schoormans 2005 yamamoto and lambert 1994 however this criterion is not a clear target to be reached and is measured through client satisfaction which is highly related to human feelings therefore it is difficult to forecast this criterion beforehand dogan and gunpinar 2017 proposed the adjective based design method which quantizes human feelings and represents them as relations between adjectives e g charismatic and modern and design parameters that are geometrically defined on products e g lengths and widths such approach aims to provide better communication between designers and clients blijlevens et al 2009 in this method feelings about designs can be easily expressed using adjectives and their relations with design parameters are used as a guide by designers thus understanding clients and appealing them can be successfully achieved in relatively short times dogan and gunpinar 2017 applied the adjective based method to yacht hulls they first learned 10 hull adjectives using a survey method and defined design parameters on hull covering common hull features a second survey was then applied to eliminate irrelevant parameters searching whether the modifications of these parameters affect any of the adjective choices made by the subjects after the eliminations the remaining design parameters were used to generate hull designs via a novel parametric design framework which is also similar to the method proposed by khan et al 2017 then another survey was conducted where the designed hulls were matched with the hull adjectives to create a dataset that included corresponding parameter values and the matched adjectives for each hull finally a machine learning algorithm that used neural network was fed with the dataset to represent relations between the adjectives and the design parameters as mathematical models however some design parameters relations with the adjectives could not be established thus it was concluded that the design parameters did not affect the subjects adjective choices such noises are caused by unrelated parameters and need to be removed to raise the quality of relation representations in this study it is assumed that if an appearance feature of a product does not attract subjects the related design parameter with the feature is unattractive and irrelevant to the adjectives as well an eye tracking device is used to evaluate the degree of attractiveness of design parameters observing where the subjects attention is focused 1 2 eye tracking system eye tracking where eye movements of subjects are recorded as gaze points on given stimuli is a commonly used method in neuroscience psychology computer science industrial engineering and marketing duchowski 2002 in the eye tracking system illuminators are used to generate near infrared lights and images of their reflections from eyes are captured by cameras in addition an external processor is used to process the images to analyze the reflection patterns and generate a 3d model of the eye with its position in space the 3d eye model is then used to calculate locations of the gaze points on relevant stimuli eye movements are illustrated on stimuli via fixations which are a batch of gaze points accumulated within a predefined span in shape of circles and saccades are displayed via straight lines that show eye movements from one fixation to another fig 1 a in this study the attractiveness of target areas is analyzed through fixation locations and durations at the locations as well as scan paths noton and stark 1971 which are combinations of fixations and saccades fixations are widely analyzed using the area of interest aoi tool and heat maps blascheck et al 2014 using the aoi tool targets are surrounded with diverse shapes fig 1 b to perform quantitative analysis with various metrics such as fixation duration and visit count the heat map fig 1 c represents fixation accumulated areas based on a color scale where red indicates more attractive areas than the rest of the image one method to examine the scan path is defining aois see fig 1 d for yellow rectangular shapes on the path that needs to be searched and the transitions between the aois will indicate how often frequency the path is used a transition matrix is also used to summarize the transitions in matrix form as illustrated in fig 1 e 1 3 template learning survey tls design parameters can be classified as local and global parameters fig 2 according to their impact on hull appearance local parameters are the ones that have full control on the target shape such as radii of feature curves on the other hand global design parameters affect large areas e g lengths and widths and the recorded gaze data on these areas can be found in any shape related to the search behavior of subjects thus gaze points for global parameters first need to be identified according to the search behavior of subjects in order to analyze them with an appropriate strategy to do this a survey is used called tls where all the learned identifier information for the relevant parameter is named as template 1 4 proposed approach according to the flow of the proposed approach displayed in fig 3 the eye tracking aided survey etas is first applied where participants select appropriate adjectives from a given list for the hull images and gaze points of participants are recorded the local parameters are analyzed by defining aois while the global parameters are first applied tls to learn their templates to determine a suitable analysis method if a template of a global parameter shows the gaze points in the shape of accumulation in a particular area the parameter is also treated as the local parameter since it is searched locally on the other hand if the gaze data are spread out instead of being gathered in local areas scan path analysis is used relative time durations rtds are then calculated for local parameters with the outcome of aoi analysis and transition probabilities frequency of path usage are calculated for global parameters which are analyzed via the scan path in the end the two calculated metrics for the design parameters are used to compare their attractiveness finally relations between gaze data of attractive parameters and the responses adjective choices are searched using regression analysis 2 related work this study is related to the adjective based design method which is similar to other human oriented design studies such as kansei engineering nagamachi 2002 and semantic attribute based concepts chaudhuri et al 2013 since these design concepts put the human perception in the center of the design process this study is also related to the cognitive research conducted to learn human preferences we are specifically interested in the research where eye tracking systems are used 2 1 adjective based design literature covers several studies on human preferences to explore identify and convert human emotions into physical entities to estimate their possible preferences nagamachi 2002 for example yanagisawa et al 2016 created a model based design method that used kansei database to forecast customer preferences and obtain former understanding about human perception of the designs for the designers chen and chang 2009 proposed a method to extract appearance attributes and determine mathematical models correlating the attributes with customer responses in order to estimate their possible preferences about product designs chaudhuri et al 2013 proposed attribit which assembles 3d models where assembly parts are related to semantic attributes the relations are explored and the parts are ranked according to their degree of relevant attributes through surveys in a similar direction in our previous study the adjective based design method dogan and gunpinar 2017 is proposed and used in this study to develop a method for screening design parameters 2 2 eye tracking studies gaze data basically show the areas that have and those that have not caught the interest of subjects there are several studies using eye tracking systems that have found relations between gaze data and emotions and or preferences alshehri and alghowinem 2013 stated that eye movements are related to the emotional states of subjects as they have diverse reactions for pleasant and unpleasant media yousefi et al 2015 suggested the use of eye tracking for construction processes analyzing the relations between gaze data and user satisfaction mohammadpour et al 2015 applied user tests recording gaze data where building designs were evaluated by subjects and long fixation durations for attractive designs were measured kim et al 2013 examined correlations between nightscape preference degrees and gaze points and found that subjects spent more time on the preferred images noland et al 2017 used eye tracking in their survey which allowed qualitative and quantitative investigations of images related to urban planning the study results showed that cars and parking were ranked negatively while new urbanist parts of the images such as people and pedestrian features were mostly highly ranked this study is motivated to use eye tracking technology with these findings to evaluate the attractiveness of the design parameters 2 3 eye tracking studies for product design there are a few studies that use the eye tracking framework to particularly understand outstanding design features or how human aesthetic understanding is formed by product appearance kukkonen 2005 studied product designs with an example of mobile phones where gaze data of subjects were compared through a questionnaire and strong correlations were found between them in that study five mobile phones were shown in pairs to the subjects including designers and gaze data for product attitudes and preferences were analyzed köhler et al 2015 extended the well known kansei engineering method using eye tracking in order to evaluate product aesthetics from the perspective of human perception and validated the results using descriptive and statistical analysis procedures koivunen koivunen et al 2004 claimed that the way people look at designs is important and suggested strategies about first impression of the subjects which they thought can help designers du and macdonald 2014 also analyzed the relative importance of visual product attributes and the impact of the attributes sizes on human preferences by using an eye tracking device their study showed the existence of significant relations between the gaze data and attribute importance and used ordinal logistic regression to predict the importance of both attributes and their size changes khalighy et al 2015 formulated aesthetic understanding of subjects through the gaze data depending on beauty and attractiveness drivers they asserted that the aesthetic formula succeeds in estimating human preferences via gaze data the above studies aimed to learn important geometric features to help designers in understanding customer needs and desires our goal is in a similar direction however we go further and provide an adjective based design concept which is a kind of translator that converts adjectives which is the design aesthetic language of clients into design parameters which is the language of designers moreover the importance of design parameters over appearance features is found which are combination of design parameters a design framework is also proposed that works with the design parameters which means that the findings can be directly used by the design framework unless subjective decisions are required by designers besides all these benefits our screening method is conducted more systematically as an orthogonal array is used to sample designs having varied geometric features where the design parameter values are equally changed through the 54 hull designs it is believed that to get favorable results from the design evaluations such systematic approach is needed to observe real perceptions of humans when they see varied features to the best of our knowledge the existing product evaluation studies with eye tracking systems use limited number of existing design samples which may be good enough to propose their methods but cannot offer proper evaluation due to lack of systematically prepared enough design variations 3 experiment materials and setup the experiments were conducted with 54 hull design images and 10 adjectives which were obtained from dogan and gunpinar 2017 in that study frequently used adjectives were determined via a survey where participants were shown various yacht hull models and asked to describe them via adjectives social listening method was then used to enlarge the adjective dictionary and the retrospective think aloud method hyrskykari et al 2008 was used to validate the determined adjectives via subjects feedbacks finally the following 10 adjectives were determined strong a 1 speedy a 2 comfortable a 3 aesthetic a 4 usual common a 5 aggressive a 6 compact a 7 modern a 8 charismatic a 9 and cute a 10 before the surveys were conducted each participant was provided car images related to the adjectives for the illustration the reason for selecting cars rather than yachts was to not steer the subjects while they were matching adjectives with the hulls but only show them how an adjective can be related to a product design the car images were obtained from the web and are not shared with this paper due to copyright issues in addition dictionaries were used to standardize adjective definitions for the subjects in the end each participant was trained with several hull models for warming up purposes hull models were sampled using the taguchi experimental method taguchi and taguchi 1988 which suggests an l54 orthogonal array for 25 design parameters with three levels and one with two levels each level was assigned an appropriate value to determine dimensions for the 54 hulls the hull models were then generated via a novel parametric design framework proposed by khan et al 2017 where a hull is divided into three parts entrance section middle body section and run section fig 4 according to the framework the entrance section surface is obtained via loft operation between forward profile fp and entrance station profile sp e middle body section is generated by lofting between sp e and middle body station profile sp m and run section is generated by lofting between sp m and run station profile sp r note that the lofting processes between profiles were performed following top bottom and feature middle guide curves to control the surfaces furthermore only half of the model was first lofted and mirroring operation was then performed to obtain the full model the design parameters with their definitions are given in table 1 and the hull locations are illustrated in fig 4 3 1 etas etas questions were prepared using images of 54 hull models with the front top and side views providing the same pixel meter ratio based on lengths widths and depths to simplify the understanding of dimension changes and fair aoi definitions section 4 1 2 note that additional views were not used since they would add nothing to the three views in terms of showing design parameters but disperse the focus of the subjects to widen areas fig 5 a shows the experimental setup where the screen was 520 mm wide and 325 mm high 24 inch diagonal and the image one of the etas questions had 1920 1080 resolution a screen based eye tracking device tobii pro x3 120 was used with a sampling rate of 120 hz moreover participants were free to move their head within 500 mm width and 400 mm height according to the report of the producer owing to this setup the subjects were not disturbed by the device and hence could behave more naturally in addition the tracker had a reported accuracy of 0 4 and precision of 0 24 finally the distance between the participants and the tracker was set as 650 mm the etas question interface for a hull design is given in fig 5 b which shows the design with three views and the location of adjectives participants were asked to select at least two appropriate adjectives from the list in order to increase the time spent on the hull as time limitation was not applied for etas the responses were verbally expressed by the subjects and recorded by an operator via google form so that the subjects could keep looking at the screen and not interrupt the gaze recording this part is important for computing the rtds since each time a subject looks away from the screen to select an adjective leads to empty gaze data while the time period of the questionnaire is increasing before each experiment calibration was made using a calibration tool of the tracker software using nine dots etas was conducted in three sets where each set consists of 18 hull design images and three calibration images fig 5 c between hull images with equal intervals note that the calibration images were shown only for two seconds and were used to check if the calibration was missed during the survey data of two subjects tasks were discarded from the analysis due to the calibration problems which were detected via the calibration images total number of participants for this study were 24 including two females aged 20 and 42 with mean 24 21 and standard deviation 5 83 the nationalities of the participants were chinese japanese korean and malaysian each participant was given only two tasks out of four three etas sets and one tls and on average 13 subjects participated in each etas set and 10 in tls tasks a relevant council of the university of tokyo approved the surveys used in the study fig 6 shows some gaze plots and heat maps of etas results obtained via tobi pro software tobii pro software 2016 4 aoi based screening methods for design parameters as mentioned in the first section the local parameters are evaluated via the aoi tool and global parameters using scan path analysis the scan path analysis was also conducted by defining aois on the path and the transitions between the aois refer the usage frequency of the defined paths to prevent confusion the aois used for scan path are called as path aois in this section first design parameters will be classified as local and global based on their impact on the appearance and search areas using tls then aoi definitions and metrics that will be used will be explained 4 1 design parameter classification design parameters that have full control on the target shapes are classified as local parameters since their search area can be limited to particular areas without overlapping with other design parameters these parameters which have local impacts on target shape include minimum radii of feature curves r 1 e r 1 m r 1 r r 0 e r 0 m r 0 r r 4 r 5 bottom width of flat panel a 1 entrance angle β and upper depth parameters d 2 e d 2 m d 2 r note that the upper depth parameters are used to control the incline of the feature guide curve between the sections therefore the incline is analyzed via aoi to evaluate these parameters in addition to these fp parameters which are h and θ are also classified as local parameters to be evaluated via the aoi tool since the area covered by the profile is relatively small to use the scan path analysis h can be observed independently from all other parameters over the front view however over the side view overlapping between h and θ is inevitable due to sharing of the same geometric feature therefore an aoi is defined with fp label that covers the whole fp on the side view in other words feature based screening is performed for fp which is a combination of h and θ rather than parameter based on the other hand global design parameters include lengths l e l m l r widths b e b m b r and depths d 1 e d 1 m d 1 r since they impact large areas on the hull shape and angular parameters α α 2 which can be found anywhere through the inclined lines in brief we do not know how global parameters are searched by subjects therefore these design parameters first need to be identified based on their search area to determine the best strategy for them tls is suggested for the identification and to define templates according to the identities for each global design parameter here the template means the generalized output of tls for a design parameter that includes information of search area of the parameter whether local or global with size and location of the area note that all locally searched parameters are analyzed via the aoi tool even if they are classified as global design parameters due to their effects on the hull appearance 4 1 1 tls tls tasks are specialized to request participants search only one specific design parameter in order to record gaze data that belong only to this specific parameter tls tasks can be categorized into two types the first task aims to compare a design parameter by sections of one hull model to observe the search behavior of subjects through the hull fig 7 demonstrates a question example of such task where relevant design parameters are first introduced and the task is explained without time limitation whenever participants feel ready the calibration image is displayed for two seconds and a hull model is then shown for five seconds finally a question e g which section is shorter longer than the others is asked related to the task and after the subject answers the other hull model is shown after that the same task is repeated three more times with other hulls this task is suitable for lengths widths and depths as they are defined for each section separately the second task is to compare a design parameter on three different hulls and suitable to be used for all design parameters fig 8 shows that the task is similarly explained and a calibration image again appears for two seconds but this time all hull models are shown consequently and one question e g which model has wide narrow perpendicular angle is asked to compare three hull models for the relevant parameter the calibration images have extra goal in tls which forces participants to start at the same point to increase similarity of initial gaze points in order to get meaningful results for comparison in addition the question and answer options that are easy to remember and understand are chosen to enable participants easily focus on the main objective of the task for example sections are introduced as left middle and right for easy comparison rather than entrance middle body and run which are difficult to remember note that the answers given for the question tasks are not analyzed since their only aim is to give purpose to the subjects and do not add value for gaze data analysis all tls results are first visualized by heat maps to check whether the parameters are searched locally fixations are accumulated in particular area or in a spread out way and additional tools are then used to decide if they are suitable for analysis via aoi or scan path example tls outputs for globally searched design parameters are visualized by gaze plot and transition arrows between path aois which are shown in fig 9 a for the first task and in fig 9 b for the second task on the other hand example local parameter results are given in fig 10 a for the first task and in fig 10 b for the second task by evaluating the visual outputs l e l m and l r are classified as global parameters since they are searched horizontally in wide areas moreover b e b m b r and α 2 are classified as local parameters since they are searched on particular areas where aoi definitions are possible without overlapping meanwhile d 1 e d 1 m d 1 r and α parameters cannot be classified due to random gaze plots which are not suitable for both aoi and scan path analyses therefore they are kept out of the scope of this paper 4 1 2 preliminary search via heat map the heat map is a well known method to visualize aggregated gaze points of all subjects at a time on a stimulus using a color scale as illustrated in fig 1 c this visualization method gives a general idea about the areas that are attractive to the subjects and those that are completely neglected as bojko 2009 suggested instead of using the heat map for extensive analysis it is recommended to use as a visualization tool for planning the study mainly to learn where to define aois in order to gain time and increase efficiency another issue that needs to be considered is the use of relative durations of the total time spent by the subjects in case the time periods of the experiments differ from one subject to another the final suggestion is to set the total kernel size which is the diameter of the colored area around the fixation center with a larger value than the default to spread the colored area to provide higher confidence interval in terms of increasing the search area in our study the heat maps are generated via tobii software by applying i vt filtration olsen 2012 with default settings of tobii pro software tobii pro software 2016 according to relative durations furthermore although the default total kernel size of tobii pro software is 100 px which is determined according to the highest visual span of the human eye this value is set to 210 px to increase the confidence level of the investigated area finally the parameters that need quantitative examinations by aoi in the colored areas are determined for each image as mentioned in section 3 mirroring operation is used to obtain the final hull models which means the hull model is symmetrically generated due to this reason a half of the front and side views has the same design parameters as the other half however fig 11 shows three heat map results where the searching area of front and side views is indicated by arrow directions according to this figure and tls results fig 10 only half of the views are investigated by the participants therefore to simplify the study unnecessary aoi definitions are avoided based on heat map visualizations and define the aois for half of the views only 4 1 3 aois for local design parameters nineteen design parameters r 1 e r 1 m r 1 r r 0 e r 0 m r 0 r r 4 r 5 d 2 e d 2 m d 2 r α 2 β θ f p h a 1 b e b m and b r are analyzed quantitatively via aois since they are locally searched by the subjects ogama voßkühler et al 2008 is used to define elliptical aois for b e b m and b r since they are observed in an area close to ellipsoidal shape fig 10 and tetragonal aois for the remaining 16 design parameters the aoi definition for parametrically generated designs has a critical problem that the dimension of the relevant design parameter differs over the 54 hull models so the aois need to be arranged for each hull model parametrically three main issues are considered for aoi definition fair comparison aoi sizes need to be adjusted by the same proportion for each of the 54 hulls since comparison is performed between the parameters batch aoi definitions nineteen local design parameters for each of the 54 hull models require 1026 aoi definitions which is impractical to do manually so automation is needed to define aois avoid from overlapping when aois are adjusted for each hull there may be some circumstances that cause overlapped aois to avoid this problem the aois are defined on the center of the target geometric feature rather than the whole in other words the gaze points are sampled from the center of the target feature this may cause some gaze data loss decreases sensitivity but prevents the analysis of incorrect gaze data increases selectivity as the design parameters are compared with batch aoi definitions it is believed that such an approach is valid when aoi definition is made providing the fairness and necessity to define aois automatically without overlapping the volume of a 3d product design changes with its length width and depth parameters basic parameters therefore the aoi sizes are varied with equations making them dependent on the main construction parameters according to the view in other words size of an aoi defined for a hull parameter on side view is based on length and depth parameters while that of a top view parameter depends on width and length parameters first template elliptical aois are defined as covering the target areas which are learned from tls empirically on the other hand the templates of the tetragonal aois are defined via the oriented bounding box method barequet and har peled 2001 enclosing the target areas after that since the aois are managed via four handle points p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 the distances between the handle points of the template aois in x and y directions are divided by the relevant basic parameters to compute ratios finally the ratios are used to determine appropriate positions of the handle points for the 54 hulls in other words defined templates are reversed based on their hull models main dimensions and the handle points are relocated according to the new hull dimensions by the amount of the ratios note that a fixed reference point p r x is selected for each design parameter to compute the ratios and to relocate the handle points of the relevant aois there are several ways to define aois based on the basic parameters but the one that is used is illustrated in fig 12 where x and y coordinates of p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 for the elliptical aoi of b e is parametrically changed in proportion to the empirically found ratios via tls over width b e and lengths l 1 and l 2 according to reference point p r x note that the major axis of the elliptical aoi is computed in two parts based on l 1 and l 2 in proportions of the ratios and the minor axis is computed based on b e similar and suitable approaches are determined and applied to the other local parameters to parametrically modify and enable them to orient with the various dimensions of the 54 hulls 4 1 4 aois for global design parameters as seen in fig 9 the sequences of gaze fixations for the global parameters l e l m and l r are observed in the form of horizontal transitions along the hull on both side and top views our aim is to associate transitions made along the sections with the relevant length parameter for each section this can be done by defining path aois to construct a path similar to that observed in tls and counting the transitions between the path aois therefore eight path aois are defined four on the side view with labels a 1 s a 2 s a 3 s and a 4 s and four on top view with labels a 1 t a 2 t a 3 t and a 4 t fig 13 a in addition to these eight path aois two extra path aois are defined one for the front view of the hull and one for the whole adjective region in order to be used for transition probability calculation the reason for this will be explained later note that the distances p 0 1 y p 2 3 y of path aois are equal to the sum of maximum depth with cabin height on the side view and maximum width on the top view similar to the procedure for local parameters the handle points of the aois in the x direction are defined depending on length parameters and relocated through the 54 hull models using computed ratios furthermore the ogama software provides average loci similarities in percentages which depicts the proportion of the covered scan paths of the subjects by the defined path aois the ratios for path aois are computed taking the loci similarities into consideration 4 2 evaluation metrics two metrics are used in this study rtd for aoi analysis and transition probability for scan path analysis 4 2 1 rtd since there are 54 hulls with varied geometries the aoi sizes are parametrically adjusted for each hull however it is not fair to compare aois with different sizes holmqvist et al 2011 furthermore the time periods for etas are not fixed so the periods are different for each subject and the results can be dominated by the one who spends more time than the others to address these problems fixation durations are standardized to be relative to the time periods of subjects and the sizes of aois for each design parameter equation 1 calculates the relative times t a where t c is the period of a subject on the relevant hull image and t a indicates the time spent on a defined aoi for a parameter 1 t a t a t c equation 2 then normalizes the aoi size of the design parameter where the sum of relative times of all subjects s u b j e c t s t a is divided by aoi proportion of the design parameter to the whole question area k these computations are made for each of the 19 local design parameters to obtain the rtd s a 2 s a 1 k s u b j e c t s t a 4 2 2 transition probability as in rtds the transition counts need to be normalized for comparison of the global parameters of the 54 hulls to do this the transition counts are divided by total transitions made in the relevant hull image and the results are interpreted as transition probability ponsoda et al 1995 the general formula of transition probability p a i a j for a pair of path aois a i and a j is given in equation 3 where the transition count c a i a j is divided by the total count of transitions made on the hull image c a note that a here refers to a relevant aoi label 3 p a i a j c a i a j c a since more than 26 target design parameters can be observed by subjects on given stimuli many pointless transitions will be made for local parameters which should be avoided from total transitions therefore the path is constructed via 10 path aois covering the major transitions rather than the minors that are made on the image c a is the number of major transitions which are the ones among front view adjectives region entrance section middle body section and run section sections are defined for both top and side views minor transitions are assumed as transitions made on black areas of the image and self transitions a i a i are the ones made inside of the defined path aois which are usually short saccades and more likely belong to the local parameters fig 13 a shows the defined 10 path aois and fig 13 b displays the transition counts between the corresponding aois for both side and top views in the matrix form fig 13 c illustrates the transition probability computation equation 3 over the transition matrix of the top view where the transition probability between a 1 t and a 2 t p a 1 t a 2 t refers to that of the entrance section length p l e on the top view p a 2 t a 3 t is equal to p l m and p a 3 t a 4 t is equal to p l r the transition diagram in fig 13 c is also used to summarize the probabilities between the relevant aois where nowhere refers to aois other than a 1 t a 2 t a 3 t a 4 t similarly transition probabilities of four path aois a 1 s a 2 s a 3 s a 4 s are used to compute transition probabilities of the section lengths based on the side view front view and adjectives are other regions that are involved by the path as they are important stations for the subjects 5 results 5 1 screening based evaluation of design parameters 5 1 1 evaluation with rtd metric first the etas questions were roughly examined based on five significant areas front view adjectives entrance section middle body section and run section the sections are available for both side and top views fig 14 a via their total rtds computed for the 54 hulls s ˆ i 1 54 s a in fig 14 b s ˆ values for each area are represented via a pie chart in percentile which are relative to the sum of all note that percentages of sections were calculated according to sum of their computed durations on the side and top views according to the chart the regions ordered from the most attractive to the least attractive are as follows 37 of the total rtd of all 54 hull images for the middle body section 20 for the entrance section 19 for adjectives 18 for front view and 6 for the run section this analysis suggests that the middle body section is the first section that needs to be modified to appeal clients or achieve any design goals in terms of aesthetics since people quickly detect the modifications made in this section also the results show that dealing with run section modifications should be considered as last option since the clients will not pay attention to this section in the first place fig 14 c also shows the comparison of the view based results with the adjectives according to the comparison the side view of the hull design attracts most attention followed by the top view and then the front view which means that the side silhouette of the designs need to be studied on priority to appeal clients fine examination is performed with the 19 local design parameters via computed average rtds s a over the 54 hulls the distribution of s a values of the 19 parameters is represented via a box plot frigge et al 1989 in fig 15 a the box plot is composed of quartiles which are used to evaluate the attractiveness of the parameters in four levels accordingly the design parameters whose s a values are above than the third quartile q 3 are the most attractive ones level 1 among the 19 local parameters the parameters with s a values between median and q 3 are second level attractive parameters the other quartiles below the median value are determined as third and fourth degrees in terms of attractiveness the local parameters are illustrated in fig 15 a according to their attractiveness levels with different colors where green demonstrates the most attractive parameters level 1 which are listed as follows level 1 h b e d 2 m r 4 and r 1 m level 2 d 2 e a 1 b m r 5 r 0 m and fp level 3 β r 0 e r 1 e and d 2 r level 4 r 1 r b r r 0 r and α 2 since the attractiveness of the parameters is measured based on the gaze data the relations between the gaze data and the hull adjectives must be analyzed the idea is that if the gaze data have relations with the adjective choices the attractiveness results obtained will be related to the adjective based design concept since it shows that the participants looked at the parameter to select the adjectives otherwise the results will be unrelated to the adjective based design concept therefore level 1 and level 2 parameters are further analyzed via regression analysis to validate the attractiveness results the parameters lower than the median value are level 3 and level 4 parameters kept out of the regression analysis s proportions of each parameter relative to the sum of all s a i 1 19 s a are visualized in fig 15 b where the discarded parameters are surrounded by a red rectangle indicating the smallness of the area covered by them as compared to the rest 5 1 2 evaluation with transition probability transition probabilities of l e l m and l r parameters p l e p l m and p l r are calculated for each of the 54 hulls via scan path analysis and refer to the usage frequencies or densities of the relevant paths the average probabilities p l e p l m and p l r for the side and top views with sum of both are given by the bar chart in fig 16 a the results show that 2 5 of transitions are made for l m on the side view and 3 8 on the top view so the total transition percentage for this parameter is 6 3 p l m 0 063 the transition frequencies for l e on the side and top views are 1 6 and 1 3 so the total value is 2 9 p l e 0 029 finally l r transition frequency is calculated as 0 5 on the side view and 1 0 on the top view and total frequency of the transitions compared to whole transitions made on the question area is 1 5 p l r 0 015 it can be inferred from these results that the attractiveness order of lengths in other words priority of the length parameters for the adjective based design concept is l m l e l r fig 16 b also depicts the distributions of the 54 hulls transition probabilities of l e l m and l r sum of both side and top views for each hull model in the box plots each whisker shows the range where 25 of all probabilities are distributed while the box covers the remaining 50 comparing to the range of box plots and median values of l e l m and l r in order 0 03 0 06 and 0 01 a big portion of p l r values is distributed under p l e and p l m values in addition the run section has already been found unattractive bringing all the reasons together l r is also kept out from the regression analysis 5 2 relation analysis via regression analysis in this section the relations between gaze data and adjective choices are studied if some relations can be established they can be used to find unattractive design parameters for this purpose regression analysis is applied for estimating the relations between the gaze metrics as independent input variables and adjective selections as dependent response variables more specifically the input variables are the rtd s a and transition probability p they are denoted as x x i i 1 13 the response variables are 10 adjective selections strong a 1 speedy a 2 comfortable a 3 aesthetic a 4 usual common a 5 aggressive a 6 compact a 7 modern a 8 charismatic a 9 and cute a 10 they are denoted as y y i i 1 10 as shown in table 2 for each of the 54 hull designs relevant values for each of x i and y i are obtained with the user experiments described in section 4 the regression analysis is conducted on these input and response variables with values from the 54 observations for the hull design i d 1 54 first a dataset is prepared where input variables are assigned as gaze metrics and the response variables are defined by converting the adjective selections into levels next generalized linear model glm mccullagh 1984 is introduced as the regression analysis method a set of input variables called the regression model is used for the regression analysis the set x including all 13 input variables cannot be the best choice for the regression model but some subset of x is preferable thus the best subset selection method miller 2002 is used to determine the final regression model for each adjective in this method the residual sum of squares rss of all possible regression models is first calculated to determine the top models which are then evaluated according to the akaike information criteria aic akaike 1998 the aic values of the top models are compared according to the akaike weight ratios wagenmakers and farrell 2004 and d 2 guisan and zimmermann 2000 values finally the performance of the determined models for each adjective is measured via d 2 mean absolute percentage error mape and correlation analysis results 5 2 1 dataset organization and response variable determination the gaze data are input for regression analysis and represented by rtd for 11 attractive local parameters and transition probability for two attractive global parameters the adjective choices are converted into three levels according to the number of selections made by subjects and then used as response variables for the analysis table 2 displays dataset organization including input variables response variables and observations note that the levels represent the projected values of number of selections and will be analyzed as continuous variables rather than classes the values of the gaze metrics rtds and transition probabilities increase due to the attention of the subjects accordingly it is hypothesized that the number of selections of an adjective for a hull model is related to the increase in the metric values in other words if a design parameter is related to an adjective choice the value of the relevant metric for the design parameter is increased by the number of participants who select the adjective however the amount of increase in the metrics and the number of subjects is not expected to be detected clearly because each additional selection does not guarantee the increase in gaze metrics due to the unstable behavior of subjects during the survey to clarify the increase between them the number of selections are projected into levels which provide higher jumps between the selections therefore the increase will be easily related to the gaze data and the noises caused by ineffective selections are filtered as it is mentioned before each participant was given only two tasks out of four and some data were discarded due to calibration problems thus the number of participants namely the maximum possible number of selections are different for each etas set so the assignment of levels for the adjective choices must be done accordingly therefore instead of using the number of selections directly selection indexes are calculated dividing them by the number of subjects participating in the relevant set the 540 index values 54 hulls and 10 adjectives are plotted against the hull id using the histogram type graph to examine their distributions fig 17 the histogram is first was divided into two parts by a median value of 0 46 and it is seen that the upper portion is randomly distributed the stable part is then divided into two equal intervals as a consequence the levels are assigned using the following conditions level 1 i n d e x 0 23 level 2 0 23 i n d e x 0 46 level 3 i n d e x 0 46 5 2 2 glm in this study glm mccullagh 1984 is used for the regression analysis in addition as the response variables adjective levels are non negative continuous variables and limited between 1 and 3 which makes the distribution skewed since the bounds cannot be exceeded the gamma family venables and ripley 2013 is found suitable for the data distribution after comparing and testing with the other families e g gaussian poisson and quasi the general formula of glm is as follows 4 g e y i β 0 β 1 x 1 β k x k where e y i is estimation of the response value adjective choices corresponding to a 1 a 2 a 10 x 1 x k are independent input variables gaze metrics corresponding to s r 1 m s b e s b m s r 4 s r 5 s r 0 m s f p s h s a 1 s d 2 e s d 2 m p l e and p l m β 0 is intercept and β 1 β k are the coefficients for the estimation inverse link function g μ μ 1 venables and ripley 2013 is also used to relate the mean μ of the gamma distribution and the linear estimation model 5 2 3 best subset selection in general a regression deviation consists of two parts 5 r e g r e s s i o n d e v i a t i o n e x p l a i n e d v a r i a n c e r e s i d u a l s where variances are explained by the input variables gaze metrics and the residuals are remaining random variances that cannot be explained by the existing variables of the regression model it is clear that our target is to increase the explained variances as much as possible to decrease the residuals to do this the input variables which are unrelated to the relevant response variable need to be discarded from the regression model this can be achieved via the subset selection method miller 2002 one way to select the best subsets is calculating the rss via equation 6 for each of the possible regression models namely each x ˆ of the power set of x 2 x after that the first m best subsets which have the least rss values are found using an exhaustive search algorithm proposed by morgan and tatar 1972 rss is computed for each x ˆ of 2 x as follows 6 r s s n i 0 y i y ˆ i 2 where n is the number of observations 54 the number of hull designs y i is the observed response value and y ˆ i represents the estimated value via the subset x ˆ x ˆ 1 x ˆ 2 x ˆ m can be found having the smallest rss values then x ˆ 1 x ˆ 2 x ˆ m are further analyzed according to one of the quality measures i e aic akaike 1998 value 7 a i c 2 l n l 2 k for each x ˆ ε x ˆ 1 x ˆ 2 x ˆ m l is the value of maximized likelihood function l ψ x which is calculated by setting its derivative with respect to unknown parameter ψ to zero and solving the derived equation for ψ k is the cardinality of x ˆ since the aic value is a measure of information loss the model with the smallest aic is the best on the other hand in case the aic values are close to each other another model close to the best model having aic value close to smallest can be selected if it explains more portion of variance of the data d 2 equation 8a guisan and zimmermann 2000 is a measure of the explained variance for a glm model which is also equivalent to the well known measure r 2 the value of d 2 increases with the number of variables involved in the regression model and causes unfair comparison between the models having different numbers of variables therefore the regression models are compared via adjusted d 2 equation 8b guisan and zimmermann 2000 to eliminate this problem 8a d 2 1 r e s i d u a l d e v i a n c e n u l l d e v i a n c e 8b adjusted d 2 1 n 1 n k 1 d 2 where residual deviance refers to the residuals of the model including all model variables β 0 β 1 x 1 β k x k and null deviance is the residual of the intercept only model β 0 additionally the aic values of the models are compared via the following equation wagenmakers and farrell 2004 9 w i j l i l j k j k i where w i j is the ratio of akaike weights burnham and anderson 2003 which indicates how much i t h model x ˆ i is better in terms of minimization of the information loss over j t h model x ˆ j to sum up the subset selection starts with finding several best subsets which have the least rss values aic is then used to find the best among them which has the smallest aic value the best subsets having aic values close to the best model are then checked to see if their d 2 values are higher than those of the best model without dramatically raising w i j which is computed between the best model which has minimum aic value and the inquired model in the end if the increase in d 2 value is not sufficient to afford the increase in w i j the search is concluded 5 2 4 performance results of determined regression models to conduct the glm analysis supporting the subset selection method based on rss and aic values the best subset glm bestglm package is used proposed by mcleod and xu 2010 through r studio software team 2015 table 3 shows the summary of the results for the determined model for each adjective in matrix form where the first column represents the adjective labels the second column indicates mape which is computed via equation 10 to obtain the error between the estimated y ˆ i and observed y i response values scaling from 0 to 1 where 0 refers to 100 prediction accuracy 10 m a p e 1 n n i 0 y i y ˆ i y i next four columns represent correlation analysis results which are measured with 95 confidence level between the relevant adjective response of the data and fitted values of the models where cor represents correlation value c i l and c i u are lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval and p v a l u e is significance level of the correlation furthermore glm assumes that all input variables are independent this assumption is checked via a multicollinearity test where the generalized variance inflation factor gvif fox and monette 1992 values are used for the judgment the last row shows that the computed gvif values for each variable are less than 3 which indicates low correlation between the input variables namely their independency hair et al 2011 the results show that the ratio of explained variances d 2 which can be interpreted in percentile multiplying them by 100 ranges between 16 and 45 since the human perception is a complicated issue the collected data for social research are usually very noisy and the d 2 values even under 50 are acceptable in the context of the research chalmer 1986 also note that the regression analysis in this study is conducted to show the existence of correlation between gaze data and preferences but not for the prediction purposes moreover the computed mape values range between 0 16 and 0 39 which shows relatively good results to claim the existence of the relations considering the noisy data correlation values where 1 indicates perfect negative correlation and 0 depicts no correlation while 1 represents perfect positive correlation between the models and the responses are found between 0 37 and 0 67 which refer to positive correlations between the gaze data and the preferences the correlations for the a 4 a 5 and a 10 models are weak compared to the others but still show the existence of positive relations the p v a l u e s also indicate that all correlations are significant since all of them are lower than the 0 05 value according to 95 confidence level the overall performance results of the determined regression models validate the existence of relations between human preferences adjective choices and subject attention gaze data the parameters of the found regression models determined x ˆ subsets for each adjective are also represented in table 3 with black color which are highly related to the relevant adjectives in terms of attention for example the regression model variables of a 1 are r 1 m r 4 f p h d 2 e d 2 m and l m a designer can use these significant parameters in the first stage to get the hull model according to the desired adjective by modifying an existing hull model as they are attractive and have impact on the adjective choices note that the unattractive parameters determined in sections 5 1 1 and 5 1 2 were also analyzed via plots against residuals of the regression models fig 18 in order to check if the parameter can explain some portion of the residual part of the model however the residual plots show that the parameters have still totally random distributions which means they are not explanatory or the randomness is broken locally but the performance measures are not raised to be involved in the regression models for example the plot for r 0 e and β is relatively symmetric according to the line y 0 so it is not possible to estimate the residuals via them on the other hand in the plot of r 1 e some residuals can be estimated by the increase in this parameter however after adding the parameter to the relevant model the adjusted d 2 value decreases and mape value increases based on this it can be said that the previous determination of the unattractive parameters is valid since they failed to explain the variances 5 2 5 further analysis pearson s product moment correlation pearson 1896 is also used between time spent on each adjective each adjective was surrounded by an aoi separately and the adjective levels fig 17 such analysis can provide following information how comfortable the subjects are with the adjectives if the subjects spend more time on an adjective even it is not selected negative correlation is expected which means that the adjective is difficult to match with the hulls or somehow confusing which makes the subjects think more about it so in that case it can be concluded that it needs to be replaced with a better adjective in the future surveys consistency of gaze data and selection reliability of the responses can be confirmed in cases where positive correlations are observed however negative correlations do not indicate bad reliability table 4 shows the correlation results for the adjectives according to the results the correlations for speedy modern and cute are found insignificant as the p v a l u e s are lower than 0 05 which means the gaze data for them are random relative to the selections therefore nothing can be claimed about them on the other hand remaining adjectives have weak positive correlations 0 32 0 47 considering the noisy data that make the correlations weak it still validates that the adjectives are perceived by the subjects and they find the adjectives suitable to match with the hulls several correlation analyses are also conducted based on the time to first fixation ttff metric which indicate the time spent before the subjects first attention for a target aoi the analyses are made for the adjective selections to inquire their relations with each adjective s aois and with local design parameters however significant correlations are not found which means that subjects do not have specific parameter targets related to the adjectives to search in the first place but they examine the designs until finding meaningful reasons for their choices on the other hand the relation between ttff and rtd metrics of local design parameters is also checked and find interestingly significant correlations for r 4 c o r 0 40 p 0 05 t 3 1890 r 0 m c o r 0 33 p 0 05 t 2 5578 f p c o r 0 52 p 0 05 t 4 3646 and a 1 c o r 0 28 p 0 05 t 2 0723 see table 5 the existence of the correlation between rtd and ttff for the parameters is also represented by graphs in fig 19 with relation equations and r 2 values represents how much variance is covered by the equation although it cannot be claimed that they are more significant than the other parameters based on these results it is apparent that they require special attention in the design process 6 conclusion and discussion in this study the adjective based design concept is used where hulls are parameterized and the adjectives are related to the designs at the parametric level this provides relatively more detailed examination compared to the studies conducted with appearance features of designs which are obtained by a combination of varied values of relevant design parameters as the design elements are correlated to the targets at the parametric level such approach provides flexibility and more control on sampling designs that meet the targets specifically after the outcomes of this perception study are integrated into the design concept however working with the design parameters requires more attention as different dimension values and various combinations of the design parameters can be interpreted differently by subjects therefore the taguchi experimental method is also used to sample models where each design parameter value is shown to be able to cover various features equivalently in the same number of times tls is first proposed which is used to classify the global design parameters based on search behavior of the subjects one output of tls is a template which conveys the required information about aoi definitions based on search areas of the relevant design parameters an etas method was then utilized to collect gaze data which were evaluated via rtd and transition probability metrics the evaluations were conducted in three parts rough examination section based and view based fine examination design parameters and finally regression analysis rough examinations indicated the most attractive section as middle body section and view as side view such results can be used by designers to decrease labor times working only on the attractive areas fine examinations were first used to determine attractive parameters in four levels for local parameters and priorities for the global parameters interpreting a box plot the determined attractive parameters for fine examination results were then used in the regression analysis to validate that attractive parameters are really useful for the adjective based design concept glm with the best subset selection method was used to find regression models for each adjective depending on some performance measures d 2 to measure explained variance ratio and mape for accuracy check and best subset x ˆ determination criteria rss and aic in addition correlation analyses were conducted to confirm and measure levels of relations the results proved the existence of correlation between gaze data and adjective choices even though the performance measures were relatively low compared to the predictive models however our aim was not to get predictive models but to show the relations social science is complicated to study since the human understanding is difficult to estimate and this problem is getting even more complex with the unclear and varied targets 54 yacht hulls are studied which are generated by 26 design parameters and developed 26 targets from our viewpoint however there are even more targets for the subjects as a hull design has many more design details that can be detected moreover they are asked to match 10 adjectives with 54 hulls having all the design details that makes the problem even harder since the decision making mechanism is also developed and changed by seeing various hull models and unstable decisions noises are observed besides the useful data moreover they are not designers who change their decision criteria for no tangible reasons this has also been proved by kukkonen 2005 where gaze data correlations with the goals were very low for the subjects who were not designers and very high for designers after all of this despite the weakness of the performance measures compared to the predictive models significant results are found that validate the attractiveness of the design parameters determined by the gaze metrics specifically relevant design parameters which are variables of determined subsets have priorities to get desired adjective based design among all attractive design parameters which can be used by designers the results are suggested to be combined with the human oriented design dogan and gunpinar 2017 and parametric design khan et al 2017 approaches to generate an infinite number of design options related to the defined adjectives after that the product related requirements can be considered for filtering out the undesired design options in this study a yacht hull was used in which the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic performances are crucial as such performance properties in addition to aesthetic properties are important the aesthetics are handled first to be then combined with a performance based system which is considered as future work besides all benefits of the proposed method design parametrization and uniform design sampling are compulsory issues to benefit from the outcomes of this study otherwise the design parameter screening cannot be accomplished thoroughly and misleading results are more likely to be obtained we find it valuable to propose a technique that parametrizes designs and evaluates the parameters with automatically defined aois based on the parametrization doing that we would like to encourage industrial design area to use our method to get prominent designs with even less labor time and costs acknowledgment we would like to thank dr koichi ohtomi for his technical discussions and hiroyuki katayama for his help on experimental setup this paper is partially based on results obtained from delight design platform project under sip

23123,to analyze the dynamic behavior of a submerged floating tunnel sft subjected to moving vehicle loads in an ocean current environment a theoretical analysis model is proposed the sft is simplified as a beam on an elastic foundation the moving vehicle is modeled as a spring mass lump and the current effect is considered as a combination of lift force inertial force and hydraulic resistance directly acting on the sft the governing equations are solved by the modal superposition method a finite element method is developed to evaluate the results the impact effects of the vertical displacement and the bending moment are used to analyze the dynamic responses of the sft the effects of some key parameters such as the current velocity the buoyancy weight ratio bwr and the inclined angle of the tethers are also investigated the results show that the behaviors of the structure are amplified under the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction furthermore the current and the vehicle velocity will directly affect the impact responses of the sft by changing the forces on the structure the bwr and the inclined angle of the tethers will change the vibration characteristics of the sft and affect the inside state of the structure keywords submerged floating tunnel fluid vehicle tunnel interaction impact factor vertical displacement bending moment 1 introduction the submerged floating tunnel sft also named archimedes bridge is an innovative traffic structure for crossing long straits and deep lakes it is maintained in its position by a combination of tension force in tethers and the buoyancy force of the tunnel body compared with traditional bridges and tunnels the sft has better spanning capacity and relatively lower construction costs østlid h et al 2010 meantime the sft can operate in all weather conditions under the water and has little effect on the environment xiang et al 2016 it is because of these advantages that the sft has been considered as the most competitive sea crossing structure for long waterways in the 21st century the preliminary idea of the sft can be traced to the first decades of the last century since then many feasibility studies and schemes have been proposed for different straits and lakes such as hogsfjord in norway ahrens d 1997 messina strait in italy martire et al 2010 martinelli et al 2016 qiandao lake in china long et al 2009 ge et al 2010 funka bay in japan maeda et al 1994 and the mokpo jeju sft in south korea han et al 2016 however there is currently no existing sft in the world due to various scientific and technical difficulties like other offshore structures the sft must face the action of waves and currents tsunamis and seismic loads in the marine environment an attempt to analyze the fluid structure interaction fsi of the sft was presented by remseth et al 1999 they studied the random dynamic responses of the sft subjected to wave loading paik et al 2004 adopted the boundary element method bem with the linear potential theory to study the depth effect of the sft in the wave field lu et al 2011 pointed out that the mooring tethers of the sft might go slack under some severe sea wave conditions the tether slacking phenomenon was sensitive to the wave height and the wave period in seismic studies researchers fogazzi et al 2000 di pilato et al 2008a 2008b and martinelli et al 2010 considered the soil structure interaction in the case of a cable moored sft the effects were accounted for by inserting three elastic springs in orthogonal directions at the bottom of each anchor element the models developed geometrical non linear cable finite elements to simulate the nonlinear seismic time history responses of the sft martinelli et al 2011 focused on spatial variability of the excitation and provided a new method to obtain the response spectrum using a median pseudo acceleration response spectrum besides lee et al 2013 simulated the local damage and global behavior of the sft in a collision with a submerged moving body via the commercial software ansys ls dyna seo et al 2015 treated underwater explosion as piecewise linear shock pressure and investigated the global responses of the sft although the sft has to face seismic and hydrodynamic excitations during its operation the occurrence probability of such extreme cases is very low the most apparent difference between the sft and other offshore structures is that the sft is designed for vehicle traffic traffic moving loads as a perennial excitation from cars or trains also will induce the sft to vibrate during the service stage the vibration loads caused by vehicle traffic are smaller than the extreme loads but long term and periodic loads will lead to the sft suffering impact and fatigue related damage in addition the resonance phenomenon also may occur in the system during the vehicle travel the dynamic responses of the sft are significantly amplified which will undoubtedly affect driving safety and comfort so it is meaningful to analyze the effect of vehicle tunnel interaction in the sft research on the moving vehicle effects date back to the last century timoshenko et al 1955 and frýba et al 1999 presented a comprehensive theory concerning the dynamic responses of a simply supported girder subjected to moving vehicle load through development during these years more sophisticated vehicle models and more practical bridge models were introduced to investigate vehicle bridge interaction wang et al 1992 developed a seven degree of freedom dof vehicle model for the truck and analyzed the impact percentages in the cable stayed bridge due to moving vehicle loads shin et al 2010 adopted a series of moving loads to model high speed trains and evaluated a new resonance reduction scheme by inserting size adjusted vehicles in the train advancements in the powerful computers and numerical methods have enabled the proposal of methods to improve solution efficiency yang and yau 1997 proposed a vehicle bridge interaction vbi element by which the vehicle dofs are condensed into those of the bridge element using newmark s finite difference scheme vehicle pitching effect and vehicle riding comfort have been numerically studied to avoid peak responses yau et al 1999 yang et al 2004 although there is little research about sfts subjected to traffic moving loads information can be learned from the aforementioned vehicle bridge coupling vibration theories the difference between the sft and the bridge is that the structure is affected by external fluid environments tariverdilo et al 2011 using 2d and 3d structural models analyzed the vibration of the sft due to moving loads in their study they considered the effects of the surrounding fluid and found that the fluid structure interaction amplifies the tunnel deflection zhang et al 2016 investigated sft kinematic problems under a single moving load and discussed the influence of anchor stiffness moving load and moving velocity however those models ignored the interaction between the sft and the moving vehicle and only discussed the hydrostatic pressure environment in fact when the fluid passes a bluff body the flow separates from the body and rolls up into distinct vortices vortex shedding tends to generate periodic forces acting on the structure blevins et al 1977 and will definitely affect the dynamic response of the vehicle tunnel coupling system for a future transport infrastructure that links islands or lands the problem of the vehicle tunnel coupling system must be considered in designing the sft in this paper a theoretical analysis model that considers the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction is proposed the model simplifies the sft as a beam on an elastic foundation the moving vehicle is modeled as a spring mass lump and the ocean current effect is considered as a combination of lift force inertial force and hydraulic resistance directly acting on the tube the governing differential equations are solved by the mode superposition method and the fourth order runge kutta method for further specification a finite element method is developed to compare the dynamic responses of the sft finally the effects of some key parameters such as the current velocity the buoyancy weight ratio bwr and the inclined angle of the tethers are investigated 2 mathematical model 2 1 model and assumptions the model for studying the dynamic responses of the sft due to fluid vehicle tunnel interaction is established in this section fig 1 is a typical sft structure which consists of a tube anchor devices underwater foundation and several pairs of anchor tethers every pair of tethers is symmetrically installed in each position plane with different spacing h i i 1 2 n along the longitudinal direction x axis generally from the view of design the buoyant effect of the sft is more than the most unfavorable load combinations and the discrete tethers are always in the tension state so the deflections of the sft in the service period are relatively small and in the linear elastic scope within the small strain linear elastic hypothesis the tethers can be regarded as elastic supports with certain stiffness the vertical and horizontal stiffness of tethers would be acquired from eqs 1 and 2 sato et al 2007 the simplified spring stiffness at the i position is shown in fig 2 1 k v i 2 e c i a c i sin 2 α i l c i i 1 2 n 2 k h i 2 e c i a c i cos 2 α i l c i i 1 2 n where k vi and k hi are the vertical stiffness and the horizontal stiffness of the tether at the i position plane and e ci a ci l ci and α i are the elastic modulus section area length and inclination angle of the tether at the i position plane respectively in fact vortex induced vibration viv will occur when the ocean current flows past the sft viv is a direct consequence of lift cross flow and drag in line oscillations due to vortex shedding based on the experimental results blevins et al 1977 proposed that the pulse drag force along the direction of the current would be less than the lift force because the larger response has been observed many studies also focus on the modeling of pure cross flow viv excited by the lift force bishop and hassan 1964 sarpkaya 2004 gabbai and benaroya 2005 xiang et al 2013 in addition the moving vehicles play a more critical role in the vertical vibration of the sft compared with the transverse and torsional direction the vertical vibration of the sft is the main motion therefore the whole system neglects the horizontal and torsional vibration of the sft to establish the theoretical analysis model some further assumptions are given as follows 1 the tube is treated as a bernoulli euler beam with constant sections and equal stiffness only the elastic vibration of the tube in the x z plane is discussed the vehicle is modeled as a spring mass lump with one degree of freedom and is always in contact with the sft 2 because the speed of the underwater current is very gentle the current is regarded as a uniform constant flow the influence of the structural vibration on the whole flow field is neglected 3 every pair of tethers has the same geometric spacing and material properties along the longitudinal direction x axis of the sft so the stiffness of all tethers is the same value i e k v1 k v2 k vi k sato et al 2008 once concluded that if the stiffness between the tethers and tube meets the condition of eq 3 the discrete elastic supports could be regarded as a continuous elastic foundation 3 k h 3 24 e i 0 05 where k is the tether stiffness h is the tether spacing and ei is the flexural rigidity of the tube according to these assumptions a beam on a continuous elastic foundation with both ends hinged can be obtained as shown in fig 3 2 2 motion differential equations according to the above discussion the kinetic equation of the sft can be obtained by the hamilton principle and is written as 4 m 2 w t 2 c w t e i 4 w x 4 k w f v x t f d x t where w z t denotes the vertical displacement of the tunnel measured from its static equilibrium position m c and ei are the mass damping and flexural rigidity of the sft respectively f v x t is the moving traffic loading f d x t is the fluid loading and k is the equivalent linear stiffness of the elastic foundation k k h accordingly the boundary conditions of the beam on the continuous elastic foundation are 5 u 0 t u l t e i w 0 t e i w l t 0 to consider the vehicle tunnel interaction the moving traffic loading is modeled as a lumped mass supported by a spring and dashpot by d alembert s principle the moving loading can be represented as 6 f v x t m v g k v u t w x t δ x v t c v u t w x t t δ x v t f o r 0 v t l m v u t k v u t w x t δ x v t c v u t w x t t δ x v t 0 f o r 0 v t l where u t is the vertical displacement of the vehicle measured from its static equilibrium position m v k v and c v are the mass stiffness and damping of the vehicle respectively δ is dirac s delta function and dot denotes derivation with respect to time the vertical component of the fluid force in the x z plane mainly consists of following parts the lift force due to the asymmetrical vortex shedding in the wake region is described by eq 8 this empirical formula is proposed for the slender cylinder based on the early physical phenomenon blevins et al 1977 it simply simulates the periodic variation of vortex lift force by the trigonometric function and thinks that the lift force is related to the current velocity and the shedding frequency williamson et al 2004 wanderley et al 2005 the inertial force and the hydraulic resistance are caused by the relative motion of the sft here morison s equation written as eq 9 is adopted to describe the inertial force and the hydraulic resistance force acting on the structure 7 f d x t f l x t f d x t 8 f l x t 1 2 ρ w d c l v c 2 cos 2 π ω s t θ 9 f d x t 1 2 c d ρ w d w x t t w x t t 1 4 c m π d 2 ρ w 2 w x t t 2 where ρ w is the fluid density d is the tube diameter θ is the preliminary angle and ω s is the frequency of the vortex ω s s t v c d the frequency of the vortex can be obtained using the strouhal number s t here c l c d and c m are the non dimensional lift force coefficient the drag force coefficient and the added mass coefficient blevins et al 1977 chen et al 2015 to quantitatively analyze the influence of vortex shedding on the system the strouhal number is unified to 0 2 in the model the values of c l c d and c m for the circular section of the tube are c l 1 0 c d 0 6 and c m 1 0 xiang et al 2013 regarding the boundary conditions of the sft the mode superposition method msm is used to separate the time and spatial variables hence the vertical displacement function w x t can be expressed as 10 w x t n 1 q n t sin n π x l w x t n 1 q n t sin n π x l where q n t is the generalized modal coordinate by substituting eq 10 in the kinetic equation and integrating with respect to x over the length l of the sft eq 4 can be transformed into the following equations the orthogonality properties of the modes can be used to simplify the equations 11 q n t c m q n t e i m n π l 4 k m q n t 2 f v v t t m l 2 f l t m l 2 d n t m l f o r 0 v t l u t c v m v u t k v m v u t c v m v i 1 q i t sin i π v t l k v m v i 1 q i t sin i π v t l 0 f o r 0 v t l ω n 2 e i m n π l 4 k m n 1 2 3 where m is the equivalent mass m m 0 25 π c m ρ ω d 2 and ω n is the nth order circular frequency of the sft in addition the concrete expansions of some items in eq 11 are written as 12 f v v t t 0 l f v x t sin n π x l d x 13 f l t 0 l f l x t sin n π x l d x 14 d n t 1 2 c d ρ ω d 0 l i 1 q i t sin i π x l i 1 q i t sin i π x l sin n π x l d x here the flow field the vehicle system and the fluid forcing function are all time dependent and should be calculated simultaneously seen from eq 11 and eq 14 the tube and vehicle displacements are coupled together and the fluid drag force is related to the velocity of the tube besides each vibration mode also interacts with other modes from eq 4 the fourth order runge kutta method as an explicit integration method is applied to obtain the numerical solution the explicit integral form of the procedure can be written as 15 q n t δ t q n t δ t q n t δ t 2 g 1 g 2 g 3 6 n 1 2 3 16 q n t δ t q n t δ t g 1 g 2 g 3 g 4 6 n 1 2 3 17 u t δ t u t δ t u t δ t 2 h 1 h 2 h 3 6 18 u t δ t u t δ t h 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 6 thus considering the initial condition if the values of q n q n u u at time t are given n 1 2 3 their values at the next time step t δt can be easily evaluated by eq 15 to eq 18 where h 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 g 1 g 2 g 3 and g 4 are addressed in the appendix then the displacement w x t and bending moment m x t can be calculated as 19 w x t n 1 sin n π x l q n t m x t e i n 1 n π l 2 sin n π x l q n t 2 3 finite element method the finite element method fem is an effective numerical method for analyzing behaviors of the structure for further specification the finite element method is developed to evaluate the dynamic responses of the sft according to the equidistant distribution of nodes the tube is divided into n plane beam segment elements as shown in fig 4 both tube ends are free for flexural rotation and fixed for vertical displacement while the tethers are simulated by some discrete elastic truss elements hinged to the foundation on the seabed in addition the typical i j beam element is separated from the whole system to illustrate in the fem the displacement function of the element should satisfy the completeness and compatibility each node of the plane beam element can assign two dofs with one for vertical motion and the other for rotation the vertical displacement w x at any point within the element is approximated as eq 20 20 w x n 1 x w 1 n 2 x θ 1 n 3 x w 2 n 4 x θ 2 n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 w 1 θ 1 w 2 θ 2 n δ e in which δ e represents a listing of nodal displacements for a particular element and the components of n are the hermite shape function zienkiewicz et al 2008 the expressions for the shape function can be written for the element shown as n 1 1 3 ξ 2 2 ξ 3 n 2 ξ 2 ξ 2 ξ 3 l n 3 3 ξ 2 2 ξ 3 n 4 ξ 2 ξ 3 l where l is the length of the element and ξ is the relative position on the element ξ x x i l the cubic displacement function satisfies the requirement of the boundary continuity between adjacent elements so the mass and the stiffness matrix of the element can be written as eq 21 to eq 23 21 m e 0 l n t m n d x 22 k e 0 l b t e i b d x 23 b n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 then the total mass and the total stiffness matrix can be assembled based on the element nodes therefore the motion equations of the sft and the vehicle can respectively be shown as eq 24 and eq 25 24 m δ c δ k δ f t 25 m v u c v u k v u c v w v k v w v in which w v a n d w v are the displacement and the velocity of the sft at the vehicle position and w v n δ e t 0 l δ x x i d x w v n δ e t 0 l δ x x i d x the damping effect of the structure can be considered in the system and added damping item in eq 24 the total loads vector f t as a time dependent vector is updated at every time step by assembling each element nodal load fig 5 depicts the deformation of a typical i j beam element at times t and t δt according to fig 5 by transferring distributed loads to nodal loads the nodal external loads acting on the beam element can be written in the form 26 f v e m v g k v u t c v u t 0 l n t δ x x i d x 0 l n k v δ e t c v δ e t n t δ x x i d x 27 f d e 1 2 c d ρ w d 0 l n δ e t n δ e t n t d x 1 4 c m π d 2 ρ w 0 l n δ e t n t d x 28 f l e 1 2 ρ w d c l v c 2 cos 2 π ω s t θ 0 l n t d x 29 f e f v e f l e f d e in which f e is the element equivalent nodal load and f v e f l e a n d f d e are the element equivalent nodal loads respectively caused by vehicle interaction lift force inertial force and hydraulic resistance the newmark β method of direct integration zienkiewicz et al 2008 is used to solve the equations for a vehicle with an assumed velocity v that passes through the sft the main procedure of solving the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction is as follows see fig 6 step 1 pre processing determine the mass the stiffness and the damping matrix of both the vehicle and the sft start with time t 0 and set up the initial conditions step 2 nodal loads assembly calculate the nodal load of the element by eq 26 to eq 29 at moment t then assemble the nodal load to the total external nodal loads by element node number step 3 data transmission and integration the dynamic responses of the sft and the vehicle at time t δt can be calculated by the newmark β method then analyze the z displacement of the element at the vehicle position by the hermite interpolation function step 4 post processing repeat steps 2 and 3 using the latest available values until the spring mass vehicle model drives away from the sft then collect the maximum response data from the results in the procedure the coupling effect between the sft and the vehicle is considered through the contact force the fluid force is related to the acceleration and velocity of the sft the external nodal loads should be updated at each increment moment and then calculations are continued the procedure realizes the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction during the integration 3 numerical example 3 1 basic parameters of the sft so far there is no existing sft project anywhere in the world so the parameters of the sft are selected from some conceptual design study cases martinelli et al 2011 xiang et al 2017 and are listed in table 1 the total span of the sft is 500 m with four pairs of anchor tethers symmetrically installed each pair of tethers is spaced 100 m apart and has the same geometric and material properties the damping effect of the structure is considered in the model to simplify the calculation process the damping coefficient of the concrete structure is equivalent to a typical value of 0 05 in reality the traffic volume is determined by the numbers of the traffic lanes and the vehicle type shi et al 2008 used the aashto hs20 44 truck in the vehicle bridge coupled analysis the total weight of the truck is about 30 tons in the conceptual design of the sft for funka bay maeda et al 1994 the sft has four traffic lanes for moving vehicles so the most unfavorable condition four full heavy trucks moving in one direction is discussed in the research the gravity of trucks is taken as the initial excitation on the sft specific values of the truck parameters are listed in table 2 3 2 modal parameters analysis the vibration characteristics of the sft such as natural frequencies and corresponding vibration mode can be obtained through modal analysis fig 7 gives the first eight mode shapes obtained by the fem which are compared with the shape functions used in the msm on the whole the mode shapes acquired by the two methods are similar in the fem the sft is supported by discrete elastic springs affected by the support stiffness a few differences exist in the local positions sato et al 2008 once pointed out that the differences are related to the stiffness of discrete elastic support although the equivalent support stiffness satisfies eq 3 the differences are quite insignificant also the differences become less obvious as the modal order number increases table 3 lists the first eight natural frequencies of the sft according to eq 11 the first mode natural frequency obtained by the msm is 0 3290 hz it is very close to the result of the fem and the difference between these two results is only 0 0022 hz 0 75 differing from the characteristic of mode shape the natural frequency difference increases as the modal order number increases in the 8th order mode the natural frequency relative difference of the msm and the fem is about 0 4852 hz 13 94 the results show that the low order frequencies of these two models have good agreement but there are still some differences in the high order frequency in other words the vibration characteristics of the sft can be reflected by the continuous elastic foundation boundary and the discrete elastic supports boundary but this assumption will cause certain error in structural high order vibration analysis and should be further considered 3 3 convergence analysis of the numerical simulation the feasibility of the msm also depends on the number of vibration modes considered in the analysis lower modes cannot reflect the vibration characteristics of the structure but higher modes tend to be less reliable in the vibration due to characteristics such as the long span significant flexibility and low damping sfts are always regarded as low frequency vibration structures therefore zhang et al 2016 only considered the first vibration mode of the sft to simplify the kinetic equations they believe the first vibration mode makes a great contribution to the structure vibration however some researchers indicate that a higher vibration mode could be recognized when the sft suffers from external loads tariverdilo et al 2011 xiang et al 2017 therefore the convergence analysis for the sft is carried out based on the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction fig 8 discusses the vertical displacements of the sft corresponding to the vehicle moving to the 50 m 150 m and 250 m points of the sft the result values obtained by the msm with the first six modes and the first eight modes are almost the same which are close to the results acquired by the fem table 4 gives the extreme values of vertical displacement at different time intervals the results of the msm with different numbers of vibration modes are compared with that of the fem the differences between the first six modes and the first eight modes are already quite small in addition the deviations are maintained at a low level which means both ways can give reasonable results it is worth noting that only considering the first vibration mode will neglect the negative direction displacements of the sft and lose much accuracy therefore the first six modes of the sft are adopted in the analysis to ensure computational efficiency and reasonable results 4 results and analysis 4 1 vertical displacement and bending moment structural displacement is the direct index reflecting structural vibration here fig 9 gives the envelopes of vertical displacements calculated by the msm and the fem the first six modes of the sft are considered in the msm and the velocity of the current and the vehicle are 0 2 m s and 90 km h respectively the maximum and the minimum vertical displacements of each position are recorded when the moving vehicle runs from left to right on the sft to evaluate the dynamic displacement responses the vertical displacements of the sft subjected to the same magnitude of static load are also calculated based on the discrete elastic supports beam model as shown in fig 9 the envelope curve of the static load is much smoother than that of the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction results gained from the msm and the fem have positive and negative displacement values which results from the high vibration modes and the oscillation will make the tethers operate in alternating stress conditions thus the tether fatigue problem should be considered in the sft design the dynamic vertical displacement responses are always larger than the static displacement responses the envelope curve of considering the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction exceeds that of static load this is called the dynamic amplification phenomenon and can also be found in the vehicle bridge coupled analysis the bending moments of the structure can also be obtained by eq 19 as shown in fig 10 according to the bernoulli euler beam principle the positive bending moment will cause the lower parts of the section to be in the tension state both positive and negative bending moments are acquired in the calculation the section of the sft suffers alternate bending moment load and alternate stress appears under such circumstances some tiny crack damage will easily occur decreasing the material strength and leading to leaks meantime the formation of cracks will be accelerated by hydraulic pressure in addition the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction amplifies the bending moment load and stress the sft operation environment is even worse than people think 4 2 impact factor to quantify the influence of fluid vehicle tunnel interaction on the sft the impact factor is defined as eq 30 30 i m p a c t f a c t o r r max r s t a 1 where r max and r sta are the absolute maximum responses under the action of dynamic and static loads respectively the impact factor can be regarded as a safety factor for the structure design fig 11 shows the impact factor of vertical displacement along the x axis although the results gained by the two methods show little difference the change laws of their results are almost the same take the results obtained by the msm as an example the impact factors of the tether supports such as the locations at 100 m 200 m 300 m and 400 m are 0 22 0 23 0 25 and 0 24 respectively they are larger than the impact factor of the mid point and the value of the mid point is only 0 15 this shows that the elastic support constraint does not reduce the impact factor when taking account of the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction therefore the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction has a bigger effect on the segments of the sft close to discrete constraint points than on the middle section fig 12 shows the impact factor of the bending moment along the x axis compared with the vertical displacement results the bending moment impact factors show much higher order features excited by the driving effect due to the effects of structural stiffness and high order modes the bending moment values change more drastically than that of the structure subjected to static load the contribution of high order modes is amplified by the structural stiffness in the dynamic bending moment calculation take the results gained from the msm as an example the impact factors of every mid point such as the locations at 50 m 150 m 250 m 350 m and 450 m are 0 28 0 20 0 05 0 16 and 0 17 respectively the values of these characteristic locations are smaller than those of the segments close to the discrete tether support points such as 100 m 200 m 300 m and 400 m from this perspective the segments of the sft close to the discrete tether support points are more sensitive to the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction 5 influence factor study 5 1 effect of the current velocity ocean current is a seasonal directed movement of seawater generated by breaking waves wind temperature and salinity differences ocean depth shoreline configurations and interactions with other currents influence a current s direction and strength to avoid the effects of waves and navigation activities the sft is always set in about 30 m below the water surface so the speed of the underwater current is very gentle and a uniform constant flow is assumed during the theoretical analysis model from eq 8 the lift force caused by vortex shedding is related to the current velocity so the effect of ocean current velocity ranging from 0 m s to 0 3 m s is analyzed in this work fig 13 shows the impact of vertical displacement at the mid point with different current velocities with increased vehicle velocity the impact factors are not stable but are mainly in a fluctuating growth as eq 8 showed the sft is in a hydrostatic pressure environment when the current velocity v c equals 0 0 m s the curve shows that the distance between the adjacent peaks increases gradually and the phenomenon is magnified by increasing the current velocity besides the impact factor contour map in fig 13 also shows that the contour lines are relatively dense when the current velocity is high when the current velocity increases to 0 3 m s the fluctuation range of the impact factor have reached around 20 it is almost twice the effect caused by vehicle velocity v 120 km h in the hydrostatic pressure environment the results mean that the vortex lift force induced by the ocean current has been relatively large and affects the dynamic behavior of the sft in other words cars and trains driving in the sft are affected by the ocean current environment the impact factors of the bending moment at the mid point with different current velocities are shown in fig 14 at the same current velocity the impact factor of the bending moment grows with increasing vehicle velocity but there is no obvious periodic change characteristic in the law of growth apparently it is caused by the moving vehicle effect according to the contour map in fig 14 there is a noticeable fluctuation in the impact factor curve when the current velocity approaches 0 3 m s the amplitude of fluctuation reaches 9 at the middle stage of vehicle velocity such as around 90 km h the fluctuation amplitude is enlarged by the ocean current effect however in contrast to the vertical displacement results the influence of this effect is much smaller from eq 19 the bending moment is related to both the high order modes and the structural stiffness 5 2 effect of the buoyancy weight ratio bwr the buoyancy weight ratio bwr is defined as the ratio of tunnel buoyancy to the whole tunnel weight selecting an appropriate bwr value is a significant step in the design of a sft lu et al 2011 in fact the bwr determines the tension force of the tether section and influences the stability of the sft so it is an important issue to determine the effect of the bwr under fluid vehicle tunnel interaction in the present research the calculation is carried out with the bwr varying in the range of 1 2 1 8 changes in the bwr originate from the change in the mass m of the sft tube fig 15 gives the impact of vertical displacement at the mid point with different bwrs the curve of the impact factor oscillates but remains between 0 1 and 0 2 however the vehicle velocities at the peaks and troughs lag significantly behind as the bwr grows according to eq 11 the natural frequency of the structure increases with increases in the bwr the impact factor peak is excited by faster vehicle velocity when the current velocity and the vehicle weight are certain in addition there are some parallel lines on the impact factor contour map this means that the vehicle velocity corresponding to the impact factor peak grows as the bwr increases to understand the effects of the bwr on the impact factor of the bending moment fig 16 illustrates the results at different bwrs the impact factor curves at different bwrs have similar growth trends but the fluctuation amplitudes of the impact factors are a little different at various bwrs the bwr impact factor at 1 5 is about 5 when the vehicle velocity approaches 80 km h the bwr impact factor around 1 5 is smaller than that of the segments close to the lower and higher bwr region in other words a bwr that is either too large or too small is not suitable for a sft subjected to fluid vehicle tunnel interaction the phenomenon of the lagging curve peak also occurs in the bending moment impact factor curve thus the proper bwr around 1 5 adjusted by balancing weights and materials can help the inside state of the structure 5 3 effect of the inclined angle of the tether the tether cross section material and spatial layout will determine the tether stiffness and influence the dynamic behavior of the sft according to eqs 1 and 2 the inclined angle of the tether is one of the design parameters which will directly affect the tether stiffness in the present research inclined angles in the range of 30 to 75 are carried out with the length of the tethers constant fig 17 gives the impact of vertical displacement at the mid point with different inclined angles fig 17 shows that the effects of the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction are reduced with increases in the inclined angle of the tether the impact factor of the vertical displacement is 15 3 at inclined angle α 75 which is almost half of the impact factor at inclined angle α 30 this indicates that improving vertical stiffness is an efficient way to reduce the impact factor of vertical displacement in addition the impact factor peaks are distributed along the diagonal direction on the contour map the tether stiffness is enhanced by increasing the inclined angle and improves the natural frequency of the structure in eq 11 increased vehicle velocity will excite higher impact factors at a low inclined tether angle fig 18 shows that the impact factor of the bending moment decreases with increases in the inclined angle of the tether take a vehicle velocity of 120 km h as an example the impact factor of the bending moment drops from 41 9 to 7 82 as the inclined angle increases from 30 to 75 however the decline rate is higher in the small inclined angle region than in the large inclined angle region from the contour map shown in fig 18 in other words increasing the inclined angle of the tether can provide only limited improvement in the bending moment impact factor whereas because of the driving effect the impact factor will show a dramatic fluctuation with increases in vehicle speed accordingly a high moving vehicle velocity is not beneficial to a sft subjected to fluid vehicle tunnel interaction so a proper inclined angle and reasonable vehicle passing velocity should be set for the sft 6 conclusion this paper proposes a theoretical analysis model for analyzing the dynamic response of the sft due to fluid vehicle tunnel interaction the msm is provided to solve the governing equations while the fem is developed to compare and evaluate the results the effects of some key parameters such as the current velocity the bwr and the inclined angles of the tether are discussed to provide a reference for preliminary structure design the following conclusions can be drawn from this research 1 the results of the msm and the fem show reasonable agreement in solving the sft suffering the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction in this paper the dynamic responses of the sft at different times the first eight mode shapes and natural frequencies are respectively compared and analyzed the results of the msm considering the first six modes have reasonable agreement with the fem results 2 the vertical displacement and the bending moment of the sft are amplified under the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction and the vertical displacement and the bending moment have opposite values along the longitudinal direction of the sft the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction has a bigger effect on the segments close to discrete tether supports than segments near the middle section those characteristics should be considered to avoid component fatigue and cracks on the primary stage 3 the vertical displacement impact factor increases as the current velocity increases compared with the vertical displacement results the influence of the current velocity on the bending moment is affected by both the structural stiffness and the high order modes 4 the bwr mainly affects the natural frequency of the sft and causes the impact factor curve peak lagging phenomenon in the numerical results the structure with a bwr around 1 5 adjusted by balancing weights and materials has a relatively small bending moment impact factor and reaches a better inside state 5 the inclined angle of the tether affects the dynamic response of the sft by changing the support stiffness the larger inclined angle will provide stronger vertical stiffness and restrain the impact factor of the vertical displacement and the bending moment compared with the current velocity and the bwr the effect of the inclined angle on the bending moment impact factor is more drastic acknowledgments this work was supported by

23123,to analyze the dynamic behavior of a submerged floating tunnel sft subjected to moving vehicle loads in an ocean current environment a theoretical analysis model is proposed the sft is simplified as a beam on an elastic foundation the moving vehicle is modeled as a spring mass lump and the current effect is considered as a combination of lift force inertial force and hydraulic resistance directly acting on the sft the governing equations are solved by the modal superposition method a finite element method is developed to evaluate the results the impact effects of the vertical displacement and the bending moment are used to analyze the dynamic responses of the sft the effects of some key parameters such as the current velocity the buoyancy weight ratio bwr and the inclined angle of the tethers are also investigated the results show that the behaviors of the structure are amplified under the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction furthermore the current and the vehicle velocity will directly affect the impact responses of the sft by changing the forces on the structure the bwr and the inclined angle of the tethers will change the vibration characteristics of the sft and affect the inside state of the structure keywords submerged floating tunnel fluid vehicle tunnel interaction impact factor vertical displacement bending moment 1 introduction the submerged floating tunnel sft also named archimedes bridge is an innovative traffic structure for crossing long straits and deep lakes it is maintained in its position by a combination of tension force in tethers and the buoyancy force of the tunnel body compared with traditional bridges and tunnels the sft has better spanning capacity and relatively lower construction costs østlid h et al 2010 meantime the sft can operate in all weather conditions under the water and has little effect on the environment xiang et al 2016 it is because of these advantages that the sft has been considered as the most competitive sea crossing structure for long waterways in the 21st century the preliminary idea of the sft can be traced to the first decades of the last century since then many feasibility studies and schemes have been proposed for different straits and lakes such as hogsfjord in norway ahrens d 1997 messina strait in italy martire et al 2010 martinelli et al 2016 qiandao lake in china long et al 2009 ge et al 2010 funka bay in japan maeda et al 1994 and the mokpo jeju sft in south korea han et al 2016 however there is currently no existing sft in the world due to various scientific and technical difficulties like other offshore structures the sft must face the action of waves and currents tsunamis and seismic loads in the marine environment an attempt to analyze the fluid structure interaction fsi of the sft was presented by remseth et al 1999 they studied the random dynamic responses of the sft subjected to wave loading paik et al 2004 adopted the boundary element method bem with the linear potential theory to study the depth effect of the sft in the wave field lu et al 2011 pointed out that the mooring tethers of the sft might go slack under some severe sea wave conditions the tether slacking phenomenon was sensitive to the wave height and the wave period in seismic studies researchers fogazzi et al 2000 di pilato et al 2008a 2008b and martinelli et al 2010 considered the soil structure interaction in the case of a cable moored sft the effects were accounted for by inserting three elastic springs in orthogonal directions at the bottom of each anchor element the models developed geometrical non linear cable finite elements to simulate the nonlinear seismic time history responses of the sft martinelli et al 2011 focused on spatial variability of the excitation and provided a new method to obtain the response spectrum using a median pseudo acceleration response spectrum besides lee et al 2013 simulated the local damage and global behavior of the sft in a collision with a submerged moving body via the commercial software ansys ls dyna seo et al 2015 treated underwater explosion as piecewise linear shock pressure and investigated the global responses of the sft although the sft has to face seismic and hydrodynamic excitations during its operation the occurrence probability of such extreme cases is very low the most apparent difference between the sft and other offshore structures is that the sft is designed for vehicle traffic traffic moving loads as a perennial excitation from cars or trains also will induce the sft to vibrate during the service stage the vibration loads caused by vehicle traffic are smaller than the extreme loads but long term and periodic loads will lead to the sft suffering impact and fatigue related damage in addition the resonance phenomenon also may occur in the system during the vehicle travel the dynamic responses of the sft are significantly amplified which will undoubtedly affect driving safety and comfort so it is meaningful to analyze the effect of vehicle tunnel interaction in the sft research on the moving vehicle effects date back to the last century timoshenko et al 1955 and frýba et al 1999 presented a comprehensive theory concerning the dynamic responses of a simply supported girder subjected to moving vehicle load through development during these years more sophisticated vehicle models and more practical bridge models were introduced to investigate vehicle bridge interaction wang et al 1992 developed a seven degree of freedom dof vehicle model for the truck and analyzed the impact percentages in the cable stayed bridge due to moving vehicle loads shin et al 2010 adopted a series of moving loads to model high speed trains and evaluated a new resonance reduction scheme by inserting size adjusted vehicles in the train advancements in the powerful computers and numerical methods have enabled the proposal of methods to improve solution efficiency yang and yau 1997 proposed a vehicle bridge interaction vbi element by which the vehicle dofs are condensed into those of the bridge element using newmark s finite difference scheme vehicle pitching effect and vehicle riding comfort have been numerically studied to avoid peak responses yau et al 1999 yang et al 2004 although there is little research about sfts subjected to traffic moving loads information can be learned from the aforementioned vehicle bridge coupling vibration theories the difference between the sft and the bridge is that the structure is affected by external fluid environments tariverdilo et al 2011 using 2d and 3d structural models analyzed the vibration of the sft due to moving loads in their study they considered the effects of the surrounding fluid and found that the fluid structure interaction amplifies the tunnel deflection zhang et al 2016 investigated sft kinematic problems under a single moving load and discussed the influence of anchor stiffness moving load and moving velocity however those models ignored the interaction between the sft and the moving vehicle and only discussed the hydrostatic pressure environment in fact when the fluid passes a bluff body the flow separates from the body and rolls up into distinct vortices vortex shedding tends to generate periodic forces acting on the structure blevins et al 1977 and will definitely affect the dynamic response of the vehicle tunnel coupling system for a future transport infrastructure that links islands or lands the problem of the vehicle tunnel coupling system must be considered in designing the sft in this paper a theoretical analysis model that considers the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction is proposed the model simplifies the sft as a beam on an elastic foundation the moving vehicle is modeled as a spring mass lump and the ocean current effect is considered as a combination of lift force inertial force and hydraulic resistance directly acting on the tube the governing differential equations are solved by the mode superposition method and the fourth order runge kutta method for further specification a finite element method is developed to compare the dynamic responses of the sft finally the effects of some key parameters such as the current velocity the buoyancy weight ratio bwr and the inclined angle of the tethers are investigated 2 mathematical model 2 1 model and assumptions the model for studying the dynamic responses of the sft due to fluid vehicle tunnel interaction is established in this section fig 1 is a typical sft structure which consists of a tube anchor devices underwater foundation and several pairs of anchor tethers every pair of tethers is symmetrically installed in each position plane with different spacing h i i 1 2 n along the longitudinal direction x axis generally from the view of design the buoyant effect of the sft is more than the most unfavorable load combinations and the discrete tethers are always in the tension state so the deflections of the sft in the service period are relatively small and in the linear elastic scope within the small strain linear elastic hypothesis the tethers can be regarded as elastic supports with certain stiffness the vertical and horizontal stiffness of tethers would be acquired from eqs 1 and 2 sato et al 2007 the simplified spring stiffness at the i position is shown in fig 2 1 k v i 2 e c i a c i sin 2 α i l c i i 1 2 n 2 k h i 2 e c i a c i cos 2 α i l c i i 1 2 n where k vi and k hi are the vertical stiffness and the horizontal stiffness of the tether at the i position plane and e ci a ci l ci and α i are the elastic modulus section area length and inclination angle of the tether at the i position plane respectively in fact vortex induced vibration viv will occur when the ocean current flows past the sft viv is a direct consequence of lift cross flow and drag in line oscillations due to vortex shedding based on the experimental results blevins et al 1977 proposed that the pulse drag force along the direction of the current would be less than the lift force because the larger response has been observed many studies also focus on the modeling of pure cross flow viv excited by the lift force bishop and hassan 1964 sarpkaya 2004 gabbai and benaroya 2005 xiang et al 2013 in addition the moving vehicles play a more critical role in the vertical vibration of the sft compared with the transverse and torsional direction the vertical vibration of the sft is the main motion therefore the whole system neglects the horizontal and torsional vibration of the sft to establish the theoretical analysis model some further assumptions are given as follows 1 the tube is treated as a bernoulli euler beam with constant sections and equal stiffness only the elastic vibration of the tube in the x z plane is discussed the vehicle is modeled as a spring mass lump with one degree of freedom and is always in contact with the sft 2 because the speed of the underwater current is very gentle the current is regarded as a uniform constant flow the influence of the structural vibration on the whole flow field is neglected 3 every pair of tethers has the same geometric spacing and material properties along the longitudinal direction x axis of the sft so the stiffness of all tethers is the same value i e k v1 k v2 k vi k sato et al 2008 once concluded that if the stiffness between the tethers and tube meets the condition of eq 3 the discrete elastic supports could be regarded as a continuous elastic foundation 3 k h 3 24 e i 0 05 where k is the tether stiffness h is the tether spacing and ei is the flexural rigidity of the tube according to these assumptions a beam on a continuous elastic foundation with both ends hinged can be obtained as shown in fig 3 2 2 motion differential equations according to the above discussion the kinetic equation of the sft can be obtained by the hamilton principle and is written as 4 m 2 w t 2 c w t e i 4 w x 4 k w f v x t f d x t where w z t denotes the vertical displacement of the tunnel measured from its static equilibrium position m c and ei are the mass damping and flexural rigidity of the sft respectively f v x t is the moving traffic loading f d x t is the fluid loading and k is the equivalent linear stiffness of the elastic foundation k k h accordingly the boundary conditions of the beam on the continuous elastic foundation are 5 u 0 t u l t e i w 0 t e i w l t 0 to consider the vehicle tunnel interaction the moving traffic loading is modeled as a lumped mass supported by a spring and dashpot by d alembert s principle the moving loading can be represented as 6 f v x t m v g k v u t w x t δ x v t c v u t w x t t δ x v t f o r 0 v t l m v u t k v u t w x t δ x v t c v u t w x t t δ x v t 0 f o r 0 v t l where u t is the vertical displacement of the vehicle measured from its static equilibrium position m v k v and c v are the mass stiffness and damping of the vehicle respectively δ is dirac s delta function and dot denotes derivation with respect to time the vertical component of the fluid force in the x z plane mainly consists of following parts the lift force due to the asymmetrical vortex shedding in the wake region is described by eq 8 this empirical formula is proposed for the slender cylinder based on the early physical phenomenon blevins et al 1977 it simply simulates the periodic variation of vortex lift force by the trigonometric function and thinks that the lift force is related to the current velocity and the shedding frequency williamson et al 2004 wanderley et al 2005 the inertial force and the hydraulic resistance are caused by the relative motion of the sft here morison s equation written as eq 9 is adopted to describe the inertial force and the hydraulic resistance force acting on the structure 7 f d x t f l x t f d x t 8 f l x t 1 2 ρ w d c l v c 2 cos 2 π ω s t θ 9 f d x t 1 2 c d ρ w d w x t t w x t t 1 4 c m π d 2 ρ w 2 w x t t 2 where ρ w is the fluid density d is the tube diameter θ is the preliminary angle and ω s is the frequency of the vortex ω s s t v c d the frequency of the vortex can be obtained using the strouhal number s t here c l c d and c m are the non dimensional lift force coefficient the drag force coefficient and the added mass coefficient blevins et al 1977 chen et al 2015 to quantitatively analyze the influence of vortex shedding on the system the strouhal number is unified to 0 2 in the model the values of c l c d and c m for the circular section of the tube are c l 1 0 c d 0 6 and c m 1 0 xiang et al 2013 regarding the boundary conditions of the sft the mode superposition method msm is used to separate the time and spatial variables hence the vertical displacement function w x t can be expressed as 10 w x t n 1 q n t sin n π x l w x t n 1 q n t sin n π x l where q n t is the generalized modal coordinate by substituting eq 10 in the kinetic equation and integrating with respect to x over the length l of the sft eq 4 can be transformed into the following equations the orthogonality properties of the modes can be used to simplify the equations 11 q n t c m q n t e i m n π l 4 k m q n t 2 f v v t t m l 2 f l t m l 2 d n t m l f o r 0 v t l u t c v m v u t k v m v u t c v m v i 1 q i t sin i π v t l k v m v i 1 q i t sin i π v t l 0 f o r 0 v t l ω n 2 e i m n π l 4 k m n 1 2 3 where m is the equivalent mass m m 0 25 π c m ρ ω d 2 and ω n is the nth order circular frequency of the sft in addition the concrete expansions of some items in eq 11 are written as 12 f v v t t 0 l f v x t sin n π x l d x 13 f l t 0 l f l x t sin n π x l d x 14 d n t 1 2 c d ρ ω d 0 l i 1 q i t sin i π x l i 1 q i t sin i π x l sin n π x l d x here the flow field the vehicle system and the fluid forcing function are all time dependent and should be calculated simultaneously seen from eq 11 and eq 14 the tube and vehicle displacements are coupled together and the fluid drag force is related to the velocity of the tube besides each vibration mode also interacts with other modes from eq 4 the fourth order runge kutta method as an explicit integration method is applied to obtain the numerical solution the explicit integral form of the procedure can be written as 15 q n t δ t q n t δ t q n t δ t 2 g 1 g 2 g 3 6 n 1 2 3 16 q n t δ t q n t δ t g 1 g 2 g 3 g 4 6 n 1 2 3 17 u t δ t u t δ t u t δ t 2 h 1 h 2 h 3 6 18 u t δ t u t δ t h 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 6 thus considering the initial condition if the values of q n q n u u at time t are given n 1 2 3 their values at the next time step t δt can be easily evaluated by eq 15 to eq 18 where h 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 g 1 g 2 g 3 and g 4 are addressed in the appendix then the displacement w x t and bending moment m x t can be calculated as 19 w x t n 1 sin n π x l q n t m x t e i n 1 n π l 2 sin n π x l q n t 2 3 finite element method the finite element method fem is an effective numerical method for analyzing behaviors of the structure for further specification the finite element method is developed to evaluate the dynamic responses of the sft according to the equidistant distribution of nodes the tube is divided into n plane beam segment elements as shown in fig 4 both tube ends are free for flexural rotation and fixed for vertical displacement while the tethers are simulated by some discrete elastic truss elements hinged to the foundation on the seabed in addition the typical i j beam element is separated from the whole system to illustrate in the fem the displacement function of the element should satisfy the completeness and compatibility each node of the plane beam element can assign two dofs with one for vertical motion and the other for rotation the vertical displacement w x at any point within the element is approximated as eq 20 20 w x n 1 x w 1 n 2 x θ 1 n 3 x w 2 n 4 x θ 2 n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 w 1 θ 1 w 2 θ 2 n δ e in which δ e represents a listing of nodal displacements for a particular element and the components of n are the hermite shape function zienkiewicz et al 2008 the expressions for the shape function can be written for the element shown as n 1 1 3 ξ 2 2 ξ 3 n 2 ξ 2 ξ 2 ξ 3 l n 3 3 ξ 2 2 ξ 3 n 4 ξ 2 ξ 3 l where l is the length of the element and ξ is the relative position on the element ξ x x i l the cubic displacement function satisfies the requirement of the boundary continuity between adjacent elements so the mass and the stiffness matrix of the element can be written as eq 21 to eq 23 21 m e 0 l n t m n d x 22 k e 0 l b t e i b d x 23 b n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 then the total mass and the total stiffness matrix can be assembled based on the element nodes therefore the motion equations of the sft and the vehicle can respectively be shown as eq 24 and eq 25 24 m δ c δ k δ f t 25 m v u c v u k v u c v w v k v w v in which w v a n d w v are the displacement and the velocity of the sft at the vehicle position and w v n δ e t 0 l δ x x i d x w v n δ e t 0 l δ x x i d x the damping effect of the structure can be considered in the system and added damping item in eq 24 the total loads vector f t as a time dependent vector is updated at every time step by assembling each element nodal load fig 5 depicts the deformation of a typical i j beam element at times t and t δt according to fig 5 by transferring distributed loads to nodal loads the nodal external loads acting on the beam element can be written in the form 26 f v e m v g k v u t c v u t 0 l n t δ x x i d x 0 l n k v δ e t c v δ e t n t δ x x i d x 27 f d e 1 2 c d ρ w d 0 l n δ e t n δ

n d f d e are the element equivalent nodal loads respectively caused by vehicle interaction lift force inertial force and hydraulic resistance the newmark β method of direct integration zienkiewicz et al 2008 is used to solve the equations for a vehicle with an assumed velocity v that passes through the sft the main procedure of solving the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction is as follows see fig 6 step 1 pre processing determine the mass the stiffness and the damping matrix of both the vehicle and the sft start with time t 0 and set up the initial conditions step 2 nodal loads assembly calculate the nodal load of the element by eq 26 to eq 29 at moment t then assemble the nodal load to the total external nodal loads by element node number step 3 data transmission and integration the dynamic responses of the sft and the vehicle at time t δt can be calculated by the newmark β method then analyze the z displacement of the element at the vehicle position by the hermite interpolation function step 4 post processing repeat steps 2 and 3 using the latest available values until the spring mass vehicle model drives away from the sft then collect the maximum response data from the results in the procedure the coupling effect between the sft and the vehicle is considered through the contact force the fluid force is related to the acceleration and velocity of the sft the external nodal loads should be updated at each increment moment and then calculations are continued the procedure realizes the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction during the integration 3 numerical example 3 1 basic parameters of the sft so far there is no existing sft project anywhere in the world so the parameters of the sft are selected from some conceptual design study cases martinelli et al 2011 xiang et al 2017 and are listed in table 1 the total span of the sft is 500 m with four pairs of anchor tethers symmetrically installed each pair of tethers is spaced 100 m apart and has the same geometric and material properties the damping effect of the structure is considered in the model to simplify the calculation process the damping coefficient of the concrete structure is equivalent to a typical value of 0 05 in reality the traffic volume is determined by the numbers of the traffic lanes and the vehicle type shi et al 2008 used the aashto hs20 44 truck in the vehicle bridge coupled analysis the total weight of the truck is about 30 tons in the conceptual design of the sft for funka bay maeda et al 1994 the sft has four traffic lanes for moving vehicles so the most unfavorable condition four full heavy trucks moving in one direction is discussed in the research the gravity of trucks is taken as the initial excitation on the sft specific values of the truck parameters are listed in table 2 3 2 modal parameters analysis the vibration characteristics of the sft such as natural frequencies and corresponding vibration mode can be obtained through modal analysis fig 7 gives the first eight mode shapes obtained by the fem which are compared with the shape functions used in the msm on the whole the mode shapes acquired by the two methods are similar in the fem the sft is supported by discrete elastic springs affected by the support stiffness a few differences exist in the local positions sato et al 2008 once pointed out that the differences are related to the stiffness of discrete elastic support although the equivalent support stiffness satisfies eq 3 the differences are quite insignificant also the differences become less obvious as the modal order number increases table 3 lists the first eight natural frequencies of the sft according to eq 11 the first mode natural frequency obtained by the msm is 0 3290 hz it is very close to the result of the fem and the difference between these two results is only 0 0022 hz 0 75 differing from the characteristic of mode shape the natural frequency difference increases as the modal order number increases in the 8th order mode the natural frequency relative difference of the msm and the fem is about 0 4852 hz 13 94 the results show that the low order frequencies of these two models have good agreement but there are still some differences in the high order frequency in other words the vibration characteristics of the sft can be reflected by the continuous elastic foundation boundary and the discrete elastic supports boundary but this assumption will cause certain error in structural high order vibration analysis and should be further considered 3 3 convergence analysis of the numerical simulation the feasibility of the msm also depends on the number of vibration modes considered in the analysis lower modes cannot reflect the vibration characteristics of the structure but higher modes tend to be less reliable in the vibration due to characteristics such as the long span significant flexibility and low damping sfts are always regarded as low frequency vibration structures therefore zhang et al 2016 only considered the first vibration mode of the sft to simplify the kinetic equations they believe the first vibration mode makes a great contribution to the structure vibration however some researchers indicate that a higher vibration mode could be recognized when the sft suffers from external loads tariverdilo et al 2011 xiang et al 2017 therefore the convergence analysis for the sft is carried out based on the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction fig 8 discusses the vertical displacements of the sft corresponding to the vehicle moving to the 50 m 150 m and 250 m points of the sft the result values obtained by the msm with the first six modes and the first eight modes are almost the same which are close to the results acquired by the fem table 4 gives the extreme values of vertical displacement at different time intervals the results of the msm with different numbers of vibration modes are compared with that of the fem the differences between the first six modes and the first eight modes are already quite small in addition the deviations are maintained at a low level which means both ways can give reasonable results it is worth noting that only considering the first vibration mode will neglect the negative direction displacements of the sft and lose much accuracy therefore the first six modes of the sft are adopted in the analysis to ensure computational efficiency and reasonable results 4 results and analysis 4 1 vertical displacement and bending moment structural displacement is the direct index reflecting structural vibration here fig 9 gives the envelopes of vertical displacements calculated by the msm and the fem the first six modes of the sft are considered in the msm and the velocity of the current and the vehicle are 0 2 m s and 90 km h respectively the maximum and the minimum vertical displacements of each position are recorded when the moving vehicle runs from left to right on the sft to evaluate the dynamic displacement responses the vertical displacements of the sft subjected to the same magnitude of static load are also calculated based on the discrete elastic supports beam model as shown in fig 9 the envelope curve of the static load is much smoother than that of the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction results gained from the msm and the fem have positive and negative displacement values which results from the high vibration modes and the oscillation will make the tethers operate in alternating stress conditions thus the tether fatigue problem should be considered in the sft design the dynamic vertical displacement responses are always larger than the static displacement responses the envelope curve of considering the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction exceeds that of static load this is called the dynamic amplification phenomenon and can also be found in the vehicle bridge coupled analysis the bending moments of the structure can also be obtained by eq 19 as shown in fig 10 according to the bernoulli euler beam principle the positive bending moment will cause the lower parts of the section to be in the tension state both positive and negative bending moments are acquired in the calculation the section of the sft suffers alternate bending moment load and alternate stress appears under such circumstances some tiny crack damage will easily occur decreasing the material strength and leading to leaks meantime the formation of cracks will be accelerated by hydraulic pressure in addition the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction amplifies the bending moment load and stress the sft operation environment is even worse than people think 4 2 impact factor to quantify the influence of fluid vehicle tunnel interaction on the sft the impact factor is defined as eq 30 30 i m p a c t f a c t o r r max r s t a 1 where r max and r sta are the absolute maximum responses under the action of dynamic and static loads respectively the impact factor can be regarded as a safety factor for the structure design fig 11 shows the impact factor of vertical displacement along the x axis although the results gained by the two methods show little difference the change laws of their results are almost the same take the results obtained by the msm as an example the impact factors of the tether supports such as the locations at 100 m 200 m 300 m and 400 m are 0 22 0 23 0 25 and 0 24 respectively they are larger than the impact factor of the mid point and the value of the mid point is only 0 15 this shows that the elastic support constraint does not reduce the impact factor when taking account of the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction therefore the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction has a bigger effect on the segments of the sft close to discrete constraint points than on the middle section fig 12 shows the impact factor of the bending moment along the x axis compared with the vertical displacement results the bending moment impact factors show much higher order features excited by the driving effect due to the effects of structural stiffness and high order modes the bending moment values change more drastically than that of the structure subjected to static load the contribution of high order modes is amplified by the structural stiffness in the dynamic bending moment calculation take the results gained from the msm as an example the impact factors of every mid point such as the locations at 50 m 150 m 250 m 350 m and 450 m are 0 28 0 20 0 05 0 16 and 0 17 respectively the values of these characteristic locations are smaller than those of the segments close to the discrete tether support points such as 100 m 200 m 300 m and 400 m from this perspective the segments of the sft close to the discrete tether support points are more sensitive to the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction 5 influence factor study 5 1 effect of the current velocity ocean current is a seasonal directed movement of seawater generated by breaking waves wind temperature and salinity differences ocean depth shoreline configurations and interactions with other currents influence a current s direction and strength to avoid the effects of waves and navigation activities the sft is always set in about 30 m below the water surface so the speed of the underwater current is very gentle and a uniform constant flow is assumed during the theoretical analysis model from eq 8 the lift force caused by vortex shedding is related to the current velocity so the effect of ocean current velocity ranging from 0 m s to 0 3 m s is analyzed in this work fig 13 shows the impact of vertical displacement at the mid point with different current velocities with increased vehicle velocity the impact factors are not stable but are mainly in a fluctuating growth as eq 8 showed the sft is in a hydrostatic pressure environment when the current velocity v c equals 0 0 m s the curve shows that the distance between the adjacent peaks increases gradually and the phenomenon is magnified by increasing the current velocity besides the impact factor contour map in fig 13 also shows that the contour lines are relatively dense when the current velocity is high when the current velocity increases to 0 3 m s the fluctuation range of the impact factor have reached around 20 it is almost twice the effect caused by vehicle velocity v 120 km h in the hydrostatic pressure environment the results mean that the vortex lift force induced by the ocean current has been relatively large and affects the dynamic behavior of the sft in other words cars and trains driving in the sft are affected by the ocean current environment the impact factors of the bending moment at the mid point with different current velocities are shown in fig 14 at the same current velocity the impact factor of the bending moment grows with increasing vehicle velocity but there is no obvious periodic change characteristic in the law of growth apparently it is caused by the moving vehicle effect according to the contour map in fig 14 there is a noticeable fluctuation in the impact factor curve when the current velocity approaches 0 3 m s the amplitude of fluctuation reaches 9 at the middle stage of vehicle velocity such as around 90 km h the fluctuation amplitude is enlarged by the ocean current effect however in contrast to the vertical displacement results the influence of this effect is much smaller from eq 19 the bending moment is related to both the high order modes and the structural stiffness 5 2 effect of the buoyancy weight ratio bwr the buoyancy weight ratio bwr is defined as the ratio of tunnel buoyancy to the whole tunnel weight selecting an appropriate bwr value is a significant step in the design of a sft lu et al 2011 in fact the bwr determines the tension force of the tether section and influences the stability of the sft so it is an important issue to determine the effect of the bwr under fluid vehicle tunnel interaction in the present research the calculation is carried out with the bwr varying in the range of 1 2 1 8 changes in the bwr originate from the change in the mass m of the sft tube fig 15 gives the impact of vertical displacement at the mid point with different bwrs the curve of the impact factor oscillates but remains between 0 1 and 0 2 however the vehicle velocities at the peaks and troughs lag significantly behind as the bwr grows according to eq 11 the natural frequency of the structure increases with increases in the bwr the impact factor peak is excited by faster vehicle velocity when the current velocity and the vehicle weight are certain in addition there are some parallel lines on the impact factor contour map this means that the vehicle velocity corresponding to the impact factor peak grows as the bwr increases to understand the effects of the bwr on the impact factor of the bending moment fig 16 illustrates the results at different bwrs the impact factor curves at different bwrs have similar growth trends but the fluctuation amplitudes of the impact factors are a little different at various bwrs the bwr impact factor at 1 5 is about 5 when the vehicle velocity approaches 80 km h the bwr impact factor around 1 5 is smaller than that of the segments close to the lower and higher bwr region in other words a bwr that is either too large or too small is not suitable for a sft subjected to fluid vehicle tunnel interaction the phenomenon of the lagging curve peak also occurs in the bending moment impact factor curve thus the proper bwr around 1 5 adjusted by balancing weights and materials can help the inside state of the structure 5 3 effect of the inclined angle of the tether the tether cross section material and spatial layout will determine the tether stiffness and influence the dynamic behavior of the sft according to eqs 1 and 2 the inclined angle of the tether is one of the design parameters which will directly affect the tether stiffness in the present research inclined angles in the range of 30 to 75 are carried out with the length of the tethers constant fig 17 gives the impact of vertical displacement at the mid point with different inclined angles fig 17 shows that the effects of the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction are reduced with increases in the inclined angle of the tether the impact factor of the vertical displacement is 15 3 at inclined angle α 75 which is almost half of the impact factor at inclined angle α 30 this indicates that improving vertical stiffness is an efficient way to reduce the impact factor of vertical displacement in addition the impact factor peaks are distributed along the diagonal direction on the contour map the tether stiffness is enhanced by increasing the inclined angle and improves the natural frequency of the structure in eq 11 increased vehicle velocity will excite higher impact factors at a low inclined tether angle fig 18 shows that the impact factor of the bending moment decreases with increases in the inclined angle of the tether take a vehicle velocity of 120 km h as an example the impact factor of the bending moment drops from 41 9 to 7 82 as the inclined angle increases from 30 to 75 however the decline rate is higher in the small inclined angle region than in the large inclined angle region from the contour map shown in fig 18 in other words increasing the inclined angle of the tether can provide only limited improvement in the bending moment impact factor whereas because of the driving effect the impact factor will show a dramatic fluctuation with increases in vehicle speed accordingly a high moving vehicle velocity is not beneficial to a sft subjected to fluid vehicle tunnel interaction so a proper inclined angle and reasonable vehicle passing velocity should be set for the sft 6 conclusion this paper proposes a theoretical analysis model for analyzing the dynamic response of the sft due to fluid vehicle tunnel interaction the msm is provided to solve the governing equations while the fem is developed to compare and evaluate the results the effects of some key parameters such as the current velocity the bwr and the inclined angles of the tether are discussed to provide a reference for preliminary structure design the following conclusions can be drawn from this research 1 the results of the msm and the fem show reasonable agreement in solving the sft suffering the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction in this paper the dynamic responses of the sft at different times the first eight mode shapes and natural frequencies are respectively compared and analyzed the results of the msm considering the first six modes have reasonable agreement with the fem results 2 the vertical displacement and the bending moment of the sft are amplified under the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction and the vertical displacement and the bending moment have opposite values along the longitudinal direction of the sft the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction has a bigger effect on the segments close to discrete tether supports than segments near the middle section those characteristics should be considered to avoid component fatigue and cracks on the primary stage 3 the vertical displacement impact factor increases as the current velocity increases compared with the vertical displacement results the influence of the current velocity on the bending moment is affected by both the structural stiffness and the high order modes 4 the bwr mainly affects the natural frequency of the sft and causes the impact factor curve peak lagging phenomenon in the numerical results the structure with a bwr around 1 5 adjusted by balancing weights and materials has a relatively small bending moment impact factor and reaches a better inside state 5 the inclined angle of the tether affects the dynamic response of the sft by changing the support stiffness the larger inclined angle will provide stronger vertical stiffness and restrain the impact factor of the vertical displacement and the bending moment compared with the current velocity and the bwr the effect of the inclined angle on the bending moment impact factor is more drastic acknowledgments this work was supported by

23124,monitoring of operational efficiency in ship fleets is a complex maritime problem which requires an analytical approach in order to provide satisfactory solutions since the problem involves high dimensional data this paper develops tree based modelling on bagging random forest and bootstrap approach to analyse the ship performance under operational condition to demonstrate the proposed model the publicly accessible dataset for 254 trips derived from a particular designed acquisition system on board ferry ship is utilised in operational variable analysis on speed through water and fuel consumption the bootstrap approach yields more accurate prediction rate than random forest and bagging the proposed model is superior to the others such as ann and gp applications in ship performance monitoring consequently the tree based model adopting bagging random forest and boosting environment is capable of increasing the predictive performance during monitoring of ship performance in maritime industry beside its theoretical insight the findings of the paper contribute ship management companies to monitor ship operational performance keywords ship performance monitoring statistical learning operation management maritime industry 1 motivation connecting ships ports and people the focused theme of the world maritime day 2017 has been promoting sustainable maritime transportation system it points out strengthening the cooperation between maritime stakeholders the authorities have expected to improve service quality of the ship fleets ports and terminals which require an interdisciplinary approach i e transportation engineering operation research etc supported with advanced data analytics herein ongoing efforts of maritime executives towards improving the operational efficiency at sea is recently noted the motivations behind the performance management on board ships have been categorized into three economical aspects regulatory compliance and customer expectations armstrong and banks 2015 in principle the economics ultimately depends on increasing the profit margin via maximizing revenue and minimising operational cost mak et al 2014 furthermore fuel costs constitutes about 20 50 operational cost of ships thus fuel efficiency is one of the most important features to remain competitive eide et al 2011 hasselaar 2011 the second one implies the compliance with the international regulatory requirements perera 2016 the international maritime organization imo has implemented strict regulations which is aimed to improve ship operational efficiency the maritime environment protection committee mepc for instance has introduced energy efficiency design index eedi to regulate all new ship design imo 2012a c in this context ship energy efficiency management plan seemp is required for all ships to enhance operational energy efficiency at sea imo 2009a b 2012b the plan provides operational strategies and development in ship management in particular ship operational performance evaluation and transportation productivity analysis another driving segment is customer requirements for instance concerns about the climate change global warming and energy efficiency have encouraged ship management companies as well as ship owners to improve ship operational efficiency armstrong and banks 2015 moreover the leading charterers of tanker industry require utmost care and practice during inspection vetting and screening with respect to the ship energy efficiency for instance the ocimf oil companies international marine forum requires sire ship inspection report programme inspections or more popularly known as vetting inspections in tanker industry in the inspection the performance of ship energy efficiency instruments are also checked along with safety and environmental protection concerns there is close nexus among ship design performance evaluation operation regulations management and competitiveness where fuel consumption has great influences coraddu et al 2015 addressed operational efficiency of ship as the key aspect to achieve this purpose the ship operational performance monitoring has been considered as one of the greatest solutions ando 2011 perera and mo 2016 orihara and tsujimoto 2017 the monitoring of ship operational efficiency can provide practical information through operational efficiency such as deviation among expected and actual efficiency coraddu et al 2015 therefore it can be used as a fault detection technological interventions charter party analysis and vessel benchmarking petersen et al 2012 even if the ship operational performance monitoring has great potential to enhance and transform discussed aspect in shipping industry there are still many concerns that required to be improved hasselaar 2011 aldous et al 2015 soner and celik 2017 first the problems with the quality of ship operational data is one of the main issue at this point considering the fact that ship operational performance is depend on many factors such as ship condition weather condition loading condition etc it is a very critical point to take into consideration the all relevant factors however most of the ships in service are not equipped with the automatic data acquisition system indeed noon reports are widely used for ship operational performance monitoring aldous et al 2015 unfortunately noon reports have several limitations especially when using for monitoring ship operational performance the frequency of recording required to human intervention and provide restricted number of features are some of them erto et all 2015 therefore automatic data acquisition systems and or sensor technologies are required to be detailed investigation of the ship operational performance monitoring statistical models which requires for the aim of extracting hidden information from the available dataset is another concern the main intentions of a utilising the statistical learning methods are prediction and interpretation james et al 2013 in some cases inference is the main purpose of analysis in order to reveals relationship between the response and each predictor prediction on the other hand is aimed to predicting the response with high accuracy however there are a small number of research that focused on this topic with regard to ship operational performance monitoring moreover it is argued in shipping literature there are urgent need for further research into ship operational performance monitoring petersen and winther 2012 aldous 2016 wang et all 2017 particularly advanced statistical model with high accuracy rate is desirable despite respective studies have attempted to fill the mentioned gap they have used the multiple linear regression to predicting the fuel consumption with a limited numbers of variables i e ship average speed sailed distance wind speed displacement bocchetti et all 2013 erto et all 2015 comparing to multiple linear regression non parametric models recently preferred approaches by practitioners are capable of the dealing with complex and highly non linear data such as ship operational data james et al 2013 studies through monitoring of ship operational performance have focused on ship emissions rather than systematic approaches however the most of ship owners and management companies have been seeking systematic approaches which enable to enhance overall efficiency although there have been various researches undertaken on ship operational performance bocchetti et all 2013 erto et all 2015 a particular approach whose aim is to employ advanced statistical model with high accuracy rate has yet to introduce to remedy this gap the paper aims to propose tree based approach utilising bagging random forest and boosting models they are capable of increasing the predictive performance moreover the paper analyses high quality dataset which has been gathered from the automatic data acquisition systems the model utilised in the paper presents comprehensive ship performance analyses in accordance with operational and technical indicators in this context the paper is organised as follows section 1 gives motivation and basic literature reviewing section 2 expresses data acquisition section 3 introduces model utilised in the paper section 4 discusses findings section 5 concludes paper 2 literature review the current methods in ship performance monitoring allow greater scope for researchers in conjunction with utilization purpose of results theoretical models are capable of providing practical results in return for simplification of the real ship operational environments leifsson et al 2008 even if the theoretical models are based on semi empirical relations assumptions and uncertainties they have been used in ship design to size main engines and determine propeller and hull dimension characteristics aas hansen 2010 hasselaar 2011 aldous et al 2015 statistical models on the other hand are broadly used for the prediction fuel consumption ship speed i e and inference purposes what is the relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables identifying the few important features etc schorsch and sutherland 1978 pedersen and larsen 2009 petersen et al 2012 mak et al 2014 sasa et al 2015 in recent decades sensor technologies and data acquisition systems enable to obtain high quality ship operational data lepore et al 2017 therefore particular statistical models have been performed on ship operational performance soner and celik 2017 in this context linear regression multiple linear regression non linear regression and artificial neural network ann i e is implemented leifsson et al 2008 aas hansen 2010 hasselaar 2011 sasa et al 2015 petersen et al 2012a b coraddu et al 2015 however it is still argued in shipping literature there are huge gap in ship operational performance monitoring petersen and winther 2012 aldous 2016 wang et all 2017 particularly advanced statistical model with high accuracy rate is desirable therefore decision tree based models should be considered for this perspective soner and celik 2017 the decision tree may provide particular advantages when ship operational performance is considered the decision tree is as a non parametric model which implies that there are no assumptions about the space distribution and the classifier structure song and ying 2015 the decision tree can be used on situation where the parameters are non linear related such as ship operational data it guarantees to remove redundant and irrelevant variables variable selection to improve the prediction accuracy ramezankhani et all 2016 apart from the utilised statistical models in shipping literature the decision tree does not require much fine tuning of its hyper parameters random forest ahmad et all 2017 therefore the model has been used in other industries such as psychiatry song and ying 2015 health ramezankhani et all 2016 and energy consumption ahmad et all 2017 to overcome similar problems to remedy aforementioned gaps this study adopts tree based models to evaluate ship operational performance by considering the industrial expectation technological developments regulatory requirements and literature shortages 3 data ship operational efficiency studies are based on dataset which are broadly obtained from ship s noon reports however the technological developments are allowed to use automatic data acquisition systems on board ships for obtaining high frequency ship operational data taking advantage of the automatic data acquisition systems on board ship substantially improve the data quality when comparing with the noon report based dataset 90 decrease in the data uncertainty level aldous et al 2015 thus the study analyses the high quality dataset obtained from automatic data acquisition systems the dataset are obtained by petersen et al 2012a and petersen et al 2012b the data acquisition system was installed in a ferry ship which was operated two or three trips per a day each trip took almost 2 h it covered almost two months from february 16th 2010 to april 12th 2010 the obtained dataset included 254 trips that conducted within the timeline before analysing ship operational dataset it was arranged into 3 min window size totally 9001 windows capturing the changes in the variables feature extraction processes were also conducted to obtain the variables mean variance and derivative petersen et al 2012a ship operational performance is not only related with the ship conditions i e hull and machinery but also additional features such as weather conditions and loading conditions orihara and tsujimoto 2017 a large number of features should be taking into account for developing reliable ship operational performance therefore followed signals were located by the system port and starboard propeller pitch port and starboard rudder angle port and starboard level measurements fuel density fuel temperature fuel volume rate trim angle longitude latitude speed through water speed over ground true heading wind speed and wind angle petersen et al 2012b fig 1 fig 2 and fig 3 are presented to provide some insight about the utilised dataset fig 1 indicates the ship speed versus trip and colour implies the consumed fuel in each data point as shown in fig 1 speed variation is very limited thus ship speed measurements which are below 15 knots might be considered as outliers when the ship reached high speed fuel consumption also increases but there are some data points that implies otherwise trip about the 100 fig 2 presents the mean speed for each trip the mean speed is fluctuating from 16 knots to 20 knots fig 3 on the other hand illustrates consumed fuel for each trip it can be noticed alignment in the figure it s because similar weather conditions effects on the ship operations thus monitoring of ship operational performance is required to deal with aforementioned limitation the correlation between each feature is presented in fig 4 to demonstrate the interrelation between the ship operational data 4 tree based models tree based models are applicable to classification and regression problems breiman 1984 dietterich 2000 however this study devoted only regression problems a regression tree is mainly based on two main steps the first one is to predictor space is required to divide distinct and non overlapping regions the second one predictions are formed from the mean output values of the training observations falling into each region in principle a region could have any shape the objective is to find boxes in order to minimize the residual sum of square rss given by equation 4 1 4 1 r s s j 1 j i r j y i y ˆ r j 2 where i 1 2 n and j 1 2 p n represent the number of data points p denotes the number of variables y i represent the response variable for the i t h observation y ˆ r j is the mean response for the training observations within the j t h region james et al 2013 recursive binary splitting is performed to determine the splitting points and splitting variables maindonald and braun 2006 lepore et al 2017 initially predictor x j and the cut point s are selected so that splitting the predictor space into the regions x x j s and x x j s minimize the rss in detail for any j and s the pair of half planes are defined 4 2 r 1 j s x x j s a n d r 2 j s x x j s and the value of j and s should minimize the equation 4 3 i x i r 1 j s y i y ˆ r 1 2 i x i r 2 j s y i y ˆ r 2 2 where y ˆ r 1 and y ˆ r 2 is the mean response for the training observations in r 1 j s and r 2 j s respectively james et al 2013 this process continues successively until some stopping criterion is reached james et al 2013 for the study the process continues until no region contains more than five observations even if this process provides high prediction accuracy on the training set a tree might over fit the data therefore a better strategy is to grow a very large tree t 0 and then prune it back to obtain a subtree james et al 2013 for each value of α there corresponds a subtree t t 0 such that 4 4 m 1 t i x i r m y i y ˆ r m 2 α t is as small as possible james et al 2013 here t represents the number of the terminal nodes of the tree t r m is the subset of predictor space corresponding to the m t h terminal node and y ˆ r m is the predicted response associated with r m james et al 2013 the tuning parameter α manages the subtree s complexity and its fit to the training data estimation of α can be achieved by tenfold cross validation final tree is t a ˆ friedman et al 2001 4 1 bagging random forest and boosting despite its considerable advantages decision trees suffer from high variance averaging a set of observations reduces variance to illustrate calculating f ˆ 1 x f ˆ 2 x f ˆ b x with utilising b separate training sets and average them to obtain a single low variance statistical learning model given by 4 5 f ˆ avg x 1 b b 1 b f ˆ b x however this is not applicable since accessing the multiple training sets is not always possible james et al 2013 in such case bootstrap enables to take repeated samples from the single training data set in this approach b different bootstrapped training data sets are generated james et al 2013 after that method can be trained on the b t h bootstrapped training set in order to get f ˆ b x and finally average all the predictions to obtain 4 6 f ˆ bag x 1 b b 1 b f ˆ b x the bagging takes advance of the bootstrap to generate many datasets from the original dataset the random forest also employs the bootstrap apart from that restricted random predictors i e p are considered to use at each split for décor relating the trees in the random forest james et al 2013 the boosting method on the other hand utilizes a modified version of the original dataset to build each tree as demonstrated in equation 4 7 james et al 2013 4 7 f ˆ x b 1 b λ f ˆ b x shrinkage parameter λ which is also called the learning rate slows the learning process thus more shaped trees could be obtained by boosting in this study shrinkage parameter λ and number of tress are determined by cross validation since the slow learner statistical approaches tend to perform well the boosting is expected to perform better when comparing to bagging and random forest james et al 2013 4 2 performance measures dataset are divided into two size randomly as a train dataset and test dataset while the training dataset consists of 80 of the total data the rest is treated as a test dataset in this study fuel consumption and speed through water are considered as the model response while the other variables are assumed as the input variables a root mean square error rmse is adopted as a performance measure to direct comparison of the similar study with the petersen et al 2012a and petersen et al 2012b the rmse can be calculated by using equation 3 2 3 2 r m s e i 1 n y i f ˆ x i 2 n where y i denotes the ith observation of the variable f ˆ x i gives prediction that f ˆ states for the ith observation and n is the number of samples moreover mean decrease accuracy incmse and mean decrease gini incnodepurity are used in the models to evaluate variables importance incmse is constructed to evaluate recording prediction and comparing it with the unpermitted test set prediction of the variable normalised by the standard error incnodepurity on the other hand is used to measure quality of a split for every variable node of a tree by means of the gini index a higher incmse and incnodepurity value represents a higher variable importance kuhn et al 2008 han et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 with both high values of incmse and incnodepurity the variable is considered to have high importance 5 results and discussion in this study the tree based models have been performed on the high frequency ship operational data to monitor ship operational efficiency in addition to the high predictive accuracy utilised models also reveal the most important variables in the ship operational efficiency to demonstrate performance of the bagging random forest and bootstrap on the ship operational performance monitoring the results of models have been compared to each other and with the similar studies thus fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 illustrate the variable importance of the bagging random forest and bootstrap for the speed through water respectively according to the bagging model starboard pitch trim headwind starboard rudder draft are the most critical variables with respect to the incmse in figs 6 and 7 according to incnodepurity the port and starboard pitch and rudder are the most important variables according to fig 6 headwind trim port and starboard pitch are of paramount in fig 7 on the other hands starboard and port pitch as well as trim have significant effect on ship operational performance particularly ship trim poses great challenges monitoring of ship operational performance the impact of trim optimisation plays vital role on reducing fuel consumption since it allows to reduce the resistance of sea water and increase the total efficiency likewise starboard and port pitches have considerable impacts on fuel consumption ship main engine is started with blade pitch set to zero this may cause to increase fuel consumption and to reduce the load on various engine bearings and shafting in case the vessel is equipped with controllable pitch control in addition the predicted and actual speed through water values are presented in fig 8 according to fig 8 bootstrap performed much better results when comparing to the other two models the rmse for three models are presented in table 1 according to the findings the bootstrap provides more accurate prediction rate than the bagging and the random forest the models performance is comparable with petersen et al 2012a and petersen et al 2012b because the same dataset is also utilised in these studies petersen et al 2012a report ann related rmse for ship speed is 0 32 knots and 41 1 l h for fuel consumption gp related rmse for ship speed is 0 63 knots and 44 2 l h for fuel consumption in addition petersen et al 2012b found respective rmse for ship speed is 0 38 knots and 47 2 l h for fuel consumption as a result tree based models provide satisfying prediction accuracy rate when compare with the ann instantaneous ann and gp 6 conclusion there are increasing growth for ship management companies to optimise ship operational performance in particular with the aim of saving fuel yu et al 2017 in recent decades optimisation modelling and simulation analysis have gained enormous momentum in maritime industry to monitor ship operational performance gracia et al 2017 thun et al 2017 this paper aims at presenting statistical modelling that utilising tree based models bagging random forest and bootstrap to evaluate operational performance of ship the tree based modelling has considerable superiority since the model provides high accuracy and ease of interpretation the findings of the paper can be utilised by maritime professionals during decision making of voyage planning fuel saving operational cost saving for instance the fuel cost is by far the largest portion of the operating cost and can be reduced by considering identical variables likewise trim optimisation may assist minimising ship operational cost and fuel consumption the paper might be extended to other maritime logistics and systems in this stage data acquisition task is achieved in the research oriented studies while the great challenges are still available on board existing ships on the other hand the utilization of the statistical analysis to decide and apply the real time performance improvement actions is under development the further studies on data acquisition and control actions can be conducted acknowledgement this article is produced from a phd thesis research entitled

moreover it is argued in shipping literature there are urgent need for further research into ship operational performance monitoring petersen and winther 2012 aldous 2016 wang et all 2017 particularly advanced statistical model with high accuracy rate is desirable despite respective studies have attempted to fill the mentioned gap they have used the multiple linear regression to predicting the fuel consumption with a limited numbers of variables i e ship average speed sailed distance wind speed displacement bocchetti et all 2013 erto et all 2015 comparing to multiple linear regression non parametric models recently preferred approaches by practitioners are capable of the dealing with complex and highly non linear data such as ship operational data james et al 2013 studies through monitoring of ship operational performance have focused on ship emissions rather than systematic approaches however the most of ship owners and management companies have been seeking systematic approaches which enable to enhance overall efficiency although there have been various researches undertaken on ship operational performance bocchetti et all 2013 erto et all 2015 a particular approach whose aim is to employ advanced statistical model with high accuracy rate has yet to introduce to remedy this gap the paper aims to propose tree based approach utilising bagging random forest and boosting models they are capable of increasing the predictive performance moreover the paper analyses high quality dataset which has been gathered from the automatic data acquisition systems the model utilised in the paper presents comprehensive ship performance analyses in accordance with operational and technical indicators in this context the paper is organised as follows section 1 gives motivation and basic literature reviewing section 2 expresses data acquisition section 3 introduces model utilised in the paper section 4 discusses findings section 5 concludes paper 2 literature review the current methods in ship performance monitoring allow greater scope for researchers in conjunction with utilization purpose of results theoretical models are capable of providing practical results in return for simplification of the real ship operational environments leifsson et al 2008 even if the theoretical models are based on semi empirical relations assumptions and uncertainties they have been used in ship design to size main engines and determine propeller and hull dimension characteristics aas hansen 2010 hasselaar 2011 aldous et al 2015 statistical models on the other hand are broadly used for the prediction fuel consumption ship speed i e and inference purposes what is the relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables identifying the few important features etc schorsch and sutherland 1978 pedersen and larsen 2009 petersen et al 2012 mak et al 2014 sasa et al 2015 in recent decades sensor technologies and data acquisition systems enable to obtain high quality ship operational data lepore et al 2017 therefore particular statistical models have been performed on ship operational performance soner and celik 2017 in this context linear regression multiple linear regression non linear regression and artificial neural network ann i e is implemented leifsson et al 2008 aas hansen 2010 hasselaar 2011 sasa et al 2015 petersen et al 2012a b coraddu et al 2015 however it is still argued in shipping literature there are huge gap in ship operational performance monitoring petersen and winther 2012 aldous 2016 wang et all 2017 particularly advanced statistical model with high accuracy rate is desirable therefore decision tree based models should be considered for this perspective soner and celik 2017 the decision tree may provide particular advantages when ship operational performance is considered the decision tree is as a non parametric model which implies that there are no assumptions about the space distribution and the classifier structure song and ying 2015 the decision tree can be used on situation where the parameters are non linear related such as ship operational data it guarantees to remove redundant and irrelevant variables variable selection to improve the prediction accuracy ramezankhani et all 2016 apart from the utilised statistical models in shipping literature the decision tree does not require much fine tuning of its hyper parameters random forest ahmad et all 2017 therefore the model has been used in other industries such as psychiatry song and ying 2015 health ramezankhani et all 2016 and energy consumption ahmad et all 2017 to overcome similar problems to remedy aforementioned gaps this study adopts tree based models to evaluate ship operational performance by considering the industrial expectation technological developments regulatory requirements and literature shortages 3 data ship operational efficiency studies are based on dataset which are broadly obtained from ship s noon reports however the technological developments are allowed to use automatic data acquisition systems on board ships for obtaining high frequency ship operational data taking advantage of the automatic data acquisition systems on board ship substantially improve the data quality when comparing with the noon report based dataset 90 decrease in the data uncertainty level aldous et al 2015 thus the study analyses the high quality dataset obtained from automatic data acquisition systems the dataset are obtained by petersen et al 2012a and petersen et al 2012b the data acquisition system was installed in a ferry ship which was operated two or three trips per a day each trip took almost 2 h it covered almost two months from february 16th 2010 to april 12th 2010 the obtained dataset included 254 trips that conducted within the timeline before analysing ship operational dataset it was arranged into 3 min window size totally 9001 windows capturing the changes in the variables feature extraction processes were also conducted to obtain the variables mean variance and derivative petersen et al 2012a ship operational performance is not only related with the ship conditions i e hull and machinery but also additional features such as weather conditions and loading conditions orihara and tsujimoto 2017 a large number of features should be taking into account for developing reliable ship operational performance therefore followed signals were located by the system port and starboard propeller pitch port and starboard rudder angle port and starboard level measurements fuel density fuel temperature fuel volume rate trim angle longitude latitude speed through water speed over ground true heading wind speed and wind angle petersen et al 2012b fig 1 fig 2 and fig 3 are presented to provide some insight about the utilised dataset fig 1 indicates the ship speed versus trip and colour implies the consumed fuel in each data point as shown in fig 1 speed variation is very limited thus ship speed measurements which are below 15 knots might be considered as outliers when the ship reached high speed fuel consumption also increases but there are some data points that implies otherwise trip about the 100 fig 2 presents the mean speed for each trip the mean speed is fluctuating from 16 knots to 20 knots fig 3 on the other hand illustrates consumed fuel for each trip it can be noticed alignment in the figure it s because similar weather conditions effects on the ship operations thus monitoring of ship operational performance is required to deal with aforementioned limitation the correlation between each feature is presented in fig 4 to demonstrate the interrelation between the ship operational data 4 tree based models tree based models are applicable to classification and regression problems breiman 1984 dietterich 2000 however this study devoted only regression problems a regression tree is mainly based on two main steps the first one is to predictor space is required to divide distinct and non overlapping regions the second one predictions are formed from the mean output values of the training observations falling into each region in principle a region could have any shape the objective is to find boxes in order to minimize the residual sum of square rss given by equation 4 1 4 1 r s s j 1 j i r j y i y ˆ r j 2 where i 1 2 n and j 1 2 p n represent the number of data points p denotes the number of variables y i represent the response variable for the i t h observation y ˆ r j is the mean response for the training observations within the j t h region james et al 2013 recursive binary splitting is performed to determine the splitting points and splitting variables maindonald and braun 2006 lepore et al 2017 initially predictor x j and the cut point s are selected so that splitting the predictor space into the regions x x j s and x x j s minimize the rss in detail for any j and s the pair of half planes are defined 4 2 r 1 j s x x j s a n d r 2 j s x x j s and the value of j and s should minimize the equation 4 3 i x i r 1 j s y i y ˆ r 1 2 i x i r 2 j s y i y ˆ r 2 2 where y ˆ r 1 and y ˆ r 2 is the mean response for the training observations in r 1 j s and r 2 j s respectively james et al 2013 this process continues successively until some stopping criterion is reached james et al 2013 for the study the process continues until no region contains more than five observations even if this process provides high prediction accuracy on the training set a tree might over fit the data therefore a better strategy is to grow a very large tree t 0 and then prune it back to obtain a subtree james et al 2013 for each value of α there corresponds a subtree t t 0 such that 4 4 m 1 t i x i r m y i y ˆ r m 2 α t is as small as possible james et al 2013 here t represents the number of the terminal nodes of the tree t r m is the subset of predictor space corresponding to the m t h terminal node and y ˆ r m is the predicted response associated with r m james et al 2013 the tuning parameter α manages the subtree s complexity and its fit to the training data estimation of α can be achieved by tenfold cross validation final tree is t a ˆ friedman et al 2001 4 1 bagging random forest and boosting despite its considerable advantages decision trees suffer from high variance averaging a set of observations reduces variance to illustrate calculating f ˆ 1 x f ˆ 2 x f ˆ b x with utilising b separate training sets and average them to obtain a single low variance statistical learning model given by 4 5 f ˆ avg x 1 b b 1 b f ˆ b x however this is not applicable since accessing the multiple training sets is not always possible james et al 2013 in such case bootstrap enables to take repeated samples from the single training data set in this approach b different bootstrapped training data sets are generated james et al 2013 after that method can be trained on the b t h bootstrapped training set in order to get f ˆ b x and finally average all the predictions to obtain 4 6 f ˆ bag x 1 b b 1 b f ˆ b x the bagging takes advance of the bootstrap to generate many datasets from the original dataset the random forest also employs the bootstrap apart from that restricted random predictors i e p are considered to use at each split for décor relating the trees in the random forest james et al 2013 the boosting method on the other hand utilizes a modified version of the original dataset to build each tree as demonstrated in equation 4 7 james et al 2013 4 7 f ˆ x b 1 b λ f ˆ b x shrinkage parameter λ which is also called the learning rate slows the learning process thus more shaped trees could be obtained by boosting in this study shrinkage parameter λ and number of tress are determined by cross validation since the slow learner statistical approaches tend to perform well the boosting is expected to perform better when comparing to bagging and random forest james et al 2013 4 2 performance measures dataset are divided into two size randomly as a train dataset and test dataset while the training dataset consists of 80 of the total data the rest is treated as a test dataset in this study fuel consumption and speed through water are considered as the model response while the other variables are assumed as the input variables a root mean square error rmse is adopted as a performance measure to direct comparison of the similar study with the petersen et al 2012a and petersen et al 2012b the rmse can be calculated by using equation 3 2 3 2 r m s e i 1 n y i f ˆ x i 2 n where y i denotes the ith observation of the variable f ˆ x i gives prediction that f ˆ states for the ith observation and n is the number of samples moreover mean decrease accuracy incmse and mean decrease gini incnodepurity are used in the models to evaluate variables importance incmse is constructed to evaluate recording prediction and comparing it with the unpermitted test set prediction of the variable normalised by the standard error incnodepurity on the other hand is used to measure quality of a split for every variable node of a tree by means of the gini index a higher incmse and incnodepurity value represents a higher variable importance kuhn et al 2008 han et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 with both high values of incmse and incnodepurity the variable is considered to have high importance 5 results and discussion in this study the tree based models have been performed on the high frequency ship operational data to monitor ship operational efficiency in addition to the high predictive accuracy utilised models also reveal the most important variables in the ship operational efficiency to demonstrate performance of the bagging random forest and bootstrap on the ship operational performance monitoring the results of models have been compared to each other and with the similar studies thus fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 illustrate the variable importance of the bagging random forest and bootstrap for the speed through water respectively according to the bagging model starboard pitch trim headwind starboard rudder draft are the most critical variables with respect to the incmse in figs 6 and 7 according to incnodepurity the port and starboard pitch and rudder are the most important variables according to fig 6 headwind trim port and starboard pitch are of paramount in fig 7 on the other hands starboard and port pitch as well as trim have significant effect on ship operational performance particularly ship trim poses great challenges monitoring of ship operational performance the impact of trim optimisation plays vital role on reducing fuel consumption since it allows to reduce the resistance of sea water and increase the total efficiency likewise starboard and port pitches have considerable impacts on fuel consumption ship main engine is started with blade pitch set to zero this may cause to increase fuel consumption and to reduce the load on various engine bearings and shafting in case the vessel is equipped with controllable pitch control in addition the predicted and actual speed through water values are presented in fig 8 according to fig 8 bootstrap performed much better results when comparing to the other two models the rmse for three models are presented in table 1 according to the findings the bootstrap provides more accurate prediction rate than the bagging and the random forest the models performance is comparable with petersen et al 2012a and petersen et al 2012b because the same dataset is also utilised in these studies petersen et al 2012a report ann related rmse for ship speed is 0 32 knots and 41 1 l h for fuel consumption gp related rmse for ship speed is 0 63 knots and 44 2 l h for fuel consumption in addition petersen et al 2012b found respective rmse for ship speed is 0 38 knots and 47 2 l h for fuel consumption as a result tree based models provide satisfying prediction accuracy rate when compare with the ann instantaneous ann and gp 6 conclusion there are increasing growth for ship management companies to optimise ship operational performance in particular with the aim of saving fuel yu et al 2017 in recent decades optimisation modelling and simulation analysis have gained enormous momentum in maritime industry to monitor ship operational performance gracia et al 2017 thun et al 2017 this paper aims at presenting statistical modelling that utilising tree based models bagging random forest and bootstrap to evaluate operational performance of ship the tree based modelling has considerable superiority since the model provides high accuracy and ease of interpretation the findings of the paper can be utilised by maritime professionals during decision making of voyage planning fuel saving operational cost saving for instance the fuel cost is by far the largest portion of the operating cost and can be reduced by considering identical variables likewise trim optimisation may assist minimising ship operational cost and fuel consumption the paper might be extended to other maritime logistics and systems in this stage data acquisition task is achieved in the research oriented studies while the great challenges are still available on board existing ships on the other hand the utilization of the statistical analysis to decide and apply the real time performance improvement actions is under development the further studies on data acquisition and control actions can be conducted acknowledgement this article is produced from a phd thesis research entitled
