11905,the growth of emerging and intermediate cities in latin america and the caribbean has been one of the main causes of the gaps found in the access to water quality and sanitation services therefore there is a pressing need to significantly improve water resources management to ensure a sustainable development is achieved in fact geographic information systems and multi criteria decision analysis have proven to be very powerful and effective tools but when the analysis is carried out on the basis of biophysical variables mixed with socioeconomic criteria problems in the spatial discretization of the data appear thus making spatialization and rating of variables difficult the aim of this paper is to compare two types of spatial alternatives in a multi criteria analysis for groundwater resource management in an intermediate city in argentina one made from an hydrological approach 14 watersheds and the other made from a socioeconomic approach 7 ad hoc defined zones three stages of the multicriteria analysis process were analysed in this paper firstly the definition of the alternatives to be prioritized secondly the sub criteria rating process using the direct and inferred rating methods and finally the model results the map of priorities by watershed and by zones was then generated and the results were classified into first second and third priority based on groundwater management needs furthermore a sensibility analysis and comparative synthesis between the use of alternatives considering watersheds and ad hoc zones were carried out while the hydrological watershed has demonstrated its usefulness as a land unit for decision making on water resources issues it can be noted that this should not be a reason to rule out other alternatives for discretizing a territory that may have socioeconomic rather than physical boundaries and that may provide a more appropriate outcome for a decision making process graphical abstract image 1 keywords multi criteria analysis groundwater management watersheds ad hoc zones 1 introduction latin america and the caribbean is the second most urbanized region on the planet with 80 of its population living in cities between 1960 and 2015 the percentage of the region s urban population increased from 44 to 78 this high level of urbanization has promoted the growth of emerging and intermediate cities such as mar del plata head of the general pueyrredon district which have populations of between 100 000 and 2 000 000 inhabitants idb 2016 furthermore this process has been one of the main causes of the gaps found in the access to water quality and sanitation services in argentina and particularly in the city of mar del plata groundwater provides an important source of water supply for rural and urban populations as well as for agriculture but it is increasingly at risk due to contamination barilari et al 2020 oecd 2020 the availability of sufficient quantity and of good quality of groundwater is severely impacted by increased water demand for agricultural irrigation public water supply industrial production and cooling in electricity generation bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 therefore there is a pressing need to significantly improve water resources management so as to sustain liveable conditions on earth for the present and future generations singth et al 2017 in this sense and considering the global framework of the 17 sustainable development goals sdg un 2018 this paper proposal essentially considers the interactions between goal 6 ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all and goal 11 make cities and human settlements inclusive safe resilient and sustainable as mentioned by wood et al 2018 understanding the interactions between sdg is one of the most pressing challenges of our time as it will help prioritize effective and efficient policy options the interaction between goal 11 and goal 6 addressed in this paper is based on 6 3 6 4 and 11 1 targets as it relates 3 essential variables groundwater quality and quantity and access equity through the analysis of the most appropriate territorial unit for water resource management using geographical information systems gis combined with multi criteria decision analysis mcda has proven to be very powerful and effective and this in fact the methods for defining spatial alternatives in a multicriteria analysis depend on the gis data models malczewski 1999 which are gaining popularity in the field of land and water resources management singh et al 2017 in this regard it is very common to find analyses carried out on the basis of biophysical criteria akinlalu et al 2017 to which variables such as land use are usually incorporated lópez et al 2019 achu et al 2020 or analyses carried out on the basis of socioeconomic criteria ruiz villaverde et al 2012 one of the problems that arises when working with both socioeconomic and biophysical criteria is that biophysical processes can operate at very different scales and boundaries than socioeconomic processes because groundwater flow is driven by gravity not political ones jakeman et al 2016 this makes spatialization and rating of variables that use different ways of spatializing information difficult usually the agencies in charge of water management use the hydrological basin or watershed as the spatial unit of analysis wwap 2015 on the other hand the agencies in charge of collecting social data use other types of spatial unit of formats which are usually more administrative than physical this paper intends to answer if watersheds are the only effective territorial units of analysis for sustainable groundwater management and it aims to compare two types of spatial alternatives in a multi criteria analysis for groundwater resource management watersheds and ad hoc defined zones 2 methodology 2 1 study area the partido of general pueyrredon pgp is a district located by the atlantic ocean in the south east of buenos aires province argentina fig 1 according to the national statistics and census institute indec it has a population of 618 989 living in an area of 1460 km2 mar del plata the head of this district is an intermediate city with an urban area of approximately 205 km2 sabuda 2018 mar del plata is located on the north eastern side of the tandilia range which has a maximum altitude of about 400 m above mean sea level the only source of water supply for all uses is the so called pampeano aquifer which is a free multilayer aquifer bocanegra et al 1993 made up of silty sandy silty and silty clayey sediments its thickness varies from about 70 m in the central sector of mar del plata city to around 100 m in the rural sectors and it contains waters that can generally be classified as calcium bicarbonate the average transmissivity values range between 800 and 1300 m2 d permeability ranges between 5 and 10 m d bocanegra et al 1993 it is important to mention that 90 of the population is supplied with water network and the rest use individual household wells water running system is supplied by more than 200 perforations distributed in 2 battery wells currently in operation north aqueduct system and south aqueduct system one battery well close to start operations west aqueduct system and one area which is under study for the austral aqueduct system 2 2 multi criteria decision making process in a multi criteria decision making process three key concepts must be taken into account the aim the criteria and the alternatives the aim refers to those goals that are desired to be achieved very often as in the case of this paper different portions of the same territory are prioritized in order to hierarchize their relevance to a given problem the criteria can be defined as the conditions or parameters that allow discriminating alternatives and establishing the decision makers preferences and this can be further divided into sub criteria the alternatives are the different portions of the territory that are going to be analysed and prioritized on the basis of the multi criteria analysis hence the multi criteria model developed in this paper and others in general are based on these different stages 1 aim of the model 2 definition of alternatives to be prioritized 3 criteria and sub criteria identification 4 criteria and sub criteria weighting 5 sub criteria rating for each alternative 6 model processing to obtain priorities 7 final priority results in this paper stages 2 5 and 7 are fundamentally analysed the application of the multi criteria model to identify those areas of the pgp where priority actions for groundwater resource management are required was carried out using the criterium decision plus 4 0 beta software cdp infoharvest 1999 identifying for this purpose the aim of the model the criteria and sub criteria to be used and the spatial alternatives cdp is a software that can be used to manage the entire decision process and runs as a windows application in it a brainstorm can be executed as a first step to define the aim and criteria an aim can be set criteria and sub criteria can be added and weighted and alternatives entered so that finally these entries can be synthesized and the alternatives can be presented as a result following a priority order also this software can provide the contributions to the outcome of those criteria and sub criteria the choice of the units of analysis or spatial alternatives was made from two different approaches on the one hand a hydrogeological approach was considered using the 14 watersheds of the pgp on the other hand a technical administrative approach was followed 2 3 spatial alternatives description regarding the hydrogeological approach the 14 watersheds of the pgp fig 2 a are conformed by streams with low topographic expression and low flow 0 2 m3 s the sectors that do not have a drainage network clearly defined were excluded from the analysis as well as the watersheds within the boundaries of the urban area of mar del plata because their limits are very blurred due to urbanization and also because approximately 90 of the urban population use water from the running water system eight that drain to the north of the urban area vivorata arroyo seco el cardalito las chacras los cueros los patos la tapera and de los padres six that drain south of the urban area chapadmalal corrientes lobería seco sur las brusquitas and san eduardo of the entire district 286 km2 remain beyond the scope of the analysis 93 km2 of the urban area and 193 km2 of the interbasin area since there is no match between the watershed boundaries and the census units limits fig 2c as for the technical administrative approach 7 zones which cover the entire district were defined fig 2b for this purpose zones were designed taking into account the aquifer exploitation areas for the public supply battery wells current under development and future and the delimitation of the urban area and the 2010 census units through which the national institute of statistics and census delivers the socioeconomic data the zones boundaries match the census units limits in order to facilitate the use of the socioeconomic data fig 2d zone 1 is characterized by the fact that it is an area without aquifer exploitation for the public network supply and with extensive agricultural livestock land use zone 2 corresponds to the area where the southern aqueduct system is planned to be installed which is still in the study phase zone 3 in this zone are the wells of the south aqueduct system and about 20 wells of the urban area the great majority of the area is part of the periurban area zone 4 this is the area that currently has the largest number of extraction wells for the public supply network that belongs to the northern aqueduct system in addition in its northwest end the new western aqueduct system is under construction and it will have 25 extraction wells in its first stage zone 5 this zone covers almost the entire intensive agricultural area and has no aquifer exploitation for the supply of the public network it is also the most complex area in terms of a wide variety of land uses interaction both productive and residential zone 6 corresponds to a part of mar del plata urban area where there are about 20 operational extraction wells for the public supply network zone 7 corresponds to the southeast sector of mar del plata urban area which does not have extraction wells for the public supply network to draw the limit with zone 6 it was also considered the limits of the census units and the maximum influence extent of the well s depression cone in that area were also considered 2 4 a synthesis of the multi criteria model any process of multi criteria analysis begins with the definition of the aim stage 1 for the development of the multi criteria model barilari 2020 a methodology that combined the work of a scientific technical team validated in two workshops by those responsible for pgp water management was adopted the disciplinary profiles of the participants cover the social and human sciences as well as the natural sciences and engineering in the case of our study the aim that was agreed with the workshop assistants was to prioritize areas of the pgp according to the needs of groundwater resource management the criteria used for the multi criteria model stage 2 were hydrological related in particular to quantity quality and vulnerability of the aquifer and socio economic related to land use the possibility of access to safe water and the response capacity to a deficiency in the groundwater quality or quantity fig 3 the criteria were weighted by the comparative pair method saaty 1992 and the sub criteria by the direct weighting method stage 3 barilari 2020 even though the selection of aim criteria sub criteria and weighting are independent of the alternatives chosen the structure of the model remains the same for both watersheds and zones what does change according to the alternative chosen is the rating of each sub criterion this aspect is developed in section 4 3 for each model watersheds and zones the development of the spatial layers and rating of the sub criteria were carried out using the arcgis 10 2 software esri 2013 each of them was developed in a geographical information layer according to its type of representation and geometry each model was then spatialized and finally rated in cdp software the data source used for this paper is shown in table 1 2 5 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was conducted to study the sensitivity of the results to the weightings given to sub criteria with respect to their parent criteria by using cdp software this analysis determines the sensitivity of the preferred alternative to changes in the criteria weights or sub criteria ratings values critical changes in the weights or ratings are those that cause a change in the preferred alternative the sensitivity plot in the cdp software shows a value called crossover point this value is where the lines that correspond to the top alternative and the upstart alternative will intersect and change the preferred alternative in the model the sensitivity analysis calculates the change in priority values from the current value to the closest crossover point then it calculates that change as a percentage of the total priority scale furthermore it refers to the crossover percentage for a given weight and it provides a useful measure of how critical that weight is to the model outcome murphy et al 2001 3 results 3 1 sub criteria rating methods for watersheds and ad hoc zones as afore mentioned in the methodology the multi criteria analysis process includes a rating stage for each of the sub criteria stage 5 in this stage a value is assigned to each sub criterion for each alternative in cdp software this value can be entered either numerically or as text ranging from trivial to very important each sub criterion was spatialized in order to comply with the rating stage it was in this stage that it became apparent the problem between the spatial variability data and the boundaries of the chosen alternatives to address this issue related to the data spatial distribution two rating methods were used which have been called direct and inferred ratings sub criteria with direct rating this method was used for those sub criteria which presented a spatial coincidence between how the source delivered the data and the alternative sub criteria with inferred rating it was necessary to adopt this valuation method in those sub criteria which presented no spatial coincidence between the source of the data and the alternative 3 1 1 direct and inferred method application example watersheds alternatives with respect to watersheds alternatives the direct method table 1 was used for hydrogeological data related to quantity criteria with the exception of one of the sub criteria aquifer vulnerability quality and land use with the exception of one of the sub criteria here the value of the data source was assigned to the corresponding watershed fig 4 the inferred method was applied to the sub criteria that used the 2010 national population household and housing census indec 2010 fig 2 as data source the range of data for each of these sub criteria was reclassified into 3 categories high moderate and low by the natural breaks method in a gis environment jenks 1977 finally the watershed was assigned with the worst category present in the watershed regardless of the occupied area fig 5 a and b 3 1 2 direct and inferred method application example ad hoc zones alternatives the direct method was used for socio economic data there is a match between zones boundaries and the census units fig 7 aquifer vulnerability quality land use and 2 quantity sub criteria for example for the industries without sewage connection sub criterion zone 2 was assigned a rating of 4 and zone 7 was assigned a rating of 7 fig 6 the inferred method was applied in the sub criteria with data generated from osse master plan data given in terms of watersheds for example for groundwater storage sub criterion the average volume that makes up the watersheds of each zone was calculated in fig 7 shows that zone 2 is made up of 5 watersheds with 1 2 5 0 2 and 0 1 hm3 year of groundwater storage the value assigned to it was 1 66hm3 year table 2 synthetizes the rating method used for each one of the sub criteria in both models once all the sub criteria in both zones and watersheds were rated these values were entered into the cdp software for processing stage 6 and obtaining the final result stage 7 3 2 results for the watersheds and zones models the map of priorities by watersheds and by zones was generated using the decision scores given by cdp and the results were classified by the natural breaks method into first second and third priority fig 8 first priority means that the greatest availability of resources should be devoted to implementing and monitoring management measures in these areas reviewing the measures applied so far and detecting gaps work must be done in the short medium and long term second priority means that these areas must be contemplated in the medium term plans the monitoring of hydrological and social variables must be sustained and increased through the allocation of resources third priority means that hydrogeological variables should be monitored particularly in these areas as shown in figs 8 and 5 watersheds were ranked as first priority 6 as second priority and 3 as third priority in the zones model 2 of them were ranked as first priority 2 zones presented second priority and 3 zones third priority thus considering the first priority alternatives it was possible to determine priority action areas by reducing the 1460 km2 of administrative surface area to 440 km2 in the case of watersheds and 540 km2 in the case of zones from the perspective of the actions implemented in relation to groundwater sustainability in this case the zones model can be considered superior since it shows zone 5 where intensive agricultural activity and the suburban residential expansion are concentrated and zone 4 where a large part of the supply wells are located as zones with high priority the watershed alternative although consistent with the groundwater extraction area leaves the intensive agricultural area with second priority 3 3 sensitivity analysis of the decision models the performing of sensitivity analysis made in the cdp software demonstrated that for the ad hoc zones alternative only two criteria showed that with a change of less than 10 in its weight value the result of the alternative can change on the other hand in the watershed alternative six very sensitive sub criteria were found showing that a change of less than 10 in its weight value can change the final result the most stable model meaning that the current preference does not change with small changes made in the value of that priority is the zones decision model since it shows 2 sub criteria that are highly sensitive table 3 compares the sub criteria which present a percentage crossover under 10 in both models 3 4 comparative synthesis between models as a comparative synthesis between the use of alternatives considering watersheds and ad hoc zones the main similarities and differences are summarized in table 4 4 discussion and conclusions the sustainability of the groundwater resource cannot leave aside the biophysical and socio economic aspects associated with water particularly those related to 3 essential variables groundwater quality and quantity and access equity multi criteria models allow working with these variables combining them and thus contributing to the relationship between the sdgs un 2018 the decision models developed in this paper include variables that are linked to targets 6 3 6 4 and 11 1 decision making in relation to this issue must be supported by as much territorial information as possible frequently and especially in urban and peri urban areas in latin america and the caribbean access to territorial information can be difficult and often the density of data is low consequently the problem that arises is how to turn over territorial information related to water resources so that it can be useful for decision making a first discussion that it is important in this sense is related to the selection of the territorial unit of analysis most papers related to integrated water resource management mention the importance of taking the watersheds as a unit of analysis dourojeanni et al 2002 gupta et al 2019 although experiences such as the one shown in this paper indicate that this should not be taken as exclusive the watershed is the basic unit for hydrological studies but it may not be very operative in some contexts where it is necessary to contrast natural social and physical variables usually organizations that collect hydrological data use a watershed spatial distribution wwap 2015 but when implementing socio economic variables it is necessary to resort to information from public or private organizations that collect it with other spatial arrangements for example in the case under study this information was obtained from the indec which carries out the spatialization of its variables by means of census units whose area basically depends on population density in summary the physical geomorphological limits and the political administrative ones often do not match and therefore a decision has to be made about which way of valuating the criteria is chosen although the use of watersheds as alternatives would seem more appropriate the possibility of using areas covering portions of the territory under study with some affinity should not be ruled out some of the main advantages of using these zones as spatial discretization are 1 depending on the scale of analysis it is possible as in the case study presented here that the watersheds do not cover the entire administrative area under study 2 the number of areas to be used can be defined according to the economic and human resources as well as the hydrological reality of the place of study while the number of watersheds is less likely to be reduced 3 the delimitation of areas being more flexible its boundaries can be redesigned if there is a modification in the data source or in the aim to be used regarding the sensitivity analysis performed for both decision models the results showed that the ad hoc zones decision model is more robust in comparison to the watersheds one leaving zones as a trustworthy alternative for the decision making process finally it can be noted that while the hydrological watershed has demonstrated its usefulness as a territorial unit for decision making on water resources issues this should not be a reason to rule out other alternatives for discretizing a territory that may have administrative rather than physical boundaries and that may provide a more appropriate outcome for a decision makers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11905,the growth of emerging and intermediate cities in latin america and the caribbean has been one of the main causes of the gaps found in the access to water quality and sanitation services therefore there is a pressing need to significantly improve water resources management to ensure a sustainable development is achieved in fact geographic information systems and multi criteria decision analysis have proven to be very powerful and effective tools but when the analysis is carried out on the basis of biophysical variables mixed with socioeconomic criteria problems in the spatial discretization of the data appear thus making spatialization and rating of variables difficult the aim of this paper is to compare two types of spatial alternatives in a multi criteria analysis for groundwater resource management in an intermediate city in argentina one made from an hydrological approach 14 watersheds and the other made from a socioeconomic approach 7 ad hoc defined zones three stages of the multicriteria analysis process were analysed in this paper firstly the definition of the alternatives to be prioritized secondly the sub criteria rating process using the direct and inferred rating methods and finally the model results the map of priorities by watershed and by zones was then generated and the results were classified into first second and third priority based on groundwater management needs furthermore a sensibility analysis and comparative synthesis between the use of alternatives considering watersheds and ad hoc zones were carried out while the hydrological watershed has demonstrated its usefulness as a land unit for decision making on water resources issues it can be noted that this should not be a reason to rule out other alternatives for discretizing a territory that may have socioeconomic rather than physical boundaries and that may provide a more appropriate outcome for a decision making process graphical abstract image 1 keywords multi criteria analysis groundwater management watersheds ad hoc zones 1 introduction latin america and the caribbean is the second most urbanized region on the planet with 80 of its population living in cities between 1960 and 2015 the percentage of the region s urban population increased from 44 to 78 this high level of urbanization has promoted the growth of emerging and intermediate cities such as mar del plata head of the general pueyrredon district which have populations of between 100 000 and 2 000 000 inhabitants idb 2016 furthermore this process has been one of the main causes of the gaps found in the access to water quality and sanitation services in argentina and particularly in the city of mar del plata groundwater provides an important source of water supply for rural and urban populations as well as for agriculture but it is increasingly at risk due to contamination barilari et al 2020 oecd 2020 the availability of sufficient quantity and of good quality of groundwater is severely impacted by increased water demand for agricultural irrigation public water supply industrial production and cooling in electricity generation bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 therefore there is a pressing need to significantly improve water resources management so as to sustain liveable conditions on earth for the present and future generations singth et al 2017 in this sense and considering the global framework of the 17 sustainable development goals sdg un 2018 this paper proposal essentially considers the interactions between goal 6 ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all and goal 11 make cities and human settlements inclusive safe resilient and sustainable as mentioned by wood et al 2018 understanding the

water resource management using geographical information systems gis combined with multi criteria decision analysis mcda has proven to be very powerful and effective and this in fact the methods for defining spatial alternatives in a multicriteria analysis depend on the gis data models malczewski 1999 which are gaining popularity in the field of land and water resources management singh et al 2017 in this regard it is very common to find analyses carried out on the basis of biophysical criteria akinlalu et al 2017 to which variables such as land use are usually incorporated lópez et al 2019 achu et al 2020 or analyses carried out on the basis of socioeconomic criteria ruiz villaverde et al 2012 one of the problems that arises when working with both socioeconomic and biophysical criteria is that biophysical processes can operate at very different scales and boundaries than socioeconomic processes because groundwater flow is driven by gravity not political ones jakeman et al 2016 this makes spatialization and rating of variables that use different ways of spatializing information difficult usually the agencies in charge of water management use the hydrological basin or watershed as the spatial unit of analysis wwap 2015 on the other hand the agencies in charge of collecting social data use other types of spatial unit of formats which are usually more administrative than physical this paper intends to answer if watersheds are the only effective territorial units of analysis for sustainable groundwater management and it aims to compare two types of spatial alternatives in a multi criteria analysis for groundwater resource management watersheds and ad hoc defined zones 2 methodology 2 1 study area the partido of general pueyrredon pgp is a district located by the atlantic ocean in the south east of buenos aires province argentina fig 1 according to the national statistics and census institute indec it has a population of 618 989 living in an area of 1460 km2 mar del plata the head of this district is an intermediate city with an urban area of approximately 205 km2 sabuda 2018 mar del plata is located on the north eastern side of the tandilia range which has a maximum altitude of about 400 m above mean sea level the only source of water supply for all uses is the so called pampeano aquifer which is a free multilayer aquifer bocanegra et al 1993 made up of silty sandy silty and silty clayey sediments its thickness varies from about 70 m in the central sector of mar del plata city to around 100 m in the rural sectors and it contains waters that can generally be classified as calcium bicarbonate the average transmissivity values range between 800 and 1300 m2 d permeability ranges between 5 and 10 m d bocanegra et al 1993 it is important to mention that 90 of the population is supplied with water network and the rest use individual household wells water running system is supplied by more than 200 perforations distributed in 2 battery wells currently in operation north aqueduct system and south aqueduct system one battery well close to start operations west aqueduct system and one area which is under study for the austral aqueduct system 2 2 multi criteria decision making process in a multi criteria decision making process three key concepts must be taken into account the aim the criteria and the alternatives the aim refers to those goals that are desired to be achieved very often as in the case of this paper different portions of the same territory are prioritized in order to hierarchize their relevance to a given problem the criteria can be defined as the conditions or parameters that allow discriminating alternatives and establishing the decision makers preferences and this can be further divided into sub criteria the alternatives are the different portions of the territory that are going to be analysed and prioritized on the basis of the multi criteria analysis hence the multi criteria model developed in this paper and others in general are based on these different stages 1 aim of the model 2 definition of alternatives to be prioritized 3 criteria and sub criteria identification 4 criteria and sub criteria weighting 5 sub criteria rating for each alternative 6 model processing to obtain priorities 7 final priority results in this paper stages 2 5 and 7 are fundamentally analysed the application of the multi criteria model to identify those areas of the pgp where priority actions for groundwater resource management are required was carried out using the criterium decision plus 4 0 beta software cdp infoharvest 1999 identifying for this purpose the aim of the model the criteria and sub criteria to be used and the spatial alternatives cdp is a software that can be used to manage the entire decision process and runs as a windows application in it a brainstorm can be executed as a first step to define the aim and criteria an aim can be set criteria and sub criteria can be added and weighted and alternatives entered so that finally these entries can be synthesized and the alternatives can be presented as a result following a priority order also this software can provide the contributions to the outcome of those criteria and sub criteria the choice of the units of analysis or spatial alternatives was made from two different approaches on the one hand a hydrogeological approach was considered using the 14 watersheds of the pgp on the other hand a technical administrative approach was followed 2 3 spatial alternatives description regarding the hydrogeological approach the 14 watersheds of the pgp fig 2 a are conformed by streams with low topographic expression and low flow 0 2 m3 s the sectors that do not have a drainage network clearly defined were excluded from the analysis as well as the watersheds within the boundaries of the urban area of mar del plata because their limits are very blurred due to urbanization and also because approximately 90 of the urban population use water from the running water system eight that drain to the north of the urban area vivorata arroyo seco el cardalito las chacras los cueros los patos la tapera and de los padres six that drain south of the urban area chapadmalal corrientes lobería seco sur las brusquitas and san eduardo of the entire district 286 km2 remain beyond the scope of the analysis 93 km2 of the urban area and 193 km2 of the interbasin area since there is no match between the watershed boundaries and the census units limits fig 2c as for the technical administrative approach 7 zones which cover the entire district were defined fig 2b for this purpose zones were designed taking into account the aquifer exploitation areas for the public supply battery wells current under development and future and the delimitation of the urban area and the 2010 census units through which the national institute of statistics and census delivers the socioeconomic data the zones boundaries match the census units limits in order to facilitate the use of the socioeconomic data fig 2d zone 1 is characterized by the fact that it is an area without aquifer exploitation for the public network supply and with extensive agricultural livestock land use zone 2 corresponds to the area where the southern aqueduct system is planned to be installed which is still in the study phase zone 3 in this zone are the wells of the south aqueduct system and about 20 wells of the urban area the great majority of the area is part of the periurban area zone 4 this is the area that currently has the largest number of extraction wells for the public supply network that belongs to the northern aqueduct system in addition in its northwest end the new western aqueduct system is under construction and it will have 25 extraction wells in its first stage zone 5 this zone covers almost the entire intensive agricultural area and has no aquifer exploitation for the supply of the public network it is also the most complex area in terms of a wide variety of land uses interaction both productive and residential zone 6 corresponds to a part of mar del plata urban area where there are about 20 operational extraction wells for the public supply network zone 7 corresponds to the southeast sector of mar del plata urban area which does not have extraction wells for the public supply network to draw the limit with zone 6 it was also considered the limits of the census units and the maximum influence extent of the well s depression cone in that area were also considered 2 4 a synthesis of the multi criteria model any process of multi criteria analysis begins with the definition of the aim stage 1 for the development of the multi criteria model barilari 2020 a methodology that combined the work of a scientific technical team validated in two workshops by those responsible for pgp water management was adopted the disciplinary profiles of the participants cover the social and human sciences as well as the natural sciences and engineering in the case of our study the aim that was agreed with the workshop assistants was to prioritize areas of the pgp according to the needs of groundwater resource management the criteria used for the multi criteria model stage 2 were hydrological related in particular to quantity quality and vulnerability of the aquifer and socio economic related to land use the possibility of access to safe water and the response capacity to a deficiency in the groundwater quality or quantity fig 3 the criteria were weighted by the comparative pair method saaty 1992 and the sub criteria by the direct weighting method stage 3 barilari 2020 even though the selection of aim criteria sub criteria and weighting are independent of the alternatives chosen the structure of the model remains the same for both watersheds and zones what does change according to the alternative chosen is the rating of each sub criterion this aspect is developed in section 4 3 for each model watersheds and zones the development of the spatial layers and rating of the sub criteria were carried out using the arcgis 10 2 software esri 2013 each of them was developed in a geographical information layer according to its type of representation and geometry each model was then spatialized and finally rated in cdp software the data source used for this paper is shown in table 1 2 5 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was conducted to study the sensitivity of the results to the weightings given to sub criteria with respect to their parent criteria by using cdp software this analysis determines the sensitivity of the preferred alternative to changes in the criteria weights or sub criteria ratings values critical changes in the weights or ratings are those that cause a change in the preferred alternative the sensitivity plot in the cdp software shows a value called crossover point this value is where the lines that correspond to the top alternative and the upstart alternative will intersect and change the preferred alternative in the model the sensitivity analysis calculates the change in priority values from the current value to the closest crossover point then it calculates that change as a percentage of the total priority scale furthermore it refers to the crossover percentage for a given weight and it provides a useful measure of how critical that weight is to the model outcome murphy et al 2001 3 results 3 1 sub criteria rating methods for watersheds and ad hoc zones as afore mentioned in the methodology the multi criteria analysis process includes a rating stage for each of the sub criteria stage 5 in this stage a value is assigned to each sub criterion for each alternative in cdp software this value can be entered either numerically or as text ranging from trivial to very important each sub criterion was spatialized in order to comply with the rating stage it was in this stage that it became apparent the problem between the spatial variability data and the boundaries of the chosen alternatives to address this issue related to the data spatial distribution two rating methods were used which have been called direct and inferred ratings sub criteria with direct rating this method was used for those sub criteria which presented a spatial coincidence between how the source delivered the data and the alternative sub criteria with inferred rating it was necessary to adopt this valuation method in those sub criteria which presented no spatial coincidence between the source of the data and the alternative 3 1 1 direct and inferred method application example watersheds alternatives with respect to watersheds alternatives the direct method table 1 was used for hydrogeological data related to quantity criteria with the exception of one of the sub criteria aquifer vulnerability quality and land use with the exception of one of the sub criteria here the value of the data source was assigned to the corresponding watershed fig 4 the inferred method was applied to the sub criteria that used the 2010 national population household and housing census indec 2010 fig 2 as data source the range of data for each of these sub criteria was reclassified into 3 categories high moderate and low by the natural breaks method in a gis environment jenks 1977 finally the watershed was assigned with the worst category present in the watershed regardless of the occupied area fig 5 a and b 3 1 2 direct and inferred method application example ad hoc zones alternatives the direct method was used for socio economic data there is a match between zones boundaries and the census units fig 7 aquifer vulnerability quality land use and 2 quantity sub criteria for example for the industries without sewage connection sub criterion zone 2 was assigned a rating of 4 and zone 7 was assigned a rating of 7 fig 6 the inferred method was applied in the sub criteria with data generated from osse master plan data given in terms of watersheds for example for groundwater storage sub criterion the average volume that makes up the watersheds of each zone was calculated in fig 7 shows that zone 2 is made up of 5 watersheds with 1 2 5 0 2 and 0 1 hm3 year of groundwater storage the value assigned to it was 1 66hm3 year table 2 synthetizes the rating method used for each one of the sub criteria in both models once all the sub criteria in both zones and watersheds were rated these values were entered into the cdp software for processing stage 6 and obtaining the final result stage 7 3 2 results for the watersheds and zones models the map of priorities by watersheds and by zones was generated using the decision scores given by cdp and the results were classified by the natural breaks method into first second and third priority fig 8 first priority means that the greatest availability of resources should be devoted to implementing and monitoring management measures in these areas reviewing the measures applied so far and detecting gaps work must be done in the short medium and long term second priority means that these areas must be contemplated in the medium term plans the monitoring of hydrological and social variables must be sustained and increased through the allocation of resources third priority means that hydrogeological variables should be monitored particularly in these areas as shown in figs 8 and 5 watersheds were ranked as first priority 6 as second priority and 3 as third priority in the zones model 2 of them were ranked as first priority 2 zones presented second priority and 3 zones third priority thus considering the first priority alternatives it was possible to determine priority action areas by reducing the 1460 km2 of administrative surface area to 440 km2 in the case of watersheds and 540 km2 in the case of zones from the perspective of the actions implemented in relation to groundwater sustainability in this case the zones model can be considered superior since it shows zone 5 where intensive agricultural activity and the suburban residential expansion are concentrated and zone 4 where a large part of the supply wells are located as zones with high priority the watershed alternative although consistent with the groundwater extraction area leaves the intensive agricultural area with second priority 3 3 sensitivity analysis of the decision models the performing of sensitivity analysis made in the cdp software demonstrated that for the ad hoc zones alternative only two criteria showed that with a change of less than 10 in its weight value the result of the alternative can change on the other hand in the watershed alternative six very sensitive sub criteria were found showing that a change of less than 10 in its weight value can change the final result the most stable model meaning that the current preference does not change with small changes made in the value of that priority is the zones decision model since it shows 2 sub criteria that are highly sensitive table 3 compares the sub criteria which present a percentage crossover under 10 in both models 3 4 comparative synthesis between models as a comparative synthesis between the use of alternatives considering watersheds and ad hoc zones the main similarities and differences are summarized in table 4 4 discussion and conclusions the sustainability of the groundwater resource cannot leave aside the biophysical and socio economic aspects associated with water particularly those related to 3 essential variables groundwater quality and quantity and access equity multi criteria models allow working with these variables combining them and thus contributing to the relationship between the sdgs un 2018 the decision models developed in this paper include variables that are linked to targets 6 3 6 4 and 11 1 decision making in relation to this issue must be supported by as much territorial information as possible frequently and especially in urban and peri urban areas in latin america and the caribbean access to territorial information can be difficult and often the density of data is low consequently the problem that arises is how to turn over territorial information related to water resources so that it can be useful for decision making a first discussion that it is important in this sense is related to the selection of the territorial unit of analysis most papers related to integrated water resource management mention the importance of taking the watersheds as a unit of analysis dourojeanni et al 2002 gupta et al 2019 although experiences such as the one shown in this paper indicate that this should not be taken as exclusive the watershed is the basic unit for hydrological studies but it may not be very operative in some contexts where it is necessary to contrast natural social and physical variables usually organizations that collect hydrological data use a watershed spatial distribution wwap 2015 but when implementing socio economic variables it is necessary to resort to information from public or private organizations that collect it with other spatial arrangements for example in the case under study this information was obtained from the indec which carries out the spatialization of its variables by means of census units whose area basically depends on population density in summary the physical geomorphological limits and the political administrative ones often do not match and therefore a decision has to be made about which way of valuating the criteria is chosen although the use of watersheds as alternatives would seem more appropriate the possibility of using areas covering portions of the territory under study with some affinity should not be ruled out some of the main advantages of using these zones as spatial discretization are 1 depending on the scale of analysis it is possible as in the case study presented here that the watersheds do not cover the entire administrative area under study 2 the number of areas to be used can be defined according to the economic and human resources as well as the hydrological reality of the place of study while the number of watersheds is less likely to be reduced 3 the delimitation of areas being more flexible its boundaries can be redesigned if there is a modification in the data source or in the aim to be used regarding the sensitivity analysis performed for both decision models the results showed that the ad hoc zones decision model is more robust in comparison to the watersheds one leaving zones as a trustworthy alternative for the decision making process finally it can be noted that while the hydrological watershed has demonstrated its usefulness as a territorial unit for decision making on water resources issues this should not be a reason to rule out other alternatives for discretizing a territory that may have administrative rather than physical boundaries and that may provide a more appropriate outcome for a decision makers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11906,the previous studies primarily identify the two types of saltwater encroachment processes like active si seawater intrusion and passive si submarine groundwater discharge under passive si the hydraulic gradient inclines towards the sea making density and fresh groundwater flow work in opposite directions under active si the hydraulic gradient inclines landward and density and fresh groundwater flow work in the same direction causing more aggressive salinization and wider mixing zones mechanical dispersion s effects in controlling the mixing zones in coastal aquifers have become the subject of ongoing debate in si studies in this study numerical experimentations of scaled tank and a field scale model were used to explore the influence of longitudinal and transversal dispersivities separately on the width of the mixing zone under passive and active si in response to inland freshwater head decline the results show that under steady si conditions increasing the longitudinal dispersivity value widened the lower part of the mixing zone while increasing the transversal dispersivity value increased the mixing zone s width both at the lower and the upper part of the saltwater wedge the same phenomenon as steady state si results was observed for passive si conditions even though with larger effects while under active si both an increase of longitudinal and transversal dispersivities widened the width of the mixing zones but their quantitative impacts are larger compared to those in passive si conditions as an instance when the transverse dispersivity is increased 50 times the width of the mixing zone at the middle of the saltwater wedge is almost doubled compared to it in the passive case ultimately it is found that under active circumstances the shear effect of transverse dispersivity pushes the toe position back graphical abstract image 1 keywords saltwater intrusion mechanical dispersion longitudinal dispersivity transversal dispersivity 1

zones werner et al 2012 morgan et al 2013 badaruddin et al 2015 2017 an important and difficult parameter to assess in si in corresponding to the mixing zone is mechanical dispersion abarca et al 2004 neupauer et al 2020 the effect of dispersivity parameter in controlling the dispersion region has become a debatable issue in si studies since this is assumed to control the width of mixing zones produced in si zhang et al 2002 abarca et al 2007 several studies have been carried out to investigate the relationship between dispersivity parameters and the mixing zone characteristics under stable si configurations i e steady state passive si and there are very limited relevant works of literature available that focused on transient si conditions e g ataie ashtiani et al 1999 badaruddin et al

abarca and clement 2009 chang and clement 2012 abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 on the other hand abarca et al 2007 showed through the numerical modelling of the benchmark henry problem that under steady state conditions the contributions of longitudinal and transversal dispersivity are quantitatively similar in widening the mixing zone in coastal aquifers they showed that an increase of longitudinal dispersivity widens the lower part of the mixing zone in which the concentration gradient and the velocity vector are parallel while an increase of transversal dispersivity widens the mixing zone in general due to its shear effect making the mixing zone moves seaward at the bottom and inland at the top in the case of tidal effects ataie ashtiani et al 1999 found that under transient passive si conditions both longitudinal and transversal dispersivity are essential for the configuration of the freshwater saltwater interface but the interface shape is most sensitive to the changes in longitudinal dispersivity relative to transversal dispersivity since the previous studies are mainly based on steady state passive si conditions the influence of dispersivity parameters on the zone of mixing under active si situation has been neglected despite some si studies have identified the occurrence of active si in many areas i e yakirevich et al 1998 fetter 2018 werner and gallagher 2006 morgan et al 2013 badaruddin et al 2015 and 2017 have shown through numerical modelling that under active si circumstances due to an inland freshwater head decline fhd the width of the mixing zone at the upper region of the coastal aquifer is very critical in generating water table salinization phenomenon particularly in shallow unconfined coastal aquifers due to its potential to salinize the unsaturated zone above aquifers through capillary rise werner and lockington 2006 badaruddin et al 2017 also have indicated through numerical modelling that mechanical dispersivity has a significant effect in increasing the width of the mixing zone both under passive and active si conditions nonetheless both badaruddin et al 2015 and 2017 did not explore further to what extent longitudinal and transversal dispersivities affect the width of the mixing zone under such conditions due to the scarce of research on active si in this study numerical modelling is used to undertake an investigation on the effect of longitudinal and transversal dispersivity on the width of the mixing zone under active si in response to an inland fhd intense fhd as the consequence of groundwater overexploitation is reported in previous researches e g alfarrah and walraevens 2018 ochoa gonzález et al 2018 fhd in stressed aquifers in association with drought may cause land subsidence vahidipour et al 2021 for comparison the effects of dispersivities on the mixing zone under passive and steady state si situations are also considered this study is essential to continue the work of werner et al 2013 badaruddin et al 2015 and 2017 to provide systematic numerical experimentation in examining the individual influence of longitudinal and transversal dispersivities on the mixing zones in coastal aquifers under passive and active si situations this study is also beneficial in clarifying the significance of the mechanical dispersivity parameter in solute transport modelling 2 methodology 2 1 conceptual model fig 1 shows a schematic model of an unconfined coastal aquifer following the conceptual case used in badaruddin et al 2015 three different salinity contours were measured in evaluating the interface configuration i e 5 50 and 95 of seawater salinity and both the 5 interface toe at the aquifer base x toe l and the 5 interface tip at the water table x tip l were evaluated the horizontal length between 5 and 95 of seawater salinity contour at the aquifer base w m1 l at the half of the interface w m2 l and at the water table w m3 l was considered as the width of the transition zone in fig 1 the right and the left sides represent the coastal and the inland boundaries respectively with h s l the depth seawater below sea level and h f l the inland freshwater head moreover q 0 is freshwater discharge to the sea l2 t and o f l is the freshwater brackish water outflow face in examining the effect of mechanical dispersivities on the mixing zone under passive and active si the 2d model domain of a scaled tank was first considered parameters of the scaled tank model follow an si experimental study presented by badaruddin et al 2015 the fhd experiment in their study was carried out by a tank with 52 mm width filled by natural sand in their work the interface was first established as a steady state condition and then an instantaneous inland fhd of δh f l causes the interface to move landward in their study the steady state conditions were confirmed after 4 h where h f and h s were maintained at 50 4 cm and 48 2 cm respectively refer to fig 1 passive si in response to an fhd was induced by dropping h f from 50 4 to 49 4 cm instantaneously refer to fig 1 and passive si was run for 210 min to induce active si h f was instantaneously dropped from 49 4 to 43 4 cm i e below the h s refer to fig 1 and active si was run for 18 min all the parameters for the scaled tank model are measured and summarized in table 1 the measurement process of soil and fluid characteristics is provided by badaruddin et al 2015 and is not stated here for brevity 2 2 numerical model in this study numerical experimentations were conducted using the variable density groundwater flow and transport code seawat version 4 langevin et al 2008 which is commonly used and has been validated using some benchmarks brovelli et al 2007 goswami and clement 2007 for each steady state simulation specified head boundary conditions were used at the left and the right sides of the model and the base of the domain was prescribed no flow conditions the right sea boundary represents seawater hydrostatic conditions whereas a constant freshwater head was applied at the inland boundary a steady state condition was used in transition simulations as an initial condition in order to meet the accuracy and convergence requirement for grid spacing in the model the mesh peclet number pe m voss and souza 1987 zhang et al 2002 brovelli et al 2007 was used to specify the discretization of the model domain 1 p e m δ l α l 4 where δl l is the grid spacing following badaruddin et al 2015 for the scaled tank model a uniform grid size of δx 0 50 cm and δz 0 25 cm was used resulted in a grid of 48 672 cells and a pe of 1 25 a time step of 30 s was employed and the transport step size was set to 3 s three stress periods were defined in the numerical model of the sand tank scale model as 1 a 4 h period to reach steady state conditions with h s at 48 2 cm and h f at 50 4 cm refer to fig 1 2 h f was dropped by 1 0 cm instantaneously and passive si was simulated for 210 min and 3 h f was dropped instantaneously by 6 0 cm to produce active si for 18 min following abarca et al 2007 different ratios of longitudinal dispersivity α l l to transversal one α t l according to table 2 were introduced in the numerical experiments representing the individual increase of α l i e 20 30 and 50 times and α t i e 2 1 and 0 2 times to realize the effect of longitudinal and transversal dispersivity parameters independently on the mixing zones 3 results and discussion 3 1 steady state si conditions fig 2 a b and c compare the salinity distribution of case 1 with cases 2 3 and 4 under steady state si conditions cases 2 3 and 4 represent the increase of α l by 2 3 and 5 times respectively relative to the α l of case 1 the figure shows that the length of x toe x tip w m1 w m2 and w m3 is 26 7 0 3 5 5 3 and 0 cm respectively these results are in accordance with the results of badaruddin et al 2015 the results demonstrate that the value of x toe 26 7 cm and x tip 0 cm are constant for these cases but there are slight variations observed on the width of the mixing zones particularly at w m1 and w m2 for example increasing α l by 5 times changed the values of w m1 from 3 5 cm in case 1 8 2 cm in case 4 almost doubled and w m2 from 5 3 cm in case 1 6 3 cm in case 4 from fig 2 it is clear that under steady state si conditions increasing longitudinal dispersivity by 5 times will widen the lower part of the mixing zone by 130 the line of 5 salinity remained static but the mixing zones broaden seaward and downward fig 3 a b and c present the comparison of salinity distribution between case 1 and cases 5 6 and 7 cases 5 6 and 7 represent the increase of α t by 5 10 and 50 times respectively compared to the α t used in case 1 the figures present that in general the x toe values are decreased and the width of the mixing zones are increased with the increase of α t the x toe values in cases 5 6 and 7 are 24 9 cm 23 5 cm and 20 2 cm respectively the length of x tip is zero in these cases except for case 7 where the x tip is 2 1 cm these results imply that an increase of transversal dispersivity widened the width of the mixing zones in all parts of the saltwater wedge but its shear effect drove the mixing zone at the bottom to move backward and landward at the top this potentially increases salinization at the water table 3 2 passive si conditions fig 4 a b and c compare the salinity distributions between case 8 and cases 9 10 and 11 cases 9 10 and 11 represent the increase of α l by 2 3 and 5 times respectively the salinity distribution under transient passive si condition for case 8 base case 2 is depicted in fig 4a as the figure presents the x toe x tip w m1 w m2 and w m3 are 59 0 7 1 10 22 and 0 cm respectively these results are the same as the results of badaruddin et al 2015 the results demonstrate that the values of x tip 0 cm and w m3 0 cm are constant for these cases but there are slight changes noticed on x toe and the width of the mixing zones particularly at w m1 and w m2 raising α l by 5 times increased the values of w m1 from 7 1 cm in case 8 15 7 cm in case 11 almost doubled and w m2 from 10 2 cm in case 8 17 cm in case 11 67 increase on the contrary decreasing the x toe from 59 cm in case 8 55 cm in case 11 the same phenomenon was observed between steady state and passive si conditions where increasing the α l y may widen the lower part of the mixing zone however a tiny difference in response was detected under transient passive si the lower part of the 5 salinity contour was pushed back slightly seaward whereas the mixing zone still broadened seawards and downwards fig 5 a b and c present the comparison of salinity distribution between case 8 base case 2 and cases 12 13 and 14 cases 12 13 and 14 denote the increase of α t by 5 10 and 50 times respectively compared to the α t in case 8 the figure shows that in general the x toe values are decreased and the width of the mixing zones are increased with the increase of α t similar to the results of steady state si the x toe values in cases 12 13 and 14 are 57 9 cm 56 5 cm and 50 9 cm respectively the length of x tip is also zero in these cases except for case 14 where the x tip is 3 5 cm these results imply that an increase of transversal dispersivity under passive si widened the width of the mixing zones in both the lower and the upper part of the saltwater wedge and increased the slope of salinity contours this also potentially increases salinization at the water table 3 3 active si conditions fig 6 a b and c compare the salinity distribution of case 15 base case 3 with cases 16 17 and 18 cases 16 17 and 18 represent the increase of α l by 2 3 and 5 times respectively relative to the α l of case 15 fig 6a shows that the values of x toe x tip w m1 w m2 and w m3 are 87 5 14 6 16 9 17 1 and 9 8 cm respectively these results are in agreement with the results of badaruddin et al 2015 the results show that the value of x toe and x tip are slightly modified for these cases but there are significant changes noted on the width of the mixing zones increasing α l by 5 times changed the values of x toe from 87 5 cm in case 15 99 cm 13 increase in case 18 and x tip from 14 6 cm to 22 cm 1 5 times the values of w m1 are also changed from 16 9 cm in case 15 36 2 cm in case 18 214 increase w m2 from 17 1 cm to 34 3 doubled cm and w m3 from 9 8 cm to 22 4 cm 2 3 times from fig 6 it is obvious that under active si conditions increasing α l widened the mixing zone both at the lower and upper part of the wedge albeit the upper part was more sensitive to the change this potentially increases salinization at the water table the performance of the mixing zone in this condition is different from the previous results in steady state and passive si here all parts of 5 and 95 salinity contours were pushed inland and seaward respectively which results in the broad mixing zone fig 7 a b and c provide the comparison of salinity distribution between case 15 base case 3 and cases 19 20 and 21 the values of α t increased by 5 10 and 50 times in cases 19 20 and 21 respectively the figures show that in general the values of x toe decreased and the x tip increased with the increase of α t in cases 19 20 and 21 the x toe values are 83 5 cm 81 5 cm and 74 5 cm respectively and the x tip values are 16 1 cm 18 2 cm and 29 cm the widths of the mixing zones are increased with the increase of α t these results imply that under active si conditions an increase of α t widened the mixing zones in all parts of the interface but in a different fashion compared to the change of longitudinal dispersivity at this condition the shear effect of transversal dispersivity becomes more obvious pushing the mixing zone backward at the bottom and landward at the top which is also potentially increasing salinization at the water table 3 4 field scale model fig 8 provides the comparison of salinity distribution between a field base case and the cases with low and high dispersivities this result is taken from badaruddin et al 2017 to confirm the results obtained in this study aside from the type of aquifer which is unconfined the geometry of the coastal aquifer and the values of hydrologic parameters used in the field base case of the study mainly followed those in lu and werner 2013 the length of aquifer l l was 1000 m with h s of 30 m the coastal aquifer was assumed as homogeneous isotropic with a hydraulic conductivity k l t of 10 m d and an effective porosity n of 0 3 seawater and freshwater densities were 1025 kg m3 and 1000 kg m3 respectively 35 kg m3 salt concentration was considered for seawater boundary for the base case the longitudinal dispersivity was 1 m and the transverse dispersivity was one tenth of α l lu and werner 2013 abarca et al 2007 following jakovovic et al 2011 a molecular diffusivity d m l2 t of 8 64 10 5 m2 d was adopted fig 8 shows the effect of modifying dispersivity on active si it can be seen that higher dispersion values increasing both a l and a t led to rates of interface movement that were lower at the toe but higher at the tip thereby increasing the saltwater wedge steepness and resulted in mixing zone widths that were larger both at the toe and tip these results are in good agreement with the results gained in cases 15 to 18 this is also consistent with the steady state si findings of kerrou and renard 2010 who found that stronger dispersion leads to decreased density contrasts due to the wider mixing zone this condition causes rotation of the mixing zone alignment such that the interface toe moves seaward relative to the interface tip 4 conclusion in this research work the individual effect of mechanical dispersivities i e longitudinal and transversal on the freshwater saltwater interface profile was investigated using numerical model of seawat the results of this study highlight the role of these two parameters in shaping the extent of seawater intrusion especially under active state which was not studied in detail at the previous works of literature based on the results of numerical modelling the individual effect of longitudinal and transversal dispersivities on mixing zone s profile under steady state si are in accordance with the results of previous studies under steady state si conditions an increase of longitudinal dispersivity widens the lower part of the mixing zone while an increase of transversal dispersivity widens the mixing zone in all part of the saltwater wedge and the same phenomenon was observed on the results of transient passive si conditions under transient active si condition both an increase of longitudinal and transversal dispersivities may increase the width of the mixing zones in all part of the freshwater saltwater interface but in different fashion this implies that both longitudinal and transversal dispersivity are significantly important in controlling the width of the mixing zone and each of this parameter cannot be neglected in numerical model the result of this research is useful as guidance in solute transport modelling at least to identify the effect of mechanical dispersion involved in affecting the results of numerical modelling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the authors wish to thank anonymous reviewers for their constructive suggestions

unsaturated zone above aquifers through capillary rise werner and lockington 2006 badaruddin et al 2017 also have indicated through numerical modelling that mechanical dispersivity has a significant effect in increasing the width of the mixing zone both under passive and active si conditions nonetheless both badaruddin et al 2015 and 2017 did not explore further to what extent longitudinal and transversal dispersivities affect the width of the mixing zone under such conditions due to the scarce of research on active si in this study numerical modelling is used to undertake an investigation on the effect of longitudinal and transversal dispersivity on the width of the mixing zone under active si in response to an inland fhd intense fhd as the consequence of groundwater overexploitation is reported in previous researches e g alfarrah and walraevens 2018 ochoa gonzález et al 2018 fhd in stressed aquifers in association with drought may cause land subsidence vahidipour et al 2021 for comparison the effects of dispersivities on the mixing zone under passive and steady state si situations are also considered this study is essential to continue the work of werner et al 2013 badaruddin et al 2015 and 2017 to provide systematic numerical experimentation in examining the individual influence of longitudinal and transversal dispersivities on the mixing zones in coastal aquifers under passive and active si situations this study is also beneficial in clarifying the significance of the mechanical dispersivity parameter in solute transport modelling 2 methodology 2 1 conceptual model fig 1 shows a schematic model of an unconfined coastal aquifer following the conceptual case used in badaruddin et al 2015 three different salinity contours were measured in evaluating the interface configuration i e 5 50 and 95 of seawater salinity and both the 5 interface toe at the aquifer base x toe l and the 5 interface tip at the water table x tip l were evaluated the horizontal length between 5 and 95 of seawater salinity contour at the aquifer base w m1 l at the half of the interface w m2 l and at the water table w m3 l was considered as the width of the transition zone in fig 1 the right and the left sides represent the coastal and the inland boundaries respectively with h s l the depth seawater below sea level and h f l the inland freshwater head moreover q 0 is freshwater discharge to the sea l2 t and o f l is the freshwater brackish water outflow face in examining the effect of mechanical dispersivities on the mixing zone under passive and active si the 2d model domain of a scaled tank was first considered parameters of the scaled tank model follow an si experimental study presented by badaruddin et al 2015 the fhd experiment in their study was carried out by a tank with 52 mm width filled by natural sand in their work the interface was first established as a steady state condition and then an instantaneous inland fhd of δh f l causes the interface to move landward in their study the steady state conditions were confirmed after 4 h where h f and h s were maintained at 50 4 cm and 48 2 cm respectively refer to fig 1 passive si in response to an fhd was induced by dropping h f from 50 4 to 49 4 cm instantaneously refer to fig 1 and passive si was run for 210 min to induce active si h f was instantaneously dropped from 49 4 to 43 4 cm i e below the h s refer to fig 1 and active si was run for 18 min all the parameters for the scaled tank model are measured and summarized in table 1 the measurement process of soil and fluid characteristics is provided by badaruddin et al 2015 and is not stated here for brevity 2 2 numerical model in this study numerical experimentations were conducted using the variable density groundwater flow and transport code seawat version 4 langevin et al 2008 which is commonly used and has been validated using some benchmarks brovelli et al 2007 goswami and clement 2007 for each steady state simulation specified head boundary conditions were used at the left and the right sides of the model and the base of the domain was prescribed no flow conditions the right sea boundary represents seawater hydrostatic conditions whereas a constant freshwater head was applied at the inland boundary a steady state condition was used in transition simulations as an initial condition in order to meet the accuracy and convergence requirement for grid spacing in the model the mesh peclet number pe m voss and souza 1987 zhang et al 2002 brovelli et al 2007 was used to specify the discretization of the model domain 1 p e m δ l α l 4 where δl l is the grid spacing following badaruddin et al 2015 for the scaled tank model a uniform grid size of δx 0 50 cm and δz 0 25 cm was used resulted in a grid of 48 672 cells and a pe of 1 25 a time step of 30 s was employed and the transport step size was set to 3 s three stress periods were defined in the numerical model of the sand tank scale model as 1 a 4 h period to reach steady state conditions with h s at 48 2 cm and h f at 50 4 cm refer to fig 1 2 h f was dropped by 1 0 cm instantaneously and passive si was simulated for 210 min and 3 h f was dropped instantaneously by 6 0 cm to produce active si for 18 min following abarca et al 2007 different ratios of longitudinal dispersivity α l l to transversal one α t l according to table 2 were introduced in the numerical experiments representing the individual increase of α l i e 20 30 and 50 times and α t i e 2 1 and 0 2 times to realize the effect of longitudinal and transversal dispersivity parameters independently on the mixing zones 3 results and discussion 3 1 steady state si conditions fig 2 a b and c compare the salinity distribution of case 1 with cases 2 3 and 4 under steady state si conditions cases 2 3 and 4 represent the increase of α l by 2 3 and 5 times respectively relative to the α l of case 1 the figure shows that the length of x toe x tip w m1 w m2 and w m3 is 26 7 0 3 5 5 3 and 0 cm respectively these results are in accordance with the results of badaruddin et al 2015 the results demonstrate that the value of x toe 26 7 cm and x tip 0 cm are constant for these cases but there are slight variations observed on the width of the mixing zones particularly at w m1 and w m2 for example increasing α l by 5 times changed the values of w m1 from 3 5 cm in case 1 8 2 cm in case 4 almost doubled and w m2 from 5 3 cm in case 1 6 3 cm in case 4 from fig 2 it is clear that under steady state si conditions increasing longitudinal dispersivity by 5 times will widen the lower part of the mixing zone by 130 the line of 5 salinity remained static but the mixing zones broaden seaward and downward fig 3 a b and c present the comparison of salinity distribution between case 1 and cases 5 6 and 7 cases 5 6 and 7 represent the increase of α t by 5 10 and 50 times respectively compared to the α t used in case 1 the figures present that in general the x toe values are decreased and the width of the mixing zones are increased with the increase of α t the x toe values in cases 5 6 and 7 are 24 9 cm 23 5 cm and 20 2 cm respectively the length of x tip is zero in these cases except for case 7 where the x tip is 2 1 cm these results imply that an increase of transversal dispersivity widened the width of the mixing zones in all parts of the saltwater wedge but its shear effect drove the mixing zone at the bottom to move backward and landward at the top this potentially increases salinization at the water table 3 2 passive si conditions fig 4 a b and c compare the salinity distributions between case 8 and cases 9 10 and 11 cases 9 10 and 11 represent the increase of α l by 2 3 and 5 times respectively the salinity distribution under transient passive si condition for case 8 base case 2 is depicted in fig 4a as the figure presents the x toe x tip w m1 w m2 and w m3 are 59 0 7 1 10 22 and 0 cm respectively these results are the same as the results of badaruddin et al 2015 the results demonstrate that the values of x tip 0 cm and w m3 0 cm are constant for these cases but there are slight changes noticed on x toe and the width of the mixing zones particularly at w m1 and w m2 raising α l by 5 times increased the values of w m1 from 7 1 cm in case 8 15 7 cm in case 11 almost doubled and w m2 from 10 2 cm in case 8 17 cm in case 11 67 increase on the contrary decreasing the x toe from 59 cm in case 8 55 cm in case 11 the same phenomenon was observed between steady state and passive si conditions where increasing the α l y may widen the lower part of the mixing zone however a tiny difference in response was detected under transient passive si the lower part of the 5 salinity contour was pushed back slightly seaward whereas the mixing zone still broadened seawards and downwards fig 5 a b and c present the comparison of salinity distribution between case 8 base case 2 and cases 12 13 and 14 cases 12 13 and 14 denote the increase of α t by 5 10 and 50 times respectively compared to the α t in case 8 the figure shows that in general the x toe values are decreased and the width of the mixing zones are increased with the increase of α t similar to the results of steady state si the x toe values in cases 12 13 and 14 are 57 9 cm 56 5 cm and 50 9 cm respectively the length of x tip is also zero in these cases except for case 14 where the x tip is 3 5 cm these results imply that an increase of transversal dispersivity under passive si widened the width of the mixing zones in both the lower and the upper part of the saltwater wedge and increased the slope of salinity contours this also potentially increases salinization at the water table 3 3 active si conditions fig 6 a b and c compare the salinity distribution of case 15 base case 3 with cases 16 17 and 18 cases 16 17 and 18 represent the increase of α l by 2 3 and 5 times respectively relative to the α l of case 15 fig 6a shows that the values of x toe x tip w m1 w m2 and w m3 are 87 5 14 6 16 9 17 1 and 9 8 cm respectively these results are in agreement with the results of badaruddin et al 2015 the results show that the value of x toe and x tip are slightly modified for these cases but there are significant changes noted on the width of the mixing zones increasing α l by 5 times changed the values of x toe from 87 5 cm in case 15 99 cm 13 increase in case 18 and x tip from 14 6 cm to 22 cm 1 5 times the values of w m1 are also changed from 16 9 cm in case 15 36 2 cm in case 18 214 increase w m2 from 17 1 cm to 34 3 doubled cm and w m3 from 9 8 cm to 22 4 cm 2 3 times from fig 6 it is obvious that under active si conditions increasing α l widened the mixing zone both at the lower and upper part of the wedge albeit the upper part was more sensitive to the change this potentially increases salinization at the water table the performance of the mixing zone in this condition is different from the previous results in steady state and passive si here all parts of 5 and 95 salinity contours were pushed inland and seaward respectively which results in the broad mixing zone fig 7 a b and c provide the comparison of salinity distribution between case 15 base case 3 and cases 19 20 and 21 the values of α t increased by 5 10 and 50 times in cases 19 20 and 21 respectively the figures show that in general the values of x toe decreased and the x tip increased with the increase of α t in cases 19 20 and 21 the x toe values are 83 5 cm 81 5 cm and 74 5 cm respectively and the x tip values are 16 1 cm 18 2 cm and 29 cm the widths of the mixing zones are increased with the increase of α t these results imply that under active si conditions an increase of α t widened the mixing zones in all parts of the interface but in a different fashion compared to the change of longitudinal dispersivity at this condition the shear effect of transversal dispersivity becomes more obvious pushing the mixing zone backward at the bottom and landward at the top which is also potentially increasing salinization at the water table 3 4 field scale model fig 8 provides the comparison of salinity distribution between a field base case and the cases with low and high dispersivities this result is taken from badaruddin et al 2017 to confirm the results obtained in this study aside from the type of aquifer which is unconfined the geometry of the coastal aquifer and the values of hydrologic parameters used in the field base case of the study mainly followed those in lu and werner 2013 the length of aquifer l l was 1000 m with h s of 30 m the coastal aquifer was assumed as homogeneous isotropic with a hydraulic conductivity k l t of 10 m d and an effective porosity n of 0 3 seawater and freshwater densities were 1025 kg m3 and 1000 kg m3 respectively 35 kg m3 salt concentration was considered for seawater boundary for the base case the longitudinal dispersivity was 1 m and the transverse dispersivity was one tenth of α l lu and werner 2013 abarca et al 2007 following jakovovic et al 2011 a molecular diffusivity d m l2 t of 8 64 10 5 m2 d was adopted fig 8 shows the effect of modifying dispersivity on active si it can be seen that higher dispersion values increasing both a l and a t led to rates of interface movement that were lower at the toe but higher at the tip thereby increasing the saltwater wedge steepness and resulted in mixing zone widths that were larger both at the toe and tip these results are in good agreement with the results gained in cases 15 to 18 this is also consistent with the steady state si findings of kerrou and renard 2010 who found that stronger dispersion leads to decreased density contrasts due to the wider mixing zone this condition causes rotation of the mixing zone alignment such that the interface toe moves seaward relative to the interface tip 4 conclusion in this research work the individual effect of mechanical dispersivities i e longitudinal and transversal on the freshwater saltwater interface profile was investigated using numerical model of seawat the results of this study highlight the role of these two parameters in shaping the extent of seawater intrusion especially under active state which was not studied in detail at the previous works of literature based on the results of numerical modelling the individual effect of longitudinal and transversal dispersivities on mixing zone s profile under steady state si are in accordance with the results of previous studies under steady state si conditions an increase of longitudinal dispersivity widens the lower part of the mixing zone while an increase of transversal dispersivity widens the mixing zone in all part of the saltwater wedge and the same phenomenon was observed on the results of transient passive si conditions under transient active si condition both an increase of longitudinal and transversal dispersivities may increase the width of the mixing zones in all part of the freshwater saltwater interface but in different fashion this implies that both longitudinal and transversal dispersivity are significantly important in controlling the width of the mixing zone and each of this parameter cannot be neglected in numerical model the result of this research is useful as guidance in solute transport modelling at least to identify the effect of mechanical dispersion involved in affecting the results of numerical modelling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

11907,this study explored the possible repercussions of water table reduction on the activity of faults in california usa the statistical period was regarded between 1972 and 2020 the cross correlation and dynamic analysis were performed on the constructed time series of the number and magnitude of the earthquakes the cross correlation results indicated a correlation between faults activity and water table fluctuations the dynamic analysis results of the monthly earthquake numbers indicated that declining groundwater levels produced irregularities and the conversion of periodicity in the time series moreover chaos and sensitivity to the initial conditions were diminished while the randomness in time series developed m increased from 6 to 7 additionally the correlation and long range persistency in time series were reduced h 2 decreased from 0 6493 to 0 6304 furthermore the number of earthquakes in a month and multifractality were limited for δ h from 1 8557 to 1 1701 and δ α from 2 0726 to 1 3743 the dynamic analysis results of the earthquake magnitude time series suggested that the periodicity and predictability were reduced while irregularities and randomness in time series were extended moreover long memory correlation and multifractal characteristics in time series were diminished for h 2 from 0 9506 to 0 6310 δ h from 0 1277 to 0 0536 and δ α from 0 27 to 0 1665 besides the possibilities of large and small earthquakes were balanced while the probability of an earthquake of a greater magnitude shifted the cross correlation results were consistent with the dynamic analysis findings and confirmed water table reduction correlation with faults seismic activity in summary seismicity pattern rates and magnitude was altered due to a reduction in water table graphical abstract image 1 keywords autocorrelation power spectrum correlation dimension multifractal mf dfa san andreas fault cross correlation 1 introduction the effects of

2020 some of which have been proven to be instrumental estimating the maximum potential earthquake magnitude or the number of earthquakes is essential to assessing hazards and gaining a deeper perception of fault activities a potentially effective geohydrology component of fault activities is the groundwater level king et al 2006 research has been conducted on the impact of earthquakes on groundwater in terms of level and quality yan et al 2014 2020 lee et al 2019 weaver et al 2020 raj paudel et al 2018 nakagawa et al 2019 li et al 2020 gonzález et al 2012 chia et al 2001 hosonoa and

california usa experiences many earthquakes every year the most significant fault in california is the san andreas as most earthquakes recorded in california are generated by the san andreas fault thus it seems important to study the effects of diverse factors on fault activity in terms of intensifying or relaxing fault activity or the natural process of discharge or accumulation of stress specifically the impact of water table variations on fault activity has been evaluated by the present study a dynamic study of a fault seismic activity can reveal hidden patterns in fault behavior for instance fractal studies on the gutenberg richter relation proved that earthquakes exhibit fractal behavior fractal patterns rundle et al 2003 a multifractal analysis is a robust practical and valuable mechanism that distinguishes characteristics and embedded dynamics in time series multifractality is a quality of numerous phenomena e g fault structure and seismic activities mandelbrot developed the multifractal theory in connection to chaos theory in the early 1970s the dynamics of the system can be explained using a singularity spectrum a continuous spectrum of exponents which results in a multifractal system or fractal dimension a single exponent which in turn results in a monofractal system wu et al 2018 according to multifractal theory the aggregate behavior of a time series is delineated by the hurst exponent the hurst exponent exerts the correlation qualities of a time series which is beneficial for identifying associations between various systems rego et al 2013 chianca et al 2005 if the number or magnitude of recorded earthquakes in a month are given as a time series then the multifractal theory can be used to investigate the nonlinear dynamic properties of the time series to understand the hidden dynamics of fault activities this study aimed to investigate the dynamic characteristics of a monthly earthquake number time series and an earthquake magnitude time series the study also involves an assessment of the potential water table variations impact on san andreas fault activity we addressed these questions that whether the groundwater level water table reduction or augmentation led to significant changes in the seismic patterns of the faults in the study area besides whether changes in the seismic patterns of the faults were related to the increments of groundwater depth to the surface to achieve the objectives of this study cross correlation correlation dimension power spectrum autocorrelation and multifractal theory mf dfa were adopted first the earthquake magnitude time series and monthly earthquake number time series were constructed second the cross correlation between groundwater level and fault seismic activity and the trend of groundwater level fluctuations was examined the statistical period was then classified into two intervals of twenty and eighteen years 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 and dynamic analysis was performed on time series for each statistical interval in section 2 details regarding the study area and data sources are provided in section 3 the theoretical and analytical multifractal analysis

region is the san andreas fault the san andreas fault is the sliding boundary between the pacific and the north american plates the fault motion type is right lateral strike slip the san andreas fault is a continental transform fault from a geological view that extends approximately 1200 km from north to south of california fig 1 the reported slip rate along the fault differs by 20 35 mm per year according to the california institute of technology data for the magnitude and number of earthquakes in california for 48 years 1972 2020 was subdivided into two intervals 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 only earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 2 5 were selected the average earthquake magnitude in the statistical period was 2 92 and the average monthly earthquake number was 119 earthquake data was extracted from www usgs gov https www usgs gov natural hazards earthquake hazards lists maps and statistics eight hydrometric stations were randomly selected across california to scrutinize the trend

autocorrelation is a signal correlation associated with a delayed copy of itself functioning as a delay in other words it is the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them autocorrelation offers a view to distinguish between periodic and stochastic behavior of a signal time series the autocorrelation is periodic when a signal is periodic whereas in a stochastic signal the autocorrelation is irregular the autocorrelation function is defined as follows eq 1 1 c j 1 n i 1 n u i u i j a linear correlation between data points is provided by the autocorrelation function 3 2 power spectrum a common definition of the power spectrum is the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function and a common method to calculate the power spectrum is the direct approach this method is based on the energy contained in x t associated with the magnitude of x t signal squared integrated over time and the power spectrum can be estimated as the magnitude squared of the fourier series related to a waveform of interest semmlow 2012 eq 2 for further details see semmlow 2012 2 p s f x f 2 3 3 correlation dimension the correlation dimension is commonly used to review or distinguish a deterministic or random process the correlation dimension was first introduced by grassberger and procaccia 1983a 1983b the dimension is used to understand the system complexity and the required variables to describe a system it can utilize the phase space to make an estimation of the relative frequency with which the attractor visits each covering element for a chaotic system fractal and the correlation dimensions are approximately equal tsonis 1992 unfolded trajectories in a sufficient space one has to consider to deal with the correlation dimension a time series can be reconstructed by an embedding dimension m with selecting a proper time delay d represents the space dimension in the correlation integral c r and c r r d is valid the correlation dimension d is estimated as follows by taking a logarithm to the correlation dimension is shown as follows eq 3 3 d lim r 0 log c r log r in a chaotic system the graph of the correlation dimension saturates at a particular level that level is the minimum embedding dimension to describe the system the embedding dimensions in this study 2 to 20 is employed to test the minimum dimension required to explain a non linear dynamic system a low dimensionality and parsimonious system are desirable and larger m values are necessarily unevaluated complexity in a system represents randomness that bigger values of m demonstrate complexity therefore the system with lower m is preferable a system with minimal values of m is deterministic and chaos concomitant of certainty accordingly in this study lower m is investigated for further details see rosenberg 2020 3 4 multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis mf dfa the mf dfa method is a practical tool for measuring the multifractal characteristics of a time series consider the time series x x τ τ 1 n where n time series length computational details are as follows mandelbrot et al 1997 movahed et al 2006 first the profile time series y y τ τ 1 n is calculated see eq 4 and y is divided into i s i n t n s such that no segment overlaps equal length s in the segmentation step n is not an integer multiple of the segmentation length s this could result in a profile time series tail discard the iteration of the above segmentation provided in the reverse order of y and the determination of 2 i s segments can eliminate the defect then each segment fluctuation is subtracted from eq 5 4 y τ k 1 τ x k x τ 1 2 n 5 f 2 ν s 1 s i 1 s y ν 1 s i y ν i 2 ν 1 2 n s for each n s of segments ν y ν i represents the best polynomial fit for y ν 1 s i in the present step the trends are eliminated via the profile polynomial fit the polynomial order m applied in the fitting procedure excludes the polynomial trend m 1 in the original series in the next step f 2 ν s is averaged through the entire set of segments by eq 6 6 f q s 1 n s ν 1 n s f 2 ν s q 2 1 q q 0 f 0 s e x p 1 2 n s ν 1 n s ln f 2 ν s q 0 finally the power law relationship between f q s and scale s is provided in eq 7 7 f q s s h q the log log plots of f q s s for each q value depict the scaling performance of the fluctuation function zhang et al 2019 when the least squares function method is employed the fitted ln f q s and ln s can be assessed and the generalized hurst exponent h q is estimated h q as the slope of the fitted ln f q s and ln s h q is a constant value when h q is independent of q this implies the monofractal behavior of the time series the time series can have multifractal characteristics when h q is particularly reliant on q values h q explicates the scaling behavior of the segments with large fluctuations if the q values are positive negative q values suggest a scaling behavior of segments with small fluctuations livina et al 2005 sun et al 2001 in 1951 hurst 1951 proposed the hurst exponent when q 2 in h q or h 2 to assess the long range correlation characteristics of the time series zhang et al 2008 h 0 5 indicates an uncorrelated time series while 0 5 h 1 denotes a long term persistence time series long range correlation or long memory and 0 h 0 5 represents an anti persistence time series short range correlation or anti memory zhang et al 2019 by the estimation of δh the intensity of the multifractality of a time series is measured as δ h h q m i n h q m a x 3 5 multifractal strength analysis the first step in regulating the multifractal strength of the time series is the calculation of the multifractal scaling exponent τ q which is found using eq 8 8 τ q q h q 1 the linear relationship in the τ q q graphs mass exponent illustrates a monofractal time series where a nonlinear relationship would indicate a multifractal time series the nonlinearity magnitude of the curves confirms the multifractal strength enhanced nonlinearity is correlated with stronger multifractality the singularity spectrum f α describes the multifractal components of a time series it is assessed based on the scaling exponent τ q and first order legendre transforms and registers the time series segment dimensions discriminated by α see eq 9 the width of f α denotes the strength of the multifractality in a time series essentially if f α is a single point the time series is monofractal 9 α τ q q f α α q τ q where α is perceived to be the hölder exponent singularity index the singularity index is utilized extensively to mark the degrees of the singularity of the time series three feasibilities are granted for α values if α 0 the distribution of the time series is uniform if α 1 the singularity degree is low finally if α 1 the singularity degree is high the width of f α is exposed by δ α and details related to the distribution evenness of the prospect of the fractal formation the higher the value of δ α α m a x α m i n the more substantial the multifractality and complexity of the time series it involves an asymmetrical time series with more severe fluctuations no standard strategy has been developed for collecting q based on the approaches used in previous studies the q range 10 10 was deemed to satisfy our research obligations zhang et al 2019 li et al 2015 yuan et al 2014 kantelhardt et al 2003 the time scale s was selected based on each time series length in steps of 1 the selected time scale value can be up to n 5 where n is the time series length in this study s considered s n 5 1 where s is an integer 3 6 cross correlation the cross correlation function can be applied to assess the similarity between a time series and lagged versions of another time series as a function of the lag suppose the time series y 1 a and y 2 a and lags l 0 1 2 for data pairs y 11 y 21 y 12 y 22 y 1 n y 2 n an estimate of the lag l cross covariance can be computed by eq 10 10 c y 1 y 2 1 n a 1 n l y 1 a y 1 y 2 a l y 2 l 0 1 2 1 n a 1 n l y 2 a y 2 y 1 a l y 1 l 0 1 2 where sample means of the time series are represented by y 1 and y 2 in the next step the sample standard deviations of the series are measured by eq 11 11 s y 1 c y 1 y 2 0 w h e r e c y 1 y 2 0 v a r y 1 s y 2 c y 2 y 2 0 w h e r e c y 2 y 2 0 v a r y 2 finally cross correlation is estimated by eq 12 12 r y 1 y 2 l c y 1

section 4 1 discovering the dependence of the fault s seismic activity on water table fluctuations the cross correlation technique was adopted to discover the concealed association between two time series the cross correlation technique detects correlation by considering a range of lags between the two time series before dynamic analysis of the influence of the water table reduction the groundwater level depth increment to the surface on fault activity the cross correlation technique was employed to discover the latent relationship between water table reduction and earthquake numbers and average magnitude in a month the issue of whether the groundwater level in the study area was declining will be discussed in the following section first the time series of the earthquake numbers per month and average of earthquake magnitude per month were constructed subsequently water table reduction as an independent variable and the monthly earthquake numbers and average of earthquake magnitude per month as dependent variables were considered to applying cross correlation on time series the cross correlation results are illustrated by fig 2 fig 2 indicated that water table reduction affected the earthquake numbers per month and the average of earthquake magnitude per month fig 2 a illustrates the cross correlation between the monthly earthquake numbers and water table reduction which showed that all stations had cross correlation it proved that water table reduction influenced monthly earthquake numbers the cross correlation between average of earthquake magnitude per month and water table reduction is illustrated by fig 2 b fig 2 b showed that all stations had cross correlation it verified alteration in the average magnitude of earthquakes per month owing to water table reduction the maximum recorded cross correlation between time series occurred at l a g 0 it demonstrated that the groundwater level water table reduction influenced the fault seismic activity with a delay of several months besides the groundwater level water table decline produced no immediate impact on the fault s seismic pattern the cross correlation results indicated that water table reduction influenced earthquake numbers and the average magnitude of earthquakes per month in addition to the eight stations listed in table 1 seven other stations were selected and cross correlation values were measured for them the results of which are given in the appendix see fig 1 in appendix the cross correlation results concerning seven new stations were similar to those of the eight stations mentioned in table 1 and confirmed the previous results the nonlinear dynamic analysis was performed to understand how the groundwater level reduction alters the seismic pattern of faults the results of which are presented following dynamic study of earthquake numbers and magnitude time series is beneficial to understand the faults behavior pattern the fault behavior pattern can be examined for a long timescale several centuries or a short timescale several decades this study offers a short timescale examination of the fault behavior pattern half a century shifts in the fault behavior in the short term can be due to fault structural factors e g the tectonic plates structure or non structural factors e g dam constructions water table reduction or augmentation the possible impact of water table reduction on fault seismic activity was investigated by the present study the fault activity time series earthquake numbers and magnitude exhibit constant dynamic characteristics during the entire statistical period whether the groundwater level water table diminishes or increases if the fault activity dynamics are independent of water table variations the non stationary fault activity dynamics due to variations in the water table reflect a relationship between fault activity and water table to study the possible connection and influences groundwater level reduction impacts on fault seismic activity the statistical period of fault activity was divided into two intervals first one from the beginning of the statistical period of fault activity to the beginning of the statistical period of water table data 1972 1992 no water table data were available before 1992 and the second one the rest of the statistical period of fault activity 1993 2020 as mentioned above fault activity dynamics concerning 1972 1992 regardless of whether the water table experiences a reduction or increment should be equal to the dynamic features of fault activity for 1993 2020 if so it proves that fault activity and groundwater level were independent and water table trend incremental or subtractive did not produce induced earthquakes has not changed fault behavior pattern conversely if the fault activity dynamics concerning 1972 1992 are distinct from those of 1993 2020 it is concluded that the reducing or increasing trend positive or negative of water table fluctuations led to induced earthquakes this comparison moreover indicates how and to what extent the reduction in groundwater level had affected the faults seismic patterns first the trend of water table variations examined using linear regression and the trend line slop estimation to begin with a groundwater level diagram was depicted and the linear regression and slope of each trend line was estimated fig 3 and table 2 as it can be noticed from fig 3 and table 2 as the depth of water below the land surface increased two stations b001s and e001s experienced a sharp rise in depth after 2006 fig 3 indicates that generally groundwater exploitation increased in the study area in particular between 2006 and 2020 famiglietti et al 2011 and scanlon et al 2012 also proved that water table lowered in the study area thus if the dynamic characteristics of the fault behavior pattern for 1993 2020 are distinct from 1972 to 1992 groundwater exploitation as a possible non structural factor of the fault can affect fault seismic pattern to understand origins and dynamical patterns in the fault activity seismicity the time series of the earthquake number and earthquake magnitude were constructed and multifractal theory was applied the dynamic analysis of time series was performed as follows tools power spectrum autocorrelation correlation dimension and multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis mf dfa were applied to study the time series of the number of monthly earthquakes additionally autocorrelation and multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis mf dfa were employed to study the time series of the earthquake magnitude first the time series of the number of monthly earthquakes were examined followed by the time series of earthquake magnitude 4 2 analysis of the time series of the monthly earthquake numbers in autocorrelation diagrams the autocorrelation crossing the standard lines signifies the autocorrelation of the time series over time the time series holding more autocorrelation was desired as illustrated in fig 4 the diagram of 1972 1992 the first interval held a higher autocorrelation value and more periodic behavior than the 1993 2020 time series the second interval fig 5 power spectrum reveals that on a small scale the time series of the second interval 1993 2020 consisted of more irregularities and drastic fluctuations than the first interval 1972 1992 this difference demonstrates the higher frequency of random behavior and the limited periodicity and predictability in the second interval time series moreover the second interval reflected less chaos and sensitivity to the initial condition from table 3 correlation dimension it can be seen that the time series of the first interval possessed a lower m value 6 than the second interval this suggests that the first time series 1972 1992 is more chaotic and sensitive to the initial condition than the second 1993 2020 it also held more stable dynamics the correlation dimension results confirmed the power spectrum and autocorrelation results the hurst exponent see table 3 was calculated before the multifractal analysis to explain the correlation attributes of the time series the hurst values table 3 explicated that the values were between 0 5 and 1 thus reflecting a long range correlation in both time series the hurst value of the time series of the first interval was larger than for the second interval revealing more major long memory or persistence in its time series the fluctuation function f q s with various q values was then evaluated using the mf dfa method the log scaling graphs of the qth f q s versus s for q are depicted in fig 6 this figure also shows that the curves of two time series 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 experienced incremental growth in the time scale range this increase which had been fitted with a straight line implied the multifractal behavior of the two time series fig 7 presents the graphs of h q q generalized fractal dimensions f α α singularity spectrum and τ q against q mass exponents for both intervals 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 it is clear from fig 7 a that the h q nonlinear monotonically diminished when the q values increased indicating the multifractal behavior of both time series 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 the time series of 1972 1992 had more multifractality i e it was more nonlinear due to the stronger dependency of hq on q values fig 7 b depicts the variation of scaling exponents τ q for the time series of the 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 intervals it was evident that an increase in q values led to an increase in τ q values as well indicating ample multifractality in both time series 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 the τ q of the 1993 2020 time series was deducted from q 8 onwards suggesting a loss in multifractality in the 1993 2020 time series and the presence of more multifractal characteristics in the 1972 1992 time series as depicted in fig 7 c the multifractal spectrum the graphs representing the 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 intervals display left side asymmetry and right side asymmetry respectively this confirms that both time series are characterized by multifractal properties it also suggests the high probability of high fluctuations occurring during the 1972 1992 time series and a high probability of low fluctuations occurring during the 1993 2020 time series this could be interpreted as a decrease in the number of monthly earthquakes to overcome the multifractal strength of the time series two multifractal elements δ h q a n d δ α the multifractal spectrum width were identified and implemented table 3 the value of δ h associated with the 1972 1992 time series was higher than that of the 1993 2020 time series the δ h value reflected that more potent multifractal characteristics are present in the 1972 1992 time series the δ α value of the 1972 1992 time series was greater than that of the 1993 2020 time series this signifies that the 1972 1992 time series has more influential multifractal behavior and more complexity than the 1993 2020 time series 4 3 analysis of the earthquake magnitude time series the autocorrelation of the earthquake magnitude time series for 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 is depicted in fig 8 the time series of 1972 1992 owns more autocorrelation and exhibits more periodic behavior it appears to contain fewer irregularities and randomness while the predictability of the 1993 2020 time series seems to have limited predictability and also displays more irregularities and randomness hurst exponent values are presented in table 4 the obtained hurst values ranged between 0 5 and 1 confirming the long range correlation in both time series 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 the value of the hurst exponent of the 1993 2020 time series was significantly smaller than that of the 1972 1992 time series this suggests that the time series of the first interval 1972 1992 possessed more robust long memory in other words it had more major long term persistence as it is manifested in fig 9 all points were fitted properly with a straight line in the log scaling graphs of the f q s versus s it reflected the multifractality of both time series 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 fig 10 presents graphs for h q q generalized fractal dimensions f α α singularity spectrum and τ q against q mass exponents for both time series 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 it is clear from fig 10 a that the h q nonlinearly diminished due to an improvement in q values thus indicating the multifractal behavior of both time series 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 the curve of the second interval 1993 2020 experienced an upward trend for 8 5 q 7 it involved a drastic reduction in multifractal behavior therefore the time series of the first interval contained more solid multifractal characteristics than that of the second interval fig 10 b portrays the variation of scaling exponents τ q for the time series of both the 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 intervals apparently an increase in q values caused τ q to increase as well suggesting that the time series of 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 both have ample multifractality the graphs for 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 displayed in fig 10 c the multifractal spectrum show symmetric and left side asymmetry sinuses respectively this confirms that both time series are characterized by multifractal properties additionally it reflects an equal probability of high and low fluctuations in the 1972 1992 time series and a high probability of high fluctuations in the 1993 2020 time series these findings could be interpreted as a change in the equal probability of minute and large earthquakes to the probability of considerable earthquakes the twist on top of the singularity spectrum of both time series reported the non monotonic behavior of h q q which is indicated in fig 10 a the twist intensity of the second time series curve was significantly greater than that of the first time series curve designating the substantial non uniform behavior of h q in the generalized fractal dimensions diagram for the second interval time series 1993 2020 concerning the multifractal strength of the time series the multifractal factors δ h q and δ α were given in table 4 the δ h value of the 1972 1992 time series was higher than that of the 1993 2020 time series this implies that the multifractal behavior in the 1972 1992 time series is stronger also the δ α value of the 1972 1992 time series was bigger than that of the 1993 2020 time series finally the time series of 1972 1992 offered more influential multifractal behavior and complexity the construction of a large number of dams in the study region was considered as another significant and influential factor the findings suggested that most of the completed dams and reservoirs in california were constructed before the first interval 1972 1992 the impact of dam and reservoirs construction on fault behavior after at least half a century seemed unlikely as the dam construction influence usually becomes apparent after two decades consequently the alteration in the multifractal characteristics and seismic pattern dynamics of california s fault due to dams and reservoirs construction seems inconceivable the cross correlation results indicated a correlation between groundwater level fluctuations and fault seismic activity so that the groundwater level reduction influenced faults seismic activity with a delay of several months moreover as the nonlinear dynamic results verified the fault activity dynamics were different for 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 and one factor increased irregularity and randomness in fault behavior earthquake numbers and magnitude the present study results revealed that the alteration in the fault s seismic pattern is either due to the tectonic plate structure fault structure or the augmentation of groundwater depth to the surface it is deduced from the findings that the water table reduction as a non structural factor affected the fault s seismic pattern moreover the declining negative trend of water table in the study region resulted in a shift in the fault behavior pattern and produced induced earthquakes inductively it has increased the number of weak earthquakes magnitude 5 5 and increased the major earthquake s magnitude magnitude 5 5 furthermore it produced irregularities in faults behavior and lowered seismic pattern predictability the results of the present study were confirmed by amos et al 2014 they suggested that moderation in the water table provoked a reduction in the long term effective normal stress maintained along the san andreas fault amos et al 2014 moreover it seems to have induced the long term seismicity rates of the fault 5 conclusion this study aimed to evaluate the possible effects of water table variations on the seismic activity of faults in california first the water table variation trend was estimated and the cross correlation was evaluated between groundwater level water table reduction and earthquake number and average magnitude per month subsequently the statistical period was divided into two intervals 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 lastly a dynamic analysis was performed on the constructed time series of the number and magnitude of earthquakes the analysis results of two intervals were then compared the trend analysis results show that generally the water table in california was diminished the cross correlation results indicated a dependency between groundwater level water table reduction and earthquake number and average magnitude per month in other words groundwater level reduction influenced faults seismic activity in the study area the nonlinear dynamic results confirmed that groundwater level reduction affected faults seismic activity the dynamic analysis results on the 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 time series concerning the monthly earthquake numbers revealed a decline in the time series correlation it indicated that an increase in the depth of the groundwater level from the land surface produced irregularities and reductions of periodicity in the time series moreover chaos and sensitivity to the initial condition were lessened while the random behavior of time series was developed additionally correlation and long range persistency in time series were lowered furthermore the number of earthquakes in a month and multifractal behavior were lessened a comparison of the analysis results of the earthquake magnitude time series for the 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 intervals made it evident that the periodicity and predictability were limited while irregularities and random behavior in time series augmented moreover long memory correlation and multifractal characteristics in time series were reduced in addition the possibilities of large and small earthquakes occurring were balanced the possibility of earthquakes with greater magnitudes shifted in other words the faults produced earthquakes of more moderate magnitudes over time while the magnitude of major earthquakes became larger on average than in the past the nonlinear dynamic analysis results confirmed the cross correlation findings concerning the association between groundwater level water table reduction and earthquake number and average magnitude per month the dynamic analysis demonstrated that the reduction in groundwater level water table generated a significant alteration in the fault s seismicity pattern it seemed that the reduction in water table lowered periodicity and predictability and augmented irregularities and randomness in faults seismic behavior besides it led to variations in seismicity rates and boosted the probability of major earthquakes due to the accumulation of energy in the fault in summary seismicity pattern rates and magnitudes was modified due to decreased water table it is suggested that future studies can focus on the structure of the san andreas fault to investigate the seismic pattern changes root of the fault from tectonic plates point of view the results will prove whether only the water table variations contributed to the seismic pattern alteration or the fault structural characteristics are also involved declarations funding this

11907,this study explored the possible repercussions of water table reduction on the activity of faults in california usa the statistical period was regarded between 1972 and 2020 the cross correlation and dynamic analysis were performed on the constructed time series of the number and magnitude of the earthquakes the cross correlation results indicated a correlation between faults activity and water table fluctuations the dynamic analysis results of the monthly earthquake numbers indicated that declining groundwater levels produced irregularities and the conversion of periodicity in the time series moreover chaos and sensitivity to the initial conditions were diminished while the randomness in time series developed m increased from 6 to 7 additionally the correlation and long range persistency in time series were reduced h 2 decreased from 0 6493 to 0 6304 furthermore the number of earthquakes in a month and multifractality were limited for δ h from 1 8557 to 1 1701 and δ α from 2 0726 to 1 3743 the dynamic analysis results of the earthquake magnitude time series suggested that the periodicity and predictability were reduced while irregularities and randomness in time series were extended moreover long memory correlation and multifractal characteristics in time series were diminished for h 2 from 0 9506 to 0 6310 δ h from 0 1277 to 0 0536 and δ α from 0 27 to 0 1665 besides the possibilities of large and small earthquakes were balanced while the probability of an earthquake of a greater magnitude shifted the cross correlation results were consistent with the dynamic analysis findings and confirmed water table reduction correlation with faults seismic activity in summary seismicity pattern rates and magnitude was altered due to a reduction in water table graphical abstract image 1 keywords autocorrelation power spectrum correlation dimension multifractal mf dfa san andreas fault cross correlation 1 introduction the effects of

2020 some of which have been proven to be instrumental estimating the maximum potential earthquake magnitude or the number of earthquakes is essential to assessing hazards and gaining a deeper perception of fault activities a potentially effective geohydrology component of fault activities is the groundwater level king et al 2006 research has been conducted on the impact of earthquakes on groundwater in terms of level and quality yan et al 2014 2020 lee et al 2019 weaver et al 2020 raj paudel et al 2018 nakagawa et al 2019 li et al 2020 gonzález et al 2012 chia et al 2001 hosonoa and

california usa experiences many earthquakes every year the most significant fault in california is the san andreas as most earthquakes recorded in california are generated by the san andreas fault thus it seems important to study the effects of diverse factors on fault activity in terms of intensifying or relaxing fault activity or the natural process of discharge or accumulation of stress specifically the impact of water table variations on fault activity has been evaluated by the present study a dynamic study of a fault seismic activity can reveal hidden patterns in fault behavior for instance fractal studies on the gutenberg richter relation proved that earthquakes exhibit fractal behavior fractal patterns rundle et al 2003 a multifractal analysis is a robust practical and valuable mechanism that distinguishes characteristics and embedded dynamics in time series multifractality is a quality of numerous phenomena e g fault structure and seismic activities mandelbrot developed the multifractal theory in connection to chaos theory in the early 1970s the dynamics of the system can be explained using a singularity spectrum a continuous spectrum of exponents which results in a multifractal system or fractal dimension a single exponent which in turn results in a monofractal system wu et al 2018 according to multifractal theory the aggregate behavior of a time series is delineated by the hurst exponent the hurst exponent exerts the correlation qualities of a time series which is beneficial for identifying associations between various systems rego et al 2013 chianca et al 2005 if the number or magnitude of recorded earthquakes in a month are given as a time series then the multifractal theory can be used to investigate the nonlinear dynamic properties of the time series to understand the hidden dynamics of fault activities this study aimed to investigate the dynamic characteristics of a monthly earthquake number time series and an earthquake magnitude time series the study also involves an assessment of the potential water table variations impact on san andreas fault activity we addressed these questions that whether the groundwater level water table reduction or augmentation led to significant changes in the seismic patterns of the faults in the study area besides whether changes in the seismic patterns of the faults were related to the increments of groundwater depth to the surface to achieve the objectives of this study cross correlation correlation dimension power spectrum autocorrelation and multifractal theory mf dfa were adopted first the earthquake magnitude time series and monthly earthquake number time series were constructed second the cross correlation between groundwater level and fault seismic activity and the trend of groundwater level fluctuations was examined the statistical period was then classified into two intervals of twenty and eighteen years 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 and dynamic analysis was performed on time series for each statistical interval in section 2 details regarding the study area and data sources are provided in section 3 the theoretical and analytical multifractal analysis correlation dimension power spectrum cross correlation and autocorrelation are discussed the results of the analysis are presented in section 4 lastly in section 5 the summary and conclusion are provided 2 study area and data sources the study area was the state of california usa california has experienced many earthquakes every year the most influential determinant of earthquakes in this region is the san andreas fault the san andreas fault is the sliding boundary between the pacific and the north american plates the fault motion type is right lateral strike slip the san andreas fault is a continental transform fault from a geological view that extends approximately 1200 km from north to south of california fig 1 the reported slip rate along the fault differs by 20 35 mm per year according to the california institute of technology data for the magnitude and number of earthquakes in california for 48 years 1972 2020 was subdivided into two intervals 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 only earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 2 5 were selected the average earthquake magnitude in the statistical period was 2 92 and the average monthly earthquake number was 119 earthquake data was extracted from www usgs gov https www usgs gov natural hazards earthquake hazards lists maps and statistics eight hydrometric stations were randomly selected across california to scrutinize the trend of groundwater level changes stations were selected to include the most statistical data water table statistics were taken from 1992 to 2020 the details of the selected stations were implemented in table 1 there is a usgs groundwater archive including thirty five models modeling all accessible groundwater groundwater systems across the california state the models details are provided in the following website link https ca water usgs gov sustainable groundwater management california groundwater modeling html the map of the san andreas fault and groundwater systems in california is shown in fig 1 the largest and tiniest water reservoirs are the central valley and the bicycle basin in the fort irwin national training center respectively the central valley in california covers 51 800 square kilometers is considered one of the most productive agricultural areas in the us approximately one fifth of the groundwater pumpage in the us concerning this area the details concerning the

autocorrelation is a signal correlation associated with a delayed copy of itself functioning as a delay in other words it is the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them autocorrelation offers a view to distinguish between periodic and stochastic behavior of a signal time series the autocorrelation is periodic when a signal is periodic whereas in a stochastic signal the autocorrelation is irregular the autocorrelation function is defined as follows eq 1 1 c j 1 n i 1 n u i u i j a linear correlation between data points is provided by the autocorrelation function 3 2 power spectrum a common definition of the power spectrum is the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function and a common method to calculate the power spectrum is the direct approach this method is based on the energy contained in x t associated with the magnitude of x t signal squared integrated over time and the power spectrum can be estimated as the magnitude squared of the fourier series related to a waveform of interest semmlow 2012 eq 2 for further details see semmlow 2012 2 p s f x f 2 3 3 correlation dimension the correlation dimension is commonly used to review or distinguish a deterministic or random process the correlation dimension was first introduced by grassberger and procaccia 1983a 1983b the dimension is used to understand the system complexity and the required variables to describe a system it can utilize the phase space to make an estimation of the relative frequency with which the attractor visits each covering element for a chaotic system fractal and the correlation dimensions are approximately equal tsonis 1992 unfolded trajectories in a sufficient space one has to consider to deal with the correlation dimension a time series can be reconstructed by an embedding dimension m with selecting a proper time delay d represents the space dimension in the correlation integral c r and c r r d is valid the correlation dimension d is estimated as follows by taking a logarithm to the correlation dimension is shown as follows eq 3 3 d lim r 0 log c r log r in a chaotic system the graph of the correlation dimension saturates at a particular level that level is the minimum embedding dimension to describe the system the embedding dimensions in this study 2 to 20 is employed to test the minimum dimension required to explain a non linear dynamic system a low dimensionality and parsimonious system are desirable and larger m values are necessarily unevaluated complexity in a system represents randomness that bigger values of m demonstrate complexity therefore the system with lower m is preferable a system with minimal values of m is deterministic and chaos concomitant of certainty accordingly in this study lower m is investigated for further details see rosenberg 2020 3 4 multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis mf dfa the mf dfa method is a practical tool for measuring the multifractal characteristics of a time series consider the time series x x τ τ 1 n where n time series length computational details are as follows mandelbrot et al 1997 movahed et al 2006 first the profile time series y y τ τ 1 n is calculated see eq 4 and y is divided into i s i n t n s such that no segment overlaps equal length s in the segmentation step n is not an integer multiple of the segmentation length s this could result in a profile time series tail discard the iteration of the above segmentation provided in the reverse order of y and the determination of 2 i s segments can eliminate the defect then each segment fluctuation is subtracted from eq 5 4 y τ k 1 τ x k x τ 1 2 n 5 f 2 ν s 1 s i 1 s y ν 1 s i y ν i 2 ν 1 2 n s for each n s of segments ν y ν i represents the best polynomial fit for y ν 1 s i in the present step the trends are eliminated via the profile polynomial fit the polynomial order m applied in the fitting procedure excludes the polynomial trend m 1 in the original series in the next step f 2 ν s is averaged through the entire set of segments by eq 6 6 f q s 1 n s ν 1 n s f 2 ν s q 2 1 q q 0 f 0 s e x p 1 2 n s ν 1 n s ln f 2 ν s q 0 finally the power law relationship between f q s and scale s is provided in eq 7 7 f q s s h q the log log plots of f q s s for each q value depict the scaling performance of the fluctuation function zhang et al 2019 when the least squares function method is employed the fitted ln f q s and ln s can be assessed and the generalized hurst exponent h q is estimated h q as the slope of the fitted ln f q s and ln s h q is a constant value when h q is independent of q this implies the monofractal behavior of the time series the time series can have multifractal characteristics when h q is particularly reliant on q values h q explicates the scaling behavior of the segments with large fluctuations if the q values are positive negative q values suggest a scaling behavior of segments with small fluctuations livina et al 2005 sun et al 2001 in 1951 hurst 1951 proposed the hurst exponent when q 2 in h q or h 2 to assess the long range correlation characteristics of the time series zhang et al 2008 h 0 5 indicates an uncorrelated time series while 0 5 h 1 denotes a long term persistence time series long range correlation or long memory and 0 h 0 5 represents an anti persistence time series short range correlation or anti memory zhang et al 2019 by the estimation of δh the intensity of the multifractality of a time series is measured as δ h h q m i n h q m a x 3 5 multifractal strength analysis the first step in regulating the multifractal strength of the time series is the calculation of the multifractal scaling exponent τ q which is found using eq 8 8 τ q q h q 1 the linear relationship in the τ q q graphs mass exponent illustrates a monofractal time series where a nonlinear relationship would indicate a multifractal time series the nonlinearity magnitude of the curves confirms the multifractal strength enhanced nonlinearity is correlated with stronger multifractality the singularity spectrum f α describes the multifractal components of a time series it is assessed based on the scaling exponent τ q and first order legendre transforms and registers the time series segment dimensions discriminated by α see eq 9 the width of f α denotes the strength of the multifractality in a time series essentially if f α is a single point the time series is monofractal 9 α τ q q f α α q τ q where α is perceived to be the hölder exponent singularity index the singularity index is utilized extensively to mark the degrees of the singularity of the time series three feasibilities are granted for α values if α 0 the distribution of the time series is uniform if α 1 the singularity degree is low finally if α 1 the singularity degree is high the width of f α is exposed by δ α and details related to the distribution evenness of the prospect of the fractal formation the higher the value of δ α α m a x α m i n the more substantial the multifractality and complexity of the time series it involves an asymmetrical time series with more severe fluctuations no standard strategy has been developed for collecting q based on the approaches used in previous studies the q range 10 10 was deemed to satisfy our research obligations zhang et al 2019 li et al 2015 yuan et al 2014 kantelhardt et al 2003 the time scale s was selected based on each time series length in steps of 1 the selected time scale value can be up to n 5 where n is the time series length in this study s considered s n 5 1 where s is an integer 3 6 cross correlation the cross correlation function can be applied to assess the similarity between a time series and lagged versions of another time series as a function of the lag suppose the time series y 1 a and y 2 a and lags l 0 1 2 for data pairs y 11 y 21 y 12 y 22 y 1 n y 2 n an estimate of the lag l cross covariance can be computed by eq 10 10 c y 1 y 2 1 n a 1 n l y 1 a y 1 y 2 a l y 2 l 0 1 2 1 n a 1 n l y 2 a y 2 y 1 a l y 1 l 0 1 2 where sample means of the time series are represented by y 1 and y 2 in the next step the sample standard deviations of the series are measured by eq 11 11 s y 1 c y 1 y 2 0 w h e r e c y 1 y 2 0 v a r y 1 s y 2 c y 2 y 2 0 w h e r e c y 2 y 2 0 v a r y 2 finally cross correlation is estimated by eq 12 12 r y 1 y 2 l c y 1 y 2 l s y 1 s y 2 l 0 1 2 4 results and discussion all results concerning dynamic analysis and dependence of the fault s seismic activity on water table fluctuations are going to be discussed in this section 4 1 discovering the dependence of the fault s seismic activity on water table fluctuations the cross correlation technique was adopted to discover the concealed association between two time series the cross correlation technique detects correlation by considering a range of lags between the two time series before dynamic analysis of the influence of the water table reduction the groundwater level depth increment to the surface on fault activity the cross correlation technique was employed to discover the latent relationship between water table reduction and earthquake numbers and average magnitude in a month the issue of whether the groundwater level in the study area was declining will be discussed in the following section first the time series of the earthquake numbers per month and average of earthquake magnitude per month were constructed subsequently water table reduction as an independent variable and the monthly earthquake numbers and average of earthquake magnitude per month as dependent variables were considered to applying cross correlation on time series the cross correlation results are illustrated by fig 2 fig 2 indicated that water table reduction affected the earthquake numbers per month and the average of earthquake magnitude per month fig 2 a illustrates the cross correlation between the monthly earthquake numbers and water table reduction which showed that all stations had cross correlation it proved that water table reduction influenced monthly earthquake numbers the cross correlation between average of earthquake magnitude per month and water table reduction is illustrated by fig 2 b fig 2 b showed that all stations had cross correlation it verified alteration in the average magnitude of earthquakes per month owing to water table reduction the maximum recorded cross correlation between time series occurred at l a g 0 it demonstrated that the groundwater level water table reduction influenced the fault seismic activity with a delay of several months besides the groundwater level water table decline produced no immediate impact on the fault s seismic pattern the cross correlation results indicated that water table reduction influenced earthquake numbers and the average magnitude of earthquakes per month in addition to the eight stations listed in table 1 seven other stations were selected and cross correlation values were measured for them the results of which are given in the appendix see fig 1 in appendix the cross correlation results concerning seven new stations were similar to those of the eight stations mentioned in table 1 and confirmed the previous results the nonlinear dynamic analysis was performed to understand how the groundwater level reduction alters the seismic pattern of faults the results of which are presented following dynamic study of earthquake numbers and magnitude time series is beneficial to understand the faults behavior pattern the fault behavior pattern can be examined for a long timescale several centuries or a short timescale several decades this study offers a short timescale examination of the fault behavior pattern half a century shifts in the fault behavior in the short term can be due to fault structural factors e g the tectonic plates structure or non structural factors e g dam constructions water table reduction or augmentation the possible impact of water table reduction on fault seismic activity was investigated by the present study the fault activity time series earthquake numbers and magnitude exhibit constant dynamic characteristics during the entire statistical period whether the groundwater level water table diminishes or increases if the fault activity dynamics are independent of water table variations the non stationary fault activity dynamics due to variations in the water table reflect a relationship between fault activity and water table to study the possible connection and influences groundwater level reduction impacts on fault seismic activity the statistical period of fault activity was divided into two intervals first one from the beginning of the statistical period of fault activity to the beginning of the statistical period of water table data 1972 1992 no water table data were available before 1992 and the second one the rest of the statistical period of fault activity 1993 2020 as mentioned above fault activity dynamics concerning 1972 1992 regardless of whether the water table experiences a reduction or increment should be equal to the dynamic features of fault activity for 1993 2020 if so it proves that fault activity and groundwater level were independent and water table trend incremental or subtractive did not produce induced earthquakes has not changed fault behavior pattern conversely if the fault activity dynamics concerning 1972 1992 are distinct from those of 1993 2020 it is concluded that the reducing or increasing trend positive or negative of water table fluctuations led to induced earthquakes this comparison moreover indicates how and to what extent the reduction in groundwater level had affected the faults seismic patterns first the trend of water table variations examined using linear regression and the trend line slop estimation to begin with a groundwater level diagram was depicted and the linear regression and slope of each trend line was estimated fig 3 and table 2 as it can be noticed from fig 3 and table 2 as the depth of water below the land surface increased two stations b001s and e001s experienced a sharp rise in depth after 2006 fig 3 indicates that generally groundwater exploitation increased in the study area in particular between 2006 and 2020 famiglietti et al 2011 and scanlon et al 2012 also proved that water table lowered in the study area thus if the dynamic characteristics of the fault behavior pattern for 1993 2020 are distinct from 1972 to 1992 groundwater exploitation as a possible non structural factor of the fault can affect fault seismic pattern to understand origins and dynamical patterns in the fault activity seismicity the time series of the earthquake number and earthquake magnitude were constructed and multifractal theory was applied the dynamic analysis of time series was performed as follows tools power spectrum autocorrelation correlation dimension and multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis mf dfa were applied to study the time series of the number of monthly earthquakes additionally autocorrelation and multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis mf dfa were employed to study the time series of the earthquake magnitude first the time series of the number of monthly earthquakes were examined followed by the time series of earthquake magnitude 4 2 analysis of the time series of the monthly earthquake numbers in autocorrelation diagrams the autocorrelation crossing the standard lines signifies the autocorrelation of the time series over time the time series holding more autocorrelation was desired as illustrated in fig 4 the diagram of 1972 1992 the first interval held a higher autocorrelation value and more periodic behavior than the 1993 2020 time series the second interval fig 5 power spectrum reveals that on a small scale the time series of the second interval 1993 2020 consisted of more irregularities and drastic fluctuations than the first interval 1972 1992 this difference demonstrates the higher frequency of random behavior and the limited periodicity and predictability in the second interval time series moreover the second interval reflected less chaos and sensitivity to the initial condition from table 3 correlation dimension it can be seen that the time series of the first interval possessed a lower m value 6 than the second interval this suggests that the first time series 1972 1992 is more chaotic and sensitive to the initial condition than the second 1993 2020 it also held more stable dynamics the correlation dimension results confirmed the power spectrum and autocorrelation results the hurst exponent see table 3 was calculated before the multifractal analysis to explain the correlation attributes of the time series the hurst values table 3 explicated that the values were between 0 5 and 1 thus reflecting a long range correlation in both time series the hurst value of the time series of the first interval was larger than for the second interval revealing more major long memory or persistence in its time series the fluctuation function f q s with various q values was then evaluated using the mf dfa method the log scaling graphs of the qth f q s versus s for q are depicted in fig 6 this figure also shows that the curves of two time series 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 experienced incremental growth in the time scale range this increase which had been fitted with a straight line implied the multifractal behavior of the two time series fig 7 presents the graphs of h q q generalized fractal dimensions f α α singularity spectrum and τ q against q mass exponents for both intervals 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 it is clear from fig 7 a that the h q nonlinear monotonically diminished when the q values increased indicating the multifractal behavior of both time series 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 the time series of 1972 1992 had more multifractality i e it was more nonlinear due to the stronger dependency of hq on q values fig 7 b depicts the variation of scaling exponents τ q for the time series of the 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 intervals it was evident that an increase in q values led to an increase in τ q values as well indicating ample multifractality in both time series 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 the τ q of the 1993 2020 time series was deducted from q 8 onwards suggesting a loss in multifractality in the 1993 2020 time series and the presence of more multifractal characteristics in the 1972 1992 time series as depicted in fig 7 c the multifractal spectrum the graphs representing the 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 intervals display left side asymmetry and right side asymmetry respectively this confirms that both time series are characterized by multifractal properties it also suggests the high probability of high fluctuations occurring during the 1972 1992 time series and a high probability of low fluctuations occurring during the 1993 2020 time series this could be interpreted as a decrease in the number of monthly earthquakes to overcome the multifractal strength of the time series two multifractal elements δ h q a n d δ α the multifractal spectrum width were identified and implemented table 3 the value of δ h associated with the 1972 1992 time series was higher than that of the 1993 2020 time series the δ h value reflected that more potent multifractal characteristics are present in the 1972 1992 time series the δ α value of the 1972 1992 time series was greater than that of the 1993 2020 time series this signifies that the 1972 1992 time series has more influential multifractal behavior and more complexity than the 1993 2020 time series 4 3 analysis of the earthquake magnitude time series the autocorrelation of the earthquake magnitude time series for 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 is depicted in fig 8 the time series of 1972 1992 owns more autocorrelation and exhibits more periodic behavior it appears to contain fewer irregularities and randomness while the predictability of the 1993 2020 time series seems to have limited predictability and also displays more irregularities and randomness hurst exponent values are presented in table 4 the obtained hurst values ranged between 0 5 and 1 confirming the long range correlation in both time series 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 the value of the hurst exponent of the 1993 2020 time series was significantly smaller than that of the 1972 1992 time series this suggests that the time series of the first interval 1972 1992 possessed more robust long memory in other words it had more major long term persistence as it is manifested in fig 9 all points were fitted properly with a straight line in the log scaling graphs of the f q s versus s it reflected the multifractality of both time series 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 fig 10 presents graphs for h q q generalized fractal dimensions f α α singularity spectrum and τ q against q mass exponents for both time series 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 it is clear from fig 10 a that the h q nonlinearly diminished due to an improvement in q values thus indicating the multifractal behavior of both time series 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 the curve of the second interval 1993 2020 experienced an upward trend for 8 5 q 7 it involved a drastic reduction in multifractal behavior therefore the time series of the first interval contained more solid multifractal characteristics than that of the second interval fig 10 b portrays the variation of scaling exponents τ q for the time series of both the 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 intervals apparently an increase in q values caused τ q to increase as well suggesting that the time series of 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 both have ample multifractality the graphs for 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 displayed in fig 10 c the multifractal spectrum show symmetric and left side asymmetry sinuses respectively this confirms that both time series are characterized by multifractal properties additionally it reflects an equal probability of high and low fluctuations in the 1972 1992 time series and a high probability of high fluctuations in the 1993 2020 time series these findings could be interpreted as a change in the equal probability of minute and large earthquakes to the probability of considerable earthquakes the twist on top of the singularity spectrum of both time series reported the non monotonic behavior of h q q which is indicated in fig 10 a the twist intensity of the second time series curve was significantly greater than that of the first time series curve designating the substantial non uniform behavior of h q in the generalized fractal dimensions diagram for the second interval time series 1993 2020 concerning the multifractal strength of the time series the multifractal factors δ h q and δ α were given in table 4 the δ h value of the 1972 1992 time series was higher than that of the 1993 2020 time series this implies that the multifractal behavior in the 1972 1992 time series is stronger also the δ α value of the 1972 1992 time series was bigger than that of the 1993 2020 time series finally the time series of 1972 1992 offered more influential multifractal behavior and complexity the construction of a large number of dams in the study region was considered as another significant and influential factor the findings suggested that most of the completed dams and reservoirs in california were constructed before the first interval 1972 1992 the impact of dam and reservoirs construction on fault behavior after at least half a century seemed unlikely as the dam construction influence usually becomes apparent after two decades consequently the alteration in the multifractal characteristics and seismic pattern dynamics of california s fault due to dams and reservoirs construction seems inconceivable the cross correlation results indicated a correlation between groundwater level fluctuations and fault seismic activity so that the groundwater level reduction influenced faults seismic activity with a delay of several months moreover as the nonlinear dynamic results verified the fault activity dynamics were different for 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 and one factor increased irregularity and randomness in fault behavior earthquake numbers and magnitude the present study results revealed that the alteration in the fault s seismic pattern is either due to the tectonic plate structure fault structure or the augmentation of groundwater depth to the surface it is deduced from the findings that the water table reduction as a non structural factor affected the fault s seismic pattern moreover the declining negative trend of water table in the study region resulted in a shift in the fault behavior pattern and produced induced earthquakes inductively it has increased the number of weak earthquakes magnitude 5 5 and increased the major earthquake s magnitude magnitude 5 5 furthermore it produced irregularities in faults behavior and lowered seismic pattern predictability the results of the present study were confirmed by amos et al 2014 they suggested that moderation in the water table provoked a reduction in the long term effective normal stress maintained along the san andreas fault amos et al 2014 moreover it seems to have induced the long term seismicity rates of the fault 5 conclusion this study aimed to evaluate the possible effects of water table variations on the seismic activity of faults in california first the water table variation trend was estimated and the cross correlation was evaluated between groundwater level water table reduction and earthquake number and average magnitude per month subsequently the statistical period was divided into two intervals 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 lastly a dynamic analysis was performed on the constructed time series of the number and magnitude of earthquakes the analysis results of two intervals were then compared the trend analysis results show that generally the water table in california was diminished the cross correlation results indicated a dependency between groundwater level water table reduction and earthquake number and average magnitude per month in other words groundwater level reduction influenced faults seismic activity in the study area the nonlinear dynamic results confirmed that groundwater level reduction affected faults seismic activity the dynamic analysis results on the 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 time series concerning the monthly earthquake numbers revealed a decline in the time series correlation it indicated that an increase in the depth of the groundwater level from the land surface produced irregularities and reductions of periodicity in the time series moreover chaos and sensitivity to the initial condition were lessened while the random behavior of time series was developed additionally correlation and long range persistency in time series were lowered furthermore the number of earthquakes in a month and multifractal behavior were lessened a comparison of the analysis results of the earthquake magnitude time series for the 1972 1992 and 1993 2020 intervals made it evident that the periodicity and predictability were limited while irregularities and random behavior in time series augmented moreover long memory correlation and multifractal characteristics in time series were reduced in addition the possibilities of large and small earthquakes occurring were balanced the possibility of earthquakes with greater magnitudes shifted in other words the faults produced earthquakes of more moderate magnitudes over time while the magnitude of major earthquakes became larger on average than in the past the nonlinear dynamic analysis results confirmed the cross correlation findings concerning the association between groundwater level water table reduction and earthquake number and average magnitude per month the dynamic analysis demonstrated that the reduction in groundwater level water table generated a significant alteration in the fault s seismicity pattern it seemed that the reduction in water table lowered periodicity and predictability and augmented irregularities and randomness in faults seismic behavior besides it led to variations in seismicity rates and boosted the probability of major earthquakes due to the accumulation of energy in the fault in summary seismicity pattern rates and magnitudes was modified due to decreased water table it is suggested that future studies can focus on the structure of the san andreas fault to investigate the seismic pattern changes root of the fault from tectonic plates point of view the results will prove whether only the water table variations contributed to the seismic pattern alteration or the fault structural characteristics are also involved declarations funding this

11908,polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are environmentally hazardous pollutants that have been linked to severe global health effects in humans as a result of ecosystem pollution this work investigated the physicochemical parameters the distribution and contents of sixteen priority pahs the incremental lifetime cancer risk through ingestion and dermal absorption in bore hole waters close to automobile workshop in southeastern nigeria a total of 70 bore hole waters was collected from 6 senatorial zones over 4 months september december 2019 electrical conductivity ec ranged from 42 8 83 12 μs cm total hardness th ranged from 4 3 6 2 mg l turbidity ranged from 1 0 0 02 4 3 1 32 ntu and redox potential ranged from 37 3 74 10 mv the values obtained for ph salinity temperature alkalinity ammonia nitrate sulfate and phosphate for the water samples were within the world health organization who limits liquid liquid extraction and solid phase extraction lle spe method was utilized for total extraction of pahs from water samples and analyzed using gas chromatography flame ionization detection gc fid individual pah levels ranged from below the detection limit bdl to 33 21 μg l total concentrations of the pahs varied as bdl 55 11 μg l have exceeded the maximum admissible concentrations mac of pahs 0 20 μg l for the water standard of the european union eu diagnostic ratios suggest that target hydrocarbons hcs are predominantly from pyrogenic sources carcinogenic risks calculated for both adults and children were higher than the united states environmental protection agency usepa acceptable cancer risk and much higher for children which suggests that children could be liable to cancer through ingestion graphical abstract image 1 keywords polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon gas chromatography pyrogenic redox potential physicochemical parameters carcinogen 1 introduction in nigeria petroleum hydrocarbon pollution is common pollution from the disposal of used lubricants is one of nigeria s major environmental issues and it is much more common than pollution from crude oil odjegba and sadiq 2002 in southeastern nigeria there are many other car workshops dispersed across the cities from which used engine oils lubricating oils and other petroleum based solvents are poured or spilled on any available surface by auto repair artisans obini et al 2013 the pace at which used engine oils spread and contaminate the soils and water around cities has worsened as a result of these haphazard patterns spent lubricant also known as waste engine oil is usually collected after vehicle and generator engines have been serviced and then drained sharifi et al 2007 there are many pah compounds in the ecosystem but in practice pahs analysis is restricted to a few compounds mostly the 16 priority compounds naphthalene acenaphthylene acenaphthene fluorene phenanthrene anthracene fluoranthene pyrene benz a anthracene chrysene benzo b fluoranthene benzo k fluoranthene benzo a pyrene indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene dibenzo a h anthracene and benzo ghi perylene listed by us environmental protection agency epa as potentially toxic joshua et al 2016 pahs are formed during the incomplete combustion of coal oil gases garbages and other organic substances most pahs do not dissolve easily in water because of their lipophilic nature zhao et al 2015 pahs can be found in smoked meats cooked rice roasted coffee baked goods raw agriculture vegetables commercial waxes and paraffin mineral oil and solvents as well as in the air soil and water organic components are partially formed smaller and more unstable molecules at temperatures of 400 c 500 c which then recombine to form larger and more stable pahs ideriah and nwinaa ie 2015 pahs in water must also be monitored because they act as markers of contamination sources the major challenge in pahs determination in water is their low level concentrations ranging from pg l to ng l the lods of widely used analytical instruments are usually lower than these values sajid et al 2020 as a result for the pre concentration of pahs in water samples prior to instrumental analysis efficient extraction techniques are needed yu et al 2018 sample preparation is an important step in the analysis of pahs in water samples sajid et al 2020 liquid liquid extraction lle and solid phase extraction spe are two popular sample preparation techniques for extracting and preconcentrating a broad range of analytes from environmental samples manousi and zachariadis 2020 pah levels in uncontaminated groundwater are normally between 0 and 5 ng per liter since pahs can absorb strongly to soil organic matter there is very little leaching of the compounds into groundwater som hasanati et al 2011 only in highly contaminated sites pahs reach the groundwater and originate concentrations above 10 μg l ec 1994 pahs are mostly absorbed through dermal contact from contaminated water sources also according to a study carried out by perera et al 2012 prenatal exposure of pahs is linked to anxiety depression disorders in children there is a general misleading assumption that water obtained from boreholes is indeed safe for human consumption grimason et al 2013 however the negative impacts of urbanization on groundwater hydrochemistry have attracted considerable global concern del campo et al 2014 owing to their high rate of percolation and poor management petrogenic wastes pollute the atmosphere all the way down to groundwater pahs can be generated at trace levels in a variety of combustion processes including cigarette smoking and indiscriminate waste tire burning pahs are abundant in natural crude oil and coal reserves resulting from chemical processes of natural products garcia et al 2015 naphthalene can be weakly bound to soil and transferred by soil particles into underground water at waste dumps and landfills atsdr 2009 pahs get into the air mostly as a release from volcanoes forest fire burning coals and automobile exhaust inhalation of air contaminated by pahs is highly deleterious and carcinogenic shamsipur et al 2015 studies in auto repair workshop sites have been carried out by many researchers ipeaiyeda and dawodu 2008 adelekan and abegunde 2001 odoh et al 2011 gyan and ofosu 2016 ekanem et al 2019 but most of them focused on the study of heavy metal contamination in soil by these used engine oils without recourse to the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs present in used lubricants used lubricants easily migrate into the environment and eventually ooze into water bodies olugboji and ogunwole 2008 a mechanic workshop is a location where car repairs are performed this site s activities produce petrogenic wastes which are the source of these pahs petroleum hydrocarbon contamination is common in developing countries including nigeria pollution from used engine oil disposal is more common and widespread than pollution from crude oil disposal this is a major environmental issue odjegba and sadiq 2002 less attention is paid to pollution caused by maintenance or vehicle repairs auto mechanic services the intense operations of this vehicle or auto mechanic activities have resulted in a rise in emissions sax 2001 mishandling intentional dumping leaking and leakage of petroleum products such as gasoline lubricating oils diesel fuel heating oils used and spent engine oil can all lead to contamination the pace at which used engine oils spread and contaminate the soil and water around cities has worsened as a result of these haphazard disposal practices ekanem et al 2019 the groundwater in these areas would not pass into a properly constructed water treatment system the sampling region in southeastern nigeria s abia imo axis is mostly urban and semi urban with a significant number of residents relying on privately run borehole water supplies for their domestic needs the aim of choosing these sampling points was to determine the amount of pahs in their drinking water and the concentration of pahs in the water would inform the likely mental health of the residents among other things waste management activities are highly uncoordinated in this area and industries are dispersed in addition the majority of the overhead tanks used to store water were discovered to be open these contaminants are invariably released into the water supply posing a health risk nonetheless no study on the status of pahs in these mechanic workshops is available to date which is very important in terms of health considerations so it became very important to investigate given its proximity to prominent industries in the region the specific objectives were 1 to investigated some physico chemical parameters 2 to determine the concentrations and compositions of individual and total pahs in borehole water around automobile workshops 3 to identify their origin and 4 to assess the possible hazards of pahs to humans by analyzing the incremental lifetime cancer risk through ingestion and dermal absorption the obtained results may provide great reference values for environmental protection and human health 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study areas this study was carried out in the six senatorial zones of abia and imo states in the southeast geopolitical zone of nigeria located within latitudes 4 15 n and 6 58 n and longitude 6 50 e and 7 59 e fig 1 the topography geographical and metrological settings as well as the occupation of the inhabitants are well described in an earlier study nnorom et al 2019 other geographical and meteorological settings of the states are well described in annual abstract of statistics 2012 and the national population commission 2009 the people especially rural dwellers are known for farming and trading ebi 2015 with the civil servants residing mostly in the urban centers sample locations were selected based on the perceived importance of pahs assessment to the population involved and locations of mechanic workshops base on residential areas supplementary tables 1s and 2s show the sample codes name of automobile workshop close to source locations types and coordinates for abia and imo states respectively amongst other sampling points e g boreholes around mechanic workshops used by rural inhabitants strategic private owned boreholes in automobile spare part markets and workshops supplying a greater number of the population were sampled notable of these boreholes around and in the mechanic workshops were those situated in okigwe michael okpara university of agriculture umudike and abia state university uturu nigeria and used by both undergraduate and postgraduate students of the institutions also alaoji orlu owerri mechanic villages and boreholes were used by the entire teachers and students of ohiya community secondary school umuahia abia state 2 1 1 water sample collection the sampling areas were chosen in order to provide an overall overview of pahs pollution in the six senatorial districts of abia and imo states and a stratified random sampling system was used automobile repair shops were also chosen because of the possibility of pah contamination due to the type of waste produced which is one of the sources of pahs a total of 75 samples were randomly collected from both rural and urban settlements of both states following standard sampling techniques apha 2005 to analyze their physicochemical and pahs contents water samples were collected at each sampling station in triplicates between september and december 2019 the period motorist repairs their vehicle for christmas celebration all the water samples 1 l each were labeled according to each sampling point and preserved using glass amber bottles to prevent adsorption of the target analytes to the sample container but also to prevent decomposition of these compounds particularly following exposure to sunlight before taken to the laboratory for analysis water samples were stored at 4 c in the fridge before analysis physicochemical parameters such as electrical conductivity ec ph temperature total dissolved solids tds was carried out using portable hi9811 5 multi meter by hanna instruments on site meters were calibrated each sampling day using their respective standards according to manufacturer s guideline in the laboratory salinity of the water samples was measured with table top seveneasy mettler toledo multi meter while redox potentials pe was measured in situ using cyberscan ph 110 m by hanna instruments ammonia nh3 total hardness th salinity turbidity nitrate phosphate alkalinity and sulfate were determined according to the american public health association apha 1995 2005 2 2 extraction of pahs in water samples liquid liquid extraction and solid phase extraction lle spe were combined to sequestrate pahs from water samples before extraction 500 ml of borehole water which filtered through 0 50 μm membrane was spiked with 5 ng of phe d10 and 5 ng of chr d12 each spiked sample was mixed with 50 ml of dichloromethane dcm provided by waters company milford ma usa in a separating funnel after shaking gently for 20 min the organic phase was sequestrated the procedure was repeated twice by 50 ml of fresh dcm the organic phases were mixed as one and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate na2so4 purchased from chengdu kelong chemical reagent factory chengdu china then evaporated to near dryness in a rotary evaporator the concentrate was moved to a c18 solid phase extracted spe cartridge cnw lc c18 spe prior to sample loading each c18 cartridge was prepared with 5 ml dcm and 5 ml methanol and then dried under vacuum the analytes on the cartridge were eluted 3 times with 10 ml of dcm and the extract was evaporated to near dryness under a gentle nitrogen stream and thereafter reconstituted with n hexane to a final volume of 100 μl the extracts were transferred into 2 ml gc vials then analyzed by gas chromatography flame ionization detection gc fid hp 5870c palo alto ca usa according to the standard methods of the american public health association apha 2005 clean up the clean up involved the use of a column packed with activated silica gel and anhydrous na2so4 saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons were eluted with 20 ml of n hexane and the aromatic hydrocarbons were eluted with 30 ml of a mixture of dichloromethane and n hexane 2 1 the volume of the eluted fraction was reduced to 2 ml fraction was transferred into gc vials for subsequent injections into the gc equipped with a flame ionization detector gc fid 2 3 validation studies and preparation of calibration standards a spiked recovery method was used for validation studies for the water samples the samples were spiked with 1 μl of 100 μg l standard mixture consisting of 16 pahs to 500 ml pre extracted water samples deionized water 100 ml was first pre extracted in triplicate with 30 ml ch2cl2 as a blank sample the spiked samples were then extracted and analyzed pahs standards were used for the calibration of the instrument the calibration standards were prepared by serial dilution from the stock solution 2 4 analysis of pahs agilent 5870c gc with hp 5 fused silica capillary column 30 m 0 320 mm i d 0 250 μm film thickness and fid was used for the quantification of the analytes of interest a sample of 1 μl volume was injected in split less mode at a temperature of 280 c the oven temperature was programmed to start from 70 c 3 min to 325 c at 12 c min 6 min the carrier gas was helium he 99 999 at an average velocity and flow rate of 29 449 cm s and 1 6255 ml min respectively fid temperature was 300 c and other detector parameters used are summarized as follows h2 flow rate 45 0 ml min air flow rate 450 ml min and n2 flow rate 20 ml min calibration standards were prepared in the working range of 0 05 20 μg ml by serial dilution with c6h14 olatunji et al 2014 the peak areas calculated using the baseline baseline mode with agilent chemstation software were used to plot calibration curves for all the 16 pahs congeners ma et al 2010 the curves were all linear with correlation coefficients falling within the acceptable range of r2 0 990 adeniji et al 2017 compounds were thereafter identified by their retention times whereas quantification was done by the instrument on the basis of the response factor generated for each congener from the linear curve plotted nekhavhambe et al 2014 adeniji et al 2019a b 2 5 human health risk assessment in this study human health risk was assessed by calculating the potential carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic effects of exposure of a person to the pahs over a certain period us epa 2009 titilawo et al 2018 the evaluation was done based on exposure by ingestion and dermal contact since the borehole water is used for drinking bathing and washing the two pathways of water exposure considered in the present analysis were direct ingestion and dermal

carcinogenic pahs hazard quotient hq was calculated by multiplying the addd by reference dose rfd for individual contaminant as presented in eq 3 hazard index hi and the sum of hqs also were estimated for all pahs congeners in the samples using eq 4 us epa 1989 wei et al 2015 adeniji et al 2019a b rfd which represents dermal reference dose for each pah congener was not available for other priority compounds except for only six i e naphthalene fluorene anthracene phenanthrene fluoranthene and benzo g h i perylene table 3 3 hq addd rfd 4 hi h q s moreover cancer risk ilcr and risk index ri were determined for carcinogenic pahs cpahs found in the water samples using addi and addd mg kg day in which eqs 1 and 2 were used to calculate the addd by dermal contact the same way as for add only that at 25 550 was used for the two age categories instead of the previous value for the calculation of cr and ri in the water samples eqs 5 7 were used according to usepa guidelines us epa 1989 2015

kumar et al 2015 wei et al 2015 adeniji et al 2019a b 2 6 quality control and assurance all of the glassware used were washed and rinsed with de ionized water successively they were subsequently dried at room temperature cooled and rinsed with acetone c3h6o merck pty ltd johannesburg south africa dong et al 2012 methods blanks were determined alongside the samples in triplicates and their values were generally below the detection limit lod kumar et al 2014 limits of detection lod and quantification loq for all the selected contaminants ranged from 0 01 to 0 03 μg l whereas their relative standard deviations rsds varied between 0 59 and 2 51 concentrations below detection limits dls were recorded as zero in calculation but reported as below dls olatunji et al 2014 kumar et al 2015 adeniji et al 2019a b the overall mean recovery r of pahs in the samples were found to be 79 53 which is in agreement with literature us epa 2003 gorleku et al 2014 likewise the recoveries of surrogate standards were within the acceptable range and were used to correct the concentrations of the analytes of interest in the samples mirza et al 2012 2 7 statistical analysis descriptive statistics were performed on data obtained from all samples and one way analysis of variance anova was equally conducted and result showed that the mean concentration of pahs in different water sources was statistically significant p 0 05 microsoft office professional plus 2016 was used for all data processing statistical package for social sciences spss version 16 spss inc usa and statistica version 10 statsoft inc 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality evaluation the results of the physicochemical content borehole waters around automobile workshops in southeastern nigeria are presented in table 1 the borehole water studied was generally acidic all samples from abia and imo regardless of the sampling point attained ph ranging from 3 2 to 6 8 as shown in supplementary tables 3s and 4s generally okigwe and ohafia in both states achieved ph between 6 5 and 6 9 which corresponded to the national standard drinking water quality and also world health organization limit of 6 5 8 5 nsdwq 2007 who 2011 table 1 moreover other studies elsewhere reported ground and surface waters ph similar to this study utom et al 2013 reported ph of 2 6 for spring and 3 5 6 7 for shallow wells while hand dug wells and boreholes in ebonyi state were stated to have ph ranges of 3 31 7 73 and 4 21 7 27 respectively nganje et al 2015 which is in agreement with the ph of the present study the ph value is an important index of acidity or alkalinity and the concentration of hydrogen ion h in groundwater murugesan et al 2006 water temperature exhibited small variations the borehole water temperatures ranged between 27 9 and 29 2 c so that the highest temperature 29 2 c was observed at ohafia and the lowest value 27 4 c at owerri table 1 temperature values are known to be dependent on the climatic condition at a particular geographical area and period boreholes in abia and imo state showed larger variation in water temperature as depicted in supplementary tables 3s and 4s the large variation in temperature in the boreholes water samples could be attributed to exposure of the reservoir tanks to sunlight most of these reservoir tanks had dull colors mostly blue and black and therefore retain heat from the sunlight different studies from within and outside these states reported varying temperatures for groundwater samples for instance nganje et al 2015 reported temperature ranges of 20 2 24 2 c for boreholes in ebonyi state adamu et al 2015 reported the temperatures of boreholes in cross river state to fall within the range of 28 30 c utom et al 2013 studied shallow wells in coal mines near enugu town and observed average temperatures of 17 c while in bauchi state average temperatures of hand dug wells and boreholes were shown to be 29 2 and 31 5 c respectively jabbo et al 2016 conductivity measures the ionic content of the water and it is linked directly to tds aljerf 2018 the overall ec 10 160 μs cm and tds 6 261 mg l of the borehole water in imo and abia states were generally low with the highest being lower than the nsdwq limit of 500 mg l for tds nsdwq 2007 the average ec values obtained in this study were below the values reported by nganje et al 2015 140 0 768 9 μs cm omaka et al 2014 10 0 1754 μs cm and jabbo et al 2016 170 1000 μs cm for different borehole water ec of water is an expression of its ability to conduct an electric current epa 2001 in this present study the tds in samples from aba 21 34 mg l in abia state is comparable to 22 42 mg l obtained by eze and madumere 2012 for abia state the turbidity values of the borehole samples were found to be in the range of 0 6 4 3 ntu these were in agreement with 5 0 ntu for who 2011 permissible limit for portable water nevertheless a study observed turbidity ranging from 0 47 to 56 78 and 1 70 56 2 ntu for boreholes and hand dug wells in ebonyi state respectively nganje et al 2015 their average turbidity values for boreholes 15 97 ntu and hand dug wells 21 02 ntu were higher than the values obtained in this study implying that these borehole water in ebonyi state are more turbid than their counterparts in abia and imo states turbidity is due to the presence of colloidal particles arising from clay and silt during rainfall aljerf 2018 or from discharges of sewage and industrial waste the results of nitrate no3 varied from 3 05 mg l 12 03 mg l mean concentrations of no3 were below the nsdwq and son tolerance limits of 50 mg l the sample from aba had the mean concentration of nitrate 12 03 mg l which is higher than who tolerance limits of 10 mg l but lower 24 20 mg l of ezeribe et al 2012 the cause of high level of nitrate may be as a result of extensive farming taking place around these automobile workshops with the possibility of the farmers making use of fertilizers a high concentration of no3 in water might lead to methemoglobinemia blue baby syndrome in humans aljerf and aljurf 2020 and eutrophication abir 2014 makhijani and manoharan 1999 reported that a high level of no3 in drinking water is due to excessive use of agricultural fertilizers domestic effluent sewage disposal industrial discharges leachable from refuse dumps and atmospheric precipitation which has become a serious challenge to the ecosystem redox potential pe is an essential indicator of the properties of natural and wastewaters it is the measurement of water s ability to oxidize contaminants bajwa et al 2017 higher pe simply indicates a greater number of oxidizing agents while lower pe indicates a greater number of reducing agents and vice versa in generalized terms for human health water with lower pe is preferred for consumption due to the high antioxidant value although no regulatory body has set a standard for pe in drinking water pe below 550 mv is considered too strong and not recommended for drinking bajwa et al 2017 therefore low values of pe in water may indicate the presence of om nh3 and generally all substances that are capable of being oxidized one of the key agents of reduction reactions in natural water is microorganisms mos decomposing the om unicef 2008 thus there is the likelihood of a plume of mos in low pe waters the pe of borehole water in this study ranged from 37 to 74 mv table 1 which indicated a relatively oxidizing environment the inability of soap to lather in certain hard water is a disadvantage together with the scaling of cooking utensils aside from these the us epa has declared that recent health studies indicate that mortality rates from heart diseases are lower in areas using hard water epa 2001 therefore the health based guideline value is 500 mg l for th in drinking water who 2011 and 150 mg l for the standard organization of nigeria son 2007 nevertheless this study recorded a maximum th of 88 mg l in oha25 and 74 mg l in owe10 supplementary table 3s which fell in the group of moderately soft waters epa 2001 ammonia nh3 usually occurs in drinking water at concentrations well below those of health concern and natural levels in groundwater water with concentrations below 0 2 mg l who 2017 this calls for concern for some of the samples from abia and imo states because borehole water is used for drinking or other domestic purposes without any treatment while data about nh3 levels in these sources were not defined before for instance borehole water aba30 contained 0 52 mg l nh3 while a sample aba21 had 0 26 mg l nh3 all in aba in abia state furthermore borehole water owe20 and owe35 in owerri imo state had 0 22 and 0 25 mg l nh3 respectively the alkalinity in water indicates the presence of natural mineral salts the highest value of alkalinity from aba 80 43 mg l and the lowest value from orlu 57 43 mg l the values obtained for alkalinity in this study were within the acceptable value of 200 mg l who 2011 the main species that contribute to alkalinity include bicarbonates hydroxides phosphates and borates sa eed and mahmoud 2014 high alkalinity values have a greater resistance to changes in ph the maximum salinity obtained in samples from aba and owerri was 0 22 and 0 18 part per thousand ppt respectively these values are lower than the maximum permissible limit 38 ppt given in european union shellfish directive epa 2001 high salinity decreases the exposure of pahs while low salinity increases exposure phosphate concentrations were ranged from 0 38 mg l to 1 98 mg l all the boreholes gave values higher than 0 5 mg l permissible limits who 2011 except for ohafia 0 38 mg l which exhibited lower values than 5 mg l fepa 1998 setting limits sulfate obtained in this study varied between the sampling sites sampling point aba25 attained the highest value 6 58 mg l supplementary table 3s sulfate contents recorded in this study were below the who 2011 permissible limit of 250 mg l sulfate is generally considered to be non toxic however drinking water containing high amounts of magnesium sulfate or mgso4 sodium sulfate na2so4 may lead to intestinal discomfort diarrhea and consequent dehydration especially in drinking water containing 500 mg l of sulfate 3 2 pahs in borehole water the summary of pahs contents μg l in borehole water near an automobile workshop in abia and imo state are shown in table 2 all 16 priority pahs of the us epa were detected in the water samples collected from the borehole water at varying concentrations confirming the ubiquitous nature of the pollutants wang et al 2018 as shown in table 2 naphthalene chrysene and benzo a pyrene group i carcinogen exceeded their maximum allowable concentrations mac in fresh and marine waters british columbia 1993 guidelines from other countries were used in this study because no limit is at the moment set in nigeria for pahs in different compartments of the environment the mean concentration of naphthalene ranged from 8 18 to 17 13 μg l aba had the highest borehole water naphthalene with an average of 8 10 20 10 μg l followed by umuahia 11 18 0 32 μg l which is closely followed by owerre 11 12 0 28 μg l the high naphthalene values in these samples may be connected to poor waste management practices and usage handling of refined petroleum products naphthalene is one of petrogenic pahs with low molecular weight that originates from the oil spills and coal incineration sun et al 2016 the highest mean water acenaphthylene content was in umuahia 18 31 1 05 μg l followed by owerre 16 32 0 34 μg l while the lowest from ohafia and orlu are having the same mean value as 9 21 1 03 μg l and 9 21 0 36 μg l respectively the data show that the mean concentration of acenaphthene in borehole water ranged from 19 03 1 13 μg l to 55 11 2 03 μg l for acenaphthene the highest mean value was observed in aba 55 11 2 03 μg l followed by umuahia and orlu had the least value 19 03 1 13 μg l also umu3 umu10 and umu17 reached 36 21 μg l 31 28 μg l and 23 31 μg l respectively supplementary table 5s likely that automobile activities repairs especially when there is a leakage of petroleum or the unscrupulous disposal of engine oil from vehicles may contribute significantly to the level of pahs recorded in these locations the highest water fluorene content was in umuahia 9 81 0 05 μg l followed by aba 7 16 0 13 μg l and the lowest from okigwe 4 12 0 42 μg l the highest phenanthrene was in aba 16 11 0 02 μg l followed by umuahia 14 66 0 48 μg l while okigwe had the lowest value 8 11 0 11 μg l phenanthrene is regarded as the tracer of vehicular emissions sun et al 2016 for anthracene the highest value was observed in aba 14 95 0 21 μg l followed by owerre and orlu which achieved the least value 7 13 0 31 μg l the mean concentration of fluoranthene ranged between 12 91 0 42 μg l to 1 22 0 02 μg l this is due to their persistence in the environment and more pahs could have accumulated within years borehole water fluoranthene content was highest in aba 12 91 0 42 μg l followed by owerre 3 73 1 01 μg l and orlu recording the least value 1 22 0 02 μg l this is due to the nature and level of activities carried out around this study area and the sites are said to be moderate to heavily contaminated the highest pyrene content of borehole water was in aba 4 78 0 11 μg l and the lowest in ohafia 1 31 0 03 μg l the highest mean water benzo a anthracene was in aba 4 34 0 03 μg l next was owerre while orlu had the lowest value 2 12 0 07 μg l this might be as a result of the level of activities carried out at this study area the highest mean water chrysene content was in owerre 14 18 2 08 μg l while ohafia had the lowest value of 2 10 0 04 μg l also owe1 oki4 and oki14 had values of 7 24 8 42 and 6 86 respectively supplementary table 6s the highest mean value for benzo a pyrene was from owerre 4 41 1 05 μg l while the lowest was from ohafia 1 20 0 02 μg l the mean values for benzo a pyrene were higher than the permissible limit of 0 2 μg l set by the agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr 2013 the highest mean water benzo b fluoranthene content was in aba 3 98 0 05 μg l followed by umuahia 3 95 1 02 μg l while the lowest from orlu having the mean value of 1

below the limit of turkish recommendation 0 1 μg l for drinking water more also the composition of pahs is characterized by a greater number of aromatic rings with high carcinogenicity wang et al 2018 the highest total concentration of pahs 176 47 μg l in the borehole waters was registered at aba due to a high level of industrial activities and these results reflect the pah inputs from direct burning of expired auto tires around the boreholes which were observed during the sampling followed by umuahia 137 65 μg l and the least total concentration of pahs was orlu 71 01 μg l as shown in table 1 the total concentrations of pahs detected in water in three lagoons in accra reported in a previous study chemu lagoon had the highest total concentration of 61 712 μg l followed by korle lagoon and kpeshie lagoon with total pahs of 38 889 μg l and 34 090 μg l respectively which were below the total concentrations obtained in orlu 71 01 μg l in the present study these results reflect the pah inputs from a direct discharge of used or condemn engine oil and the deposition of fuel combustion of vehicles which were clearly observed during sampling it was detected that lmw pahs were more predominant in the samples table 2 which is in agreement as reported on the detection of pahs in drinking water from a large mixed use reservoir in china who 2003 larger concentrations of lmw pahs in the area indicate naturally occurring pahs petrogenic and biogenic origins while pahs from combustion processes pyrolytic origin suggest elevated concentrations of hmw e g phenanthrene fluoranthene pyrene and fewer lmw pahs in the present study it was observed that lmw pahs occurred in a higher ratio compared to hmw pahs 5 3 suggesting that pahs in borehole water samples were generally of natural origin petrogenic and biogenic than of anthropogenic origin the presence of lmw pahs in water can be attributed to their high vapor pressure and water solubility also due to their persistence in the environment and more pahs could have accumulated within years while the low concentration or absence of hmw pahs can be attributed to their lower water solubility and great tendency to adsorb onto solid phases the pahs in aba one of the biggest dealers in automobile spare parts in the region may be attributed to petrogenic from petroleum related activities or pyrogenic pyrolytic from the incomplete combustion of diesel fuel and engine oil condemn or used oil whereas the pollution at umuahia may be related to a probable leakage of petroleum products from the pits where used engines oil is being discharged after auto repair and most of the boreholes were between 20 and 200 m close to the mechanic workshops vehicular emissions from the workshops also contributed the pahs in the water results obtained in this study were also lower compared to the values of 11 2 341 5 μg l reported by olajire et al 2007 who worked on water samples in agbadu bitumen field southwest nigeria and that of ogunfowokan et al 2003 which had the values of 100 15810 μg l reported for osogbo and ile ife and 73 720 μg l reported for industrial area of lagos similarly the results in this study were in agreement with those of kalsson et al 2008 who reported concentrations between 0 09 and 183 μg l for water samples in gully pots northern sweden the maximum concentration of carcinogen pahs was observed in aba as shown in fig 2 which was similar to the results from the study of kabzinski et al 2002 cpahs ranged between 16 01 and 31 79 μg l in southeast nigeria which is higher than the guideline values proposed by who 2003 generally the pahs detected in this study were above the set standard for drinking water which is 0 005 μg l who 2003 and in most cases exceeded the maximum permissible limit of 10 μg l recommended by who for safety groundwater environmental canada 1994 thus their accumulative effect over time could be dangerous to human health and may cause some of the life threatening diseases such as cancer associated with the presence of pahs also as stipulated by who 2017 the maximum permissible limits for total pahs in drinking water is 0 2 μg l borehole water samples from this study area have total pahs higher than the standard set by who indicating a public health concern because pahs have been confirmed to be carcinogenic and man stand the greatest risk of bioaccumulation in this study correlation matrix was used to identify inter relationships between the physicochemical parameters as presented in table 3 classification of a no relevance r 0 3 b less relevance 0 3 r 0 5 c median relevance 0 5 r 0 8 and d high relevance r 0 8 as used by wang 2018 was adopted at p 0 05 parameters that correlated positively with one another include po4 3 with th r 0 81 th with turb r 0 89 tds with so4 2 r 0 85 so4 2 withnh3 r 0 71 so4 2 with ec r 0 79 so4 2 with temperature 0 79 and tds with salinity r 0 78 at p 0 01 parameters that strongly correlated with one another include tds with temperature r 0 90 ec with tds r 0 90 so4 2 with salinity r 0 90 ec with temperature r 1 00 the parameters that negatively correlated are po4 3 with no3 r 0 69 no3 with ph r 0 74 they were poorly significantly correlated with r values of less than 0 7 at p 0 05 or 0 01 however majority of the measured physico chemical parameters correlated with one another at either p 0 05 or 0 01 which is an indication that availability of specified pollution indicators will definitely have an influence on other assessed pollutants in water samples 3 3 human health risk assessment bio concentration and bio accumulation of pahs occur in organisms through ingestion and dermal contact route s adeniji et al 2018a b the health risk in borehole water near automobile workshops was assessed via dermal absorption pathway the estimated hazard quotients of pahs in the borehole water by dermal absorption ranged from 8 03 10 4 to 1 02 10 2 and from 6 73 10 4 to 3 24 10 3 in children and adults respectively table 4 the results indicate that hqs for both age categories in the water column were below the us epa maximum limit of 1 hence the chance of humans contracting any non carcinogenic disease or other health related issues by using the water for domestic purposes is very unlikely however the dermal incremental lifetime cancer risk values calculated were high crd varied between 2 13 10 5 and 1 04 10 1 for children and from 9 54 10 6 to 6 39 10 1 for adults respectively with chrysene and benzo a pyrene recording the lowest and highest values in that order table 5 the risk indices for the two groups were 2 12 10 3 and 5 86 10 5 correspondingly while cri varied between 3 87 10 3 and 1 87 10 1 for children and from 6 28 10 6 to 6 84 10 1 for adults respectively with chrysene and benzo a pyrene recording the lowest and highest values in that order table 6 the risk indices for the two groups were 2 19 10 3 and 5 29 10 5 correspondingly in particular 4 of the 7 cpahs which are benzo b fluoranthene benzo a pyrene dibenzo a h anthracene and indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene exceeded the threshold value of 1 10 4 wang et al 2018 no kp value was available for bkf hence addd and crd were not computed for it it therefore could be inferred that borehole water is unfit for bathing because there is a chance that 1 in every 500 adults and 300 children who bath with these borehole waters are exposed to the risk of having cancer respectively the carcinogenic risk calculated for both adults and children was higher than the usepa acceptable cancer risk but much higher in children indicating that children may be prone to cancer through ingestion and this may be due to the high probability of dermal contact of infants with water and dust particles hence necessary caution should be taken by everyone using borehole water close to automobile workshops and regulatory bodies should as well ensure that the proper management of condemning or used engine oil in the environment is controlled to ensure the safety of human lives 3 4 diagnostic ratios and possible sources of pahs in borehole water distribution of high molecular weight pahs hpahs and low molecular weight pahs lpahs were calculated to identify the possible sources of pahs pollution in borehole water close to automobile workshop the calculated ratios for the σlmw σhmw for all sampling points were between 0 19 and 2 53 which suggests that the sources of pahs were both pyrogenic ratio of 1 and petrogenic ratio of 1 table 7 it is apprehensible because the lpahs is characteristically volatile and more biodegradable which is different from hpahs that are more persistent in the environment doan 2005 other diagnostic ratios of specific pah congeners and their isomers have been used as geochemical tracers and also to distinguish natural and anthropogenic sources of pahs in urban and rural areas mirza et al 2012 eight of such ratios were in all selected for use in this study table 7 approximately eight of them pointed to pyrolytic origins in the boreholes another four diagnostic ratios flt pyr and flt flt pyr in the water column however suggested predominant petrogenic sources of pahs in the area sule et al 2011 the inconsistencies of these ratios was not unexpected because of their possible instability which has been reported previously sany et al 2014 saha et al 2009 adeniji et al 2018a b notwithstanding petrogenic diagnosis in the boreholes water may be attributed to possible leakage of fuel and condemn oil from engines of damaged cars gorleku et al 2014 chr baa is more peculiar among the ratios used values 0 2 usually indicate petrogenic origin between 0 2 and 0 35 points to the combustion of petroleum products whereas combustion of wood grass and or coal will be suspected if higher than 0 35 adeniji et al 2019a b table 6 shows values 0 35 in the borehole water implying contributions from the burning of nonpetroleum materials such as refuse or biomass as another major pyrolytic input the overall assessment of the result points to predominant pyrogenic contamination in the environment largely due to discharge of untreated effluents used engine oil or incomplete combustion of biomass deposited around the sample sites 4 conclusions data obtained from this work revealed that the activities of a mechanic village can cause a serious contamination of groundwater supply of its host community resulting in chronic health effects a diagnostic ratio used for source determination revealed that the pahs in this study are majorly from both petrogenic and pyrogenic origins the presence of these pahs in concentrations higher than the stipulated maximum contamination level mcl of regulatory bodies calls for fast intervention to save the ignorant coastal habitants from impending terminal health issues it can be concluded that automobile repair activities had contributed to the borehole water contamination with pahs therefore the mechanic village effluents should be properly treated and disposed of using environmentally friendly practices that are in line with regulatory standards and guidelines enlightenment campaigns need to be done to create awareness to the occupants of the mechanic village about the effects of petrogenic and pyrogenic waste on the environment and the groundwater the government also needs to enact strict laws that will regulate illicit construction of mechanic workshops around residential areas to avoid contamination of water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

aromatic hydrocarbon gas chromatography pyrogenic redox potential physicochemical parameters carcinogen 1 introduction in nigeria petroleum hydrocarbon pollution is common pollution from the disposal of used lubricants is one of nigeria s major environmental issues and it is much more common than pollution from crude oil odjegba and sadiq 2002 in southeastern nigeria there are many other car workshops dispersed across the cities from which used engine oils lubricating oils and other petroleum based solvents are poured or spilled on any available surface by auto repair artisans obini et al 2013 the pace at which used engine oils spread and contaminate the soils and water around cities has worsened as a result of these haphazard patterns spent lubricant also known as waste engine oil is usually collected after vehicle and generator engines have been serviced and then drained sharifi et al 2007 there are many pah compounds in the ecosystem but in practice pahs analysis is restricted to a few compounds mostly the 16 priority compounds naphthalene acenaphthylene acenaphthene fluorene phenanthrene anthracene fluoranthene pyrene benz a anthracene chrysene benzo b fluoranthene benzo k fluoranthene benzo a pyrene indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene dibenzo a h anthracene and benzo ghi perylene listed by us environmental protection agency epa as potentially toxic joshua et al 2016 pahs are formed during the incomplete combustion of coal oil gases garbages and other organic substances most pahs do not dissolve easily in water because of their lipophilic nature zhao et al 2015 pahs can be found in smoked meats cooked rice roasted coffee baked goods raw agriculture vegetables commercial waxes and paraffin mineral oil and solvents as well as in the air soil and water organic components are partially formed smaller and more unstable molecules at temperatures of 400 c 500 c which then recombine to form larger and more stable pahs ideriah and nwinaa ie 2015 pahs in water must also be monitored because they act as markers of contamination sources the major challenge in pahs determination in water is their low level concentrations ranging from pg l to ng l the lods of widely used analytical instruments are usually lower than these values sajid et al 2020 as a result for the pre concentration of pahs in water samples prior to instrumental analysis efficient extraction techniques are needed yu et al 2018 sample preparation is an important step in the analysis of pahs in water samples sajid et al 2020 liquid liquid extraction lle and solid phase extraction spe are two popular sample preparation techniques for extracting and preconcentrating a broad range of analytes from environmental samples manousi and zachariadis 2020 pah levels in uncontaminated groundwater are normally between 0 and 5 ng per liter since pahs can absorb strongly to soil organic matter there is very little leaching of the compounds into groundwater som hasanati et al 2011 only in highly contaminated sites pahs reach the groundwater and originate concentrations above 10 μg l ec 1994 pahs are mostly absorbed through dermal contact from contaminated water sources also according to a study carried out by perera et al 2012 prenatal exposure of pahs is linked to anxiety depression disorders in children there is a general misleading assumption that water obtained from boreholes is indeed safe for human consumption grimason et al 2013 however the negative impacts of urbanization on groundwater hydrochemistry have attracted considerable global concern del campo et al 2014 owing to their high rate of percolation and poor management petrogenic wastes pollute the atmosphere all the way down to groundwater pahs can be generated at trace levels in a variety of combustion processes including cigarette smoking and indiscriminate waste tire burning pahs are abundant in natural crude oil and coal reserves resulting from chemical processes of natural products garcia et al 2015 naphthalene can be weakly bound to soil and transferred by soil particles into underground water at waste dumps and landfills atsdr 2009 pahs get into the air mostly as a release from volcanoes forest fire burning coals and automobile exhaust inhalation of air contaminated by pahs is highly deleterious and carcinogenic shamsipur et al 2015 studies in auto repair workshop sites have been carried out by many researchers ipeaiyeda and dawodu 2008 adelekan and abegunde 2001 odoh et al 2011 gyan and ofosu 2016 ekanem et al 2019 but most of them focused on the study of heavy metal contamination in soil by these used engine oils without recourse to the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs present in used lubricants used lubricants easily migrate into the environment and eventually ooze into water bodies olugboji and ogunwole 2008 a mechanic workshop is a location where car repairs are performed this site s activities produce petrogenic wastes which are the source of these pahs petroleum hydrocarbon contamination is common in developing countries including nigeria pollution from used engine oil disposal is more common and widespread than pollution from crude oil disposal this is a major environmental issue odjegba and sadiq 2002 less attention is paid to pollution caused by maintenance or vehicle repairs auto mechanic services the intense operations of this vehicle or auto mechanic activities have resulted in a rise in emissions sax 2001 mishandling intentional dumping leaking and leakage of petroleum products such as gasoline lubricating oils diesel fuel heating oils used and spent engine oil can all lead to contamination the pace at which used engine oils spread and contaminate the soil and water around cities has worsened as a result of these haphazard disposal practices ekanem et al 2019 the groundwater in these areas would not pass into a properly constructed water treatment system the sampling region in southeastern nigeria s abia imo axis is mostly urban and semi urban with a significant number of residents relying on privately run borehole water supplies for their domestic needs the aim of choosing these sampling points was to determine the amount of pahs in their drinking water and the concentration of pahs in the water would inform the likely mental health of the residents among other things waste management activities are highly uncoordinated in this area and industries are dispersed in addition the majority of the overhead tanks used to store water were discovered to be open these contaminants are invariably released into the water supply posing a health risk nonetheless no study on the status of pahs in these mechanic workshops is available to date which is very important in terms of health considerations so it became very important to investigate given its proximity to prominent industries in the region the specific objectives were 1 to investigated some physico chemical parameters 2 to determine the concentrations and compositions of individual and total pahs in borehole water around automobile workshops 3 to identify their origin and 4 to assess the possible hazards of pahs to humans by analyzing the incremental lifetime cancer risk through ingestion and dermal absorption the obtained results may provide great reference values for environmental protection and human health 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study areas this study was carried out in the six senatorial zones of abia and imo states in the southeast geopolitical zone of nigeria located within latitudes 4 15 n and 6 58 n and longitude 6 50 e and 7 59 e fig 1 the topography geographical and metrological settings as well as the occupation of the inhabitants are well described in an earlier study nnorom et al 2019 other geographical and meteorological settings of the states are well described in annual abstract of statistics 2012 and the national population commission 2009 the people especially rural dwellers are known for farming and trading ebi 2015 with the civil servants residing mostly in the urban centers sample locations were selected based on the perceived importance of pahs assessment to the population involved and locations of mechanic workshops base on residential areas supplementary tables 1s and 2s show the sample codes name of automobile workshop close to source locations types and coordinates for abia and imo states respectively amongst other sampling points e g boreholes around mechanic workshops used by rural inhabitants strategic private owned boreholes in automobile spare part markets and workshops supplying a greater number of the population were sampled notable of these boreholes around and in the mechanic workshops were those situated in okigwe michael okpara university of agriculture umudike and abia state university uturu nigeria and used by both undergraduate and postgraduate students of the institutions also alaoji orlu owerri mechanic villages and boreholes were used by the entire teachers and students of ohiya community secondary school umuahia abia state 2 1 1 water sample collection the sampling areas were chosen in order to provide an overall overview of pahs pollution in the six senatorial districts of abia and imo states and a stratified random sampling system was used automobile repair shops were also chosen because of the possibility of pah contamination due to the type of waste produced which is one of the sources of pahs a total of 75 samples were randomly collected from both rural and urban settlements of both states following standard sampling techniques apha 2005 to analyze their physicochemical and pahs contents water samples were collected at each sampling station in triplicates between september and december 2019 the period motorist repairs their vehicle for christmas celebration all the water samples 1 l each were labeled according to each sampling point and preserved using glass amber bottles to prevent adsorption of the target analytes to the sample container but also to prevent decomposition of these compounds particularly following exposure to sunlight before taken

surrogate standards were within the acceptable range and were used to correct the concentrations of the analytes of interest in the samples mirza et al 2012 2 7 statistical analysis descriptive statistics were performed on data obtained from all samples and one way analysis of variance anova was equally conducted and result showed that the mean concentration of pahs in different water sources was statistically significant p 0 05 microsoft office professional plus 2016 was used for all data processing statistical package for social sciences spss version 16 spss inc usa and statistica version 10 statsoft inc 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality evaluation the results of the physicochemical content borehole waters around automobile workshops in southeastern nigeria are presented in table 1 the borehole water studied was generally acidic all samples from abia and imo regardless of the sampling point attained ph ranging from 3 2 to 6 8 as shown in supplementary tables 3s and 4s generally okigwe and ohafia in both states achieved ph between 6 5 and 6 9 which corresponded to the national standard drinking water quality and also world health organization limit of 6 5 8 5 nsdwq 2007 who 2011 table 1 moreover other studies elsewhere reported ground and surface waters ph similar to this study utom et al 2013 reported ph of 2 6 for spring and 3 5 6 7 for shallow wells while hand dug wells and boreholes in ebonyi state were stated to have ph ranges of 3 31 7 73 and 4 21 7 27 respectively nganje et al 2015 which is in agreement with the ph of the present study the ph value is an important index of acidity or alkalinity and the concentration of hydrogen ion h in groundwater murugesan et al 2006 water temperature exhibited small variations the borehole water temperatures ranged between 27 9 and 29 2 c so that the highest temperature 29 2 c was observed at ohafia and the lowest value 27 4 c at owerri table 1 temperature values are known to be dependent on the climatic condition at a particular geographical area and period boreholes in abia and imo state showed larger variation in water temperature as depicted in supplementary tables 3s and 4s the large variation in temperature in the boreholes water samples could be attributed to exposure of the reservoir tanks to sunlight most of these reservoir tanks had dull colors mostly blue and black and therefore retain heat from the sunlight different studies from within and outside these states reported varying temperatures for groundwater samples for instance nganje et al 2015 reported temperature ranges of 20 2 24 2 c for boreholes in ebonyi state adamu et al 2015 reported the temperatures of boreholes in cross river state to fall within the range of 28 30 c utom et al 2013 studied shallow wells in coal mines near enugu town and observed average temperatures of 17 c while in bauchi state average temperatures of hand dug wells and boreholes were shown to be 29 2 and 31 5 c respectively jabbo et al 2016 conductivity measures the ionic content of the water and it is linked directly to tds aljerf 2018 the overall ec 10 160 μs cm and tds 6 261 mg l of the borehole water in imo and abia states were generally low with the highest being lower than the nsdwq limit of 500 mg l for tds nsdwq 2007 the average ec values obtained in this study were below the values reported by nganje et al 2015 140 0 768 9 μs cm omaka et al 2014 10 0 1754 μs cm and jabbo et al 2016 170 1000 μs cm for different borehole water ec of water is an expression of its ability to conduct an electric current epa 2001 in this present study the tds in samples from aba 21 34 mg l in abia state is comparable to 22 42 mg l obtained by eze and madumere 2012 for abia state the turbidity values of the borehole samples were found to be in the range of 0 6 4 3 ntu these were in agreement with 5 0 ntu for who 2011 permissible limit for portable water nevertheless a study observed turbidity ranging from 0 47 to 56 78 and 1 70 56 2 ntu for boreholes and hand dug wells in ebonyi state respectively nganje et al 2015 their average turbidity values for boreholes 15 97 ntu and hand dug wells 21 02 ntu were higher than the values obtained in this study implying that these borehole water in ebonyi state are more turbid than their counterparts in abia and imo states turbidity is due to the presence of colloidal particles arising from clay and silt during rainfall aljerf 2018 or from discharges of sewage and industrial waste the results of nitrate no3 varied from 3 05 mg l 12 03 mg l mean concentrations of no3 were below the nsdwq and son tolerance limits of 50 mg l the sample from aba had the mean concentration of nitrate 12 03 mg l which is higher than who tolerance limits of 10 mg l but lower 24 20 mg l of ezeribe et al 2012 the cause of high level of nitrate may be as a result of extensive farming taking place around these automobile workshops with the possibility of the farmers making use of fertilizers a high concentration of no3 in water might lead to methemoglobinemia blue baby syndrome in humans aljerf and aljurf 2020 and eutrophication abir 2014 makhijani and manoharan 1999 reported that a high level of no3 in drinking water is due to excessive use of agricultural fertilizers domestic effluent sewage disposal industrial discharges leachable from refuse dumps and atmospheric precipitation which has become a serious challenge to the ecosystem redox potential pe is an essential indicator of the properties of natural and wastewaters it is the measurement of water s ability to oxidize contaminants bajwa et al 2017 higher pe simply indicates a greater number of oxidizing agents while lower pe indicates a greater number of reducing agents and vice versa in generalized terms for human health water with lower pe is preferred for consumption due to the high antioxidant value although no regulatory body has set a standard for pe in drinking water pe below 550 mv is considered too strong and not recommended for drinking bajwa et al 2017 therefore low values of pe in water may indicate the presence of om nh3 and generally all substances that are capable of being oxidized one of the key agents of reduction reactions in natural water is microorganisms mos decomposing the om unicef 2008 thus there is the likelihood of a plume of mos in low pe waters the pe of borehole water in this study ranged from 37 to 74 mv table 1 which indicated a relatively oxidizing environment the inability of soap to lather in certain hard water is a disadvantage together with the scaling of cooking utensils aside from these the us epa has declared that recent health studies indicate that mortality rates from heart diseases are lower in areas using hard water epa 2001 therefore the health based guideline value is 500 mg l for th in drinking water who 2011 and 150 mg l for the standard organization of nigeria son 2007 nevertheless this study recorded a maximum th of 88 mg l in oha25 and 74 mg l in owe10 supplementary table 3s which fell in the group of moderately soft waters epa 2001 ammonia nh3 usually occurs in drinking water at concentrations well below those of health concern and natural levels in groundwater water with concentrations below 0 2 mg l who 2017 this calls for concern for some of the samples from abia and imo states because borehole water is used for drinking or other domestic purposes without any treatment while data about nh3 levels in these sources were not defined before for instance borehole water aba30 contained 0 52 mg l nh3 while a sample aba21 had 0 26 mg l nh3 all in aba in abia state furthermore borehole water owe20 and owe35 in owerri imo state had 0 22 and 0 25 mg l nh3 respectively the alkalinity in water indicates the presence of natural mineral salts the highest value of alkalinity from aba 80 43 mg l and the lowest value from orlu 57 43 mg l the values obtained for alkalinity in this study were within the acceptable value of 200 mg l who 2011 the main species that contribute to alkalinity include bicarbonates hydroxides phosphates and borates sa eed and mahmoud 2014 high alkalinity values have a greater resistance to changes in ph the maximum salinity obtained in samples from aba and owerri was 0 22 and 0 18 part per thousand ppt respectively these values are lower than the maximum permissible limit 38 ppt given in european union shellfish directive epa 2001 high salinity decreases the exposure of pahs while low salinity increases exposure phosphate concentrations were ranged from 0 38 mg l to 1 98 mg l all the boreholes gave values higher than 0 5 mg l permissible limits who 2011 except for ohafia 0 38 mg l which exhibited lower values than 5 mg l fepa 1998 setting limits sulfate obtained in this study varied between the sampling sites sampling point aba25 attained the highest value 6 58 mg l supplementary table 3s sulfate contents recorded in this study were below the who 2011 permissible limit of 250 mg l sulfate is generally considered to be non toxic however drinking water containing high amounts of magnesium sulfate or mgso4 sodium sulfate na2so4 may lead to intestinal discomfort diarrhea and consequent dehydration especially in drinking water containing 500 mg l of sulfate 3 2 pahs in borehole water the summary of pahs contents μg l in borehole water near an automobile workshop in abia and imo state are shown in table 2 all 16 priority pahs of the us epa were detected in the water samples collected from the borehole water at varying concentrations confirming the ubiquitous nature of the pollutants wang et al 2018 as shown in table 2 naphthalene chrysene and benzo a pyrene group i carcinogen exceeded their maximum allowable concentrations mac in fresh and marine waters british columbia 1993 guidelines from other countries were used in this study because no limit is at the moment set in nigeria for pahs in different compartments of the environment the mean concentration of naphthalene ranged from 8 18 to 17 13 μg l aba had the highest borehole water naphthalene with an average of 8 10 20 10 μg l followed by umuahia 11 18 0 32 μg l which is closely followed by owerre 11 12 0 28 μg l the high naphthalene values in these samples may be connected to poor waste management practices and usage handling of refined petroleum products naphthalene is one of petrogenic pahs with low molecular weight that originates from the oil spills and coal incineration sun et al 2016 the highest mean water acenaphthylene content was in umuahia 18 31 1 05 μg l followed by owerre 16 32 0 34 μg l while the lowest from ohafia and orlu are having the same mean value as 9 21 1 03 μg l and 9 21 0 36 μg l respectively the data show that the mean concentration of acenaphthene in borehole water ranged from 19 03 1 13 μg l to 55 11 2 03 μg l for acenaphthene the highest mean value was observed in aba 55 11 2 03 μg l followed by umuahia and orlu had the least value 19 03 1 13 μg l also umu3 umu10 and umu17 reached 36 21 μg l 31 28 μg l and 23 31 μg l respectively supplementary table 5s likely that automobile activities repairs especially when there is a leakage of petroleum or the unscrupulous disposal of engine oil from vehicles may contribute significantly to the level of pahs recorded in these locations the highest water fluorene content was in umuahia 9 81 0 05 μg l followed by aba 7 16 0 13 μg l and the lowest from okigwe 4 12 0 42 μg l the highest phenanthrene was in aba 16 11 0 02 μg l followed by umuahia 14 66 0 48 μg l while okigwe had the lowest value 8 11 0 11 μg l phenanthrene is regarded as the tracer of vehicular emissions sun et al 2016 for anthracene the highest value was observed in aba 14 95 0 21 μg l followed by owerre and orlu which achieved the least value 7 13 0 31 μg l the mean concentration of fluoranthene ranged between 12 91 0 42 μg l to 1 22 0 02 μg l this is due to their persistence in the environment and more pahs could have accumulated within years borehole water fluoranthene content was highest in aba 12 91 0 42 μg l followed by owerre 3 73 1 01 μg l and orlu recording the least value 1 22 0 02 μg l this is due to the nature and level of activities carried out around this study area and the sites are said to be moderate to heavily contaminated the highest pyrene content of borehole water was in aba 4 78 0 11 μg l and the lowest in ohafia 1 31 0 03 μg l the highest mean water benzo a anthracene was in aba 4 34 0 03 μg l next was owerre while orlu had the lowest value 2 12 0 07 μg l this might be as a result of the level of activities carried out at this study area the highest mean water chrysene content was in owerre 14 18 2 08 μg l while ohafia had the lowest value of 2 10 0 04 μg l also owe1 oki4 and oki14 had values of 7 24 8 42 and 6 86 respectively supplementary table 6s the highest mean value for benzo a pyrene was from owerre 4 41 1 05 μg l while the lowest was from ohafia 1 20 0 02 μg l the mean values for benzo a pyrene were higher than the permissible limit of 0 2 μg l set by the agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr 2013 the highest mean water benzo b fluoranthene content was in aba 3 98 0 05 μg l followed by umuahia 3 95 1 02 μg l while the lowest from orlu having the mean value of 1 05 0 02 μg l for benzo k fluoranthene the highest mean value was observed in aba 2 27 0 02 μg l followed by owerre and orlu had the least value 1 16 0 12 μg l the highest water dibenzo a h anthracene content was in aba 11 61 1 04 μg l followed by owerre 11 52 1 03 μg l and the lowest from ohafia 6 82 0 11 μg l the highest benzo g h i perylene content was in aba 3 52 0 03 μg l followed by umuahia 2 57 0 14 μg l and orlu had the lowest value 2 12 0 21 μg l for indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene the highest value was observed in aba 1 34 0 05 and orlu had the least value 0 30 0 01 μg l these were slightly below the limit of turkish recommendation 0 1 μg l for drinking water more also the composition of pahs is characterized by a greater number of aromatic rings with high carcinogenicity wang et al 2018 the highest total concentration of pahs 176 47 μg l in the borehole waters was registered at aba due to a high level of industrial activities and these results reflect the pah inputs from direct burning of expired auto tires around the boreholes which were observed during the sampling followed by umuahia 137 65 μg l and the least total concentration of pahs was orlu 71 01 μg l as shown in table 1 the total concentrations of pahs detected in water in three lagoons in accra reported in a previous study chemu lagoon had the highest total concentration of 61 712 μg l followed by korle lagoon and kpeshie lagoon with total pahs of 38 889 μg l and 34 090 μg l respectively which were below the total concentrations obtained in orlu 71 01 μg l in the present study these results reflect the pah inputs from a direct discharge of used or condemn engine oil and the deposition of fuel combustion of vehicles which were clearly observed during sampling it was detected that lmw pahs were more predominant in the samples table 2 which is in agreement as reported on the detection of pahs in drinking water from a large mixed use reservoir in china who 2003 larger concentrations of lmw pahs in the area indicate naturally occurring pahs petrogenic and biogenic origins while pahs from combustion processes pyrolytic origin suggest elevated concentrations of hmw e g phenanthrene fluoranthene pyrene and fewer lmw pahs in the present study it was observed that lmw pahs occurred in a higher ratio compared to hmw pahs 5 3 suggesting that pahs in borehole water samples were generally of natural origin petrogenic and biogenic than of anthropogenic origin the presence of lmw pahs in water can be attributed to their high vapor pressure and water solubility also due to their persistence in the environment and more pahs could have accumulated within years while the low concentration or absence of hmw pahs can be attributed to their lower water solubility and great tendency to adsorb onto solid phases the pahs in aba one of the biggest dealers in automobile spare parts in the region may be attributed to petrogenic from petroleum related activities or pyrogenic pyrolytic from the incomplete combustion of diesel fuel and engine oil condemn or used oil whereas the pollution at umuahia may be related to a probable leakage of petroleum products from the pits where used engines oil is being discharged after auto repair and most of the boreholes were between 20 and 200 m close to the mechanic workshops vehicular emissions from the workshops also contributed the pahs in the water results obtained in this study were also lower compared to the values of 11 2 341 5 μg l reported by olajire et al 2007 who worked on water samples in agbadu bitumen field southwest nigeria and that of ogunfowokan et al 2003 which had the values of 100 15810 μg l reported for osogbo and ile ife and 73 720 μg l reported for industrial area of lagos similarly the results in this study were in agreement with those of kalsson et al 2008 who reported concentrations between 0 09 and 183 μg l for water samples in gully pots northern sweden the maximum concentration of carcinogen pahs was observed in aba as shown in fig 2 which was similar to the results from the study of kabzinski et al 2002 cpahs ranged between 16 01 and 31 79 μg l in southeast nigeria which is higher than the guideline values proposed by who 2003 generally the pahs detected in this study were above the set standard for drinking water which is 0 005 μg l who 2003 and in most cases exceeded the maximum permissible limit of 10 μg l recommended by who for safety groundwater environmental canada 1994 thus their accumulative effect over time could be dangerous to human health and may cause some of the life threatening diseases such as cancer associated with the presence of pahs also as stipulated by who 2017 the maximum permissible limits for total pahs in drinking water is 0 2 μg l borehole water samples from this study area have total pahs higher than the standard set by who indicating a public health concern because pahs have been confirmed to be carcinogenic and man stand the greatest risk of bioaccumulation in this study correlation matrix was used to identify inter relationships between the physicochemical parameters as presented in table 3 classification of a no relevance r 0 3 b less relevance 0 3 r 0 5 c median relevance 0 5 r 0 8 and d high relevance r 0 8 as used by wang 2018 was adopted at p 0 05 parameters that correlated positively with one another include po4 3 with th r 0 81 th with turb r 0 89 tds with so4 2 r 0 85 so4 2 withnh3 r 0 71 so4 2 with ec r 0 79 so4 2 with temperature 0 79 and tds with salinity r 0 78 at p 0 01 parameters that strongly correlated with one another include tds with temperature r 0 90 ec with tds r 0 90 so4 2 with salinity r 0 90 ec with temperature r 1 00 the parameters that negatively correlated are po4 3 with no3 r 0 69 no3 with ph r 0 74 they were poorly significantly correlated with r values of less than 0 7 at p 0 05 or 0 01 however majority of the measured physico chemical parameters correlated with one another at either p 0 05 or 0 01 which is an indication that availability of specified pollution indicators will definitely have an influence on other assessed pollutants in water samples 3 3 human health risk assessment bio concentration and bio accumulation of pahs occur in organisms through ingestion and dermal contact route s adeniji et al 2018a b the health risk in borehole water near automobile workshops was assessed via dermal absorption pathway the estimated hazard quotients of pahs in the borehole water by dermal absorption ranged from 8 03 10 4 to 1 02 10 2 and from 6 73 10 4 to 3 24 10 3 in children and adults respectively table 4 the results indicate that hqs for both age categories in the water column were below the us epa maximum limit of 1 hence the chance of humans contracting any non carcinogenic disease or other health related issues by using the water for domestic purposes is very unlikely however the dermal incremental lifetime cancer risk values calculated were high crd varied between 2 13 10 5 and 1 04 10 1 for children and from 9 54 10 6 to 6 39 10 1 for adults respectively with chrysene and benzo a pyrene recording the lowest and highest values in that order table 5 the risk indices for the two groups were 2 12 10 3 and 5 86 10 5 correspondingly while cri varied between 3 87 10 3 and 1 87 10 1 for children and from 6 28 10 6 to 6 84 10 1 for adults respectively with chrysene and benzo a pyrene recording the lowest and highest values in that order table 6 the risk indices for the two groups were 2 19 10 3 and 5 29 10 5 correspondingly in particular 4 of the 7 cpahs which are benzo b fluoranthene benzo a pyrene dibenzo a h anthracene and indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene exceeded the threshold value of 1 10 4 wang et al 2018 no kp value was available for bkf hence addd and crd were not computed for it it therefore could be inferred that borehole water is unfit for bathing because there is a chance that 1 in every 500 adults and 300 children who bath with these borehole waters are exposed to the risk of having cancer respectively the carcinogenic risk calculated for both adults and children was higher than the usepa acceptable cancer risk but much higher in children indicating that children may be prone to cancer through ingestion and this may be due to the high probability of dermal contact of infants with water and dust particles hence necessary caution should be taken by everyone using borehole water close to automobile workshops and regulatory bodies should as well ensure that the proper management of condemning or used engine oil in the environment is controlled to ensure the safety of human lives 3 4 diagnostic ratios and possible sources of pahs in borehole water distribution of high molecular weight pahs hpahs and low molecular weight pahs lpahs were calculated to identify the possible sources of pahs pollution in borehole water close to automobile workshop the calculated ratios for the σlmw σhmw for all sampling points were between 0 19 and 2 53 which suggests that the sources of pahs were both pyrogenic ratio of 1 and petrogenic ratio of 1 table 7 it is apprehensible because the lpahs is characteristically volatile and more biodegradable which is different from hpahs that are more persistent in the environment doan 2005 other diagnostic ratios of specific pah congeners and their isomers have been used as geochemical tracers and also to distinguish natural and anthropogenic sources of pahs in urban and rural areas mirza et al 2012 eight of such ratios were in all selected for use in this study table 7 approximately eight of them pointed to pyrolytic origins in the boreholes another four diagnostic ratios flt pyr and flt flt pyr in the water column however suggested predominant petrogenic sources of pahs in the area sule et al 2011 the inconsistencies of these ratios was not unexpected because of their possible instability which has been reported previously sany et al 2014 saha et al 2009 adeniji et al 2018a b notwithstanding petrogenic diagnosis in the boreholes water may be attributed to possible leakage of fuel and condemn oil from engines of damaged cars gorleku et al 2014 chr baa is more peculiar among the ratios used values 0 2 usually indicate petrogenic origin between 0 2 and 0 35 points to the combustion of petroleum products whereas combustion of wood grass and or coal will be suspected if higher than 0 35 adeniji et al 2019a b table 6 shows values 0 35 in the borehole water implying contributions from the burning of nonpetroleum materials such as refuse or biomass as another major pyrolytic input the overall assessment of the result points to predominant pyrogenic contamination in the environment largely due to discharge of untreated effluents used engine oil or incomplete combustion of biomass deposited around the sample sites 4 conclusions data obtained from this work revealed that the activities of a mechanic village can cause a serious contamination of groundwater supply of its host community resulting in chronic health effects a diagnostic ratio used for source determination revealed that the pahs in this study are majorly from both petrogenic and pyrogenic origins the presence of these pahs in concentrations higher than the stipulated maximum contamination level mcl of regulatory bodies calls for fast intervention to save the ignorant coastal habitants from impending terminal health issues it can be concluded that automobile repair activities had contributed to the borehole water contamination with pahs therefore the mechanic village effluents should be properly treated and disposed of using environmentally friendly practices that are in line with regulatory standards and guidelines enlightenment campaigns need to be done to create awareness to the occupants of the mechanic village about the effects of petrogenic and pyrogenic waste on the environment and the groundwater the government also needs to enact strict laws that will regulate illicit construction of mechanic workshops around residential areas to avoid contamination of water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

11909,in the present study the straw ash sa was proposed to remove phosphate and fluoride from aqueous solution the effects of sa dosage initial contaminants concentration and initial ph on removal efficiency adsorption kinetics and isotherms were investigated in batch experiments the removal mechanisms were also discussed the results show that solution ph was a critical parameter for the adsorption and the removal efficiency decreased with the increase of initial ph at initial solution ph of 2 the removal efficiency of sa 25 g l for phosphate 200 mg l achieved 88 20 and the fluoride 100 mg l removal rate by sa 50 g l was 87 52 the adsorption for phosphate fluoride followed the pseudo second order kinetic model the adsorption isotherm data were well fitted by the langmuir model and the maximum adsorption capacity of sa reached 92 16 mg g for phosphate and 66 23 mg g for fluoride the sem eds and xrd tests show that phosphate fluoride were mainly removed by chemically precipitating as cahpo4 ca4h po4 3 2 5h2o ca5 po4 3 oh and alf3 caf2 on the sa surface electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange with hydroxyl groups also exited in the removal process besides sa has been proved to be a promising adsorbent for the treatment of industrial wastewater contaminated with phosphate and fluoride graphical abstract image 1 keywords straw ash cost effective adsorbent phosphate fluoride 1 introduction phosphate and fluoride are important contaminants in water bodies the discharging of phosphate and fluoride mainly come from industrial activities for instance the phosphate and fluoride concentration of wastewater generating from fertilizer production could achieve 4540 and 9720 mg l 1 respectively bagastyo et al 2017 and wastewater mixed with fluoride and phosphate is also produced in semiconductor manufacturing park et al 2008 surveys revealed that high level of phosphate and fluoride in groundwater occurred in many areas around the word such as china mexico and india kong et al 2019 the excessive phosphate in water causes eutrophication and enormous death of aquatic lives while long term intake of fluoride often results in dental and skeletal fluorosis koilraj and sasaki 2017 zhao et al 2018 the international agency for research on cancer iarc has classified phosphate and fluoride as carcinogenic to humans international agency for research on cancer 2021 moreover the coexistence of phosphate and fluoride exposes more severe damage to human security kong et al 2019 therefore it has become a global environmental requirement to remove the phosphate and fluoride from water systems several technologies such as ion exchange dong et al 2020 grzegorzek et al 2020 adsorption murambasvina and mahamadi 2020 oginni et al 2020 chemical precipitation huang et al 2017 and coagulation bakshi et al 2020 dubey et al 2018 have been used for phosphate and fluoride removal however most of these techniques have disadvantages and limitations in practical application for the high energy consumption and complex operation process adsorption is considered as a promising technique for the removal of pollutants from aqueous solution with multiple virtues of wide material availability easy operation and low operational cost saadat et al 2018 in recent years diverse adsorbents including metal oxides hydroxides biochar industrial and agricultural by products have been developed for phosphate and fluoride removal from wastewater goswami and kumar 2018 kong et al 2020 kumari et al 2020 liu et al 2018 ye et al 2020 solid wastes such as steel slag claveau mallet et al 2013 sellner et al 2019 fly ash hermassi et al 2017 ye et al 2019 and basic oxygen furnace slag islam and patel 2011 xue et al 2009 have attracted extensive attention among these sorbents on account of their easy gained and low cost these solid wastes are usually composed of oxides such as sio2 mgo cao fe2o3 and al2o3 that would promote the removal of phosphate and fluoride through electrostatic attraction precipitation and ligand exchange lee et al 2020 li et al 2020b xu et al 2015 yin et al 2017 additionally the large specific surface areas and abundant porous structure of these solid wastes can greatly enhance their adsorption capacity qiu and duan 2019 straw ash sa is a kind of solid waste after the thermo chemical transformation of straw and has the characteristics of low density high porosity and large surface area sa has been proved to be a promising adsorbent for the removal of heavy metals arshadi et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 it could immobilize heavy metals through chemical precipitation ion exchange and surface complexation besides the alkaline of sa equips it with excellent acid neutralization capacity however there have been no relevant reports on the use of sa as phosphate and fluoride adsorption material previous studies have showed that alkaline residue is an effective adsorbent for the removal of anionic dye and phosphate yan et al 2014 and the main components of sa i e cao fe2o3 sio2 and al2o3 enable it to adsorb or precipitate phosphate and fluoride therefore sa can be considered as a potential adsorbent for the removal of phosphate and fluoride from aqueous solution to explore the feasibility of the sa to be used as adsorbent for phosphate and fluoride removal the effects and mechanisms of the sa on removing phosphate and fluoride from artificially acid solutions were evaluated in this work for the first time the aims are to exhibit the potential application of the sa for the treatment of industrial wastewater contaminated with phosphate and fluoride and provide theoretical support for its practical application 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents the straw ash sa was obtained from huaneng thermal power plant jilin province china the powder sample was dried at 105 c for 120 min ground into less than 100 mesh particles and thoroughly homogenized before used all chemicals used were in analytical grade 2 2 characterization methods the main chemical compositions of sa were examined using quantitative analysis methods the silicon content of sa was determined by perchloric acid dehydration gravimetric method described in chinese standard gb t 1509 2016 mixed acid digestion of sa was conducted before the determination of total concentrations of other compositions a 0 5 g sa was digested with 10 ml of hcl 8 ml of hf 8 ml of hno3 and 4 ml of hclo4 in a closed teflon vessel on an electric hot plate at 180 c until no black material remained the digested solution was diluted to 50 ml with deionized water for subsequent measurement then the concentrations of ca mg al fe p were determined via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes perkinelmer optima 8300 while the contents of na and k were quantified by atomic absorption spectrometry aas aa 6300 the leaching toxicity of heavy metals in sa were tested using the horizontal vibration method hj 557 2010 china and the sulfuric acid and nitric acid method hj t 299 2007 china the morphological characteristics of sa were observed using a scanning electron microscope sem supra 55 zeiss equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds the zeta potentials of sa were measured at 25 c by a zeta potential analyzer zetasizer nano z malvern instrument co ltd uk fourier transform infrared ftir nicolet 6700 thermo scientific spectra of sa were recorded in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 x ray diffraction xrd patterns of samples were recorded by a rigaku ttr3 equipped with cu kα radiation 40 kv 100 ma at a scanning rate of 3 min and the tested data were analyzed by mdi jade 6 0 software the solution ph was measured using a hq30d portable ph meter the concentrations of phosphate and fluoride were determined via icp oes the chemical oxygen demand cod of industrial wastewater was determined according to chinese standard hj t 399 2007 the total phosphorus tp was measured using ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method gb 11893 89 china 2 3 batch experiments the adsorption tests for phosphate or fluoride removal were conducted by batch experiments stock solution of phosphate 1 g l and fluoride 1 g l were prepared by dissolving the required amount of kh2po4 and naf in deionized water respectively and then diluted with deionized water to give the appropriate concentration used for the batch experiments the initial solution ph was adjusted using 0 1 mol l hno3 or 0 1 mol l naoh a known amount of sa was added into 100 ml phosphate or fluoride solution in a 250 ml conical ﬂask the ﬂask was shaken at 25 c for a given time in an oscillator at 200 r min after that the suspension was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane to obtain the supernatant for anion concentration detection the removal efficiency η and adsorption capacity at time t q t mg g were calculated by eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 η 100 c 0 c t c 0 2 q t v c 0 c t m to better understand the interactions between sa and phosphate fluoride the adsorption kinetic and isotherm were studied the pseudo first order and pseudo second order eqs 3 4 have been considered as the most notable models to demonstrating the adsorption mechanisms and rate controlling steps on solid surface systems ahamad et al 2018 the pseudo first order supposes that the adsorption process depends on the solution concentration and the number of available adsorption sites while the pseudo second order kinetic model is based on the assumption that chemical adsorption involving valence forces through sharing or exchange of electrons between adsorbent and contaminants controls the adsorption rate sen gupta and bhattacharyya 2011 on the other hand the adsorption isotherm expresses the distribution of adsorbate on the adsorbent surface three typical adsorption isotherms i e langmuir freundlich and temkin models were selected to investigate removal performances as well the corresponding isotherm equations were listed as eqs 5 7 the langmuir model assumes that the adsorption is monolayer adsorption without any interaction between the adsorbed molecules and the energies of adsorption onto the surface are uniform the freundlich model indicates a heterogeneous surface of adsorbent the temkin model contains the adsorbent adsorbate interactions which leading to the decreasing of adsorption heat with the coverage 3 pseudo first order equation q t q e 1 exp k 1 t 4 pseudo second order equation q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t 5 langmuir isotherm q e q m b c e 1 b c e 6

parameters were evaluated by nonlinear regression to optimize the procedure the chi square χ 2 was used to evaluate the fitting quality of the experimental data 8 χ 2 i 1 a q exp q cal 2 q cal where a is the number of observations in the experimental data q exp mg g is the experimental removal capacity and q cal mg g is the removal capacity obtained by calculating from models the smaller value of χ 2 represented the better fitting of the curve in addition the performance of sa for synchronous phosphate and fluoride removal was also investigated by treating industrial wastewater collected from the washing of phosphogypsum the main qualities of industrial wastewater are shown in table 1 the adsorption using industrial wastewater was conducted in the same procedure as mentioned above 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical compositions and heavy metals leaching concentration of straw ash the main chemical compositions of sa are presented in table 2 it can be seen that the sa mainly consisted of sio2 k2o cao al2o3 and mgo considering of environmental risks the leaching toxicity of heavy metals in sa were tested according to the data in table 3 a negligible amount of pb zn cu cd ni and cr leached from sa illustrating that sa is an environmentally friendly material for the removal of phosphate and fluoride from aqueous solution 3 2 effect of adsorbent dosage the effects of the sa dosage on the removal of phosphate and fluoride are shown in fig 1 with the increasing of adsorbent dosage the removal efficiency of phosphate and fluoride increased at first and then leveled off when dosage of sa was 50 g l for phosphate and 90 g l for fluoride the removal efficiency achieved 99 35 and 98 99 respectively it turns out that the sa is an effective adsorbent for both phosphate and fluoride the large available of surface and active sites on adsorbent played a significant role in phosphate and fluoride removal from aqueous solution 3 3 effect of initial ph the solution ph is one of the most important parameters affecting the adsorption of phosphate and fluoride fig 2 displays the effect of initial ph on removal efficiency and solution equilibrium ph obviously the removal efficiency of phosphate and fluoride presented negative correlation with the initial ph with the initial solution ph increased from 2 to 6 the removal efficiency decreased from 88 2 to 67 6 for phosphate and reduced from 87 52 to 47 89 for fluoride the results were consistent with the previous reports where the change of adsorbent surface property and contaminants species accounting for lower phosphate and fluoride removal efficiency at higher initial ph li et al 2019 wei et al 2020 and the removal efficiency of fluoride showed a more significant reduction than that of phosphate as a function of increasing initial ph furthermore the equilibrium ph after removal increased from initial ph of 2 to 8 55 for phosphate and 7 89 for fluoride respectively which demonstrating the strong acid neutralization capacity of sa that would be an important advantage for the treatment of contaminants in aqueous environments with lower ph 3 4 effect of contact time and adsorption kinetics the rate limiting step for phosphate and fluoride removal using sa were illustrated by adsorption kinetic study as shown in fig 3 phosphate and fluoride were rapidly captured within 60 min once the sa was added into the solution afterwards the adsorption process slowed down and reached equilibrium after 120 min for both phosphate and fluoride due to the less target anions in solutions and the decreasing available sorption sites on sa the kinetic data were fitted with the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models respectively the kinetic parameters are listed in table 4 the higher correlation coefficients and lower χ2 values obtained by the pseudo second order model indicate that the rate controlling step are chemical adsorption for phosphate and fluoride owing to the relatively smaller size of fluoride anions which could take a shorter distance to access the sorption sites on sa the rate constant for fluoride 0 257 g mg min is higher than that of phosphate 0 012 g mg min 3 5 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherm results of sa for phosphate and fluoride removal are shown in fig 4 the parameters calculated are described in table 5 the q e increased with the increasing initial concentration of phosphate and fluoride because the higher concentration of contaminants in solutions promoted their interaction with adsorbent and the q e eventually tended towards steady on account of saturated adsorption the equilibrium data fitted by langmuir model shows the higher r 2 and lower χ 2 than other two models indicating that the adsorption of phosphate and fluoride on sa are monolayer adsorption process the maximum adsorption capacity of sa calculated from langmuir model are 92 16 mg g for phosphate and 66 23 mg g for fluoride which are higher than most solid wastes natural minerals and even some synthetic materials table 6 furthermore the majority of these adsorbents are only feasible for single contaminant given the high adsorption capacity low cost avoidance of adsorbent synthesis and the utilization of solid waste sa has been proved to be a highly competitive material for the removal of phosphate and fluoride from acid wastewater 3 6 characterization of straw ash before and after the removal of phosphate fluoride 3 6 1 zeta potential and sem eds analysis zeta potentials of sa as a function of ph are shown in fig 5 the point of zero charge pzc of sa was measured as 4 5 in the presence of either phosphate or fluoride the value of phpzc shifted to the lower ph indicating the high affinity of the two contaminants to sa li et al 2020a the sem images fig 6 a and b exhibit the accidented surface of sa there are abundant pores exposed on the surface of different particles which can provide a large number of active sites for contaminants the eds mappings reveal highly coincidental distribution of element si o k al ca indicating the skeleton structure of sa is constituted by these elements together by comparing the sem images given in fig 6 b and d e it can be seen that some particles are presented on the surface of sa after the phosphate fluoride removal the eds analysis fig 6 a and b indicate high contents of ca p and o in the particles on the surface of sa after phosphate removal in addition high level of ca and f contents were also detected after the removal of fluoride fig 6 c and d it can be reasonably inferred that phosphate and fluoride were well immobilized onto sa surface through chemical precipitated with ca2 3 6 2 ftir and xrd analysis ftir spectra of sa before and after adsorption of phosphate fluoride are illustrated in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 a the intensity of the peak at 3407 98 cm 1 is associated with the hydroxyl oh stretching the peaks at 1434 94 cm 1 and 875 62 cm 1 confirm the presence of the ca al si vibration ye et al 2019 the stretching around 1083 92 cm 1 corresponded to al o bend dubey et al 2018 besides the si o si 779 19 cm 1 and 457 10 cm 1 were detected in sa roy et al 2017 after adsorption of phosphate and fluoride fig 7 b and c the vibration of ca al si weakened and even disappeared demonstrating that the chemical composition contained ca al si was in decline during the adsorption process this might be caused by the hydration reaction of metal oxide in sa in addition the vibrations of al o and si o si both increased and the peaks exhibited blue or red shift it could be explained by inductive effects of phosphate and fluoride on the group or the formation of hydrogen bond these phenomena indicated the interactions of phosphate and fluoride with groups on sa the xrd patterns of sa before and after adsorption of phosphate fluoride were detected as shown in fig 8 it can be observed that the crystalline phases of sa before adsorption are dominated by quartz sio2 sanidine kalsi3o8 and anorthite caal2si2o8 obviously the intensities of peaks representing kalsi3o8 and caal2si2o8 were reduced after the adsorption for both phosphate and fluoride indicating their participation in the adsorption process this result was consistent with the analysis of ftir after the sa was subjected to phosphate adsorption the emerging peaks at 2θ 26 60 30 19 and 25 60 are in accordance with cahpo4 dibasic calcium phosphate dcp pdf 77 0128 the diffraction peaks at 2θ 31 59 31 47 27 68 29 55 25 58 23 08 22 72 and 24 37 are assigned to ca4h po4 3 2 5h2o octacalcium phosphate ocp pdf 44 0778 and the peaks attributed to ca5 po4 3 oh hydroxyapatite hap pdf 84 1998 also appeared at 2θ 31 79 32 92 32 22 and 34 09 on the other hand after the adsorption of fluoride alf3 pdf 83 0717 at peaks of 2θ 21 38 27 68 and 27 77 was generated and the peaks belong to caf2 pdf 75 0097 were also detected at 2θ 28 28 and 55 77 3 7 removal mechanisms as exhibited in fig 2 the solution ph was a critical parameter affecting the removal performance the adsorption depends directly on the surface charge of adsorbents and the charge is determined by the solution ph when the solution ph lower than phpzc the surface of sa was positively charged due to the protonation as eq 9 phosphate exists in different dominant species at different ph h3po4 ph 2 13 h2po4 ph 2 13 7 20 hpo4 2 ph 7 20 12 33 and po4 3 ph 12 33 ye et al 2017 it could be seen from fig 2 that h2po4 and hpo4 2 were the dominant species while fluoride was dominated by f under the experimental conditions therefore the electrostatic attraction took place between positively charged surface of sa and phosphate fluoride ions as eqs 10 11 9 sur oh h sur oh2 10 sur oh2 hpo4 2 h2po4 sur oh2 hpo4 2 h2po4 11 sur oh2 f sur oh2 f furthermore phosphate and fluoride species are also preferentially adsorbed by hydroxyl groups on the surface of oxides in aqueous solution ligand hydroxyl groups would be generated on the hydrous oxide surface of particles sio2 and al2o3 for instance in adsorbents thus active sites were developed for the ligand exchange between phosphate fluoride and ligand hydroxyl groups dhillon et al 2018 dos reis et al 2020 this was well confirmed by the change of al o and si o si stretching vibration in ftir spectrum the reaction could be described as eq 12 14 similar theories have also been proposed by other researchers for the phosphate fluoride adsorption dhillon et al 2018 kumari et al 2020 xue et al 2009 zhang et al 2018 12 13 14 sur oh f h sur f h2o where sur stands for the surface sites of sa and sur oh represents a surface hydroxyl group as the initial ph increased the protonation effect was waning and the surface of sa was deprotonated with reaction described as eq 15 resulting in a negative charge hence the electrostatic repulsion between sa and phosphate fluoride was enhanced leading to the poor adsorption efficiency additionally the higher solution ph brought about the higher concentration of oh which could generate a remarkable competitive effect with phosphate fluoride for the sorption sites on sa thus the removal efficiency would also get reduced 15 sur oh oh sur o h2o moreover it could be indicated from the sem eds and xrd analysis that chemical precipitation played a predominant role in the removal process of phosphate and fluoride the metal oxide in sa dissolved in aqueous solution as eq 16 which in turn increased the solution ph to alkaline fig 5 and promoted the chemical precipitation between cationic such as ca2 and al3 with phosphate fluoride on the sa surface 16 m x o y yh2o xm 2 y x 2yoh m ca al k etc significantly the chemical precipitation of phosphate involved complicated reaction processes under the influence of ca p and ph generally when the ca p molar ratio exceeds 1 67 ca2 oh and phosphate can directly form hap which is the most thermodynamically stable phrase liu et al 2019 however as the sa was added into the phosphate solution the ca2 and oh were gradually released thus the precursors such as dcp and ocp observed in the xrd analysis would preferentially generate with the increase of thermodynamic driving force the precursors dcp and ocp were transformed into more stable phase hap while the transformation from precursors to hap was incomplete because the formation of hap was much slower than that of the precursors moreover the limitation of ca2 released by sa also restricted the transformation to hap thus resulting in the less peaks with low intensities belonging to hap in fig 8 the chemical precipitation of fluoride was relatively explicit the reactions are given below 17 ca2 2f caf2 18 al3 3f alf3 3 8 industrial wastewater treatment to evaluate the practicability of sa for industrial wastewater sa was used to simultaneously removal phosphate and fluoride of the washing water of phosphogypsum the initial concentrations of phosphate and fluoride of industrial wastewater were 2145 and 1450 mg l respectively table 1 as shown in fig 9 the removal efficiency for phosphate and fluoride reached 91 79 and 97 82 by using 150 g l adsorbent at such high initial concentrations of containments indicating that the sa could be a promising adsorbent for the synchronous phosphate and fluoride removal from industrial wastewater moreover the solution ph increased from 2 3 to 7 52 at 150 g l dosage of sa thus can effectively solve the problem of highly acidic of industrial wastewater and lower the treatment cost the removal efficiency of phosphate and fluoride presented little growth when the dosage of sa increased over 150 g l while the solution ph gradually raised to highly alkaline therefore the dosage of sa should be within a certain limit in practical application 4 conclusions the present study shows that the sa is a cost effective and environmentally friendly adsorbent for the removal of phosphate and fluoride from aqueous solution the solution ph was a critical parameter for the removal of phosphate fluoride and the removal efficiency decreased with the increase of initial ph at initial solution ph of 2 the removal efficiency of sa 25 g l for phosphate 200 mg l achieved 88 20 and the fluoride 100 mg l removal rate by sa 50 g l was 87 52 the adsorption process followed the pseudo second order kinetic model and langmuir isotherm indicating that phosphate fluoride adsorption on sa were dominated by chemical reactions leading to monolayer adsorption the maximum adsorption capacities of sa were 92 16 mg g for phosphate and 66 23 mg g for fluoride the sem eds and xrd analysis indicate that chemical precipitation played a predominant role for phosphate fluoride removal from aqueous solution electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange with hydroxyl groups also exited in the removal process the results of industrial wastewater treatment revealed that the sa could be a promising adsorbent

11909,in the present study the straw ash sa was proposed to remove phosphate and fluoride from aqueous solution the effects of sa dosage initial contaminants concentration and initial ph on removal efficiency adsorption kinetics and isotherms were investigated in batch experiments the removal mechanisms were also discussed the results show that solution ph was a critical parameter for the adsorption and the removal efficiency decreased with the increase of initial ph at initial solution ph of 2 the removal efficiency of sa 25 g l for phosphate 200 mg l achieved 88 20 and the fluoride 100 mg l removal rate by sa 50 g l was 87 52 the adsorption for phosphate fluoride followed the pseudo second order kinetic model the adsorption isotherm data were well fitted by the langmuir model and the maximum adsorption capacity of sa reached 92 16 mg g for phosphate and 66 23 mg g for fluoride the sem eds and xrd tests show that phosphate fluoride were mainly removed by chemically precipitating as cahpo4 ca4h po4 3 2 5h2o ca5 po4 3 oh and alf3 caf2 on the sa surface electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange with hydroxyl groups also exited in the removal process besides sa has been proved to be a promising adsorbent for the treatment of industrial wastewater contaminated with phosphate and fluoride graphical abstract image 1 keywords straw ash cost effective adsorbent phosphate fluoride 1 introduction phosphate and fluoride are important contaminants in water bodies the discharging of phosphate and fluoride mainly come from industrial activities for instance the phosphate and fluoride concentration of wastewater generating from fertilizer production could achieve 4540 and 9720 mg l 1 respectively bagastyo et al 2017 and wastewater mixed with fluoride and phosphate is also produced in semiconductor manufacturing park et al 2008 surveys revealed that high level of phosphate and fluoride in groundwater occurred in many areas around the word such as china mexico and india kong et al 2019 the excessive phosphate in water causes eutrophication and enormous death of aquatic lives while long term intake of fluoride often results in dental and skeletal fluorosis koilraj and sasaki 2017 zhao et al 2018 the international agency for research on cancer iarc has classified phosphate and fluoride as carcinogenic to humans international agency for research on cancer 2021 moreover the coexistence of phosphate and fluoride exposes more severe damage to human security kong et al 2019 therefore it has become a global environmental requirement to remove the phosphate and fluoride from water systems several technologies such as ion exchange dong et al 2020 grzegorzek et al 2020 adsorption murambasvina and mahamadi 2020 oginni et al 2020 chemical precipitation huang et al 2017 and coagulation bakshi et al 2020 dubey et al 2018 have been used for phosphate and fluoride removal however most of these techniques have disadvantages and limitations in practical application for the high energy consumption and complex operation process adsorption is considered as a promising technique for the removal of pollutants from aqueous solution with multiple virtues of wide material availability easy operation and low operational cost saadat et al 2018 in recent years diverse adsorbents including metal oxides hydroxides biochar industrial and agricultural by products have been developed for phosphate and fluoride removal from wastewater goswami and kumar 2018 kong et al 2020 kumari et al 2020 liu et al 2018 ye et al 2020 solid wastes such as steel slag claveau mallet et al 2013 sellner et al 2019 fly ash hermassi et al 2017 ye et al 2019 and basic oxygen furnace slag islam and patel 2011 xue et al 2009 have attracted extensive attention among these sorbents on account of their easy gained and low cost these solid wastes are usually composed of oxides such as sio2 mgo cao fe2o3 and al2o3 that would promote the removal of phosphate and fluoride through electrostatic attraction precipitation and ligand exchange lee et al 2020 li et al 2020b xu et al 2015 yin et al 2017 additionally the large specific surface areas and abundant porous structure of these solid wastes can greatly enhance their adsorption capacity qiu and duan 2019 straw ash sa is a kind of solid waste after the thermo chemical transformation of straw and has the characteristics of low density high porosity and large surface area sa has been proved to be a promising adsorbent for the removal of heavy metals arshadi et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 it could immobilize heavy metals through chemical precipitation ion exchange and surface complexation besides the alkaline of sa equips it with excellent acid neutralization capacity however there have been no relevant reports on the use of sa as phosphate and fluoride adsorption material previous studies have showed that alkaline residue is an effective adsorbent for the removal of anionic dye and phosphate yan et al 2014 and the main components of sa i e cao fe2o3 sio2 and al2o3 enable it to adsorb or precipitate phosphate and fluoride therefore sa can be considered as a potential adsorbent for the removal of phosphate and fluoride from aqueous solution to explore the feasibility of the sa to be used as adsorbent for phosphate and fluoride removal the effects and mechanisms of the sa on removing phosphate and fluoride from artificially acid solutions were evaluated in this work for the first time the aims are to exhibit the potential application of the sa for the treatment of industrial wastewater contaminated with phosphate and fluoride and provide theoretical support for its practical application 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents the straw ash sa was

correlation coefficients and lower χ2 values obtained by the pseudo second order model indicate that the rate controlling step are chemical adsorption for phosphate and fluoride owing to the relatively smaller size of fluoride anions which could take a shorter distance to access the sorption sites on sa the rate constant for fluoride 0 257 g mg min is higher than that of phosphate 0 012 g mg min 3 5 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherm results of sa for phosphate and fluoride removal are shown in fig 4 the parameters calculated are described in table 5 the q e increased with the increasing initial concentration of phosphate and fluoride because the higher concentration of contaminants in solutions promoted their interaction with adsorbent and the q e eventually tended towards steady on account of saturated adsorption the equilibrium data fitted by langmuir model shows the higher r 2 and lower χ 2 than other two models indicating that the adsorption of phosphate and fluoride on sa are monolayer adsorption process the maximum adsorption capacity of sa calculated from langmuir model are 92 16 mg g for phosphate and 66 23 mg g for fluoride which are higher than most solid wastes natural minerals and even some synthetic materials table 6 furthermore the majority of these adsorbents are only feasible for single contaminant given the high adsorption capacity low cost avoidance of adsorbent synthesis and the utilization of solid waste sa has been proved to be a highly competitive material for the removal of phosphate and fluoride from acid wastewater 3 6 characterization of straw ash before and after the removal of phosphate fluoride 3 6 1 zeta potential and sem eds analysis zeta potentials of sa as a function of ph are shown in fig 5 the point of zero charge pzc of sa was measured as 4 5 in the presence of either phosphate or fluoride the value of phpzc shifted to the lower ph indicating the high affinity of the two contaminants to sa li et al 2020a the sem images fig 6 a and b exhibit the accidented surface of sa there are abundant pores exposed on the surface of different particles which can provide a large number of active sites for contaminants the eds mappings reveal highly coincidental distribution of element si o k al ca indicating the skeleton structure of sa is constituted by these elements together by comparing the sem images given in fig 6 b and d e it can be seen that some particles are presented on the surface of sa after the phosphate fluoride removal the eds analysis fig 6 a and b indicate high contents of ca p and o in the particles on the surface of sa after phosphate removal in addition high level of ca and f contents were also detected after the removal of fluoride fig 6 c and d it can be reasonably inferred that phosphate and fluoride were well immobilized onto sa surface through chemical precipitated with ca2 3 6 2 ftir and xrd analysis ftir spectra of sa before and after adsorption of phosphate fluoride are illustrated in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 a the intensity of the peak at 3407 98 cm 1 is associated with the hydroxyl oh stretching the peaks at 1434 94 cm 1 and 875 62 cm 1 confirm the presence of the ca al si vibration ye et al 2019 the stretching around 1083 92 cm 1 corresponded to al o bend dubey et al 2018 besides the si o si 779 19 cm 1 and 457 10 cm 1 were detected in sa roy et al 2017 after adsorption of phosphate and fluoride fig 7 b and c the vibration of ca al si weakened and even disappeared demonstrating that the chemical composition contained ca al si was in decline during the adsorption process this might be caused by the hydration reaction of metal oxide in sa in addition the vibrations of al o and si o si both increased and the peaks exhibited blue or red shift it could be explained by inductive effects of phosphate and fluoride on the group or the formation of hydrogen bond these phenomena indicated the interactions of phosphate and fluoride with groups on sa the xrd patterns of sa before and after adsorption of phosphate fluoride were detected as shown in fig 8 it can be observed that the crystalline phases of sa before adsorption are dominated by quartz sio2 sanidine kalsi3o8 and anorthite caal2si2o8 obviously the intensities of peaks representing kalsi3o8 and caal2si2o8 were reduced after the adsorption for both phosphate and fluoride indicating their participation in the adsorption process this result was consistent with the analysis of ftir after the sa was subjected to phosphate adsorption the emerging peaks at 2θ 26 60 30 19 and 25 60 are in accordance with cahpo4 dibasic calcium phosphate dcp pdf 77 0128 the diffraction peaks at 2θ 31 59 31 47 27 68 29 55 25 58 23 08 22 72 and 24 37 are assigned to ca4h po4 3 2 5h2o octacalcium phosphate ocp pdf 44 0778 and the peaks attributed to ca5 po4 3 oh hydroxyapatite hap pdf 84 1998 also appeared at 2θ 31 79 32 92 32 22 and 34 09 on the other hand after the adsorption of fluoride alf3 pdf 83 0717 at peaks of 2θ 21 38 27 68 and 27 77 was generated and the peaks belong to caf2 pdf 75 0097 were also detected at 2θ 28 28 and 55 77 3 7 removal mechanisms as exhibited in fig 2 the solution ph was a critical parameter affecting the removal performance the adsorption depends directly on the surface charge of adsorbents and the charge is determined by the solution ph when the solution ph lower than phpzc the surface of sa was positively charged due to the protonation as eq 9 phosphate exists in different dominant species at different ph h3po4 ph 2 13 h2po4 ph 2 13 7 20 hpo4 2 ph 7 20 12 33 and po4 3 ph 12 33 ye et al 2017 it could be seen from fig 2 that h2po4 and hpo4 2 were the dominant species while fluoride was dominated by f under the experimental conditions therefore the electrostatic attraction took place between positively charged surface of sa and phosphate fluoride ions as eqs 10 11 9 sur oh h sur oh2 10 sur oh2 hpo4 2 h2po4 sur oh2 hpo4 2 h2po4 11 sur oh2 f sur oh2 f furthermore phosphate and fluoride species are also preferentially adsorbed by hydroxyl groups on the surface of oxides in aqueous solution ligand hydroxyl groups would be generated on the hydrous oxide surface of particles sio2 and al2o3 for instance in adsorbents thus active sites were developed for the ligand exchange between phosphate fluoride and ligand hydroxyl groups dhillon et al 2018 dos reis et al 2020 this was well confirmed by the change of al o and si o si stretching vibration in ftir spectrum the reaction could be described as eq 12 14 similar theories have also been proposed by other researchers for the phosphate fluoride adsorption dhillon et al 2018 kumari et al 2020 xue et al 2009 zhang et al 2018 12 13 14 sur oh f h sur f h2o where sur stands for the surface sites of sa and sur oh represents a surface hydroxyl group as the initial ph increased the protonation effect was waning and the surface of sa was deprotonated with reaction described as eq 15 resulting in a negative charge hence the electrostatic repulsion between sa and phosphate fluoride was enhanced leading to the poor adsorption efficiency additionally the higher solution ph brought about the higher concentration of oh which could generate a remarkable competitive effect with phosphate fluoride for the sorption sites on sa thus the removal efficiency would also get reduced 15 sur oh oh sur o h2o moreover it could be indicated from the sem eds and xrd analysis that chemical precipitation played a predominant role in the removal process of phosphate and fluoride the metal oxide in sa dissolved in aqueous solution as eq 16 which in turn increased the solution ph to alkaline fig 5 and promoted the chemical precipitation between cationic such as ca2 and al3 with phosphate fluoride on the sa surface 16 m x o y yh2o xm 2 y x 2yoh m ca al k etc significantly the chemical precipitation of phosphate involved complicated reaction processes under the influence of ca p and ph generally when the ca p molar ratio exceeds 1 67 ca2 oh and phosphate can directly form hap which is the most thermodynamically stable phrase liu et al 2019 however as the sa was added into the phosphate solution the ca2 and oh were gradually released thus the precursors such as dcp and ocp observed in the xrd analysis would preferentially generate with the increase of thermodynamic driving force the precursors dcp and ocp were transformed into more stable phase hap while the transformation from precursors to hap was incomplete because the formation of hap was much slower than that of the precursors moreover the limitation of ca2 released by sa also restricted the transformation to hap thus resulting in the less peaks with low intensities belonging to hap in fig 8 the chemical precipitation of fluoride was relatively explicit the reactions are given below 17 ca2 2f caf2 18 al3 3f alf3 3 8 industrial wastewater treatment to evaluate the practicability of sa for industrial wastewater sa was used to simultaneously removal phosphate and fluoride of the washing water of phosphogypsum the initial concentrations of phosphate and fluoride of industrial wastewater were 2145 and 1450 mg l respectively table 1 as shown in fig 9 the removal efficiency for phosphate and fluoride reached 91 79 and 97 82 by using 150 g l adsorbent at such high initial concentrations of containments indicating that the sa could be a promising adsorbent for the synchronous phosphate and fluoride removal from industrial wastewater moreover the solution ph increased from 2 3 to 7 52 at 150 g l dosage of sa thus can effectively solve the problem of highly acidic of industrial wastewater and lower the treatment cost the removal efficiency of phosphate and fluoride presented little growth when the dosage of sa increased over 150 g l while the solution ph gradually raised to highly alkaline therefore the dosage of sa should be within a certain limit in practical application 4 conclusions the present study shows that the sa is a cost effective and environmentally friendly adsorbent for the removal of phosphate and fluoride from aqueous solution the solution ph was a critical parameter for the removal of phosphate fluoride and the removal efficiency decreased with the increase of initial ph at initial solution ph of 2 the removal efficiency of sa 25 g l for phosphate 200 mg l achieved 88 20 and the fluoride 100 mg l removal rate by sa 50 g l was 87 52 the adsorption process followed the pseudo second order kinetic model and langmuir isotherm indicating that phosphate fluoride adsorption on sa were dominated by chemical reactions leading to monolayer adsorption the maximum adsorption capacities of sa were 92 16 mg g for phosphate and 66 23 mg g for fluoride the sem eds and xrd analysis indicate that chemical precipitation played a predominant role for phosphate fluoride removal from aqueous solution electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange with hydroxyl groups also exited in the removal process the results of industrial wastewater treatment revealed that the sa could be a promising adsorbent
