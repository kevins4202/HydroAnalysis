735,numerous methods are used to measure contact angles θ in multiphase systems the wettability and θ are primary controls on co2 residual trapping during geologic carbon storage gcs and determining these values within rock pores is paramount to increasing storage efficiency one traditional experimental approach is the sessile drop method which involves θ measurements on a single image of droplets more recent developments utilize x ray micro computed tomography ct scans which provide the resolutions necessary to image in situ θ of fluids at representative conditions however experimental micro ct data is limited and varied to further examine θ distributions in supercritical co2 brine sandstone systems a combination of manual and automated θ measurement methods were utilized to measure θ using both sessile drop and micro ct images of two sandstone cores the purpose of this work was threefold 1 compare two current and two new θ measuring methods using micro ct images of scco2 brine sandstone systems 2 determine how traditional experimental method sessile drop θ results compare to in situ θ results micro ct and 3 determine if the matlab contact angle algorithm mcaa from klise et al 2016 can be used to measure θ scco2 brine sandstone systems one of the two new methods utilizing open source software resulted in comparable average θ and θ ranges to the primary manual measuring method andrew et al 2014b reported in literature that requires commercial software to complete an additional new method involves immersive interaction with micro ct image volumes that no other software currently provides both processes are found to be promising for future work θ measured using micro ct images at in situ conditions result in a broader θ distribution than those measured using sessile drop images these findings suggest some pores are intermediate wet in an in situ sandstone system and factors other than interfacial tension influence trapping lastly mcaa θ results consistently produced broader θ distributions and higher average θ than the manual θ measurements this is a result of some automated measurements incorrectly identifying directional quantities leading to skewed results mcaa is still promising for future work with careful attention to data interpretation keywords contact angle supercritical co2 matlab contact angle algorithm micro ct 1 introduction wetting phenomena was first recognized by galileo in 1612 galileo 1612 and equations to characterize contact angles θ were produced by young nearly 200 years later in 1805 young 1805 young found that the θ of a drop on an ideal surface is a function of the three interfacial tensions influencing the drop s mechanical equilibrium γ lg cos θ y γ sg γ sl where γlg γsg and γsl represent the liquid gas solid gas and solid liquid interfacial tensions and θy is young s contact angle the traditional definition for θ is the tangent of the drop profile at the three phase contact point where the liquid gas interface meets the solid liquid interface erbil 2014 wetting is defined as a fluid s tendency to adhere to a solid when another fluid is present and can be quantified by θ the angle indicates if wetting of a surface is favorable θ 90 or unfavorable θ 90 with respect to a solid yuan and lee 2013 geologic carbon storage gcs is one application where understanding properties of θ is important gcs involves the capture of excess carbon dioxide co2 from point sources and subsequent injection into geologic formations there are four primary mechanisms for co2 trapping structural capillary residual solubility and mineral trapping iglauer 2011 the wettability and θ are primary controls on co2 residual trapping sahimi 1993 and determining these values within rock pores is paramount to increasing storage efficiency traditionally θ have been measured on smooth flat surfaces using experimental methods such as the sessile drop using sessile drop images marmur 2006 highlighted the complexities present by showing the difference between the actual θ and the apparent θ as seen in fig 1 a the actual θ can only be identified when the details of a surface are captured in the imaging process this shows how different a θ measurement can be when the fluid solid plane tangent to the drop is able to be precisely determined however at the time of marmur s 2006 study the actual contact angle could not be identified because the surface topology was not captured in the imaging process additional studies using sessile drop were completed with conflicting results when certain testing parameters are changed e g temperature pressure brine salinity surface roughness etc farokhpoor et al 2013 saraji et al 2013 wang et al 2013 iglauer et al 2014 saraji et al 2014 al yaseri et al 2016 more recent sessile drop studies completed by botto et al 2017 and tudek et al 2017 used mt simon sandstone cores from different depths in a supercritical co2 scco2 brine and liquid co2 brine systems both used the imagej dropsnake plugin stalder et al 2006 to measure θ on sessile drop images fig 1b displays additional complexities in an enclosed geometry when measuring in situ θ using micro computed tomography ct scanning while measuring θ on flat surfaces remains complex obtaining accurate θ on non flat surfaces in three dimensional image volumes remains a more significant endeavor yet to be perfected from literature it is clear θ varies throughout a pore network and cannot be represented by a single θ measured on a flat surface yuan and lee 2013 klise et al 2016 pore geometry pore dimensions pore throat sizes and surface roughness all affect flow ketcham and carlson 2001 and likely influence θ but are not considered in traditional laboratory experiments or in young s equation the inherent intricacies of fluid distribution in natural porous media require continued research to expand a more robust database of in situ θ manual θ measurement methods using micro ct were developed and used by many previous studies tudek et al 2017 klise et al 2016 andrew et al 2014b lv et al 2016 lv et al 2017 iglauer et al 2015 singh et al 2016 m khishvand et al 2016b m khishvand et al 2016a however only andrew et al 2014b lv et al 2016 2017 and tudek et al 2017 are discussed further as each study used a co2 brine system the andrew et al 2014b methodology is the foundation from which additional micro ct θ measurements arose and is heavily cited throughout literature tudek et al 2017 klise et al 2016 andrew et al 2014b lv et al 2016 lv et al 2017 iglauer et al 2015 singh et al 2016 m khishvand et al 2016b m khishvand et al 2016a scanziani et al 2017 alratrout et al 2017 in this work the authors performed in situ θ measurements on micro ct images of a ketton limestone brine scco2 system at residual conditions the angle measurement method involved obtaining the contact line and resampling the data to a plane normal to the contact line from there a 3d angle tool was used by tracing vectors tangent to the solid surface and the scco2 brine interface lv et al also obtained the contact line in micro ct images first in an unconsolidated glass bead system lv et al 2016 and then in a comparison of scco2 brine quartz sand and scco2 glass bead systems lv et al 2017 contact points were randomly selected and labeled along the contact line image slices were manually rotated to find the normal plane perpendicular to the three phase interface and each angle was measured both by a computer and manually to ensure measurement accuracy most recently tudek et al 2017 performed a detailed θ study using mt simon sandstone micro ct images in a liquid co2 brine system θ were completed using the imagej angle tool schneider et al 2012 following six pre specified criteria manual θ measurements are cumbersome and may be prone to bias from one operator to the next scanziani et al 2017 hence the development of automated processes was pursued with the goal to measure numerous angles throughout large datasets klise et al 2016 scanziani et al 2017 alratrout et al 2017 lunati et al 2016 blunt 2017 s khorsandi et al 2017b peng and xiao 2017 a m alhammadi et al 2017b a m alhammadi et al 2017a s khorsandi et al 2017a jafari and jung 2017 the algorithm developed by klise et al 2016 calculates θ by finding the angle between planes fit to each solid fluid and fluid fluid interface in the region surrounding the contact point with all points defined in the wetting phase scanziani et al 2017 developed an algorithm to estimate the effective θ based on constraints from the natural curvature between two fluid phases θ was computed using two lines one obtained using the young laplace equation to capture the fluid fluid curvature and the second used a moving average to establish the solid fluid interface similarly alratrout et al 2017 developed a robust algorithm that involves the identification of each vertice edge and face throughout a segmented image stack followed by gaussian smoothing to eliminate noise artifacts while preserving rock structure additional smoothing is applied to the fluid fluid interface to obtain constant curvature two normal vectors are placed at each contact point and the dot product of these two vectors are used to measure θ at every contact point along the contact line both scanziani et al 2017 and alratrout et al 2017 completed manual measurements following andrew et al 2014b methodology on a single ganglion to verify their algorithms in these studies manual and automated results were in good agreement numerous differences are present among the studies outlined above including rock type testing conditions temperature and pressure image processing steps θ measurement method and number of θ measured some studies report an average θ while others report a distribution and or median value advancements have been made to characterize θ at reservoir conditions but measurement variations among methods have not been evaluated if discrepancies are present among methods they need to be better understood to know if results among studies are comparable simply from a measuring standpoint let alone all the additional differences listed in this study images from two micro ct experiments are used for measuring θ from both a berea and a mt simon sandstone core sessile drop images were obtained on a single mt simon sample and used compare experimental methods on the mt simon sandstone only seven methods to measure θ are evaluated 1 imagej dropsnake plugin stalder et al 2006 2 imagej angle tool schneider et al 2012 3 imagej angle tool schneider et al 2012 following six criteria from tudek et al 2017 4 a new method using the imagej angle tool schneider et al 2012 inspired from tudek et al 2017 5 pergeos angle tool fei 2016 using a resampling method from andrew et al 2014b 6 new 3d virtual reality software syglass angle tool pidhorskyi et al 2018 and 7 the automated matlab contact angle algorithm mcaa from klise et al 2016 the purpose of this work was not to determine a best contact angle measurement method but to evaluate and compare past methods to ensure they provide consistent results among studies already completed 2 experimental and methodology section the purpose of this work was threefold 1 to compare two current and two new θ measuring methods using micro ct images of a scco2 brine berea sandstone system 2 to determine how traditional experimental method sessile drop θ results compare to in situ θ results micro ct in a scco2 brine mt simon sandstone system and 3 determine if the matlab contact angle algorithm mcaa from klise et al 2016 can be used to measure θ in scco2 brine sandstone systems it should be noted that current θ methods are evaluated following the procedures described in prior publications as they were applied to past datasets many of these methods have tuning parameters however it is important to better understand how prior results compare among studies and to what extent different variables e g method resolution image processing etc may influence θ results 2 1 experimental method and image type the following section outlines the two experimental methods used in this work sessile drop and micro ct sessile drop method involves the capture of a single image in a viewing glass while micro ct images a volume image stack each apparatus and sandstone samples used are outlined below 2 1 1 sessile drop experiment a schematic of the custom sessile drop setup based on wang and clarens 2012 located at the university of texas austin is displayed in fig 2 the custom high temperature and pressure viewing cell is a 9 5 cm outer diameter stainless steel cylinder with a hollow interior 2 5 cm diameter set in an l shaped stainless steel stage a single mt simon rock sample from a depth of 2111 35 m 6927 ft was trimmed using a slow cut diamond saw to 2 5 cm 2 5 cm 0 95 cm dimensions no polishing or manipulation of the surface was completed the sample was set within a custom glass holder 3 8 cm long by 2 5 cm diameter the ends of the cylinder were secured with a teflon o ring a sapphire window and secured with a threaded screw brine was injected from the top port before the vessel was brought up to temperature 52 c with heating tape managed by a labview program a teledyne isco pump 100dm was used to inject co2 to bring the vessel up to constant pressure 21 99 mpa an avt ccd camera guppy f 038c nir with a 16 mm zoom lens fujinon was set up at one end of the cell facing the sapphire window to record time lapse images every 5 minutes over 3 hours 2 1 2 micro ct experiments a schematic of the u s department of energy national energy technology laboratory netl micro ct flow through setup is displayed in fig 3 a the setup is identical to tudek et al 2017 with the addition of a variable 12 v power supply to control temperature of a peltier plate to maintain elevated temperatures in the beryllium vessel three isco pumps and one reactor chamber are used in the core flooding apparatus gaseous co2 is connected to the delivery pump which is connected to the reactor chamber where brine is exposed to co2 stirred and allowed to equilibrate 24 hours allowing time for dissolution cores were placed in a confining sleeve with aluminum spacers at both ends to eliminate capillary end effects fig 3b once secured in the beryllium vessel it was placed in the zeiss versa xrm 400 ct scanner the core was saturated with brine to restore wettability system pressure was elevated to 12 4 mpa pore pressure and 14 5 mpa confining pressure and temperature was raised to achieve scco2 conditions 47 0 c after twenty four hours co2 saturated brine was flooded through the core followed by a drainage and imbibition cycle to reach residual conditions all flowrates ranged from 0 1 to 1 0 ml min at the testing temperatures and pressures correspond to a capillary number below 10 6 e g values typically seen in reservoirs lake 1989 niu et al 2014 which means flow was dominated by capillary forces for each experiment core details are listed in table 1 the mt simon core is from a depth of 2111 35 m 6927 ft and the berea core was cored a 50 8 mm by 152 4 mm core berea was used for the first flow through test with co2 at supercritical conditions using the netl micro ct flow through setup because berea is a standard sandstone for core flow testing scco2 is attained when carbon dioxide reaches or surpasses both its critical temperature 31 1 c and pressure 7 39 mpa at this point co2 exhibits intermediate behavior between states while possessing the properties of both a fluid and a gas e g possess liquid like density viscosities more like the gas state and will expand to fill void area like a gas the brine recipe used for the berea test was a potassium iodide ki brine with a 10 wt salinity to obtain sufficient contrast between brine and scco2 mt simon brine table a 1 designed to have comparable properties to the resident brine in the mt simon formation was used for the mt simon sample the mt simon core is shorter than the berea core because the mt simon rock was too friable to core using a core drill a handheld rotary tool with a diamond bit was used to sculpt the cores to the dimensions listed in table 1 scans were completed at using a 4x optic at 150 kv and 9 8 w equal to a current of 65 µa this is the highest voltage attainable with the ct scanner and was used to obtain images more quickly and reduce noise 2 2 contact angle measurement methods the following section outlines the seven θ measurement methods evaluated in this work each method is labeled as a two or three dimensional 2d or 3d measurement method as well as manual m or automated a these two identifiers are separated by a dash prior to each method name the analysis naming scheme herein is as follows 1 imagej dropsnake stalder et al 2006 2d m dropsnake 2 imagej angle tool schneider et al 2012 2d m angletool 3 tudek et al 2017 method completed using the imagej angle tool schneider et al 2012 2d m criteria 4 new method using three plane views and the imagej angle tool schneider et al 2012 2d m planes 5 andrew et al 2014b method using the pergeos angle tool fei 2016 3d m resampling 6 morehead et al pidhorskyi et al 2018 syglass 3d virtual reality software angle tool 3d m syglass 7 klise et al 2016 automated matlab contact angle algorithm mcaa 3d a mcaa 2 2 1 2d m dropsnake imagej dropsnake plugin is a general method that was developed specifically for measuring θ on sessile drops stalder et al 2006 this plugin requires a flat surface and single drop from which points along the 2d drop shape can either be user or automatically defined these points are then used to measure the angles on either side of the drop using a piecewise polynomial fit if there are multiple drops in an image this procedure must be completed for each drop in this work 2d m dropsnake is used to measure θ on original sessile drop images using manually defined points 2 2 2 2d m angletool imagej angle tool schneider et al 2012 measures angles according to three user defined points placed on a specified measurement plane each point snaps to a pixel corner according to manual placement made by the user in this study 2d m angletool is used to measure angles manually on segmented sessile drop images for a manual comparison to the 3d a mcaa process which also requires segmented images this measurement tool is also used in two additional methods but with additional requirements in completing θ measurements these are outlined below as 2d m criteria and 2d m planes 2 2 3 2d m criteria θ measurements completed using the imagej angle tool schneider et al 2012 following six criteria outlined in tudek et al 2017 were completed on original micro ct images the six criteria are as follows 1 a smooth and uniform matrix surface 2 the matrix surface must be perpendicular to the slice 3 the angle must be perpendicular to the matrix surface 4 measurements were taken equidistant from the leading and trailing edge of each bubble 5 the angle must be stable over tens of slices and 6 the interface must be clearly visible extending a minimum of 10 voxels and must not contain imaging artifacts that may influence image fidelity and the measurement 2 2 4 2d m planes a new method was inspired from tudek et al 2017 who found θ varied along a liquid co2 ganglion between 50 and 90 and concluded this variation may be loosely correlated to the localized pore constriction encompassing a trapped ganglion this change in pore geometry and visual observations of the micro ct image stacks used in this work led to the development of a more comprehensive manual method the first step in this method is applying an imagej non local means edge preserving filter buades et al 2005 buades et al 2008 to the data to remove unwanted noise the data is segmented to obtain the contact line from there the contact points are overlain on the filtered data and θ measurements were completed at each contact point along the xy plane from the first slice where the scco2 ganglion was present successively to the last identical steps were then completed along the resliced xz and yz planes completing this procedure in multiple planes and at every contact point provides a more comprehensive θ analysis as the angles are better quantified and the effects of pore geometry can be analyzed further 2 2 5 3d m resampling andrew et al s 2014b methodology is the most cited method in literature used on micro ct data one drawback is that commercial software is needed to complete the method and researchers without access to specific software cannot use this method notably the most novel aspect of andrew et al 2014b method is the resampling of the data to a plane using the contact line this method improves upon traditional processes as more precise planes and a 3d angle measuring tool are used to determine θ however it should be noted that while the pergeos angle tool is a 3d device these measurements are still completed on a 2d plane which restricts the measurement to a pre defined 2d surface in this study data was image processed and measured using pergeos software fei 2016 successor to avizo fire a 3d non local means filter was applied to the original data and a watershed algorithm was used to establish phases once phases were separated the contact line fig 4 a and b was obtained and used to measure angles from the surface line of the void following the methodology outlined in andrew et al 2014b 150 θ were measured on each filtered fig 4c and each segmented fig 4d dataset to see if the filtered and segmented results varied both data types were analyzed because segmented data is currently the data type required for automated processes if variation or inconsistencies are present between data types they need to be identified and analyzed further 2 2 6 3d m syglass istovisio inc is a startup company out of west virginia university that has recently developed a novel 3d immersive virtual reality visualization system called syglass pidhorskyi et al 2018 data is loaded into the software where the operator is free to move and rotate 360 to better visualize datasets while simultaneously having the capability to slice through any observable plane 3d objects can also be segmented manually in 3d creating an expedited process for data extraction a brand new feature utilizes similar coding to measure angles in 3d meaning contact angles can be measured using an initial defined plane with the second tangent plane having no restrictions to the data orientation the second plane used to measure angles can be moved freely in any direction from that point this process affords manual control and is a promising prospect for future work for more information on the process two supplementary videos s1 https youtu be nwwyckprjjs and s2 https youtu be 6 bbdjwbjnu showing 3d visualization and the angle measuring process can be viewed 2 2 7 3d a mcaa in klise et al 2016 mcaa was developed to measure θ using micro ct data from a glass and plastic bead kerosene brine system this was the first automated process used to analyze 3d volumes of interest vois alratrout et al 2017 a m alhammadi et al 2017b and not a single ganglion scanziani et al 2017 mcaa calculates θ by finding the angle between planes fit to each solid fluid and fluid fluid interface in the region surrounding the contact point with all points defined in the wetting phase θ is obtained by taking the dot product of the normal vectors to each interface the algorithm defines the direction of each normal vectors based on the location of the wetting phase if the direction is incorrectly identified in this automated process i e the vector is flipped the supplementary angle is reported the authors report that image resolution segmentation process and or different pore geometries need to be tested to further determine the precision and robustness of the algorithm for this study mcaa was run with the following parameters for both sessile drop and micro ct image stacks face connectivity 6 search radius 5 and minimum number of points 3 as listed in klise et al 2016 specific segmentation steps were required for each set of images and are outlined below 2 2 7 1 sessile drop image stack preparation to run mcaa on 2d sessile drop images data was segmented into three phases solid sandstone dense liquid phase brine and lower density phase scco2 segmented images were then made into image stacks of 20 with 5 blank images at each end to avoid end effects when running the algorithm 2 2 7 2 micro ct image stack preparation the micro ct files also required data segmented into three phases solid sandstone dense liquid phase brine and lower density phase scco2 but with additional segmentation steps for accurate 3d results segmentation steps using imagej were as follows 1 imagej non local means filter buades et al 2005 buades et al 2008 on raw data fig 5 a and b 2 threshold pores fig 5c and scco2 fig 5d from filtered data 3 use imagej plugin erode3d on pores and dilate3d on scco2 an equal number of iterations until phases are in contact while maintaining accurate pore structure and 4 combine scco2 and pores into a three phase image fig 5e and f other opensource segmentation software ilastik sommer et al 2011 yielded similar segmentation results and can be used for this step but this was deemed the most efficient segmentation method within imagej to obtain adequate contact between phases step 3 dilate3d and erode3d were each completed a single iteration and it is recommended no more than two iterations be completed on an roi to reduce data manipulation step 3 could impact the contact line and the contact angle to a similar degree applying a 3d watershed algorithm or seeded training algorithm could impact the contact line and angle the extent to which this could influence the results cannot be quantified but if the phases are not in contact after segmentation the results would be less accurate the dilate3d step is technically more controlled as a single line of voxels is being added along the phases whereas a watershed is growing across boundaries which is highly variable 2 3 methodology overview specific experimental and analysis details are shown in a flow chart in fig 6 and should be referenced throughout the paper to classify each core s wettability criteria more specific to a reservoir is used herein water wet w w 0 75 intermediate wet i w 75 105 or scco2 wet s w 105 180 iglauer et al 2015 the first analysis involved examining two current 2d m criteria and 3d m resampling on both filtered and segmented data and two new methods 2d m planes and 3d m syglass used to measure θ on micro ct image stacks of scco2 brine sandstone systems five scco2 ganglia regions of interest rois were carefully selected and cropped from the berea micro ct images and used for analysis analyses on pore geometry using the 2d m planes methods and differences in data type using the 3d m resampling method are completed as preliminary detailed analyses the mean range and θ distribution were used to determine how θ results compare among measurement methods and if 2d m planes and 3d m syglass are viable options for measuring θ using statistical analysis the second analysis was completed using both sessile drop and micro ct images from a mt simon core to determine how results from the two different experimental methods compare and to test if 3d a mcaa results in comparable θ to manual measurement methods ten sessile drop images containing multiple droplets imaged in the view cell were analyzed with three measurement methods 2d m dropsnake 2d m angletool and 3d a mcaa four micro ct scans from three locations top middle bottom along the mt simon core at residual conditions were scanned the top was scanned at 2 32 µm and the bottom was scanned at 1 66 µm the middle was scanned at two resolutions 1 66 µm and 2 32 µm to analyze the effects of resolution on 3d a mcaa θ distributions each scan was cropped to a single 640 µm3 voi top and bottom scans were run using 3d a mcaa for comparison to each middle scan and each middle scan θ was measured using one manual 2d m planes and one automated 3d a mcaa method one identical scco2 ganglia was cropped to an roi from each middle scan and only 3d a mcaa was used for a more detailed analysis 3 results 3 1 berea micro ct roi manual contact angle measurements detailed results from measuring θ using the 2d m planes method are displayed in fig 7 the mean θ is placed above one slice from the plane of measurement images are included to show the shape of each scco2 roi ganglion and the surrounding geometry present from one plane to the next θ was highest in the yz plane which was the direction of flow while both xy and xz planes resulted in lower average θ scco2 becomes trapped within the pore structure while resisting the forces during flowing conditions abrupt jumps in θ along a plane e g the end of roi 2 xy plane plot data represent angles measured as the ganglion reached a constriction tudek et al 2017 found θ to vary between 50 and 90 through a pore constriction here a broader θ range was observed within individual rois and throughout multiple plane views this further confirms pore geometry influences resultant local θ measurements additionally all 150 θ from each roi using the 3d m resampling on filtered and segmented data are plotted as frequency distributions in fig 8 a e each roi θ distribution reveals discrepancies between data types some distributions are bimodal with no set trend present among rois in three cases the mean θ was higher for the filtered data rois 2 4 and 5 one higher for the segmented data roi 3 and one approximately equal for filtered and segmented roi 1 however combining all 750 θ for both filtered and segmented data fig 8f resulted in similar ranges filtered 10 105 and segmented 5 110 means filtered 44 4 and segmented 43 5 and standard deviations filtered 14 3 and segmented 17 0 filtered and segmented data are in good agreement when looking at the overall averages but discrepancies are present between the different data types per individual roi this suggests segmented data angles may vary from filtered data angles but when numerous angle locations are included in the analysis the overall means and ranges should be in good agreement fig 8f since automated methods require segmented data this suggests automated results should be accurate but may not be precise table 2 contains individual and combined θ results for each measurement method completed on the five berea rois all mean θ results classify the berea core as a water wet system however ranges vary among methods 2d m criteria resulted in the highest average and narrowest range of the manual processes 2d m criteria methodology provides precise θ measurements but the rigid requirements inevitably restrict the angles being evaluated and likely does not capture the true range of angles present throughout a reservoir 2d m planes and both 3d m resampling means and ranges are similar while the syglass results are slightly lower while the 2d m planes method is not as precise as 3d m resampling measuring angles in multiple planes appears to capture the average θ and θ range well only 20 measurements were completed using the 3d m syglass which is in part leading to lower results the purpose of this analysis was to review four manual contact angle measurement methods θ distributions means and standard deviations for each method are plotted in fig 9 because each manual method is labor intensive with varying number of measurements recorded among methods extensive statistical analyses to determine statistical significance was not completed among methods 3 2 mt simon sessile drop and micro ct contact angle measurements 3 2 1 sessile drop 2d m dropsnake method results on sessile drop images of a scco2 brine setup using a mt simon sample was 32 8 both botto et al 2017 and tudek et al 2017 found similar θ averages of 35 and 30 on mt simon sandstones from different depths while 2d m dropsnake results are consistent with past results using the same method both 2d m angletool and 3d a mcaa measurements on the segmented sessile drop images resulted in higher average θ than the 2d m dropsnake method used on the original images table 3 potential reasons were analyzed further first 2d m dropsnake measurements are not confined to a specified pixel color nor are they confined to pixel geometry partial volume effects impact segmentation and while a pixel in a raw image can fall somewhere on a grayscale spectrum after segmentation a pixel is either scco2 brine or sandstone second 2d m dropsnake utilizes the entire bubble shape with angle measurement lines spanning the length of a sessile drop s edge whereas 2d m angletool measurements were purposely completed using only three to five pixel lengths to compare to 3d a mcaa segmentation combined with pixel restrictions in both the 2d m angletool and 3d a mcaa methods may contribute to the higher angle averages from the 3d a mcaa output x y and z slice number coordinates were obtained for each contact point and angle measured image stack 1 further review of the contact points showed points were only identified on the right side of each image and angles identified on the end slices slice 10 and 21 were supplementary angles to those identified in the middle slices slices 11 to 19 as seen in fig 10 this could be a result of the proximity of the contact point to the image edge since both angles identified furthest to the right in slice 10 and 21 were flipped to the supplementary angle however only one of the angles located farther left on slices 10 and 21 was flipped fig 10 these end angles were removed and re averaged and are included in table 3 when this step was taken the 2d m angletool and 3d a mcaa results are in better agreement furthermore the additional minor difference observed between 2d m angletool and 3d a mcaa average θ can be explained using fig 11 2d m angletool is designed to link to pixel corners when taking an angle measurement fig 11a when measured from the upper left corner the measured angle is 45 0 fig 11a measuring the same angle from the lower corner results in a lower θ equal to 33 7 fig 11b and measuring the same angle from the upper right corner results in an angle equal to 56 3 fig 11c the difference in the upper left corner compared to the lower left and upper right corner angles is 11 7 in both cases 3d a mcaa is designed to measure θ through the center of the pixels fig 11d and at the same contact point results in an angle equal to 39 5 in the 3d a mcaa the fluid fluid tangent line will change by half the pixel height when measured through the pixel center dividing 11 7 by 2 equates to 5 9 which when subtracted from 45 0 or added to 33 7 results in a contact angle between 39 1 and 39 6 which is equal to the 3d a mcaa result the 5 9 difference within a single θ measurement between the 2d m angletool and 3d a mcaa methods provides one explanation for the 1 6 difference in the mean θ 3 2 2 micro ct one hundred 2d m planes measurements were done in each plane to quantify θ in each middle scan imaged at different resolutions table 4 mean and median θ were in good agreement among scan resolutions with no substantial differences found among planes each sample mean qualified as w w systems with ranges spanning into i w angles 3d a mcaa was run on vois from four scans taken at different heights along the same core both the top and middle fig 12 a and bottom and middle fig 12b scans at the same resolutions resulted in nearly identical θ distributions with consistent mean and median values this suggests the location of a cubed voi throughout a core should result in θ representative of an entire core when using 3d a mcaa each 3d a mcaa median and average θ qualify as w w systems but unlike the 2d planes method the ranges show some angles qualified as s w while scans at the same resolutions have agreeable results the middle scan means are approximately 10 different between the 2 32 µm and 1 66 µm scans while the 2d m planes results were similar between resolutions thousands of angle measurements are an improvement over hundreds but θ distribution plots in fig 12 are bimodal with peaks appearing to be supplementary angles mt simon sessile drop 3d a mcaa results showed vectors were being flipped on the slices towards the end of the image stacks since only two angles are measured on a single drop flipped vectors could easily be identified and excluded however thousands of θ were measured in each voi making it cumbersome to locate incorrectly identified angles identical rois segmented from each middle voi are used to verify 3d a mcaa table 5 contains 2d m planes 3d m resampling and 3d a mcaa mean and median θ results for each roi the mean and median values are in better agreement than the voi mean and median values for each middle scan however there are still differences in the median values between resolutions review of the roi ranges shows minimum and maximum θ for each roi are approximately supplementary angles the 3d a mcaa 2d m planes and 3d m resampling roi θ distributions are plotted in fig 13 while some of the 3d a mcaa angles are clearly outliers the distributions among resolutions and among the 3d a mcaa 2d m planes and 3d m resampling methods are agreeable with the 3d a mcaa results shifted to slightly lower angle measurements excluding outliers and lower frequency overall tudek et al 2017 completed manual measurements on two different scan resolution images 0 68 µm and 1 7 µm and found resolution did not impact average θ 2d m planes resulted in consistent mean and median values between resolutions while some discrepancies were found within each 3d method 3d m resampling resulted in approximately 10 difference in both mean and median values between resolutions and 3d a mcaa resulted in a 6 difference in median values these slight discrepancies should be considered when comparing results using these methods 4 discussion completing manual measurements of contact angles provides insight into detailed observations that can be overlooked with an automated process andrew et al 2014b 3d m resampling methodology on both filtered and segmented data revealed similar averages and ranges when all θ measurements were combined but review of individual ganglia showed inconsistencies between data types moreover 3d a mcaa measurements are confined to both segmentation accuracy and pixel geometry while manual angle measurement methods utilizing tools such as dropsnake stalder et al 2006 and pergeos 3d angle tool fei 2016 are not these results combined with results showing resolution influenced 3d a mcaa θ distributions suggest automated processes using segmented data can provide accurate θ but care in data interpretation must be conducted the new 2d m planes method resulted in similar θ distributions and ranges to 3d m resampling andrew et a sl 2014b method these findings are used as evidence to use 2d m planes method when pergeos avizo fire is not available to a researcher completing similar work from detailed analyses on the 2d m planes results geometry was found to influence θ in the berea rois further supporting past findings from tudek et al 2017 suggesting pore geometry plays a role in situ residual trapping and resultant θ distribution throughout a sandstone pore network additionally 3d m syglass method was also consistent with other manual methods reviewed however the limited number of angles used for measurements needs to be further evaluated to determine a more precise comparison and should be pursued further in future work comparing mt simon mean θ classifications between experimental methods shows the mt simon sandstone is w w for both sessile drop and micro ct mean θ results but θ ranges in the in situ micro ct analyses was broader than sessile drop while 3d a mcaa voi results include some incorrectly identified vectors 2d m planes results on the same vois contained angles spanning above 75 which suggests the in situ scco2 brine mt simon sandstone had some pores that were i w inferring a heterogeneous θ distribution throughout the pore network similar ranges were found in the results for the five berea rois suggesting both in situ sandstones behaved similarly andrew et al 2014b found the scco2 brine ketton limestone θ mean and range classified as w w lv et al 2017 found a gas co2 brine quartz sand and scco2 brine quartz sand mean θ each classified as w w and θ ranges that spanned to i w and s w and tudek et al 2017 found the liquid co2 brine mt simon mean θ classified as i w while the range spanned to s w angles the findings in this study are most in agreement with the result of lv et al 2017 the main difference being that lv et al 2017 used unconsolidated quartz sand packs and consolidated sandstones were used in this work as previously mentioned when co2 is in a supercritical state it exhibits properties of both a liquid and a gas behaves as a gas lv et al 2017 found gas co2 resulted in a lower θ average and range than scco2 and tudek et al 2017 used liquid co2 which resulted in the highest average θ of all co2 based micro ct studies the higher θ average found in tudek et al 2017 could be a combined function of the consolidated sandstone system and the use of liquid co2 compared to lv et al 2017 who did not use consolidated rock however including θ results from this work which was also completed on a consolidated sandstone it appears scco2 θ fall somewhere between that of gas co2 and liquid co2 when exposed to a brine sandstone system temperature also influences θ al khdeeawi et al 2018 at the macroscopic level mt simon sessile drop experiments were completed at 51 c while micro ct experiments were completed at 47 c effects of temperature co2 phase need further evaluated as potential impacts on θ 5 conclusions in this study images from micro ct experiments were used for measuring θ on two different sandstone cores one berea and one mt simon sandstone sessile drop experiments were completed using only a mt simon sample seven methods to measure θ were evaluated with the purpose of this work being threefold 1 to compare current and new θ measuring methods using micro ct image stack rois cropped from a scco2 brine berea sandstone system 2 to determine how traditional experimental method sessile drop θ results compare to in situ θ results micro ct in a scco2 brine mt simon sandstone system and 3 determine if the matlab contact angle algorithm mcaa from klise et al 2016 can be used to measure θ in scco2 brine sandstone systems the results are as follows 1 both new manual θ measurement methods 2d m planes and 3d m syglass classified the berea core as water wet and were in good agreement with past measurement andrew et al 2014b methodology results this is used as justification for future work to be completed using these two methods 2 both sessile drop and micro ct average θ results classify the mt simon sandstone as water wet at the conditions tested but micro ct measurements result in broader θ distributions than sessile drop ranges the micro ct ranges suggest mixed wettability is present in the in situ sandstone formations sessile drop remains a useful experimental method for understand fluid behavior at equilibrium but does not capture in situ ranges 3 3d a mcaa θ distributions from both sessile drop and micro ct image stacks reveal some vectors were incorrectly identified as the supplementary angle when flipped vectors were located in the sessile drop images and excluded re averaged θ were consistent with additional θ measurement methods evaluated on the same segmented files additional criteria need to be further reviewed before using 3d a mcaa to analyze subsequent datasets of similar

735,numerous methods are used to measure contact angles θ in multiphase systems the wettability and θ are primary controls on co2 residual trapping during geologic carbon storage gcs and determining these values within rock pores is paramount to increasing storage efficiency one traditional experimental approach is the sessile drop method which involves θ measurements on a single image of droplets more recent developments utilize x ray micro computed tomography ct scans which provide the resolutions necessary to image in situ θ of fluids at representative conditions however experimental micro ct data is limited and varied to further examine θ distributions in supercritical co2 brine sandstone systems a combination of manual and automated θ measurement methods were utilized to measure θ using both sessile drop and micro ct images of two sandstone cores the purpose of this work was threefold 1 compare two current and two new θ measuring methods using micro ct images of scco2 brine sandstone systems 2 determine how traditional experimental method sessile drop θ results compare to in situ θ results micro ct and 3 determine if the matlab contact angle algorithm mcaa from klise et al 2016 can be used to measure θ scco2 brine sandstone systems one of the two new methods utilizing open source software resulted in comparable average θ and θ ranges to the primary manual measuring method andrew et al 2014b reported in literature that requires commercial software to complete an additional new method involves immersive interaction with micro ct image volumes that no other software currently provides both processes are found to be promising for future work θ measured using micro ct images at in situ conditions result in a broader θ distribution than those measured using sessile drop images these findings suggest some pores are intermediate wet in an in situ sandstone system and factors other than interfacial tension influence trapping lastly mcaa θ results consistently produced broader θ distributions and higher average θ than the manual θ measurements this is a result of some automated measurements incorrectly identifying directional quantities leading to skewed results mcaa is still promising for future work with careful attention to data interpretation keywords contact angle supercritical co2 matlab contact angle algorithm micro ct 1 introduction wetting phenomena was first recognized by galileo in 1612 galileo 1612 and equations to characterize contact angles θ were produced by young nearly 200 years later in 1805 young 1805 young found that the θ of a drop on an ideal surface is a function of the three interfacial tensions influencing the drop s mechanical equilibrium γ lg cos θ y γ sg γ sl where γlg γsg and γsl represent the liquid gas solid gas and solid liquid interfacial tensions and θy is young s contact angle the traditional definition for θ is the tangent of the drop profile at the three phase contact point where the liquid gas interface meets the solid liquid interface erbil 2014 wetting is defined as a fluid s tendency to adhere to a solid when another fluid is present and can be quantified by θ the angle indicates if wetting of a surface is favorable θ 90 or unfavorable θ 90 with respect to a solid yuan and lee 2013 geologic carbon storage gcs is one application where understanding properties of θ is important gcs involves the capture of excess carbon dioxide co2 from point sources and subsequent injection into geologic formations there are four primary mechanisms for co2 trapping structural capillary residual solubility and mineral trapping iglauer 2011 the wettability and θ are primary controls on co2 residual trapping sahimi 1993 and determining these values within rock pores is paramount to increasing storage efficiency traditionally θ have been measured on smooth flat surfaces using experimental methods such as the sessile drop using sessile drop images marmur 2006 highlighted the complexities present by showing the difference between the actual θ and the apparent θ as seen in fig 1 a the actual θ can only be identified when the details of a surface are captured in the imaging process this shows how different a θ measurement can be when the fluid solid plane tangent to the drop is able to be precisely determined however at the time of marmur s 2006 study the actual contact angle could not be identified because the surface topology was not captured in the imaging process additional studies using sessile drop were completed with conflicting results when certain testing parameters are changed e g temperature pressure brine salinity surface roughness etc farokhpoor et al 2013 saraji et al 2013 wang et al 2013 iglauer et al 2014 saraji et al 2014 al yaseri et al 2016 more recent sessile drop studies completed by botto et al 2017 and tudek et al 2017 used mt simon sandstone cores from different depths in a supercritical co2 scco2 brine and liquid co2 brine systems both used the imagej dropsnake plugin stalder et al 2006 to measure θ on sessile drop images fig 1b displays additional complexities in an enclosed geometry when measuring in situ θ using micro computed tomography ct scanning while measuring θ on flat surfaces remains complex obtaining accurate θ on non flat surfaces in three dimensional image volumes remains a more significant endeavor yet to be perfected from literature it is clear θ varies throughout a pore network and cannot be represented by a single θ measured on a flat surface yuan and lee 2013 klise et al 2016 pore geometry pore dimensions pore throat sizes and surface roughness all affect flow ketcham and carlson 2001 and likely influence θ but are not considered in traditional laboratory experiments or in young s equation the inherent intricacies of fluid distribution in natural porous media require continued research to expand a more robust database of in situ θ manual θ measurement methods using micro ct were developed and used by many previous studies tudek et al 2017 klise et al 2016 andrew et al 2014b lv et al 2016 lv et al 2017 iglauer et al 2015 singh et al 2016 m khishvand et al 2016b m khishvand et al 2016a however only andrew et al 2014b lv et al 2016 2017 and tudek et al 2017 are discussed further as each study used a co2 brine system the andrew et al 2014b methodology is the foundation from which additional micro ct θ measurements arose and is heavily cited throughout literature tudek et al 2017 klise et al 2016 andrew et al 2014b lv et al 2016 lv et al 2017 iglauer et al 2015 singh et al 2016 m khishvand et al 2016b m khishvand et al 2016a scanziani et al 2017 alratrout et al 2017 in this work the authors performed in situ θ measurements on micro ct images of a ketton limestone brine scco2 system at residual conditions the angle measurement method involved obtaining the contact line and resampling the data to a plane normal to the contact line from there a 3d angle tool was used by tracing vectors tangent to the solid surface and the scco2 brine interface lv et al also obtained the contact line in micro ct images first in an unconsolidated glass bead system lv et al 2016 and then in a comparison of scco2 brine quartz sand and scco2 glass bead systems lv et al 2017 contact points were randomly selected and labeled along the contact line image slices were manually rotated to find the normal plane perpendicular to the three phase interface and each angle was measured both by a computer and manually to ensure measurement accuracy most recently tudek et al 2017 performed a detailed θ study using mt simon sandstone micro ct images in a liquid co2 brine system θ were completed using the imagej angle tool schneider et al 2012 following six pre specified criteria manual θ measurements are cumbersome and may be prone to bias from one operator to the next scanziani et al 2017 hence the development of automated processes was pursued with the goal to measure numerous angles throughout large datasets klise et al 2016 scanziani et al 2017 alratrout et al 2017 lunati et al 2016 blunt 2017 s khorsandi et al 2017b peng and xiao 2017 a m alhammadi et al 2017b a m alhammadi et al 2017a s khorsandi et al 2017a jafari and jung 2017 the algorithm developed by klise et al 2016 calculates θ by finding the angle between planes fit to each solid fluid and fluid fluid interface in the region surrounding the contact point with all points defined in the wetting phase scanziani et al 2017 developed an algorithm to estimate the effective θ based on constraints from the natural curvature between two fluid phases θ was computed using two lines one obtained using the young laplace equation to capture the fluid fluid curvature and the second used a moving average to establish the solid fluid interface similarly alratrout et al 2017 developed a robust algorithm that involves the identification of each vertice edge and face throughout a segmented image stack followed by gaussian smoothing to eliminate noise artifacts while preserving rock structure additional smoothing is applied to the fluid fluid interface to obtain constant curvature two normal vectors are placed at each contact point and the dot product of these two vectors are used to measure θ at every contact point along the contact line both scanziani et al 2017 and alratrout et al 2017 completed manual measurements following andrew et al 2014b methodology on a single ganglion to verify their algorithms in these studies manual and automated results were in good agreement numerous differences are present among the studies outlined above including rock type testing conditions temperature and pressure image processing steps θ measurement method and number of θ measured some studies report an average θ while others report a distribution and or median value advancements have been made to characterize θ at reservoir conditions but measurement variations among methods have not been evaluated if discrepancies are present among methods they need to be better understood to know if results among studies are comparable simply from a measuring standpoint let alone all the additional differences listed in this study images from two micro ct experiments are used for measuring θ from both a berea and a mt simon sandstone core sessile drop images were obtained on a single mt simon sample and used compare experimental methods on the mt simon sandstone only seven methods to measure θ are evaluated 1 imagej dropsnake plugin stalder et al 2006 2 imagej angle tool schneider et al 2012 3 imagej angle tool schneider et al 2012 following six criteria from tudek et al 2017 4 a new method using the imagej angle tool schneider et al 2012 inspired from tudek et al 2017 5 pergeos angle tool fei 2016 using a resampling method from andrew et al 2014b 6 new 3d virtual reality software syglass angle tool pidhorskyi et al 2018 and 7 the automated matlab contact angle algorithm mcaa from klise et al 2016 the purpose of this work was not to determine a best contact angle measurement method but to evaluate and compare past methods to ensure they provide consistent results among studies already completed 2 experimental and methodology section the purpose of this work was threefold 1 to compare two current and two new θ measuring methods using micro ct images of a scco2 brine berea sandstone system 2 to determine how traditional experimental method sessile drop θ results compare to in situ θ results micro ct in a scco2 brine mt simon sandstone system and 3 determine if the matlab contact angle algorithm mcaa from klise et al 2016 can be used to measure θ in scco2 brine sandstone systems it should be noted that current θ methods are evaluated following the procedures described in prior publications as they were applied to past datasets many of these methods have tuning parameters however it is important to better understand how prior results compare among studies and to what extent different variables e g method resolution image processing etc may influence θ results 2 1 experimental method and image type the following section outlines the two experimental methods used in this work sessile drop and micro ct sessile drop method involves the capture of a single image in a viewing glass while micro ct images a volume image stack each apparatus and sandstone samples used are outlined below 2 1 1 sessile drop experiment a schematic of the custom sessile drop setup based on wang and clarens 2012 located at the university of texas austin is displayed in fig 2 the custom high temperature and pressure viewing cell is a 9 5 cm outer diameter stainless steel cylinder with a hollow interior 2 5 cm diameter set in an l shaped stainless steel stage a single mt simon rock sample from a depth of 2111 35 m 6927 ft was trimmed using a slow cut diamond saw to 2 5 cm 2 5 cm 0 95 cm dimensions no polishing or manipulation of the surface was completed the sample was set within a custom glass holder 3 8 cm long by 2 5 cm diameter the ends of the cylinder were secured with a teflon o ring a sapphire window and secured with a threaded screw brine was injected from the top port before the vessel was brought up to temperature 52 c with heating tape managed by a labview program a teledyne isco pump 100dm was used to inject co2 to bring the vessel up to constant pressure 21 99 mpa an avt ccd camera guppy f 038c nir with a 16 mm zoom lens fujinon was set up at one end of the cell facing the sapphire window to record time lapse images every 5 minutes over 3 hours 2 1 2 micro ct experiments a schematic of the u s department of energy national energy technology laboratory netl micro ct flow through setup is displayed in fig 3 a the setup is identical to tudek et al 2017 with the addition of a variable 12 v power supply to control temperature of a peltier plate to maintain elevated temperatures in the beryllium vessel three isco pumps and one reactor chamber are used in the core flooding apparatus gaseous co2 is connected to the delivery pump which is connected to the reactor chamber where brine is exposed to co2 stirred and allowed to equilibrate 24 hours allowing time for dissolution cores were placed in a confining sleeve with aluminum spacers at both ends to eliminate capillary end effects fig 3b once secured in the beryllium vessel it was placed in the zeiss versa xrm 400 ct scanner the core was saturated with brine to restore wettability system pressure was elevated to 12 4 mpa pore pressure and 14 5 mpa confining pressure and temperature was raised to achieve scco2 conditions 47 0 c after twenty four hours co2 saturated brine was flooded through the core followed by a drainage and imbibition cycle to reach residual conditions all flowrates ranged from 0 1 to 1 0 ml min at the testing temperatures and pressures correspond to a capillary number below 10 6 e g values typically seen in reservoirs lake 1989 niu et al 2014 which means flow was dominated by capillary forces for each experiment core details are listed in table 1 the mt simon core is from a depth of 2111 35 m 6927 ft and the berea core was cored a 50 8 mm by 152 4 mm core berea was used for the first flow through test with co2 at supercritical conditions using the netl micro ct flow through setup because berea is a standard sandstone for core flow testing scco2 is attained when carbon dioxide reaches or surpasses both its critical temperature 31 1 c and pressure 7 39 mpa at this point co2 exhibits intermediate behavior between states while possessing the properties of both a fluid and a gas e g possess liquid like density viscosities more like the gas state and will expand to fill void area like a gas the brine recipe used for the berea test was a potassium iodide ki brine with a 10 wt salinity to obtain sufficient contrast between brine and scco2 mt simon brine table a 1 designed to have comparable properties to the resident brine in the mt simon formation was used for the mt simon sample the mt simon core is shorter than the berea core because the mt simon rock was too friable to core using a core drill a handheld rotary tool with a diamond bit was used to sculpt the cores to the dimensions listed in table 1 scans were completed at using a 4x optic at 150 kv and 9 8 w equal to a current of 65 µa this is the highest voltage attainable with the ct scanner and was used to obtain images more quickly and reduce noise 2 2 contact angle measurement methods the following section outlines the seven θ measurement methods evaluated in this work each method is labeled as a two or three dimensional 2d or 3d measurement method as well as manual m or automated a these two identifiers are separated by a dash prior to each method name the analysis naming scheme herein is as follows 1 imagej dropsnake stalder et al 2006 2d m dropsnake 2 imagej angle tool schneider et al 2012 2d m angletool 3 tudek et al 2017 method completed using the imagej angle tool schneider et al 2012 2d m criteria 4 new method using three plane views and the imagej angle tool schneider et al 2012 2d m planes 5 andrew et al 2014b method using the pergeos angle tool fei 2016 3d m resampling 6 morehead et al pidhorskyi et al 2018 syglass 3d virtual reality software angle tool 3d m syglass 7 klise et al 2016 automated matlab contact angle algorithm mcaa 3d a mcaa 2 2 1 2d m dropsnake imagej dropsnake plugin is a general method that was developed specifically for measuring θ on sessile drops stalder et al 2006 this plugin requires a flat surface and single drop from which points along the 2d drop shape can either be user or automatically defined these points are then used to measure the angles on either side of the drop using a piecewise polynomial fit if there are multiple drops in an image this procedure must be completed for each drop in this work 2d m dropsnake is used to measure θ on original sessile drop images using manually defined points 2 2 2 2d m angletool imagej angle tool schneider et al 2012 measures angles according to three user defined points placed on a specified measurement plane each point snaps to a pixel corner according to manual placement made by the user in this study 2d m angletool is used to measure angles manually on segmented sessile drop images for a manual comparison to the 3d a mcaa process which also requires segmented images this measurement tool is also used in two additional methods but with additional requirements in completing θ measurements these are outlined below as 2d m criteria and 2d m planes 2 2 3 2d m criteria θ measurements completed using the imagej angle tool schneider et al 2012 following six criteria outlined in tudek et al 2017 were completed on original micro ct images the six criteria are as follows 1 a smooth and uniform matrix surface 2 the matrix surface must be perpendicular to the slice 3 the angle must be perpendicular to the matrix surface 4 measurements were taken equidistant from the leading and trailing edge of each bubble 5 the angle must be stable over tens of slices and 6 the interface must be clearly visible extending a minimum of 10 voxels and must not contain imaging artifacts that may influence image fidelity and the measurement 2 2 4 2d m planes a new method was inspired from tudek et al 2017 who found θ varied along a liquid co2 ganglion between 50 and 90 and concluded this variation may be loosely correlated to the localized pore constriction encompassing a trapped ganglion this change in pore geometry and visual observations of the micro ct image stacks used in this work led to the development of a more comprehensive manual method the first step in this method is applying an imagej non local means edge preserving filter buades et al 2005 buades et al 2008 to the data to remove unwanted noise the data is segmented to obtain the contact line from there the contact points are overlain on the filtered data and θ measurements were completed at each contact point along the xy plane from the first slice where the scco2 ganglion was present successively to the last identical steps were then completed along the resliced xz and yz planes completing this procedure in multiple planes and at every contact point provides a more comprehensive θ analysis as the angles are better quantified and the effects of pore geometry can be analyzed further 2 2 5 3d m resampling andrew et al s 2014b methodology is the most cited method in literature used on micro ct data one drawback is that commercial software is needed to complete the method and researchers without access to specific software cannot use this method notably the most novel aspect of andrew et al 2014b method is the resampling of the data to a plane using the contact line this method improves upon traditional processes as more precise planes and a 3d angle measuring tool are used to determine θ however it should be noted that while the pergeos angle tool is a 3d device these measurements are still completed on a 2d plane which restricts the measurement to a pre defined 2d surface in this study data was image processed and measured using pergeos software fei 2016 successor to avizo fire a 3d non local means filter was applied to the original data and a watershed algorithm was used to establish phases once phases were separated the contact line fig 4 a and b was obtained and used to measure angles from the surface line of the void following the methodology outlined in andrew et al 2014b 150 θ were measured on each filtered fig 4c and each segmented fig 4d dataset to see if the filtered and segmented results varied both data types were analyzed because segmented data is currently the data type required for automated processes if variation or inconsistencies are present between data types they need to be identified and analyzed further 2 2 6 3d m syglass istovisio inc is a startup company out of west virginia university that has recently developed a novel 3d immersive virtual reality visualization system called syglass pidhorskyi et al 2018 data is loaded into the software where the operator is free to move and rotate 360 to better visualize datasets while simultaneously having the capability to slice through any observable plane 3d objects can also be segmented manually in 3d creating an expedited process for data extraction a brand new feature utilizes similar coding to measure angles in 3d meaning contact angles can be measured using an initial defined plane with the second tangent plane having no restrictions to the data orientation the second plane used to measure angles can be moved freely in any direction from that point this process affords manual control and is a promising prospect for future work for more information on the process two supplementary videos s1 https youtu be nwwyckprjjs and s2 https youtu be 6 bbdjwbjnu showing 3d visualization and the angle measuring process can be viewed 2 2 7 3d a mcaa in klise et al 2016 mcaa was developed to measure θ using micro ct data from a glass and plastic bead kerosene brine system this was the first automated process used to analyze 3d volumes of interest vois alratrout et al 2017 a m alhammadi et al 2017b and not a single ganglion scanziani et al 2017 mcaa calculates θ by finding the angle between planes fit to each solid fluid and fluid fluid interface in the region surrounding the contact point with all points defined in the wetting phase θ is obtained by taking the dot product of the normal vectors to each interface the algorithm defines the direction of each normal vectors based on the location of the wetting phase if the direction is incorrectly identified in this automated process i e the vector is flipped the supplementary angle is reported the authors report that image resolution segmentation process and or different pore geometries need to be tested to further determine the precision and robustness of the algorithm for this study mcaa was run with the following parameters for both sessile drop and micro ct image stacks face connectivity 6 search radius 5 and minimum number of points 3 as listed in klise et al 2016 specific segmentation steps were required for each set of images and are outlined below 2 2 7 1 sessile drop image stack preparation to run mcaa on 2d sessile drop images data was segmented into three phases solid sandstone dense liquid phase brine and lower density phase scco2 segmented images were then made into image stacks of 20 with 5 blank images at each end to avoid end effects when running the algorithm 2 2 7 2 micro ct image stack preparation the micro ct files also required data segmented into three phases solid sandstone dense liquid phase brine and lower density phase scco2 but with additional segmentation steps for accurate 3d results segmentation steps using imagej were as follows 1 imagej non local means filter buades et al 2005 buades et al 2008 on raw data fig 5 a and b 2 threshold pores fig 5c and scco2 fig 5d from filtered data 3 use imagej plugin erode3d on pores and dilate3d on scco2 an equal number of iterations until phases are in contact while maintaining accurate pore structure and 4 combine scco2 and pores into a three phase image fig 5e and f other opensource segmentation software ilastik sommer et al 2011 yielded similar segmentation results and can be used for this step but this was deemed the most efficient segmentation method within imagej to obtain adequate contact between phases step 3 dilate3d and erode3d were each completed a single iteration and it is recommended no more than two iterations be completed on an roi to reduce data manipulation step 3 could impact the contact line and the contact angle to a similar degree applying a 3d watershed algorithm or seeded training algorithm could impact the contact line and angle the extent to which this could influence the results cannot be quantified but if the phases are not in contact after segmentation the results would be less accurate the dilate3d step is technically more controlled as a single line of voxels is being added along the phases whereas a watershed is growing across boundaries which is highly variable 2 3 methodology overview specific experimental and analysis details are shown in a flow chart in fig 6 and should be referenced throughout the paper to classify each core s wettability criteria more specific to a reservoir is used herein water wet w w 0 75 intermediate wet i w 75 105 or scco2 wet s w 105 180 iglauer et al 2015 the first analysis involved examining two current 2d m criteria and 3d m resampling on both filtered and segmented data and two new methods 2d m planes and 3d m syglass used to measure θ on micro ct image stacks of scco2 brine sandstone systems five scco2 ganglia regions of interest rois were carefully selected and cropped from the berea micro ct images and used for analysis analyses on pore geometry using the 2d m planes methods and differences in data type using the 3d m resampling method are completed as preliminary detailed analyses the mean range and θ distribution were used to determine how θ results compare among measurement methods and if 2d m planes and 3d m syglass are viable options for measuring θ using statistical analysis the second analysis was completed using both sessile drop and micro ct images from a mt simon core to determine how results from the two different experimental methods compare and to test if 3d a mcaa results in comparable θ to manual measurement methods ten sessile drop images containing multiple droplets imaged in the view cell were analyzed with three measurement methods 2d m dropsnake 2d m angletool and 3d a mcaa four micro ct scans from three locations top middle bottom along the mt simon core at residual conditions were scanned the top was scanned at 2 32 µm and the bottom was scanned at 1 66 µm the middle was scanned at two resolutions 1 66 µm and 2 32 µm to analyze the effects of resolution on 3d a mcaa θ distributions each scan was cropped to a single 640 µm3 voi top and bottom scans were run using 3d a mcaa for comparison to each middle scan and each middle scan θ was measured using one manual 2d m planes and one automated 3d a mcaa method one identical scco2 ganglia was cropped to an roi from each middle scan and only 3d a mcaa was used for a more detailed analysis 3 results 3 1 berea micro ct roi manual contact angle measurements detailed results from measuring θ using the 2d m planes method are displayed in fig 7 the mean θ is placed above one slice from the plane of measurement images are included to show the shape of each scco2 roi ganglion and the surrounding geometry present from one plane to the next θ was highest in the yz plane which was the direction of flow while both xy and xz planes resulted in lower average θ scco2 becomes trapped within the pore structure while resisting the forces during flowing conditions abrupt jumps in θ along a plane e g the end of roi 2 xy plane plot data represent angles measured as the ganglion reached a constriction tudek et al 2017 found θ to vary between 50 and 90 through a pore constriction here a broader θ range was observed within individual rois and throughout multiple plane views this further confirms pore geometry influences resultant local θ measurements additionally all 150 θ from each roi using the 3d m resampling on filtered and segmented data are plotted as frequency distributions in fig 8 a e each roi θ distribution reveals discrepancies between data types some distributions are bimodal with no set trend present among rois in three cases the mean θ was higher for the filtered data rois 2 4 and 5 one higher for the segmented data roi 3 and one approximately equal for filtered and segmented roi 1 however combining all 750 θ for both filtered and segmented data fig 8f resulted in similar ranges filtered 10 105 and segmented 5 110 means filtered 44 4 and segmented 43 5 and standard deviations filtered 14 3 and segmented 17 0 filtered and segmented data are in good agreement when looking at the overall averages but discrepancies are present between the different data types per individual roi this suggests segmented data angles may vary from filtered data angles but when numerous angle locations are included in the analysis the overall means and ranges should be in good agreement fig 8f since automated methods require segmented data this suggests automated results should be accurate but may not be precise table 2 contains individual and combined θ results for each measurement method completed on the five berea rois all mean θ results classify the berea core as a water wet system however ranges vary among methods 2d m criteria resulted in the highest average and narrowest range of the manual processes 2d m criteria methodology provides precise θ measurements but the rigid requirements inevitably restrict the angles being evaluated and likely does not capture the true range of angles present throughout a reservoir 2d m planes and both 3d m resampling means and ranges are similar while the syglass results are slightly lower while the 2d m planes method is not as precise as 3d m resampling measuring angles in multiple planes appears to capture the average θ and θ range well only 20 measurements were completed using the 3d m syglass which is in part leading to lower results the purpose of this analysis was to review four manual contact angle measurement methods θ distributions means and standard deviations for each method are plotted in fig 9 because each manual method is labor intensive with varying number of measurements recorded among methods extensive statistical analyses to determine statistical significance was not completed among methods 3 2 mt simon sessile drop and micro ct contact angle measurements 3 2 1 sessile drop 2d m dropsnake method results on sessile drop images of a scco2 brine setup using a mt simon sample was 32 8 both botto et al 2017 and tudek et al 2017 found similar θ averages of 35 and 30 on mt simon sandstones from different depths while 2d m dropsnake results are consistent with past results using the same method both 2d m angletool and 3d a mcaa measurements on the segmented sessile drop images resulted in higher average θ than the 2d m dropsnake method used on the original images table 3 potential reasons were analyzed further first 2d m dropsnake measurements are not confined to a specified pixel color nor are they confined to pixel geometry partial volume effects impact segmentation and while a pixel in a raw image can fall somewhere on a grayscale spectrum after segmentation a pixel is either scco2 brine or sandstone second 2d m dropsnake utilizes the entire bubble shape with angle measurement lines spanning the length of a sessile drop s edge whereas 2d m angletool measurements were purposely completed using only three to five pixel lengths to compare to 3d a mcaa segmentation combined with pixel restrictions in both the 2d m angletool and 3d a mcaa methods may contribute to the higher angle averages from the 3d a mcaa output x y and z slice number coordinates were obtained for each contact point and angle measured image stack 1 further review of the contact points showed points were only identified on the right side of each image and angles identified on the end slices slice 10 and 21 were supplementary angles to those identified in the middle slices slices 11 to 19 as seen in fig 10 this could be a result of the proximity of the contact point to the image edge since both angles identified furthest to the right in slice 10 and 21 were flipped to the supplementary angle however only one of the angles located farther left on slices 10 and 21 was flipped fig 10 these end angles were removed and re averaged and are included in table 3 when this step was taken the 2d m angletool and 3d a mcaa results are in better agreement furthermore the additional minor difference observed between 2d m angletool and 3d a mcaa average θ can be explained using fig 11 2d m angletool is designed to link to pixel corners when taking an angle measurement fig 11a when measured from the upper left corner the measured angle is 45 0 fig 11a measuring the same angle from the lower corner results in a lower θ equal to 33 7 fig 11b and measuring the same angle from the upper right corner results in an angle equal to 56 3 fig 11c the difference in the upper left corner compared to the lower left and upper right corner angles is 11 7 in both cases 3d a mcaa is designed to measure θ through the center of the pixels fig 11d and at the same contact point results in an angle equal to 39 5 in the 3d a mcaa the fluid fluid tangent line will change by half the pixel height when measured through the pixel center dividing 11 7 by 2 equates to 5 9 which when subtracted from 45 0 or added to 33 7 results in a contact angle between 39 1 and 39 6 which is equal to the 3d a mcaa result the 5 9 difference within a single θ measurement between the 2d m angletool and 3d a mcaa methods provides one explanation for the 1 6 difference in the mean θ 3 2 2 micro ct one hundred 2d m planes measurements were done in each plane to quantify θ in each middle scan imaged at different resolutions table 4 mean and median θ were in good agreement among scan resolutions with no substantial differences found among planes each sample mean qualified as w w systems with ranges spanning into i w angles 3d a mcaa was run on vois from four scans taken at different heights along the same core both the top and middle fig 12 a and bottom and middle fig 12b scans at the same resolutions resulted in nearly identical θ distributions with consistent mean and median values this suggests the location of a cubed voi throughout a core should result in θ representative of an entire core when using 3d a mcaa each 3d a mcaa median and average θ qualify as w w systems but unlike the 2d planes method the ranges show some angles qualified as s w while scans at the same resolutions have agreeable results the middle scan means are approximately 10 different between the 2 32 µm and 1 66 µm scans while the 2d m planes results were similar between resolutions thousands of angle measurements are an improvement over hundreds but θ distribution plots in fig 12 are bimodal with peaks appearing to be supplementary angles mt simon sessile drop 3d a mcaa results showed vectors were being flipped on the slices towards the end of the image stacks since only two angles are measured on a single drop flipped vectors could easily be identified and excluded however thousands of θ were measured in each voi making it cumbersome to locate incorrectly identified angles identical rois segmented from each middle voi are used to verify 3d a mcaa table 5 contains 2d m planes 3d m resampling and 3d a mcaa mean and median θ results for each roi the mean and median values are in better agreement than the voi mean and median values for each middle scan however there are still differences in the median values between resolutions review of the roi ranges shows minimum and maximum θ for each roi are approximately supplementary angles the 3d a mcaa 2d m planes and 3d m resampling roi θ distributions are plotted in fig 13 while some of the 3d a mcaa angles are clearly outliers the distributions among resolutions and among the 3d a mcaa 2d m planes and 3d m resampling methods are agreeable with the 3d a mcaa results shifted to slightly lower angle measurements excluding outliers and lower frequency overall tudek et al 2017 completed manual measurements on two different scan resolution images 0 68 µm and 1 7 µm and found resolution did not impact average θ 2d m planes resulted in consistent mean and median values between resolutions while some discrepancies were found within each 3d method 3d m resampling resulted in approximately 10 difference in both mean and median values between resolutions and 3d a mcaa resulted in a 6 difference in median values these slight discrepancies should be considered when comparing results using these methods 4 discussion completing manual measurements of contact angles provides insight into detailed observations that can be overlooked with an automated process andrew et al 2014b 3d m resampling methodology on both filtered and segmented data revealed similar averages and ranges when all θ measurements were combined but review of individual ganglia showed inconsistencies between data types moreover 3d a mcaa measurements are confined to both segmentation accuracy and pixel geometry while manual angle measurement methods utilizing tools such as dropsnake stalder et al 2006 and pergeos 3d angle tool fei 2016 are not these results combined with results showing resolution influenced 3d a mcaa θ distributions suggest automated processes using segmented data can provide accurate θ but care in data interpretation must be conducted the new 2d m planes method resulted in similar θ distributions and ranges to 3d m resampling andrew et a sl 2014b method these findings are used as evidence to use 2d m planes method when pergeos avizo fire is not available to a researcher completing similar work from detailed analyses on the 2d m planes results geometry was found to influence θ in the berea rois further supporting past findings from tudek et al 2017 suggesting pore geometry plays a role in situ residual trapping and resultant θ distribution throughout a sandstone pore network additionally 3d m syglass method was also consistent with other manual methods reviewed however the limited number of angles used for measurements needs to be further evaluated to determine a more precise comparison and should be pursued further in future work comparing mt simon mean θ classifications between experimental methods shows the mt simon sandstone is w w for both sessile drop and micro ct mean θ results but θ ranges in the in situ micro ct analyses was broader than sessile drop while 3d a mcaa voi results include some incorrectly identified vectors 2d m planes results on the same vois contained angles spanning above 75 which suggests the in situ scco2 brine mt simon sandstone had some pores that were i w inferring a heterogeneous θ distribution throughout the pore network similar ranges were found in the results for the five berea rois suggesting both in situ sandstones behaved similarly andrew et al 2014b found the scco2 brine ketton limestone θ mean and range classified as w w lv et al 2017 found a gas co2 brine quartz sand and scco2 brine quartz sand mean θ each classified as w w and θ ranges that spanned to i w and s w and tudek et al 2017 found the liquid co2 brine mt simon mean θ classified as i w while the range spanned to s w angles the findings in this study are most in agreement with the result of lv et al 2017 the main difference being that lv et al 2017 used unconsolidated quartz sand packs and consolidated sandstones were used in this work as previously mentioned when co2 is in a supercritical state it exhibits properties of both a liquid and a gas behaves as a gas lv et al 2017 found gas co2 resulted in a lower θ average and range than scco2 and tudek et al 2017 used liquid co2 which resulted in the highest average θ of all co2 based micro ct studies the higher θ average found in tudek et al 2017 could be a combined function of the consolidated sandstone system and the use of liquid co2 compared to lv et al 2017 who did not use consolidated rock however including θ results from this work which was also completed on a consolidated sandstone it appears scco2 θ fall somewhere between that of gas co2 and liquid co2 when exposed to a brine sandstone system temperature also influences θ al khdeeawi et al 2018 at the macroscopic level mt simon sessile drop experiments were completed at 51 c while micro ct experiments were completed at 47 c effects of temperature co2 phase need further evaluated as potential impacts on θ 5 conclusions in this study images from micro ct experiments were used for measuring θ on two different sandstone cores one berea and one mt simon sandstone sessile drop experiments were completed using only a mt simon sample seven methods to measure θ were evaluated with the purpose of this work being threefold 1 to compare current and new θ measuring methods using micro ct image stack rois cropped from a scco2 brine berea sandstone system 2 to determine how traditional experimental method sessile drop θ results compare to in situ θ results micro ct in a scco2 brine mt simon sandstone system and 3 determine if the matlab contact angle algorithm mcaa from klise et al 2016 can be used to measure θ in scco2 brine sandstone systems the results are as follows 1 both new manual θ measurement methods 2d m planes and 3d m syglass classified the berea core as water wet and were in good agreement with past measurement andrew et al 2014b methodology results this is used as justification for future work to be completed using these two methods 2 both sessile drop and micro ct average θ results classify the mt simon sandstone as water wet at the conditions tested but micro ct measurements result in broader θ distributions than sessile drop ranges the micro ct ranges suggest mixed wettability is present in the in situ sandstone formations sessile drop remains a useful experimental method for understand fluid behavior at equilibrium but does not capture in situ ranges 3 3d a mcaa θ distributions from both sessile drop and micro ct image stacks reveal some vectors were incorrectly identified as the supplementary angle when flipped vectors were located in the sessile drop images and excluded re averaged θ were consistent with additional θ measurement methods evaluated on the same segmented files additional criteria need to be further reviewed before using 3d a mcaa to analyze subsequent datasets of similar

736,two dimensional high resolution numerical solutions for the classical formulation and two widely accepted nonequilibrium models of multiphase flow through porous media are generated and compared with experimental observations from literature flow equations for simultaneous flow of two immiscible phases through porous media are written in a vorticity stream function form in the resulting system of equations the vorticity stream function equation is solved using a spectral method and the transport equation is discretized in space using a central upwind scheme the system of equations is solved for a two dimensional domain using a semi implicit time stepper the solutions reveal behavior that is not apparent in one dimensional solutions namely that sharpening of the saturation front caused by the inclusion of a dynamic capillary pressure results in propagation of viscous fingers compared to the classical formulation the inclusion of nonequilibrium effects in the constitutive relations in the form of effective saturation introduces dispersion and smears the otherwise highly resolved viscous fingers in the saturation front once developed the length of the mixing zone in the numerical solutions remains constant with time regardless of the degree of instability this is contrary to the evolution of the mixing zone observed in unstable flow experiments where unlike the numerical solutions the propagation speed of the leading edge of the front appears to increase with time keywords multiphase flow nonequilibrium models high resolution methods flow instability 1 introduction an accurate mathematical description of multiphase flow in porous media is essential in many practical applications such as environmental remediation of the vadose zone and mitigation of green house effects by geological storage of co2 in saline aquifers and depleted petroleum reservoirs juanes 2008 natural porous media consist of matrices of grains interspersed with many irregularly shaped and interconnected void spaces referred to as pores attempts to describe in an exact manner the geometry of the solid surfaces that bound the flow domain inside a porous medium are futile bear 2013 given the availability of information regarding the exact geometry of these surfaces i e boundary conditions in a porous medium it would be conceivable to treat multiphase flow at the pore level herein referred to as microscale using a fluid continuum approach i e the navier stokes equations pore morphology aside a great deal of additional information would be needed to attempt such a theoretical solution to the problem of multiphase flow e g properties and condition of interfaces and mass transfer across them bear 2013 nevertheless under the burden of many simplifying assumptions simplified approaches for pore level fluid flow simulation have been developed lenormand 1990 lenormand et al 1988 wilkinson 1986 wilkinson and willemsen 1983 witten jr and sander 1981 field scale simulation models must however deal with immensely disparate length scales from pores to the field bear 2012 to circumvent these difficulties computationally feasible field scale models rely on macroscale descriptions of flow through porous media which use macroscale variables such as saturation porosity and permeability mathematical descriptions of flow through porous media are formulated using conservation laws namely conservations of mass momentum and energy leveque 1992 darcy s law is a macroscale expression of the conservation of momentum for a single phase and is valid for low reynolds numbers very slow flow dullien 2012 hubbert 1956 whitaker 1986 in macroscale formulations of multiphase flow through porous media darcy s law is extended to multiple phases via the use of constitutive relations i e relative permeability and capillary pressure functions leverett 1941 muskat and meres 1936 wyckoff and botset 1936 moreover constitutive relations are known to depend not only on local saturation but also on a number of other parameters such as saturation history initial wetting phase saturation wettability interfacial tension pore geometry and viscosity of fluids avraam and payatakes 1995 honarpour 2018 tang and kovscek 2011 neglecting some of the influential parameters may contribute to their path dependent behavior nevertheless under controlled conditions constitutive relations may be reasonably expressed as sole functions of local saturation macroscale models are indispensable in simulating flow through porous media in large scale systems however they often suffer from lack of predictive capabilities due to flow instabilities riaz et al 2007 instabilities in flow dynamics arise due to heterogeneity in the media and nonlinearities in the flow equations furtado and pereira 2003 the instabilities due to nonlinearities are driven by unfavorable contrasts of viscosity and density between the resident and invading phases where the classical assumption of instantaneous equilibrium of the local state of flow in porous media may no longer be an adequate representation of the physics barenblatt et al 2003 results from linear stability analysis suggest the onset of flow instabilities often manifest in the form of fingers may be predicted by mobility ratio chorin 1983 hagoort 1974 riaz and tchelepi 2004 this work investigates simultaneous flow of two immiscible phases in fully saturated porous media with significant viscous forces such that darcy scale continuum models apply lenormand 1990 wilkinson and willemsen 1983 zhang et al 2011 a number of nonequilibrium models have been proposed to improve the predictive capability of the classical macroscale formulation examples of such models include the dynamic capillary pressure saturation relation proposed by hassanizadeh and gray 1993a b herein referred to as the h g model the nonequilibrium model proposed by barenblatt 1971 and barenblatt and gilman 1987 referred to as the bne model and the general nonequilibrium formulation developed by aryana and kovscek 2013 referred to as the a k model other examples of alternate constitutive models include dynamic capillary pressure relations that depend on specific interfacial areas joekar niasar et al 2010 niessner and hassanizadeh 2008 and the extension of capillary pressure to dynamic conditions by kalaydjian 1987 this work focuses on two widely accepted nonequilibrium models namely the h g and bne models along with the classical macroscale formulation for simultaneous flow of two immiscible phases in porous media based on volume averaging of microscopic flow equations and thermodynamic arguments the h g model defines a macroscopic dynamic capillary pressure whose value is calculated by subtracting the product of a phenomenological coefficient and the partial time derivative of local saturation from the static capillary pressure hassanizadeh et al 2002 barenblatt et al 1997 accounts for nonequilibrium effects in both capillary pressure and relative permeability functions by recognizing the rearrangement of flow networks for each phase that must take place to transition from one steady state to another the finite amount of time associated with this transition is referred to as redistribution time τ and effective saturation is a future actual saturation τ units of time in the future hassanizadeh et al 2002 incorporated the h g model in richards equation in one dimension 1d to simulate the process of water infiltration in soil results for unsaturated flow systems indicate that incorporation of the h g model tends to retard the front and the retardation of the infiltration front becomes more significant with larger values of the phenomenological coefficient juanes 2008 studied the impact of bne model for a two phase system numerically using one dimensional simulation results and extended the nonequilibrium formulation to three phase systems one dimensional simulation results for both two and three phase systems show that the inclusion of bne model smears the front ren et al 2017 used a bayesian model selection framework to compare the classical h g and bne models in comparison with two phase core scale experimental data aryana and kovscek 2012 despite the development of alternate constitutive relations competing models i e bne and h g models exhibit limited improvements in terms of predictive capability ren et al 2017 and lead to prohibitive computational costs and stability concerns in numerical simulation the numerical value of the parameter τ introduced in the bne and h g models is not often available a priori and therefore τ may often be used as a fitting parameter in practice all the aforementioned numerical experiments are in one dimension and do not directly examine the evolution of fingers and the mixing zone moreover these numerical experiments rely on low order numerical methods e g the use of first order single point upstream weighting for spatial discretization of the flux terms and the results might suffer from numerical diffusion in this work a high resolution two dimensional mathematical framework is proposed for the h g and bne models the governing system of equations include a vorticity stream function equation and a transport saturation equation a spectral numerical method canuto et al 2012 peyret 2013 is used to solve the vorticity stream function equation and a central upwind scheme kurganov et al 2001 kurganov and tadmor 2000 is used for the spatial discretization of convection flux in the transport equation numerical solutions to the h g and bne nonequilibrium models are obtained in two computational domains 1d and 2d simulation results are compared with core scale experimental observations by tang and kovscek 2011 the use of mobility ratio as the criterion for the onset of instabilities is investigated the impact of nonequilibrium effects as formulated in the aforementioned models on saturation profiles are studied in 1d and 2d saturation maps 2 mathematical model 2 1 problem set up and two phase flow equations numerical simulation is performed in two computational domains i a line segment with length l in one dimension 1d and ii a rectangle with width w and length l in two dimensions 2d as shown in fig 1 the invading fluid with a viscosity of μ 2 is injected into the porous medium at its left boundary x 0 with a constant velocity u which displaces the resident fluid with a viscosity of μ 1 a constant pressure condition is used at the outlet boundary x l in 2d no flux boundary condition u n 0 is imposed at the bottom and top boundaries y 0 and y w where n is the unit vector normal to the boundaries two phase flow in porous media is described by expressions of conservation of mass and momentum multiphase extension of darcy s law the formulation is simplified by assuming incompressible and isothermal conditions the medium is homogeneous with a constant permeability k and porosity ϕ the governing equations are given by 2 1 ϕ t s α u α q α 2 2 u α k k r α s α μ α p α where the subscript α denotes the wetting α w or the non wetting phase α n sα u α qα krα μα and pα represent saturation darcy velocity volumetric flow rate relative permeability viscosity and pressure of phase α the phases are assumed to fill the entire void volume of the porous medium s w s n 1 total velocity u is the summation of the two phase velocities u u w u n combining eq 2 2 with total velocity gives 2 3 u k λ t s w p n k λ w s w p c s w where λα sw is the mobility of phase α given by λ α s w k r α s w μ α λt sw is the total mobility given by λ t s w λ w s w λ n s w the variable pc sw represents capillary pressure that quantifies the pressure difference between non wetting and wetting phases by writing eq 2 1 for all present phases and summing all resulting equations we arrive at 2 4 u q where u is the total darcy velocity and q is the total volumetric flow rate q q w q n furthermore a relation between the wetting phase velocity u w and the total velocity u is established using eq 2 2 as 2 5 u w f w s w u k λ n s w f w s w p c s w where fw is the fractional flow function for the wetting phase which is given by f w s w λ w s w λ t s w substituting eq 2 5 into eq 2 1 for α w gives the transport equation as 2 6 ϕ t s w u f w s w k f w s w λ n s w p c s w q w eq 2 6 is defined as the convection diffusion equation where u f w s w is a nonlinear convection flux and k λ n s w f w s w p c s w is a dissipation flux eqs 2 3 2 4 and 2 6 form

dominate and overwhelm capillary forces in both numerical and physical experiments as such the velocity field plays a significant role in driving the mixing process of the two phase flow to obtain highly accurate velocity fields a spectral numerical method is used flow equations are written in a vorticity stream function form meiburg and homsy 1988 rogerson and meiburg 1993 tan and homsy 1988 tryggvason and aref 1983 thus avoiding the need to calculate phase pressure as a simulation variable for a sufficiently smooth g g 0 dividing the first equation in 2 7 by kλt and solving for pn gives 2 8 p n u k λ t f w p c taking the curl of this last equation yields 2 9 0 u k λ t 1 k λ t u f w p c from which it is established that 2 10 u k λ t 1 k λ t u k λ t f w p c vorticity is defined as ω u since the domain is two dimensional vorticity is given by ω ω k where k is the unit vector in the positive z direction the rest two terms in 2 10 is also given as the scalar component multiplied by k therefore eq 2 10 is treated as a scalar equation the magnitude of scalar ω is given by 2 11 ω x u y y u x where u x and u y are scalar components of u along x and y axes respectively the stream function ψ is defined such that josselin de jong 1960 2 12 u x y ψ and u y x ψ the stream function and vorticity are related by 2 13 2 ψ ω combining the definition of vorticity and eqs 2 10 and 2 13 gives 2 14 k 2 ψ k λ t 1 k λ t u k λ t f w p c in order to use high accuracy spectral method for the solution of eq 2 14 the total velocity field u is decomposed into two components 2 15 u u 0 u where u 0 is a constant base velocity constant injection velocity along the positive direction of x axis and u is a fluctuating velocity the stream function ψ is also decomposed given by 2 16 ψ ψ 0 ψ where ψ 0 and ψ correspond to u 0 and u respectively namely 2 17 u x 0 y ψ 0 and u y 0 x ψ 0 and 2 18 u x y ψ and u y x ψ solving eq 2 17 for ψ 0 gives 2 19 ψ 0 u x 0 y u y 0 x c where c is the integration constant and is independent of x and y in this study u y 0 0 substituting eqs 2 16 and 2 19 into eq 2 14 gives 2 20 k 2 ψ k λ t 1 k λ t u k λ t f w p c velocity components ux and uy are expressed as

of presentation a generic variable ξ has been used in the above system to represent the dependence of various constitutive relations on the saturation the immediate issue to address relates to in what manner pc is to be represented at this juncture the following discussion branches out into three different interpretation of pc namely 1 classical model referred to as the cla model 2 the hassanizadeh gray model hassanizadeh and gray 1993a 1993b referred to as the h g model and 3 the barenblatt model barenblatt 1971 barenblatt and gilman 1987 referred to as the bne model 2 3 classical model this is the usual approach whereby an equilibrium state has been reached for which the capillary pressure is static i e p c p c s w stat static capillary pressure is a macroscopic representation of the difference between phase pressures under equilibrium conditions hassanizadeh et al 2002 and is obtained experimentally from quasi static displacement processes juanes 2008 an inherent major assumption and likely accounting for its drawback is that this relation has already incorporated all accumulated effects of surface tension fluids interface wettability etc toward realizing the equilibrium with respect to system 2 22 this pc sw stat is utilized and ξ s w assume fw sw and pc are smoothly dependent on sw as a result f w s w f w s w s w p c s w p c s w s w and f w s w p c s w 0 2 4 the h g model a significant amount of experimental evidence suggests that the classical model may not be accurate which prompts the need to include dynamics of the flow the relationship between the dynamic capillary pressure and the static capillary pressure is given by hassanizadeh et al 2002 2 23 p c p c s w dyn p c s w stat τ h s w t s w where τ h s w is a phenomenological coefficient consistent with experimental observations by hassanizadeh et al 2002 in drainage processes t s w 0 and p c s w dyn p c s w stat and in imbibition processes t s w 0 and p c s w dyn p c s w stat this pc sw dyn is used in the system 2 22 along with setting ξ s w and assuming τ h s w to be constant 2 5 bne model the bne model incorporates nonequilibrium effects in relative permeability and capillary pressure functions instantaneous dynamic constitutive relations which include nonequilibrium effects are determined by evaluating static constitutive relations at some effective saturation juanes 2008 the relationship between effective saturation η w and actual saturation sw is given by η w s w τ b s w t s w where τ b s w is referred to as redistribution time compared with the classical model an

data and simulation input experimental data used in this study are extracted from work by tang and kovscek 2011 a series of core scale water flooding experiments are conducted in a water wet berea sandstone the absolute permeability of the core sample is 0 377e 12 m2 and the porosity is 0 20 x ray tomography is used to collect saturation distribution data during displacement experiments results from three pairs of immiscible fluids are used in this work see table 1 brine serves as the invading phase injection velocity of 4 051e 6 m s for all three experiments mixed oil blandol and drakeol serve as the resident fluid for experiments 1 2 and 3 respectively tang and kovscek 2011 the viscosity ratio in table 1 is defined as the ratio of the viscosity of the resident fluid to that of the invading fluid end point mobility ratio m e and total shock mobility ratio m s t are defined as berg and ott 2012 4 1 m e k r i s i max μ i k r r s i min μ r and 4 2 m s t k r i s i shock μ i k r r s i shock μ r k r i s i ahead μ i k r r s i ahead μ r where subscripts r and i denote resident and invading phases respectively s i max and s i min represent maximum and minimum invading phase saturation values respectively shown in fig 2 a s i shock and s i ahead represent invading phase saturation values at the shock and ahead of the front respectively s i shock is determined based on the fractional flow function buckley and leverett 1942 shown schematically in fig 2b mobility ratios m e and m s t are often used as indicators of the onset of flow instability beliveau 2009 berg and ott 2012 hagoort 1974 riaz and tchelepi 2004 yortsos and hickernell 1989 where mobility ratios larger than unity indicate an unstable displacement whereas mobility ratios less than one indicate stable processes m e values imply that experiment 2 and 3 are unstable whereas values of m s t suggest that only experiment 3 is unstable see table 1 experimental observations are plotted using dimensionless space and time given by 4 3 x d x l and t d t pv pv where l and pv are length and pore volume of the core respectively time t pv represents the cumulative volume of injected fluid at any given point in time for each case one dimensional saturation profiles at three different times are shown in fig 3 in the case of experiment 1 the saturation front appears to be stable for the remaining two cases 1d saturation profiles exhibit spreading fronts based on these observations end point mobility ratio m e appears to be an appropriate criterion for the onset of instabilities simulation parameters are presented in table 2 length applies to both one and two dimensional cases and width only applies to two dimensional cases the flow geometry of the 2d cases is presented in fig 1 relative permeability functions are based on steady state measurements conducted by tang and kovscek 2011 the core used in the experiment is similar to the one described in ren et al 2017 both are berea sandstone where the capillary pressure data obtained from steady state measurements are used for 1d cases a uniform distribution of the residual saturation of the invading phase is used as the initial condition the initial condition used for 2d simulation models is created by stacking a one dimensional solution of the buckley leverett equation buckley and leverett 1942 with the front position located at 0 1 l along y axis followed by random perturbations of the one dimensional solution riaz and tchelepi 2006 ruith and meiburg 2000 mesh size is chosen based on the result of linear stability analysis chuoke et al 1959 hagoort 1974 saffman and taylor 1988 the critical wavelength λ c is calculated using feder 2013 4 4 λ c 2 π σ μ 2 k 2 μ 1 k 1 u u c 1 2 σ is interfacial tension between two phases k 1 k 2 k which is the absolute permeability of the medium μ 2 and μ 1 are viscosities of resident and invading phases respectively u is flow velocity and uc is the critical velocity for horizontal configuration u c 0 feder 2013 the size of the grid is set below the critical wave length to resolve small scale fingers berg and ott 2012 the fluid system in experiment 3 has the smallest λ c and the corresponding mesh is used for all the three cases a mesh size given by 256 128 is used for 2d cases 5 results and discussion even though flow in core scale experiments is three dimensional the boundary conditions consisting of no flow lateral boundaries and uniform flow conditions across inlet and outlet faces a priori determine the flow pattern there is a predominant flow direction along the main axis of the cores in a perfectly homogeneous medium flow would be essentially one dimensional however small scale heterogeneities in the core introduce fluctuations in experiments which lead to the formation of fingers and smeared equivalent one dimensional saturation profiles those fluctuations are modeled as small perturbations in the initial conditions of the two dimensional simulation cases the inclusion of the second dimension in numerical experiments enables investigation of the dynamics of the mixing zone the aforementioned experimental boundary conditions preclude geometrical effects therefore the inclusion of the third dimension in numerical simulation is not expected to result in significant additional insights as such even though flow in core scale experiment is three dimensional it can be adequately simulated in two dimensions the mesh in all numerical experiments is adequately fine such that all relevant macroscopic physical scales are resolved including the diffusive effects and as a result the simulation cases are convergent 5 1 the classical model numerical solutions to the system in 1d are presented by dashed curves in fig 4 unlike experimental observations 1d numerical results exhibit compact fronts whose shapes do not change as they propagate in space with time results from cla in 2d are used to examine the use of mobility ratio criteria as indicators of instability three saturation maps from each of the three experiments considered in this work are shown in fig 5 it is observed that for cases a and b in fig 5 fluctuations along the interface between the two phases decay as displacement progresses the mixing zone becomes a thin band perpendicular to the injection direction a stable displacement process for case c fluctuations grow and develop into prominent fingers the amplitude of the fingers increases with time an unstable displacement process recalling the values of two mobility ratios presented in table 1 total shock mobility ratio m s t appears to be the appropriate indicator for the onset of flow instabilities for the simulation results this is in contrast to the experimental data in 1d where saturation profiles for both experiments 2 and 3 appear to exhibit unstable behavior and the end point mobility ratio seems to be a more appropriate indicator numerical solutions from 2d cases are presented in fig 4 where saturation profiles are averaged in the direction transverse to the mean flow it is observed that for stable cases figs 4a and b profiles obtained from cla in 1d and 2d are nearly identical in fig 4c 1d saturation profiles obtained from cla in 2d show a spreading front due to the appearance of viscous fingering in 2d nevertheless the numerical results appear to not capture the dispersion the mixing zone observed in experiments a grid convergence test is performed for the case of unstable flow experiment 3 two types of numerical schemes are used to discretize the convection flux 1 the second order central upwind scheme kurganov et al 2001 referred to as the second order scheme and 2 the first order upwind scheme patankar 1980 referred to as the first order scheme fig 6 shows the saturation maps obtained via the second order scheme using a coarse mesh and a fine mesh once the mesh is adequately fine see fig 6b the diffusion effects are resolved and the details of the displacement front are revealed additionally saturation maps on different levels of mesh refinement are compared to the reference solution on a fine grid see fig 7 it is observed that the l 2 norm error decreases monotonically as the mesh size becomes smaller for both schemes as expected the second order scheme outperforms the first order scheme given the same mesh size the impact of the initial perturbed front initial condition on the numerical solution is investigated using the unstable fluid system experiment 3 as shown in fig 8 differing initial perturbations result in two dimensional solutions whose details of the two dimensional fronts are also different as shown in fig 9 statistically and reproducible relevant properties of the solutions namely the length of the mixing zone and the position of the leading edge of the front in one dimensional saturation profiles are consistent across solutions resulting from different initial perturbations 5 2 impacts of nonequilibrium effects on saturation profiles in 1d two values of τ h 1 0e6 pa s and 2 0e6 pa s are used for each of the three cases these values are within the range reported by hassanizadeh et al 2002 the simulation results of the h g model are compared with those obtained using the cla model see fig 10 it is observed that the shape of the fronts obtained using the h g model are retarded compared to those from cla for all the cases an increase in the value of τ h appears to result in additional sharpening of the fronts as indicated by arrows in fig 10 those observations are consistent with findings reported by hassanizadeh et al 2002 the impact of the inclusion of nonequilibrium effects using the bne effective saturation in capillary pressure function and relative permeability functions are investigated separately i capillary pressure function only bne p c and ii in relative permeability functions only bne vis τ b is assumed to be constant at 20 0 s for all three experimental cases results are presented in fig 11 compared with solutions from cla saturation profiles from bne p c exhibit a sharpening behavior on the other hand fronts from bne vis appear to be more dispersed incorporation of nonequilibrium effects in capillary pressure function only via either h g or bne p c retards the saturation front and incorporation of nonequilibrium effects in relative permeability functions via bne vis introduces dispersion in the saturation front since experimental data are more dispersed than results from cla bne model is used to match the observations in 1d redistribution time is treated as a fitting parameter and its value is adjusted in 1d simulation to improve the match see fig 12 τ b values of 180 0 s 240 0 s and 150 0 s are used to produce the matches for experiments 1 2 and 3 respectively unlike experiments 2 and 3 the quality of the agreement between numerical results and experimental data for the fluid system given by experiment 1 is relatively constant across the entire experimental time scale see fig 12 fronts in numerical simulations once developed propagate in space unchanged whereas experimental fronts evolve with time throughout the experimental domain core given an infinitely long experimental domain the length of the mixing zone might stabilize at some point and propagate unchanged thereafter nevertheless the numerical solution from the bne model do not appear to capture the evolving nature of instabilities observed in experiments fig 13 compares the leading edge of the spreading fronts defined as the position where saturation of the invading phase drops to its residual saturation from experimental data and numerical solution of bne and cla in 1d as indicated by the slope of the corresponding curves in fig 13 the leading edge appears to propagate with a relatively constant speed in bne cla and the stable displacement experiment 1 this is contrast to the leading edge in experiments 2 and 3 whose propagation speed appears to be non constant this observation is in agreement with the use of end point mobility ratio m e as the criterion for the onset of instabilities 5 3 impacts of nonequilibrium effects on saturation maps in 2d two dimensional numerical solutions to cla bne and h g for experiments 2 and 3 are presented in fig 14 the values of τ b used for bne in 2d are the same as those used for bne in 1d saturation maps from cla show that case a has a stable displacement front whereas case b exhibits a fingering behavior the bne model introduces dispersion in the saturation front which results in smearing and lengthening of the mixing zone for both cases in fig 14 the fingers that appear in cla are no longer visible in solutions to the bne model as shown in fig 15 there is no appreciable difference between bne in 1d and the 1d saturation profiles obtained from averaging saturation maps from bne in 2d in the transverse direction to the mean flow direction h g saturation maps shown in fig 14 are obtained using a value of 1 0e6 pa s for τ h as shown in fig 14 the sharpening effect of the h g model causes perturbations in 2d saturation maps to become more prominent for 2d cases where fingers are present the sharpening effect of the h g model appears to lengthen the mixing zone this phenomenon appears as a dispersive effect in the equivalent 1d saturation profile averaged in the transverse direction to mean flow on the other hand in 2d cases where fingers are not present the sharpening effect of the h g model translates into a sharpening of the equivalent 1d profile these effects are shown in fig 16 comparisons between positions of the leading edge of the saturation fronts from 2d simulations and experiments are presented in fig 17 similar to the 1d case fig 13 the leading edge in numerical solutions appears to propagate with a relatively constant speed whereas the leading edges in experiments 2 and 3 appear to propagate with a non constant speed the lack of agreement between nonequilibrium models and physical observations is in part due to the non evolving nature of the coefficients τ h and τ b 5 4 sensitivity analysis of h g model for the cases of cla and h g at times t d2 and t d3 in fig 14 the length of the mixing zone is indicated by bidirectional arrows that point to the leftmost trough and rightmost crest associated with the fingers the arrows are longer for the h g model compared to cla at t d2 and t d3 this is attributed to the aforementioned sharpening effect of the h g model in 2d the extent of this sharpening effect as a function of the magnitude of τh is investigated using three values 5 0e5 pa s 1 0e6 pa s and 2 0e6 pa s the resulting saturation profiles using parameters from experiments 2 and 3 and h g model in 2d along with experimental observations and a reference profile τ h 0 are shown in fig 18 for the first case experiment 2 the sharpening of the saturation profile becomes more pronounced as the value of τ h increases for the second case where fingers are present experiment 3 the increased sharpening of the saturation map in 2d due to a larger value of τh results in a an increase in the length of the mixing zone which appears as a dispersive effect in the equivalent 1d profile in fig 18 larger range of τh is then tested and the results are presented in fig 19 the advancement of the leading edge is insignificant with increases of τh this phenomenon is examined in 2d saturation maps from h g 2d see fig 20 initial increases of τh smaller values of τh lengthens the mixing zone equally in both the positive and negative directions along the x axis as shown in fig 21 after a certain value of τh additional increases of the coefficient only lengthen the mixing zone in the direction opposite to the mean flow direction while further sharpening the fingers 6 conclusions this paper presents a recently developed high resolution two dimensional numerical simulator that incorporates h g and bne nonequilibrium models flow equations are cast in a vorticity stream function form which is then solved using a spectral method the convection flux in the transport equation is computed using a high order tvd central upwind scheme the coupled vorticity stream function equation and transport equation in 2d are solved using a semi implicit time stepping scheme numerical results for a homogeneous porous medium are compared with core scale displacement experiments from literature the criterion of the onset of instabilities is investigated and juxtaposed using experimental and numerical results end point mobility ratio appears to be an appropriate indicator of the onset of instabilities based on the experimental observations whereas the onset of instabilities in numerical results are more aptly captured by the total shock mobility ratio numerical results indicate that implementation of the h g model in 1d tends to retard the saturation front whereas 2d simulation reveals the sharpening qualities of h g in the presence of fingers this sharpening may lead to an increase of the length of the mixing zone which may appear as a dispersive effect in the equivalent 1d profile averaged in the transverse direction to mean flow increases in the length of the mixing zone appears to occur in equal amounts in the mean flow direction and opposite to it for small values of τ h additional increases in τ h appear to lengthen the mixing zone only in the direction opposite to the mean flow results from the bne model demonstrate its dispersive effect on the saturation profile in both 1d and 2d domains this results in an elongated transition zone where fingers that are resolved using the classical formulation are now smeared even though both h g and bne models may increase the length of the mixing zone they seem to not capture the observed flow behavior for unstable cases adequately numerical results from bne and h g models show that leading edges propagate at relatively constant speeds whereas experimental observations of unstable displacement processes show profiles whose leading edges propagate with non constant

736,two dimensional high resolution numerical solutions for the classical formulation and two widely accepted nonequilibrium models of multiphase flow through porous media are generated and compared with experimental observations from literature flow equations for simultaneous flow of two immiscible phases through porous media are written in a vorticity stream function form in the resulting system of equations the vorticity stream function equation is solved using a spectral method and the transport equation is discretized in space using a central upwind scheme the system of equations is solved for a two dimensional domain using a semi implicit time stepper the solutions reveal behavior that is not apparent in one dimensional solutions namely that sharpening of the saturation front caused by the inclusion of a dynamic capillary pressure results in propagation of viscous fingers compared to the classical formulation the inclusion of nonequilibrium effects in the constitutive relations in the form of effective saturation introduces dispersion and smears the otherwise highly resolved viscous fingers in the saturation front once developed the length of the mixing zone in the numerical solutions remains constant with time regardless of the degree of instability this is contrary to the evolution of the mixing zone observed in unstable flow experiments where unlike the numerical solutions the propagation speed of the leading edge of the front appears to increase with time keywords multiphase flow nonequilibrium models high resolution methods flow instability 1 introduction an accurate mathematical description of multiphase flow in porous media is essential in many practical applications such as environmental remediation of the vadose zone and mitigation of green house effects by geological storage of co2 in saline aquifers and depleted petroleum reservoirs juanes 2008 natural porous media consist of matrices of grains interspersed with many irregularly shaped and interconnected void spaces referred to as pores attempts to describe in an exact manner the geometry of the solid surfaces that bound the flow domain inside a porous medium are futile bear 2013 given the availability of information regarding the exact geometry of these surfaces i e boundary conditions in a porous medium it would be conceivable to treat multiphase flow at the pore level herein referred to as microscale using a fluid continuum approach i e the navier stokes equations pore morphology aside a great deal of additional information would be needed to attempt such a theoretical solution to the problem of multiphase flow e g properties and condition of interfaces and mass transfer across them bear 2013 nevertheless under the burden of many simplifying assumptions simplified approaches for pore level fluid flow simulation have been developed lenormand 1990 lenormand et al 1988 wilkinson 1986 wilkinson and willemsen 1983 witten jr and sander 1981 field scale simulation models must however deal with immensely disparate length scales from pores to the field bear 2012 to circumvent these difficulties computationally feasible field scale models rely on macroscale descriptions of flow through porous media which use macroscale variables such as saturation porosity and permeability mathematical descriptions of flow through porous media are formulated using conservation laws namely conservations of mass momentum and energy leveque 1992 darcy s law is a macroscale expression of the conservation of momentum for a single phase and is valid for low reynolds numbers very slow flow dullien 2012 hubbert 1956 whitaker 1986 in macroscale formulations of multiphase flow through porous media darcy s law is extended to multiple phases via the use of constitutive relations i e relative permeability and capillary pressure functions leverett 1941 muskat and meres 1936 wyckoff and botset 1936 moreover constitutive relations are known to depend not only on local saturation but also on a number of other parameters such as saturation history initial wetting phase saturation wettability interfacial tension pore geometry and viscosity of fluids avraam and payatakes 1995 honarpour 2018 tang and kovscek 2011 neglecting some of the influential parameters may contribute to their path dependent behavior nevertheless under controlled conditions constitutive relations may be reasonably expressed as sole functions of local saturation macroscale models are indispensable in simulating flow through porous media in large scale systems however they often suffer from lack of predictive capabilities due to flow instabilities riaz et al 2007 instabilities in flow dynamics arise due to heterogeneity in the media and nonlinearities in the flow equations furtado and pereira 2003 the instabilities due to nonlinearities are driven by unfavorable contrasts of viscosity and density between the resident and invading phases where the classical assumption of instantaneous equilibrium of the local state of flow in porous media may no longer be an adequate representation of the physics barenblatt et al 2003 results from linear stability analysis suggest the onset of flow instabilities often manifest in the form of fingers may be predicted by mobility ratio chorin 1983 hagoort 1974 riaz and tchelepi 2004 this work investigates simultaneous flow of two immiscible phases in fully saturated porous media with significant viscous forces such that darcy scale continuum models apply lenormand 1990 wilkinson and willemsen 1983 zhang et al 2011 a number of nonequilibrium models have been proposed to improve the predictive capability of the classical macroscale formulation examples of such models include the dynamic capillary pressure saturation relation proposed by hassanizadeh and gray 1993a b herein referred to as the h g model the nonequilibrium model proposed by barenblatt 1971 and barenblatt and gilman 1987 referred to as the bne model and the general nonequilibrium formulation developed by aryana and kovscek 2013 referred to as the a k model other examples of alternate constitutive models include dynamic capillary pressure relations that depend on specific interfacial areas joekar niasar et al 2010 niessner and hassanizadeh 2008 and the extension of capillary pressure to dynamic conditions by kalaydjian 1987 this work focuses on two widely accepted nonequilibrium models namely the h g and bne models along with the classical macroscale formulation for simultaneous flow of two immiscible phases in porous media based on volume averaging of microscopic flow equations and thermodynamic arguments the h g model defines a macroscopic dynamic capillary pressure whose value is calculated by subtracting the product of a phenomenological coefficient and the partial time derivative of local saturation from the static capillary pressure hassanizadeh et al 2002 barenblatt et al 1997 accounts for nonequilibrium effects in both capillary pressure and relative permeability functions by recognizing the rearrangement of flow networks for each phase that must take place to transition from one steady state to another the finite amount of time associated with this transition is referred to as redistribution time τ and effective saturation is a future actual saturation τ units of time in the future hassanizadeh et al 2002 incorporated the h g model in richards equation in one dimension 1d to simulate the process of water infiltration in soil results for unsaturated flow systems indicate that incorporation of the h g model tends to retard the front and the retardation of the infiltration front becomes more significant with larger values of the phenomenological coefficient juanes 2008 studied the impact of bne model for a two phase system numerically using one dimensional simulation results and extended the nonequilibrium formulation to three phase systems one dimensional simulation results for both two and three phase systems show that the inclusion of bne model smears the front ren et al 2017 used a bayesian model selection framework to compare the classical h g and bne models in comparison with two phase core scale experimental data aryana and kovscek 2012 despite the development of alternate constitutive relations competing models i e bne and h g models exhibit limited improvements in terms of predictive capability ren et al 2017 and lead to prohibitive computational costs and stability concerns in numerical simulation the numerical value of the parameter τ introduced in the bne and h g models is not often available a priori and therefore τ may often be used as a fitting parameter in practice all the aforementioned numerical experiments are in one dimension and do not directly examine the evolution of fingers and the mixing zone moreover these numerical experiments rely on low order numerical methods e g the use of first order single point upstream weighting for spatial discretization of the flux terms and the results might suffer from numerical diffusion in this work a high resolution two dimensional mathematical framework is proposed for the h g and bne models the governing system of equations include a vorticity stream function equation and a transport saturation equation a spectral numerical method canuto et al 2012 peyret 2013 is used to solve the vorticity stream function equation and a central upwind scheme kurganov et al 2001 kurganov and tadmor 2000 is used for the spatial discretization of convection flux in the transport equation numerical solutions to the h g and bne nonequilibrium models are obtained in two computational domains 1d and 2d simulation results are compared with core scale experimental observations by tang and kovscek 2011 the use of mobility ratio as the criterion for the onset of instabilities is investigated the impact of nonequilibrium effects as formulated in the aforementioned models on saturation profiles are studied in 1d and 2d saturation maps 2 mathematical model 2 1 problem set up and two phase flow equations numerical simulation is performed in two computational domains i a line segment with length l in one dimension 1d and ii a rectangle with width w and length l in two dimensions 2d as shown in fig 1 the invading fluid with a viscosity of μ 2 is injected into the porous medium at its left boundary x 0 with a constant velocity u which displaces the resident fluid with a viscosity of μ 1 a constant pressure condition is used at the outlet boundary x l in 2d no flux boundary condition u n 0 is imposed at the bottom and top boundaries y 0 and y w where n is the unit vector normal to the boundaries two phase flow in porous media is described by expressions of conservation of mass and momentum multiphase extension of darcy s law the formulation is simplified by assuming incompressible and isothermal conditions the medium is homogeneous with a

dominate and overwhelm capillary forces in both numerical and physical experiments as such the velocity field plays a significant role in driving the mixing process of the two phase flow to obtain highly accurate velocity fields a spectral numerical method is used flow equations are written in a vorticity stream function form meiburg and homsy 1988 rogerson and meiburg 1993 tan and homsy 1988 tryggvason and aref 1983 thus avoiding the need to calculate phase pressure as a simulation variable for a sufficiently smooth g g 0 dividing the first equation in 2 7 by kλt and solving for pn gives 2 8 p n u k λ t f w p c taking the curl of this last equation yields 2 9 0 u k λ t 1 k λ t u f w p c from which it is established that 2 10 u k λ t 1 k λ t u k λ t f w p c vorticity is defined as ω u since the domain is two dimensional vorticity is given by ω ω k where k is the unit vector in the positive z direction the rest two terms in 2 10 is also given as the scalar component multiplied by k therefore eq 2 10 is treated as a scalar equation the magnitude of scalar ω is given by 2 11 ω x u y y u x where u x and u y are scalar components of u along x and y axes respectively the stream function ψ is defined such that josselin de jong 1960 2 12 u x y ψ and u y x ψ the stream function and vorticity are related by 2 13 2 ψ ω combining the definition of vorticity and eqs 2 10 and 2 13 gives 2 14 k 2 ψ k λ t 1 k λ t u k λ t f w p c in order to use high accuracy spectral method for the solution of eq 2 14 the total velocity field u is decomposed into two components 2 15 u u 0 u where u 0 is a constant base velocity constant injection velocity along the positive direction of x axis and u is a fluctuating velocity the stream function ψ is also decomposed given by 2 16 ψ ψ 0 ψ where ψ 0 and ψ correspond to u 0 and u respectively namely 2 17 u x 0 y ψ 0 and u y 0 x ψ 0 and 2 18 u x y ψ and u y x ψ solving eq 2 17 for ψ 0 gives 2 19 ψ 0 u x 0 y u y 0 x c where c is the integration

of presentation a generic variable ξ has been used in the above system to represent the dependence of various constitutive relations on the saturation the immediate issue to address relates to in what manner pc is to be represented at this juncture the following discussion branches out into three different interpretation of pc namely 1 classical model referred to as the cla model 2 the hassanizadeh gray model hassanizadeh and gray 1993a 1993b referred to as the h g model and 3 the barenblatt model barenblatt 1971 barenblatt and gilman 1987 referred to as the bne model 2 3 classical model this is the usual approach whereby an equilibrium state has been reached for which the capillary pressure is static i e p c p c s w stat static capillary pressure is a macroscopic representation of the difference between phase pressures under equilibrium conditions hassanizadeh et al 2002 and is obtained experimentally from quasi static displacement processes juanes 2008 an inherent major assumption and likely accounting for its drawback is that this relation has already incorporated all accumulated effects of surface tension fluids interface wettability etc toward realizing the equilibrium with

model a significant amount of experimental evidence suggests that the classical model may not be accurate which prompts the need to include dynamics of the flow the relationship between the dynamic capillary pressure and the static capillary pressure is given by hassanizadeh et al 2002 2 23 p c p c s w dyn p c s w stat τ h s w t s w where τ h s w is a phenomenological coefficient consistent with experimental observations by hassanizadeh et al 2002 in drainage processes t s w 0 and p c s w dyn p c s w stat and in imbibition processes t s w 0 and p c s w dyn p c s w stat this pc sw dyn is used in the system 2 22 along with setting ξ s w and assuming τ h s w to be constant 2 5 bne model the bne model incorporates nonequilibrium effects in relative permeability and capillary pressure functions instantaneous dynamic constitutive relations which include nonequilibrium effects are determined by evaluating static constitutive relations at some effective saturation juanes 2008 the relationship between effective saturation η w and actual saturation sw is given by η w s w τ b s w t s w where τ b s w is referred to as redistribution time compared with the classical model an additional primary variable ηw is introduced in the system accounting for the nonequilibrium effects assuming τ b s w to be constant torsu and aryana 2016 the system 2 22 uses p c p c η w stat along with ξ η w following the smoothness assumption in subsect 2 3 f w η w p c η w 0 3 numerical scheme in the following subsection numerical schemes in 2d are discussed in detail the main structure of the governing equations for the three capillary pressure models is depicted in system 2 22 it is then adequate to carry out derivation of the scheme for this system to set periodic boundary conditions values of the first order spatial derivative terms 1 k λ t fw and pc are assumed to be zero on all boundaries riaz and tchelepi 2006 to calculate velocity components ux and uy a fourier transform kutz 2013 is used resulting in 3 1 f ψ f k λ t 1 k λ t u f w p c k k x 2 k y 2 where f denotes fourier transform operator and kx and ky are wave numbers in the x and y direction respectively the first order spatial derivatives of f ψ are given by kutz 2013 3 2 f x ψ i k x f ψ and f y ψ i k y f ψ where i is unit imaginary number the spatial derivative of the fluctuating component of stream function i e x ψ and y ψ are computed by performing inverse transform on both sides of eq 3 2 the numerical scheme for the transport equation in 2 22 is obtained from integration of that equation over cell v

data and simulation input experimental data used in this study are extracted from work by tang and kovscek 2011 a series of core scale water flooding experiments are conducted in a water wet berea sandstone the absolute permeability of the core sample is 0 377e 12 m2 and the porosity is 0 20 x ray tomography is used to collect saturation distribution data during displacement experiments results from three pairs of immiscible fluids are used in this work see table 1 brine serves as the invading phase injection velocity of 4 051e 6 m s for all three experiments mixed oil blandol and drakeol serve as the resident fluid for experiments 1 2 and 3 respectively tang and kovscek 2011 the viscosity ratio in table 1 is defined as the ratio of the viscosity of the resident fluid to that of the invading fluid end point mobility ratio m e and total shock mobility ratio m s t are defined as berg and ott 2012 4 1 m e k r i s i max μ i k r r s i min μ r and 4 2 m s t k r i s i shock μ i k r r s i shock μ r k r i s i ahead μ i k r r s i ahead μ r where subscripts r and i denote resident and invading phases respectively s i max and s i min represent maximum and minimum invading phase saturation values respectively shown in fig 2 a s i shock and s i ahead represent invading phase saturation values at the shock and ahead of the front respectively s i shock is determined based on the fractional flow function buckley and leverett 1942 shown schematically in fig 2b mobility ratios m e and m s t are often used as indicators of the onset of flow instability beliveau 2009 berg and ott 2012 hagoort 1974 riaz and tchelepi 2004 yortsos and hickernell 1989 where mobility ratios larger than unity indicate an unstable displacement whereas mobility ratios less than one indicate stable processes m e values imply that experiment 2 and 3 are unstable whereas values of m s t suggest that only experiment 3 is unstable see table 1 experimental observations are plotted using dimensionless space and time given by 4 3 x d x l and t d t pv pv where l and pv are length and pore volume of the core respectively time t pv represents the cumulative volume of injected fluid at any given point in time for each case one dimensional saturation profiles at three different times are shown in fig 3 in the case of experiment 1 the saturation front appears to be stable for the remaining two cases 1d saturation profiles exhibit spreading fronts based on these observations end point mobility ratio m e appears to be an appropriate criterion for the onset of instabilities simulation parameters are presented in table 2 length applies to both one and two dimensional cases and width only applies to two dimensional cases the flow geometry of the 2d cases is presented in fig 1 relative permeability functions are based on steady state measurements conducted by tang and kovscek 2011 the core used in the experiment is similar to the one described in ren et al 2017 both are berea sandstone where the capillary pressure data obtained from steady state measurements are used for 1d cases a uniform distribution of the residual saturation of the invading phase is used as the initial condition the initial condition used for 2d simulation models is created by stacking a one dimensional solution of the buckley leverett equation buckley and leverett 1942 with the front position located at 0 1 l along y axis followed by random perturbations of the one dimensional solution riaz and tchelepi 2006 ruith and meiburg 2000 mesh size is chosen based on the result of linear stability analysis chuoke et al 1959 hagoort 1974 saffman and taylor 1988 the critical wavelength λ c is calculated using feder 2013 4 4 λ c 2 π σ μ 2 k 2 μ 1 k 1 u u c 1 2 σ is interfacial tension between two phases k 1 k 2 k which is the absolute permeability of the medium μ 2 and μ 1 are viscosities of resident and invading phases respectively u is flow velocity and uc is the critical velocity for horizontal configuration u c 0 feder 2013 the size of the grid is set below the critical wave length to resolve small scale fingers berg and ott 2012 the fluid system in experiment 3 has the smallest λ c and the corresponding mesh is used for all the three cases a mesh size given by 256 128 is used for 2d cases 5 results and discussion even though flow in core scale experiments is three dimensional the boundary conditions consisting of no flow lateral boundaries and uniform flow conditions across inlet and outlet faces a priori determine the flow pattern there is a predominant flow direction along the main axis of the cores in a perfectly homogeneous medium flow would be essentially one dimensional however small scale heterogeneities in the core introduce fluctuations in experiments which lead to the formation of fingers and smeared equivalent one dimensional saturation profiles those fluctuations are modeled as small perturbations in the initial conditions of the two dimensional simulation cases the inclusion of the second dimension in numerical experiments enables investigation of the dynamics of the mixing zone the aforementioned experimental boundary conditions preclude geometrical effects therefore the inclusion of the third dimension in numerical simulation is not expected to result in significant additional insights as such even though flow in core scale experiment is three dimensional it can be adequately simulated in two dimensions the mesh in all numerical experiments is adequately fine such that all relevant macroscopic physical scales are resolved including the diffusive effects and as a result the simulation cases are convergent 5 1 the classical model numerical solutions to the system in 1d are presented by dashed curves in fig 4 unlike experimental observations 1d numerical results exhibit compact fronts whose shapes do not change as they propagate in space with time results from cla in 2d are used to examine the use of mobility ratio criteria as indicators of instability three saturation maps from each of the three experiments considered in this work are shown in fig 5 it is observed that for cases a and b in fig 5 fluctuations along the interface between the two phases decay as displacement progresses the mixing zone becomes a thin band perpendicular to the injection direction a stable displacement process for case c fluctuations grow and develop into prominent fingers the amplitude of the fingers increases with time an unstable displacement process recalling the values of two mobility ratios presented in table 1 total shock mobility ratio m s t appears to be the appropriate indicator for the onset of flow instabilities for the simulation results this is in contrast to the experimental data in 1d where saturation profiles for both experiments 2 and 3 appear to exhibit unstable behavior and the end point mobility ratio seems to be a more appropriate indicator numerical solutions from 2d cases are presented in fig 4 where saturation profiles are averaged in the direction transverse to the mean flow it is observed that for stable cases figs 4a and b profiles obtained from cla in 1d and 2d are nearly identical in fig 4c 1d saturation profiles obtained from cla in 2d show a spreading front due to the appearance of viscous fingering in 2d nevertheless the numerical results appear to not capture the dispersion the mixing zone observed in experiments a grid convergence test is performed for the case of unstable flow experiment 3 two types of numerical schemes are used to discretize the convection flux 1 the second order central upwind scheme kurganov et al 2001 referred to as the second order scheme and 2 the first order upwind scheme patankar 1980 referred to as the first order scheme fig 6 shows the saturation maps obtained via the second order scheme using a coarse mesh and a fine mesh once the mesh is adequately fine see fig 6b the diffusion effects are resolved and the details of the displacement front are revealed additionally saturation maps on different levels of mesh refinement are compared to the reference solution on a fine grid see fig 7 it is observed that the l 2 norm error decreases monotonically as the mesh size becomes smaller for both schemes as expected the second order scheme outperforms the first order scheme given the same mesh size the impact of the initial perturbed front initial condition on the numerical solution is investigated using the unstable fluid system experiment 3 as shown in fig 8 differing initial perturbations result in two dimensional solutions whose details of the two dimensional fronts are also different as shown in fig 9 statistically and reproducible relevant properties of the solutions namely the length of the mixing zone and the position of the leading edge of the front in one dimensional saturation profiles are consistent across solutions resulting from different initial perturbations 5 2 impacts of nonequilibrium effects on saturation profiles in 1d two values of τ h 1 0e6 pa s and 2 0e6 pa s are used for each of the three cases these values are within the range reported by hassanizadeh et al 2002 the simulation results of the h g model are compared with those obtained using the cla model see fig 10 it is observed that the shape of the fronts obtained using the h g model are retarded compared to those from cla for all the cases an increase in the value of τ h appears to result in additional sharpening of the fronts as indicated by arrows in fig 10 those observations are consistent with findings reported by hassanizadeh et al 2002 the impact of the inclusion of nonequilibrium effects using the bne effective saturation in capillary pressure function and relative permeability functions are investigated separately i capillary pressure function only bne p c and ii in relative permeability functions only bne vis τ b is assumed to be constant at 20 0 s for all three experimental cases results are presented in fig 11 compared with solutions from cla saturation profiles from bne p c exhibit a sharpening behavior on the other hand fronts from bne vis appear to be more dispersed incorporation of nonequilibrium effects in capillary pressure function only via either h g or bne p c retards the saturation front and incorporation of nonequilibrium effects in relative permeability functions via bne vis introduces dispersion in the saturation front since experimental data are more dispersed than results from cla bne model is used to match the observations in 1d redistribution time is treated as a fitting parameter and its value is adjusted in 1d simulation to improve the match see fig 12 τ b values of 180 0 s 240 0 s and 150 0 s are used to produce the matches for experiments 1 2 and 3 respectively unlike experiments 2 and 3 the quality of the agreement between numerical results and experimental data for the fluid system given by experiment 1 is relatively constant across the entire experimental time scale see fig 12 fronts in numerical simulations once developed propagate in space unchanged whereas experimental fronts evolve with time throughout the experimental domain core given an infinitely long experimental domain the length of the mixing zone might stabilize at some point and propagate unchanged thereafter nevertheless the numerical solution from the bne model do not appear to capture the evolving nature of instabilities observed in experiments fig 13 compares the leading edge of the spreading fronts defined as the position where saturation of the invading phase drops to its residual saturation from experimental data and numerical solution of bne and cla in 1d as indicated by the slope of the corresponding curves in fig 13 the leading edge appears to propagate with a relatively constant speed in bne cla and the stable displacement experiment 1 this is contrast to the leading edge in experiments 2 and 3 whose propagation speed appears to be non constant this observation is in agreement with the use of end point mobility ratio m e as the criterion for the onset of instabilities 5 3 impacts of nonequilibrium effects on saturation maps in 2d two dimensional numerical solutions to cla bne and h g for experiments 2 and 3 are presented in fig 14 the values of τ b used for bne in 2d are the same as those used for bne in 1d saturation maps from cla show that case a has a stable displacement front whereas case b exhibits a fingering behavior the bne model introduces dispersion in the saturation front which results in smearing and lengthening of the mixing zone for both cases in fig 14 the fingers that appear in cla are no longer visible in solutions to the bne model as shown in fig 15 there is no appreciable difference between bne in 1d and the 1d saturation profiles obtained from averaging saturation maps from bne in 2d in the transverse direction to the mean flow direction h g saturation maps shown in fig 14 are obtained using a value of 1 0e6 pa s for τ h as shown in fig 14 the sharpening effect of the h g model causes perturbations in 2d saturation maps to become more prominent for 2d cases where fingers are present the sharpening effect of the h g model appears to lengthen the mixing zone this phenomenon appears as a dispersive effect in the equivalent 1d saturation profile averaged in the transverse direction to mean flow on the other hand in 2d cases where fingers are not present the sharpening effect of the h g model translates into a sharpening of the equivalent 1d profile these effects are shown in fig 16 comparisons between positions of the leading edge of the saturation fronts from 2d simulations and experiments are presented in fig 17 similar to the 1d case fig 13 the leading edge in numerical solutions appears to propagate with a relatively constant speed whereas the leading edges in experiments 2 and 3 appear to propagate with a non constant speed the lack of agreement between nonequilibrium models and physical observations is in part due to the non evolving nature of the coefficients τ h and τ b 5 4 sensitivity analysis of h g model for the cases of cla and h g at times t d2 and t d3 in fig 14 the length of the mixing zone is indicated by bidirectional arrows that point to the leftmost trough and rightmost crest associated with the fingers the arrows are longer for the h g model compared to cla at t d2 and t d3 this is attributed to the aforementioned sharpening effect of the h g model in 2d the extent of this sharpening effect as a function of the magnitude of τh is investigated using three values 5 0e5 pa s 1 0e6 pa s and 2 0e6 pa s the resulting saturation profiles using parameters from experiments 2 and 3 and h g model in 2d along with experimental observations and a reference profile τ h 0 are shown in fig 18 for the first case experiment 2 the sharpening of the saturation profile becomes more pronounced as the value of τ h increases for the second case where fingers are present experiment 3 the increased sharpening of the saturation map in 2d due to a larger value of τh results in a an increase in the length of the mixing zone which appears as a dispersive effect in the equivalent 1d profile in fig 18 larger range of τh is then tested and the results are presented in fig 19 the advancement of the leading edge is insignificant with increases of τh this phenomenon is examined in 2d saturation maps from h g 2d see fig 20 initial increases of τh smaller values of τh lengthens the mixing zone equally in both the positive and negative directions along the x axis as shown in fig 21 after a certain value of τh additional increases of the coefficient only lengthen the mixing zone in the direction opposite to the mean flow direction while further sharpening the fingers 6 conclusions this paper presents a recently developed high resolution two dimensional numerical simulator that incorporates h g and bne nonequilibrium models flow equations are cast in a vorticity stream function form which is then solved using a spectral method the convection flux in the transport equation is computed using a high order tvd central upwind scheme the coupled vorticity stream function equation and transport equation in 2d are solved using a semi implicit time stepping scheme numerical results for a homogeneous porous medium are compared with core scale displacement experiments from literature the criterion of the onset of instabilities is investigated and juxtaposed using experimental and numerical results end point mobility ratio appears to be an appropriate indicator of the onset of instabilities based on the experimental observations whereas the onset of instabilities in numerical results are more aptly captured by the total shock mobility ratio numerical results indicate that implementation of the h g model in 1d tends to retard the saturation front whereas 2d simulation reveals the sharpening qualities of h g in the presence of fingers this sharpening may lead to an increase of the length of the mixing zone which may appear as a dispersive effect in the equivalent 1d profile averaged in the transverse direction to mean flow increases in the length of the mixing zone appears to occur in equal amounts in the mean flow direction and opposite to it for small values of τ h additional increases in τ h appear to lengthen the mixing zone only in the direction opposite to the mean flow results from the bne model demonstrate its dispersive effect on the saturation profile in both 1d and 2d domains this results in an elongated transition zone where fingers that are resolved using the classical formulation are now smeared even though both h g and bne models may increase the length of the mixing zone they seem to not capture the observed flow behavior for unstable cases adequately numerical results from bne and h g models show that leading edges propagate at relatively constant speeds whereas experimental observations of unstable displacement processes show profiles whose leading edges propagate with non constant

737,due to their influence on design guidelines there is great interest in quantifying the possible impacts of climate change on extreme rainfall return levels these studies can be affected by existing distortions in available rainfall historical series the effect of the temporal aggregation or time resolution ta of rainfall observations on the estimation of trends in annual maxima over the last 100 years is examined here we have used long term historical rainfall observations with various temporal aggregations due to the progress of recording systems through time at 10 representative meteorological stations located in an inland region of central italy series of annual maximum rainfall depths hd for given durations d have been then derived it is well known that hd values derived from rainfall data characterized by every ta may involve underestimation errors that for ta 10 min can become important considering that all selected stations were installed in the first half of the twentieth century each hd series can be assumed as inhomogeneous since it contains values obtained by rainfall data with ta values ranging from fine e g 1 min to coarse e g 24 h thus with different levels of underestimation by using a recently developed mathematical relation between average underestimation error and the ratio ta d we then correct each hd value has been corrected through two different approaches obtaining quasi homogeneous series successively commonly used climatic trend tests including least squares linear trend analysis mann kendall spearman s rank correlation and sen s method have been applied to the inhomogeneous and quasi homogeneous hd series the results show that the underestimation of hd values with coarse ta plays a significant role in the analysis of the effects of climatic change on extreme rainfalls specifically the correction of the hd values can change the sign of the trend from positive to negative mainly for series characterized by high probability to include hd values with ta d 1 key words extreme rainfall climate change trend analysis rainfall data temporal aggregation 1 introduction overwhelming evidence suggests that climate change mainly due to greenhouse gas emissions from human activities has been modifying the hydrologic cycle and exerting impacts on the environment with significant implications for water resources barnett et al 2008 mean global surface temperatures show an increase of about 0 7 c in the last century ipcc 2007 and 2014 and based on the clausius clapeyron relation for each 1 c increase in global temperature the precipitable water increases by 7 lenderink and van meijgarrd 2008 hardwick jones et al 2010 furthermore in the context of global warming it is expected that temperatures will increase near to the surface and decrease in the upper troposphere favoring thermodynamic instability and the chances of deep convection kunkel 2003 therefore the associated increase in average rainfall is typically variable over the planet not only because the atmospheric warming and water vapor trends have local non uniformity but also because of other factors such as the frequency and intensity of meteorological systems and their respective changes re and barros 2009 variations in extreme rainfall can be distinct from those in average rainfall because extreme precipitation by its nature is more erratic observed trends are less spatially coherent than trends in average rainfall however increasing temperatures directly imply an increase in the maximum water vapor in the atmosphere and hence the maximum amount of rainfall so an increase in extreme rainfall is a robust expectation from rising temperatures globally there are more places where heavy rainfall is increasing than decreasing across much of the united states for example 1 and 2 day extreme rainfall events are becoming much more frequent degaetano 2009 jansen et al 2014 overall models have wide spread but are reasonably centered around the average observed rate of increase in extreme 1 day rainfall in the northern hemisphere mid latitudes but they tend to underestimate the rate of increase in extreme rainfall in the tropics asadieh and krakauer 2015 fatichi and caporali 2009 found an absence of trends for mean precipitation and the intensity of extreme events of duration 3 h 6 h and 12 h in tuscany a region of central italy over the period 1916 2003 similarly quirmbach et al 2012 found that over 1950 2008 there were no significant trends in the number of annual extreme precipitation events for the north rhine westphalia region analyses for other regions of italy both in the north and in the south indicate an increase of extreme rainfall events bonaccorso et al 2005 brunetti et al 2000 a similar study was conducted by hydalgo munoz et al 2011 in andalusia spain where an increase of extreme events in wintertime was observed in the period 1955 2006 many scientific papers e g gershunov and cayan 2003 schreck and semazzi 2004 grimm and tedeschi 2009 haylock et al 2006 cayan et al 1999 gershunov 1998 aryal et al 2009 kamruzzaman et al 2011 kendon et al 2018 contain experimental evidence that temporal oscillations in the occurrence of high rainfall intensities are somehow linked to large scale atmospheric and oceanographic oscillations such as the nao or enso willems 2013 used 107 years of rainfall data recorded at uccle brussel belgium to show cyclic variations with period 30 40 years indicating that trends over short time periods 40 years may be simply a result of large scale atmospheric changes from the above scientific literature clear evidence emerges firstly the analysis of trends in annual maximum rainfall depths hd associated with a given duration d should be carried out only for long term rainfall data recorded for example from the earliest decades of the last century see also teegavarapu and nayak 2017 to allow for biases introduced by large scale oscillations of the climate system when the time series length is less than one oscillation cycle it may coincide with an oscillation high period or an oscillation low period hence rainfall statistics derived from such periods may be distorted from the longer term statistics willems 2013 secondly analyses on the hd series for durations less than 1 h are not available since for prolonged periods historical rainfall data have been recorded with different temporal aggregations or time resolutions ta linked to the technologic progress of recording systems through time currently through tipping bucket sensors rainfall amounts are recorded in a data logger for each tip time associated with a fixed rainfall depth but until the last decades of the 21st century rainfall data were recorded only over paper rolls pluviograph typically with hourly ta bonaccorso et al 2005 fatichi and caporali 2009 in addition especially before the second world war there are many years for which only daily rainfall data are available recorded each day at 9 a m local time in italy and some other countries other countries have different recording times and measuring the accumulated rainfall during the previous 24 h many studies have been performed to determine the potential underestimation errors in the hd evaluation starting from rainfall data with a coarse ta hershfield and wilson 1958 hershfield 1961 weiss 1964 harihara and tripathi 1973 natural environment research council 1975 van montfort 1990 huff and angel 1992 faiers et al 1994 dwyer and reed 1995 van montfort 1997 young and mcenroe 2003 yoo et al 2015 papalexiou et al 2016 morbidelli et al 2017 all of them agree that for d comparable with ta the actual maximum accumulations may be significantly underestimated with errors of up to 50 see also fig 1 long hd series always include a percentage of values derived from coarse rainfall data typically old data involving the aforementioned problem of underestimation and another percentage derived from continuous data recorded in the last 20 30 years consequently these hd series can be considered as inhomogeneous morbidelli et al 2017 defined a procedure to obtain quasi homogeneous series of annual maximum rainfall depths that involves data derived through different temporal aggregations due to the progress of recording systems with time for each different d value interval a mathematical relation between average underestimation error and the ratio ta d can be used to correct the hd values with the awareness that many hd series contain a relevant number of underestimated values due to the availability of only coarse resolution rainfall data e g daily the main objective of this paper is to evaluate whether this unavoidable problem significantly affects trend analyses which determine if climate change is having an impact on extreme event intensities and frequencies commonly used climatic trend tests including least squares linear trend analysis mann kendall spearman s rank correlation and sen s method have been applied to the inhomogeneous and quasi homogeneous hd series the comparison of the results obtained by the same trend test should not be significantly influenced by a few critical elements concerning the hypothesis of stationarity non stationarity lins and cohn 2011 kutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 serinaldi et al 2018 of the investigated hd series a second objective of the paper is to verify if the more common homogeneity tests are able to detect in the hd series the existence of anomalies due to the use of rainfall data characterized by temporal aggregations that change over time to limit the influence of possible climate oscillations only time series with durations of up to 95 years are used 2 study area and rainfall data umbria region 8456 km2 located in an inland zone of central italy fig 2 is our study area it is characterized by a complex orography along the eastern seaboard where the apennine mountains exceed 2000 m a s l and is mainly hilly in the central and western areas with elevations ranging from 100 to 800 m a s l a wide percentage of the study area is included within the tiber river basin in fact the tiber river crosses the region from north to south west receiving water from many tributaries mainly located on the hydrographic left side annual rainfall totals vary across the region with mean value of about 900 mm but ranging from 650 mm to 1450 mm based on 1921 2015 and a network of more than 90 rain gauges higher monthly rainfall values generally occur during the autumn winter period together with floods caused by widespread rainfall mean annual air temperature ranges between 3 3 c and 14 2 c with maximum values during the month of july and minimum in january the region is currently monitored through a dense rain gauge network about 1 rain gauge for each 90 km2 with most stations continuously connected to a central unit through a radio link while before the year 1992 only few rain gauges with measurements made every sixty minutes were installed over the past 15 years the region has been affected by five significant droughts 2001 to 2003 then in 2007 2012 2015 and 2017 as well as by six dangerous flood events one occurred in 2005 one in 2008 one in 2010 two in 2012 and one in 2013 with very large impacts in economic terms in this study we use rainfall data from 10 stations characterized by long available time series from january 1 1921 to december 31 2015 with their best temporal aggregation variable over time from 24 h for very old data to 1 min typically in the last 20 30 years only one station was included in the network earlier used by morbidelli et al 2017 their geographic position is shown in fig 2 while for each selected station the main characteristics of the time series are reported in table 1 with details on the percentage of available rainfall data characterized by specific temporal aggregation ta the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall in the umbria region can be studied by analyzing the historical records from the following four rain gauge stations representative of the complexity of the regional climate see also fig 2 and table 1 città di castello located in the north of the region along the tiber river valley gualdo tadino north east apennine mountains spoleto south east clitunno river valley and todi south tiber river valley the rainfall regime of the study area is synthesized in fig 3 through the monthly rainfall distribution of four selected representative stations the monthly coefficient of variation cvm defined as the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean monthly rainfall is in the interval 0 25 0 31 with values inversely proportional to the specific site s annual total rainfall the rainfall depth during each month of the year in the gualdo tadino station is always higher than in the other stations fig 3 clearly shows the rainfall regime of the region with the highest and lowest rainfall depths that typically occur in november and july respectively 3 methods the accumulated rainfall recorded over a time interval d xd can be obtained through the following procedure burlando and rosso 1996 boni et al 2006 1 x d t t t d x τ d τ where x t is the rainfall rate at time t then the annual maximum rainfall depth over a duration d hd may be easily determined 2 h d m a x x d t t 0 t t 0 d 1 y e a r where t0 is the starting time of each year here we identify a large number of very long series of annual maximum rainfall depths associated with durations 1 h 3 h 6 h 12 h 24 h and 48 h each of these series hereinafter called uncorrected because they contain some underestimated hd values see also morbidelli et al 2017 is then used to verify the existence of possible trend induced by climate change specifically we consider the following tests 1 least squares linear trend analysis 2 non parametrical mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 3 the spearman rank correlation test khaliq et al 2009 4 the sen s method sen 2012 successively the above mentioned tests were repeated on two different corrected versions of the same series hereinafter called corrected in which the underestimation error due to the coarse temporal aggregation of historical rainfall data was minimized eliminated the two versions differ for the deterministic or stochastic approach adopted during the correction phase in the deterministic approach an average correction is identically applied to all hd values characterized by the same ratio ta d to this aim the average underestimation errors have been determined through the relations earlier proposed by morbidelli et al 2017 on the basis of rainfall data recorded by a rain gauge network very different from that used here for another objective thus with the deterministic approach each underestimated hd value deriving from rainfall data characterized by a specific ta has been corrected through the use of eq 8 by morbidelli et al 2017 note that all corrections deriving from these equations for which the average underestimation error become less than 1 are neglected in the second approach of stochastic type a more complex procedure has been adopted each single deterministic error e may be considered as an exponentially distributed random variable with a probability density function dependent on a mean value that is linked with the ratio ta d the choice of the exponential distribution perfectly coherent with papalexiou et al 2016 derives from the performance comparison in terms of pearson s chi square test of the more common statistical distributions furthermore the random variable e is demonstrated to have an inverse correlation with the corresponding rainfall depth for each hd series that contains a defined number of underestimated values 1000 realizations of the random variable e with the required characteristics exponential pdf and mean value achievable through eq 8 by morbidelli et al 2017 were first generated and then used to correct the underestimated hd respecting the inverse correlation between errors and rainfall depths independently from the adopted test least squares linear trend analysis mann kendall spearman sen to provide an overall representation of the random e effect a monte carlo technique has been used papalexiou et al 2016 more specifically when a series of n annual maximum rainfall depths h d i i 1 n of assigned d obtained from data characterized by coarse ta has to be corrected with a stochastic approach these steps could be followed 1 the parameter of the exponential distribution function equal to the inverse of the ea achievable with eq 8 by morbidelli et al 2017 has to be quantified 2 a set of underestimation errors e i i 1 n respecting the probability density function of point 1 has to be generated 3 each generated e i value has to be combined with a specific uncorrected h d i on the basis of the inverse correlation between these quantities 4 each h d i has to be corrected in accordance with the following equation 4 h d i c o r r h d i u n c o r r 1 e i i 1 n where h d i c o r r and h d i u n c o r r are the corrected and uncorrected h d i values respectively 5 steps 2 3 and 4 have to be repeated 1000 times as is well known homogeneity tests may be used to identify modifications to observational practices station relocations and changes in measuring techniques e g kendon et al 2018 in principle homogeneity tests may also be able to detect the existence of anomalies in hd series due to the use of rainfall data characterized by temporal aggregations that change over time to this aim we use two different methods the standard normal homogeneity test snht for a single break point alexandersson 1986 and the pettitt test pettitt 1979 both tests consider that the hd values are independent and identically distributed under the alternative hypothesis both tests assume that an evident break with a specific temporal position is present most studies recommend to make homogeneity tests in a relative way by using one or more neighboring stations that are supposedly homogeneous peterson et al 1998 but there are cases where the homogeneity analysis may be only performed through absolute tests which use the single station series under investigation in our study area all rain gauges changed their recording systems from paper rolls characterized by ta 1 h to data logger able to register each tip time within the same decade 1985 1995 so relative testing is pointless therefore the mathematical formulations of the snht and pettitt tests whose detailed descriptions may be found in alexandersson 1986 and pettitt 1979 have been here performed in their absolute declination wijngaard et al 2003 4 results and discussion 4 1 annual maximum rainfall depth series for each station to quantify the maximum number of hd series we considered all existing rainfall data in recent years mainly since 1992 it is possible to obtain rainfall data recorded in data loggers for each tip time associated with a fixed rainfall depth no more than 0 2 mm in this case each rainfall event was summarized by aggregating the number of tips over a ta equal to 1 min nevertheless for long time series a considerable amount of rainfall data were available with hourly recording system as a consequence of the paper rolls adoption furthermore in the absence of other possibilities daily information derived from observation made each day at 9 00 a m was used an example of the available hd series carried out is shown in table 2 for città di castello rain gauge station where for d 1 h there are 27 values 53 of the total placed in the period 1921 1991 characterized by ta d 1 and consequently with single underestimation errors up to 50 and average error equal to 11 morbidelli et al 2017 for all analyses carried out in this paper 60 hd time series obtained considering 6 different durations 1 h 3 h 6 h 12 h 24 h and 48 h and the 10 longest record rain gauge stations reported in table 1 were selected 4 2 least squares linear trend analysis as a first test we fitted a least squares linear trend to the annual maxima for 6 durations at 10 stations 60 datasets for the uncorrected hd series the number of positive least squares linear trends equal to 28 barely outnumbers the negative ones equal to 27 see values in bold in table 3 opposing results were obtained for the corrected hd series independent from the deterministic or stochastic approach adopted in fact after corrections cases with negative least square linear trends become equal to 36 and 34 for the deterministic and stochastic approaches respectively whereas the positive ones become in both cases 22 in table 3 see values with normal and italic characters for the deterministic and stochastic approaches respectively the comparison of the two corrected values in table 3 shows that the approaches used to correct the hd underestimation produce quite equivalent results see also fig 4 since this similarity has been always observed independently by the considered test hereinafter it will only be considered the distinction between uncorrected and corrected series table 3 clearly shows that corrections of hd values produce significant effects on the least square linear trends especially for series characterized by durations 1 h and 24 h in which the probability of the presence of values with ta d 1 is particularly high figs 5 and 6 show a comparison between uncorrected and corrected annual maximum rainfall depths observed at umbertide for durations 1 h and 24 h respectively it can be seen that the uncorrected series show a positive trend figs 5 a and 6 a while the correct series linear trends are negative figs 5 b and 6 b neither of trends in fig 5 and 6 are significant but they are anyway important in terms of general trend evaluation note that when the objective is a definition of a specific climatic trend missing data may be crucial in these cases it is very important to work with a continuous period of data or to infill the missing information however in this paper the objective was the comparison between uncorrected and corrected hd series in our opinion possible missing data each time series analyzed here includes all data from the last 25 30 years and except for the period of the second world war the few other years with missing data have occurred randomly do not influence the aforementioned comparison because they are in series uncorrected and corrected regarding the influence of climatic change on heavy rainfalls from the results of table 3 it is very difficult to find a clear indication on the relationship between trends and geographic position altitude above sea level and mean annual rainfall characteristics of each station actually all selected stations in the north of the region città di castello gualdo tadino gubbio and umbertide evidenced a prevailing positive trend despite their non homogeneous altitude in fact two of them are characterized by a significant value of altitude for gualdo tadino equal to 599 m a s l and for gubbio equal to 471 m a s l whereas two by a relatively low value città di castello and umbertide both around 300 m a s l instead in the south of the region almost all the stations except orvieto and terni evidenced negative trends 4 3 non parametric mann kendall test and spearman rank correlation test to release from the assumption of a linear trend the analysis of the 60 time series was successively performed by the non parametric mann kendall mann 1945 kendall 1975 and the spearman rank correlation khaliq et al 2009 tests which are frequently used to detect trends in heavy rainfall fu et al 2004 houssos and bartzokas 2006 ramos and martinez casasnovas 2006 su et al 2006 fatichi and caporali 2009 rashid et al 2015 for the uncorrected series by using for both tests a significance level equal to 0 05 the percentage without significant trends is always the same independent of the adopted test more specifically for both tests this percentage is higher than 93 with 2 series spoleto station with rainfall durations 24 h and 48 h characterized by a negative trend and 2 series gubbio station with rainfall durations 1 h and 24 h by a positive trend instead after the correction the mann kendall and the spearman rank correlation tests evidenced 3 cases with a negative trend and no positive case in addition to the hd series for spoleto station with d 24 and 48 h also that of todi with d 1 h becomes characterized by a negative trend it is interesting to note that in this last case the least square linear trend was negative also before the correction with eq 3 with slope of the linear regressions equal to 0 05 mm year however as shown in fig 7 after the correction the negative trend became exacerbated slope of the linear regression equal to 0 12 mm year finally it is evident that in the transition from uncorrected to corrected hd series the application of the mann kendall and the spearman rank correlation tests produce different results particularly when d 1 or 24 h where as specified above the probability of the presence of values with ta d 1 is particularly high 4 4 sen s slope method the sen s innovative method sen 2012 has been recently adopted in many analyses sonali and kumar 2013 guclu 2016 oztopal and sen 2016 guclu et al 2018 guclu 2018 especially for a comparison with classical methods it is based on the realization of two ordered sub series in ascending order and offers the following advantages 1 the chance to show visual results on the graph and 2 the possibility to consider five trend types monotonic increasing and decreasing non monotonic increasing and decreasing and no trend conditions instead of the usual three types monotonic increasing and decreasing and no trend condition similarly to what already emerged using the most classic methodologies also the adoption of the sen s method produces different results when applied to the uncorrected and corrected annual maximum rainfall depths series as an example fig 8 shows the application of the method for both the uncorrected and corrected hd series observed at todi considering d 1 h as it can be seen in fig 8 a the uncorrected series shows a no trend condition because all values are close to 1 1 line while in fig 8 b the correct series evidences a clear monotonic decreasing trend details on the results interpretation can be found in sen 2012 4 5 series length the above results show that temporal aggregation of rainfall data can have a significant role in the analysis of the effects of climatic change on extreme rainfall intensities in principle this problem could be solved by using only rainfall data available with temporal aggregation of 1 min however for most geographical areas historical data with ta 1 min are available only for the last 20 30 years fig 9 shows that exhaustive results in terms of linear regression can be obtained by using at least 60 years of data in addition when only the most recent 20 40 years of data are used the risk of misleading results is very high as a consequence series derived from rainfall data with ta 1 min in every part of the world characterized by lengths of up to 30 years can never be used furthermore as shown in fig 10 in some cases the more recent values f i observed in the last 10 years when compared to those of the entire period can provide different indications of change based on whether the series are corrected or uncorrected it may be concluded that there is no climatic index or test that can be usefully conducted on hd series composed of values resulting from years with rainfall data characterized by ta 1 min because their length is too short for example using these short series in the 60 cases selected here of length up to 25 years the non parametric test of mann kendall offers different results from those previously discussed showing no trend for 58 cases an increasing trend for gualdo tadino station with d 24 h and a decreasing trend for città di castello station with d 3 h 4 6 homogeneity tests the standard normal homogeneity test snht for a single break point alexandersson 1986 and the pettitt test pettitt 1979 were applied to the 60 hd series considered in their uncorrected form where the inhomogeneity due to the use of rainfall data with coarse temporal aggregation should be evident however break conditions detected with both absolute tests were very limited and never simultaneous 8 and 7 cases for snht and pettitt tests respectively furthermore detected inhomogeneities could not be justified by metadata and not even by changes in the recording practice with a significant modification of rainfall temporal aggregation as an example fig 11 shows the annual maximum rainfall depths for d 24 h at città di castello station with a clear indication of the 1991 1992 change in rainfall temporal aggregation from 24 h to 1 min see also table 2 therefore hd values in the period 1921 1991 should be strongly underestimated up to 50 while successive years are correctly determined despite the existence of a discontinuity localized in the years 1991 1992 the two tests suggest possible breaks in 1927 snht and 1948 pettitt this suggests that the detection of breaks in hd series due to inhomogeneities for coarse rainfall time aggregation is not possible because this inhomogeneity even when very evident cannot produce sufficiently large break points to be detectible this confirms that if the standard deviation of the considered variable is significantly high as in the precipitation case then the probability that inhomogeneity will escape detection increases wijngaard et al 2003 5 conclusions historical rainfall data are available with different temporal aggregations within the range 1 min 24 h linked to the progress of recording systems through time therefore in many geographical areas of the world long annual maximum rainfall depth series can become inhomogeneous because characterized by a percentage of values obtained from coarse data generally old data involving the problem of underestimation and another percentage derived from continuous data recorded more recently in principle this may affect subsequent analyses including those which aim to examine the effect of climate change on extreme event intensities and frequencies however by using the mathematical relation recently proposed by morbidelli et al 2017 between average underestimation error and the ratio ta d each hd value may be corrected obtaining quasi homogeneous hd series which can then be reassessed for trends over time the main objective of this paper was to evaluate whether the underestimation errors of the hd due to the availability of coarse temporal aggregation data significantly affect the most common methods used to evaluate trend signals in intense rainfall without considering specific analyses on the possible limits of the adopted trend tests and the stationary non stationary characteristics of the selected time series the major findings and conclusions of this study conducted over 10 long record high resolution rain gauges using data for 1921 2015 and based on the comparison of the results obtained with both corrected and uncorrected series are the following the underestimation errors due to coarse ta produce significant effects on the least squares linear trend analysis of the hd values in fact since a prevalence of increasing and decreasing trends for uncorrected and corrected series respectively was observed it is obvious that the correction can change the sign of the trend the correction of the hd values performed with both deterministic and stochastic approaches produces more evident effects for series where the probability of the presence of values with ta d 1 is particularly high d 1 h and d 24 h the non parametric mann kendall test and the spearman rank correlation test both with a significance level 0 05 are less sensitive than the least squares linear trend to corrections of the hd values for both tests using the 60 uncorrected time series selected in this paper only 2 cases are characterized by a negative trend and 2 cases by a positive one after the hd corrections cases with negative trends become 3 and there are no cases with positive trend also the adoption of the innovative sen s method produces different results when applied to the uncorrected and corrected annual maximum rainfall depths series the hypothetical solution to consider only rainfall data with ta 1 min is not possible because in most geographical areas these data exist only for the last 2 3 decades while trend identification requires at least 60 years of data due to the effect of large scale climate oscillations at multi decadal time scales the existence of anomalies in the hd series due to the different temporal aggregations of rainfall data cannot be detected by common homogeneity tests because any consequent discontinuity even when very evident does not produce sufficiently large break points at least for the annual maximum series acknowledgment the authors

737,due to their influence on design guidelines there is great interest in quantifying the possible impacts of climate change on extreme rainfall return levels these studies can be affected by existing distortions in available rainfall historical series the effect of the temporal aggregation or time resolution ta of rainfall observations on the estimation of trends in annual maxima over the last 100 years is examined here we have used long term historical rainfall observations with various temporal aggregations due to the progress of recording systems through time at 10 representative meteorological stations located in an inland region of central italy series of annual maximum rainfall depths hd for given durations d have been then derived it is well known that hd values derived from rainfall data characterized by every ta may involve underestimation errors that for ta 10 min can become important considering that all selected stations were installed in the first half of the twentieth century each hd series can be assumed as inhomogeneous since it contains values obtained by rainfall data with ta values ranging from fine e g 1 min to coarse e g 24 h thus with different levels of underestimation by using a recently developed mathematical relation between average underestimation error and the ratio ta d we then correct each hd value has been corrected through two different approaches obtaining quasi homogeneous series successively commonly used climatic trend tests including least squares linear trend analysis mann kendall spearman s rank correlation and sen s method have been applied to the inhomogeneous and quasi homogeneous hd series the results show that the underestimation of hd values with coarse ta plays a significant role in the analysis of the effects of climatic change on extreme rainfalls specifically the correction of the hd values can change the sign of the trend from positive to negative mainly for series characterized by high probability to include hd values with ta d 1 key words extreme rainfall climate change trend analysis rainfall data temporal aggregation 1 introduction overwhelming evidence suggests that climate change mainly due to greenhouse gas emissions from human activities has been modifying the hydrologic cycle and exerting impacts on the environment with significant implications for water resources barnett et al 2008 mean global surface temperatures show an increase of about 0 7 c in the last century ipcc 2007 and 2014 and based on the clausius clapeyron relation for each 1 c increase in global temperature the precipitable water increases by 7 lenderink and van meijgarrd 2008 hardwick jones et al 2010 furthermore in the context of global warming it is expected that temperatures will increase near to the surface and decrease in the upper troposphere favoring thermodynamic instability and the chances of deep convection kunkel 2003 therefore the associated increase in average rainfall is typically variable over the planet not only because the atmospheric warming and water vapor trends have local non uniformity but also because of other factors such as the frequency and intensity of meteorological systems and their respective changes re and barros 2009 variations in extreme rainfall can be distinct from those in average rainfall because extreme precipitation by its nature is more erratic observed trends are less spatially coherent than trends in average rainfall however increasing temperatures directly imply an increase in the maximum water vapor in the atmosphere and hence the maximum amount of rainfall so an increase in extreme rainfall is a robust expectation from rising temperatures globally there are more places where heavy rainfall is increasing than decreasing across much of the united states for example 1 and 2 day extreme rainfall events are becoming much more frequent degaetano 2009 jansen et al 2014 overall models have wide spread but are reasonably centered around the average observed rate of increase in extreme 1 day rainfall in the northern hemisphere mid latitudes but they tend to underestimate the rate of increase in extreme rainfall in the tropics asadieh and krakauer 2015 fatichi and caporali 2009 found an absence of trends for mean precipitation and the intensity of extreme events of duration 3 h 6 h and 12 h in tuscany a region of central italy over the period 1916 2003 similarly quirmbach et al 2012 found that over 1950 2008 there were no significant trends in the number of annual extreme precipitation events for the north rhine westphalia region analyses for other regions of italy both in the north and in the south indicate an increase of extreme rainfall events bonaccorso et al 2005 brunetti et al 2000 a similar study was conducted by hydalgo munoz et al 2011 in andalusia spain where an increase of extreme events in wintertime was observed in the period 1955 2006 many scientific papers e g gershunov and cayan 2003 schreck and semazzi 2004 grimm and tedeschi 2009 haylock et al 2006 cayan et al 1999 gershunov 1998 aryal et al 2009 kamruzzaman et al 2011 kendon et al 2018 contain experimental evidence that temporal oscillations in the occurrence of high rainfall intensities are somehow linked to large scale atmospheric and oceanographic oscillations such as the nao or enso willems 2013 used 107 years of rainfall data recorded at uccle brussel belgium to show cyclic variations with period 30 40 years indicating that trends over short time periods 40 years may be simply a result of large scale atmospheric changes from the above scientific literature clear evidence emerges firstly the analysis of trends in annual maximum rainfall depths hd associated with a given duration d should be carried out only for long term rainfall data recorded for example from the earliest decades of the last century see also teegavarapu and nayak 2017 to allow for biases introduced by large scale oscillations of the climate system when the time series length is less than one oscillation cycle it may coincide with an oscillation high period or an oscillation low period hence rainfall statistics derived from such periods may be distorted from the longer term statistics willems 2013 secondly analyses on the hd series for durations less than 1 h are not available since for prolonged periods historical rainfall data have been recorded with different temporal aggregations or time resolutions ta linked to the technologic progress of recording systems through time currently through tipping bucket sensors rainfall amounts are recorded in a data logger for each tip time associated with a fixed rainfall depth but until the last decades of the 21st century rainfall data were recorded only over paper rolls pluviograph typically with hourly ta bonaccorso et al 2005 fatichi and caporali 2009 in addition especially before the second world war there are many years for which only daily rainfall data are available recorded each day at 9 a m local time in italy and some other countries other countries have different recording times and measuring the accumulated rainfall during the previous 24 h many studies have been performed to determine the potential underestimation errors in the hd evaluation starting from rainfall data with a coarse ta hershfield and wilson 1958 hershfield 1961 weiss 1964 harihara and tripathi 1973 natural environment research council 1975 van montfort 1990 huff and angel 1992 faiers et al 1994 dwyer and reed 1995 van montfort 1997 young and mcenroe 2003 yoo et al 2015 papalexiou et al 2016 morbidelli et al 2017 all of them agree that for d comparable with ta the actual maximum accumulations may be significantly underestimated with errors of up to 50 see also fig 1 long hd series always include a percentage of values derived from coarse rainfall data typically old data involving the aforementioned problem of underestimation and another percentage derived from continuous data recorded in the last 20 30 years consequently these hd series can be considered as inhomogeneous morbidelli et al 2017 defined a procedure to obtain quasi homogeneous series of annual maximum rainfall depths that involves data derived through different temporal aggregations due to the progress of recording systems with time for each different d value interval a mathematical relation between average underestimation error and the ratio ta d can be used to correct the hd values with the awareness that many hd series contain a relevant number of underestimated values due to the availability of only coarse resolution rainfall data e g daily the main objective of this paper is to evaluate whether this unavoidable problem significantly affects trend analyses which determine if climate change is having an impact on extreme event intensities and frequencies commonly used climatic trend tests including least squares linear trend analysis mann kendall spearman s rank correlation and sen s method have been applied to the inhomogeneous and quasi homogeneous hd series the comparison of the results obtained by the same trend test should not be significantly influenced by a few critical elements concerning the hypothesis of stationarity non stationarity lins and cohn 2011 kutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 serinaldi et al 2018 of the investigated hd series a second objective of the paper is to verify if the more common homogeneity tests are able to detect in the hd series the existence of anomalies due to the use of rainfall data characterized by temporal aggregations that change over time to limit the influence of possible climate oscillations only time series with durations of up to 95 years are used 2 study area and rainfall data umbria region 8456 km2 located in an inland zone of central italy fig 2 is our study area it is characterized by a complex orography along the eastern seaboard where the apennine mountains exceed 2000 m a s l and is mainly hilly in the central and western areas with elevations ranging from 100 to 800 m a s l a wide percentage of the study area is included within the tiber river basin in fact the tiber river crosses the region from north to south west receiving water from many tributaries mainly located on the hydrographic left side annual rainfall totals vary across the region with mean value of about 900 mm but ranging from 650 mm to 1450 mm based on 1921 2015 and a network of more than 90 rain gauges higher monthly rainfall values generally occur during the autumn winter period together with floods caused by widespread rainfall mean annual air temperature ranges between 3 3 c and 14 2 c with maximum values during the month of july and minimum in january the region is currently monitored through a dense rain gauge network about 1 rain gauge for each 90 km2 with most stations continuously connected to a central unit through a radio link while before the year 1992 only few rain gauges with measurements made every sixty minutes were installed over the past 15 years the region has been affected by five significant droughts 2001 to 2003 then in 2007 2012 2015 and 2017 as well as by six dangerous flood events one occurred in 2005 one in 2008 one in 2010 two in 2012 and one in 2013 with very large impacts in economic terms in this study we use rainfall data from 10 stations characterized by long available time series from january 1 1921 to december 31 2015 with their best temporal aggregation variable over time from 24 h for very old data to 1 min typically in the last 20 30 years only one station was included in the network earlier used by morbidelli et al 2017 their geographic position is shown in fig 2 while for each selected station the main characteristics of the time series are reported in table 1 with details on the percentage of available rainfall data characterized by specific temporal aggregation ta the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall in the umbria region can be studied by analyzing the historical records from the following four rain gauge stations representative of the complexity of the regional climate see also fig 2 and table 1 città di castello located in the north of the region along the tiber river valley gualdo tadino north east apennine mountains spoleto south east clitunno river valley and todi south tiber river valley the rainfall regime of the study area is synthesized in fig 3 through the monthly rainfall distribution of four selected representative stations the monthly coefficient of variation cvm defined as the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean monthly rainfall is in the interval 0 25 0 31 with values inversely proportional to the specific site s annual total rainfall the rainfall depth during each month of the year in the gualdo tadino station is always higher than in the other stations fig 3 clearly shows the rainfall regime of the region with the highest and lowest rainfall depths that typically occur in november and july respectively 3 methods the accumulated rainfall recorded over a time interval d xd can be obtained through the following procedure burlando and rosso 1996 boni et al 2006 1 x d t t t d x τ d τ where x t is the rainfall rate at time t then the annual maximum rainfall depth over a duration d hd may be easily determined 2 h d m a x x d t t 0 t t 0 d 1 y e a r where t0 is the starting time of each year here we identify a large number of very long series of annual maximum rainfall depths associated with durations 1 h 3 h 6 h 12 h 24 h and 48 h each of these series hereinafter called uncorrected because they contain some underestimated hd values see also morbidelli et al 2017 is then used to verify the existence of possible trend induced by climate change specifically we consider the following tests 1 least squares linear trend analysis 2 non parametrical mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 3 the spearman rank correlation test khaliq et al 2009 4 the sen s method sen 2012 successively the above mentioned tests were repeated on two different corrected versions of the same series hereinafter called corrected in which the underestimation error due to the coarse temporal aggregation of historical rainfall data was minimized eliminated the two versions differ for the deterministic or stochastic approach adopted during the correction phase in the deterministic approach an average correction is identically applied to all hd values characterized by the same ratio ta d to this aim the average underestimation errors have been determined through the relations earlier proposed by morbidelli et al 2017 on the basis of rainfall data recorded by a rain gauge network very different from that used here for another objective thus with the deterministic approach each underestimated hd value deriving from rainfall data characterized by a specific ta has been corrected through the use of eq 8 by morbidelli et al 2017 note that all corrections deriving from these equations for which the average underestimation error become less than 1 are neglected in the second approach of stochastic type a more complex procedure has been adopted each single deterministic error e may be considered as an exponentially distributed random variable with a probability density function dependent on a mean value that is linked with the ratio ta d the choice of the exponential distribution perfectly coherent with papalexiou et al 2016 derives from the performance comparison in terms of pearson s chi square test of the more common statistical distributions furthermore the random variable e is demonstrated to have an inverse correlation with the corresponding rainfall depth for each hd series that contains a defined number of underestimated values 1000 realizations of the random variable e with the required characteristics exponential pdf and mean value achievable through eq 8 by morbidelli et al 2017 were first generated and then used to correct the underestimated hd respecting the inverse correlation between errors and rainfall depths independently from the adopted test least squares linear trend analysis mann kendall spearman sen to provide an overall representation of the random e effect a monte carlo technique has been used papalexiou et al 2016 more specifically when a series of n annual maximum rainfall depths h d i i 1 n of assigned d obtained from data characterized by coarse ta has to be corrected with a stochastic approach these steps could be followed 1 the parameter of the exponential distribution function equal to the inverse of the ea achievable with eq 8 by morbidelli et al 2017 has to be quantified 2 a set of underestimation errors e i i 1 n respecting the probability density function of point 1 has to be generated 3 each generated e i value has to be combined with a specific uncorrected h d i on the basis of the inverse correlation between these quantities 4 each h d i has to be corrected in accordance with the following equation 4 h d i c o r r h d i u n c o r r 1 e i i 1 n where h d i c o r r and h d i u n c o r r are the corrected and uncorrected h d i values respectively 5 steps 2 3 and 4 have to be repeated 1000 times as is well known homogeneity tests may be used to identify modifications to observational practices station relocations and changes in measuring techniques e g kendon et al 2018 in principle homogeneity tests may also be able to detect the existence of anomalies in hd series due to the use of rainfall data characterized by temporal aggregations that change over time to this aim we use two different methods the standard normal homogeneity test snht for a single break point alexandersson 1986 and the pettitt test pettitt 1979 both tests consider that the hd values are independent and identically distributed under the alternative hypothesis both tests assume that an evident break with a specific temporal position is present most studies recommend to make homogeneity tests in a relative way by using one or more neighboring stations that are supposedly homogeneous peterson et al 1998 but there are cases where the homogeneity analysis may be only performed through absolute tests which use the single station series under investigation in our study area all rain gauges changed their recording systems from paper rolls characterized by ta 1 h to data logger able to register each tip time within the same decade 1985 1995 so relative testing is pointless therefore the mathematical formulations of the snht and pettitt tests whose detailed descriptions may be found in alexandersson 1986 and pettitt 1979 have been here performed in their absolute declination wijngaard et al 2003 4 results and discussion 4 1 annual maximum rainfall depth series for each station to quantify the maximum number of hd series we considered all existing rainfall data in recent years mainly since 1992 it is possible to obtain rainfall data recorded in data loggers for each tip time associated with a fixed rainfall depth no more than 0 2 mm in this case each rainfall event was summarized by aggregating the number of tips over a ta equal to 1 min nevertheless for long time series a considerable amount of rainfall data were available with hourly recording system as a consequence of the paper rolls adoption furthermore in the absence of other possibilities daily information derived from observation made each day at 9 00 a m was used an example of the available hd series carried out is shown in table 2 for città di castello rain gauge station where for d 1 h there are 27 values 53 of the total placed in the period 1921 1991 characterized by ta d 1 and consequently with single underestimation errors up to 50 and average error equal to 11 morbidelli et al 2017 for all analyses carried out in this paper 60 hd time series obtained considering 6 different durations 1 h 3 h 6 h 12 h 24 h and 48 h and the 10 longest record rain gauge stations reported in table 1 were selected 4 2 least squares linear trend analysis as a first test we fitted a least squares linear trend to the annual maxima for 6 durations at 10 stations 60 datasets for the uncorrected hd series the number of positive least squares linear trends equal to 28 barely outnumbers the negative ones equal to 27 see values in bold in table 3 opposing results were obtained for the corrected hd series independent from the deterministic or stochastic approach adopted in fact after corrections cases with negative least square linear trends become equal to 36 and 34 for the deterministic and stochastic approaches respectively whereas the positive ones become in both cases 22 in table 3 see values with normal and italic characters for the deterministic and stochastic approaches respectively the comparison of the two corrected values in table 3 shows that the approaches used to correct the hd underestimation produce quite equivalent results see also fig 4 since this similarity has been always observed independently by the considered test hereinafter it will only be considered the distinction between uncorrected and corrected series table 3 clearly shows that corrections of hd values produce significant effects on the least square linear trends especially for series characterized by durations 1 h and 24 h in which the probability of the presence of values with ta d 1 is particularly high figs 5 and 6 show a comparison between uncorrected and corrected annual maximum rainfall depths observed at umbertide for durations 1 h and 24 h respectively it can be seen that the uncorrected series show a positive trend figs 5 a and 6 a while the correct series linear trends are negative figs 5 b and 6 b neither of trends in fig 5 and 6 are significant but they are anyway important in terms of general trend evaluation note that when the objective is a definition of a specific climatic trend missing data may be crucial in these cases it is very important to work with a continuous period of data or to infill the missing information however in this paper the objective was the comparison between uncorrected and corrected hd series in our opinion possible missing data each time series analyzed here includes all data from the last 25 30 years and except for the period of the second world war the few other years with missing data have occurred randomly do not influence the aforementioned comparison because they are in series uncorrected and corrected regarding the influence of climatic change on heavy rainfalls from the results of table 3 it is very difficult to find a clear indication on the relationship between trends and geographic position altitude above sea level and mean annual rainfall characteristics of each station actually all selected stations in the north of the region città di castello gualdo tadino gubbio and umbertide evidenced a prevailing positive trend despite their non homogeneous altitude in fact two of them are characterized by a significant value of altitude for gualdo tadino equal to 599 m a s l and for gubbio equal to 471 m a s l whereas two by a relatively low value città di castello and umbertide both around 300 m a s l instead in the south of the region almost all the stations except orvieto and terni evidenced negative trends 4 3 non parametric mann kendall test and spearman rank correlation test to release from the assumption of a linear trend the analysis of the 60 time series was successively performed by the non parametric mann kendall mann 1945 kendall 1975 and the spearman rank correlation khaliq et al 2009 tests which are frequently used to detect trends in heavy rainfall fu et al 2004 houssos and bartzokas 2006 ramos and martinez casasnovas 2006 su et al 2006 fatichi and caporali 2009 rashid et al 2015 for the uncorrected series by using for both tests a significance level equal to 0 05 the percentage without significant trends is always the same independent of the adopted test more specifically for both tests this percentage is higher than 93 with 2 series spoleto station with rainfall durations 24 h and 48 h characterized by a negative trend and 2 series gubbio station with rainfall durations 1 h and 24 h by a positive trend instead after the correction the mann kendall and the spearman rank correlation tests evidenced 3 cases with a negative trend and no positive case in addition to the hd series for spoleto station with d 24 and 48 h also that of todi with d 1 h becomes characterized by a negative trend it is interesting to note that in this last case the least square linear trend was negative also before the correction with eq 3 with slope of the linear regressions equal to 0 05 mm year however as shown in fig 7 after the correction the negative trend became exacerbated slope of the linear regression equal to 0 12 mm year finally it is evident that in the transition from uncorrected to corrected hd series the application of the mann kendall and the spearman rank correlation tests produce different results particularly when d 1 or 24 h where as specified above the probability of the presence of values with ta d 1 is particularly high 4 4 sen s slope method the sen s innovative method sen 2012 has been recently adopted in many analyses sonali and kumar 2013 guclu 2016 oztopal and sen 2016 guclu et al 2018 guclu 2018 especially for a comparison with classical methods it is based on the realization of two ordered sub series in ascending order and offers the following advantages 1 the chance to show visual results on the graph and 2 the possibility to consider five trend types monotonic increasing and decreasing non monotonic increasing and decreasing and no trend conditions instead of the usual three types monotonic increasing and decreasing and no trend condition similarly to what already emerged using the most classic methodologies also the adoption of the sen s method produces different results when applied to the uncorrected and corrected annual maximum rainfall depths series as an example fig 8 shows the application of the method for both the uncorrected and corrected hd series observed at todi considering d 1 h as it can be seen in fig 8 a the uncorrected series shows a no trend condition because all values are close to 1 1 line while in fig 8 b the correct series evidences a clear monotonic decreasing trend details on the results interpretation can be found in sen 2012 4 5 series length the above results show that temporal aggregation of rainfall data can have a significant role in the analysis of the effects of climatic change on extreme rainfall intensities in principle this problem could be solved by using only rainfall data available with temporal aggregation of 1 min however for most geographical areas historical data with ta 1 min are available only for the last 20 30 years fig 9 shows that exhaustive results in terms of linear regression can be obtained by using at least 60 years of data in addition when only the most recent 20 40 years of data are used the risk of misleading results is very high as a consequence series derived from rainfall data with ta 1 min in every part of the world characterized by lengths of up to 30 years can never be used furthermore as shown in fig 10 in some cases the more recent values f i observed in the last 10 years when compared to those of the entire period can provide different indications of change based on whether the series are corrected or uncorrected it may be concluded that there is no climatic index or test that can be usefully conducted on hd series composed of values resulting from years with rainfall data characterized by ta 1 min because their length is too short for example using these short series in the 60 cases selected here of length up to 25 years the non parametric test of mann kendall offers different results from those previously discussed showing no trend for 58 cases an increasing trend for gualdo tadino station with d 24 h and a decreasing trend for città di castello station with d 3 h 4 6 homogeneity tests the standard normal homogeneity test snht for a single break point alexandersson 1986 and the pettitt test pettitt 1979 were applied to the 60 hd series considered in their uncorrected form where the inhomogeneity due to the use of rainfall data with coarse temporal aggregation should be evident however break conditions detected with both absolute tests were very limited and never simultaneous 8 and 7 cases for snht and pettitt tests respectively furthermore detected inhomogeneities could not be justified by metadata and not even by changes in the recording practice with a significant modification of rainfall temporal aggregation as an example fig 11 shows the annual maximum rainfall depths for d 24 h at città di castello station with a clear indication of the 1991 1992 change in rainfall temporal aggregation from 24 h to 1 min see also table 2 therefore hd values in the period 1921 1991 should be strongly underestimated up to 50 while successive years are correctly determined despite the existence of a discontinuity localized in the years 1991 1992 the two tests suggest possible breaks in 1927 snht and 1948 pettitt this suggests that the detection of breaks in hd series due to inhomogeneities for coarse rainfall time aggregation is not possible because this inhomogeneity even when very evident cannot produce sufficiently large break points to be detectible this confirms that if the standard deviation of the considered variable is significantly high as in the precipitation case then the probability that inhomogeneity will escape detection increases wijngaard et al 2003 5 conclusions historical rainfall data are available with different temporal aggregations within the range 1 min 24 h linked to the progress of recording systems through time therefore in many geographical areas of the world long annual maximum rainfall depth series can become inhomogeneous because characterized by a percentage of values obtained from coarse data generally old data involving the problem of underestimation and another percentage derived from continuous data recorded more recently in principle this may affect subsequent analyses including those which aim to examine the effect of climate change on extreme event intensities and frequencies however by using the mathematical relation recently proposed by morbidelli et al 2017 between average underestimation error and the ratio ta d each hd value may be corrected obtaining quasi homogeneous hd series which can then be reassessed for trends over time the main objective of this paper was to evaluate whether the underestimation errors of the hd due to the availability of coarse temporal aggregation data significantly affect the most common methods used to evaluate trend signals in intense rainfall without considering specific analyses on the possible limits of the adopted trend tests and the stationary non stationary characteristics of the selected time series the major findings and conclusions of this study conducted over 10 long record high resolution rain gauges using data for 1921 2015 and based on the comparison of the results obtained with both corrected and uncorrected series are the following the underestimation errors due to coarse ta produce significant effects on the least squares linear trend analysis of the hd values in fact since a prevalence of increasing and decreasing trends for uncorrected and corrected series respectively was observed it is obvious that the correction can change the sign of the trend the correction of the hd values performed with both deterministic and stochastic approaches produces more evident effects for series where the probability of the presence of values with ta d 1 is particularly high d 1 h and d 24 h the non parametric mann kendall test and the spearman rank correlation test both with a significance level 0 05 are less sensitive than the least squares linear trend to corrections of the hd values for both tests using the 60 uncorrected time series selected in this paper only 2 cases are characterized by a negative trend and 2 cases by a positive one after the hd corrections cases with negative trends become 3 and there are no cases with positive trend also the adoption of the innovative sen s method produces different results when applied to the uncorrected and corrected annual maximum rainfall depths series the hypothetical solution to consider only rainfall data with ta 1 min is not possible because in most geographical areas these data exist only for the last 2 3 decades while trend identification requires at least 60 years of data due to the effect of large scale climate oscillations at multi decadal time scales the existence of anomalies in the hd series due to the different temporal aggregations of rainfall data cannot be detected by common homogeneity tests because any consequent discontinuity even when very evident does not produce sufficiently large break points at least for the annual maximum series acknowledgment the authors

738,a conceptual model is presented for non newtonian fluid flow in a rough channel representing a single fracture the fluid rheology is described via a truncated power law tpl model approximating the carreau constitutive equation while the aperture variation along the channel is modeled via a stochastic distribution of assigned mean and variance the log normal and gamma distributions are considered together with a deterministic variation of sinusoidal behavior the flow rate in a fracture subject to an external pressure gradient is derived under the lubrication approximation for the two limiting cases of a pressure gradient which is i perpendicular and ii parallel to aperture variation these parallel and serial arrangements pa or sa provide an upper and lower bound to the fracture conductance different combinations of the parameters describing the fluid rheology and the variability of the aperture field are considered for a sensitivity analysis results are also compared with those valid for a pure power law pl fluid which provides a relevant benchmark the channel flow rate shows a direct inverse dependency upon aperture variability for pa sa the difference in flow rate between the pl and tpl models is positively affected by aperture variability and pressure gradient negatively affected by flow behaviour index while its sign is positive or negative depending on pa sa the influence of the specific pdf adopted for the aperture field is moderate an increasing function of aperture variability and depends on the third and fourth moment of the distribution the conductance for a deterministic aperture variation exhibits the same trends as a stochastic variation with differences from the latter depending on aperture variability and flow arrangement keywords fracture non newtonian truncated power law aperture variation lubrication theory 1 introduction hydraulic fracturing is largely used for optimal exploitation of oil gas and thermal reservoirs non newtonian fluids are most frequently used in this type of operations boronin et al 2015 linkov 2014 the challenge of modeling flow of these rheologically complex fluids is compounded by the possible interaction of multiple non newtonian fluids morris et al 2015 complex fluids interact with pre existing rock fractures also during drilling operations huang et al 2011 ozdemirtas et al 2010 enhanced oil recovery auradou et al 2008 and environmental remediation and other natural phenomena such as magma intrusions sand intrusions and mud volcanoes see medina et al 2015 medina et al 2015 and references therein hence it is important to model non newtonian flow in fractured media a first step in this process is a detailed understanding of flow in a single fracture as the space between fracture walls termed fracture aperture is typically spatially variable adler et al 2002 a large bibliography exists on newtonian flow in single variable aperture fractures neuzil and tracy 1981 and tsang and tsang 1987 adopted a one dimensional channel model with channels described by an aperture density distribution and a spatial correlation length other authors moreno et al 1988 tsang 1984 tsang and tsang 1989 tsang et al 1988 extended the model to two dimensional spatial variability of assigned correlation function while other studies brown 1987 mourzenko et al 2001 talon et al 2010 yan and koplik 2008 simulated the fracture surface roughness using fractal models of surface topography comprehensive reviews on flow in a single fracture were provided in zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 adler and thovert 1999 berkowitz 2002 and sahimi 2011 ultimately stochastic modeling of aperture variability at the single fracture scale leads to determination of the flow rate under a given pressure gradient as a function of the parameters describing the variability of the aperture field and the fluid rheological behaviour from the flow rate a flow or hydraulic aperture can then be derived silliman 1989 a second equivalent aperture can be defined for transport and usually differs from the hydraulic aperture tsang 1992 the equivalent flow aperture for flow of non newtonian fluids of power law nature in single variable aperture fractures has been obtained with an heuristic approach by di federico for a stochastic variation of assigned distribution di federico 1998 and for deterministic variations di federico 1997 2001 detailed numerical modeling of flow of a power law fluid in a variable aperture fracture was performed by lavrov 2013b 2014 whose work demonstrated that pronounced channelization effects are associated to a nonlinear fluid rheology a further study by lavrov 2013a validated the simplified model of di federico 1997 the availability of an equivalent flow aperture as a function of the parameters describing the fluid rheology and the aperture variability is enticing as it allows taking their interaction into account when modeling flow in fracture networks at a larger scale neuman 2005 bingham fluid flow in a variable aperture channel was studied analytically and numerically by roustaei et al 2016 highlightning the progressive departure from the lubrication approximation with increasing heterogeneity the onset of fouling layers and the existence of a limiting pressure gradient another relevant issue in non newtonian fracture flow is the rheological nature of the fluid the constitutive model routinely used for hydro fracturing modeling is the simple two parameter power law perkowska et al 2016 yet this model does not characterize real fluids at low and high shear rates as it implies for shear thinning fluids an apparent viscosity which becomes unbounded for zero shear rate and tends to zero for infinite shear rate on the contrary the four parameter carreau constitutive equation includes asymptotic values of the apparent viscosity at those limits lavrov 2015 showed the carreau rheological equation is well approximated by the truncated power law model and suggested to adopt the latter model for numerical modeling of flow in variable aperture fractures to this end he derived the expressions for flow of a truncated power law fluid between parallel walls under a constant pressure gradient a method to predict the flow of yield stress fluids described by a herschel bulkley model and of shear thinning fluids without yield stress described by carreau model through rough fractures was recently proposed and experimentally validated rodríguez de castro and radilla 2016 2017 this paper extends the adoption of the truncated power law model to fractures of variable aperture in a stochastic or deterministic fashion with the aim of understanding the joint influence of rheology and aperture spatial variability in a simplified geometrical setup where the variability is confined to one direction looking at the two limit cases where the aperture variability is either parallel or perpendicular to the flow direction this assumption which admittedly simplifies the real flow field aims at providing reference benchmarks to be compared with more complex simulations section 2 summarizes results on flow of a truncated power law fluid between parallel walls section 3 presents the general expressions of the flow rate for flow perpendicular and parallel to aperture variation section 4 deals with a stochastic aperture variation and illustrates results stemming from the adoption of two different pdfs for the aperture distribution lognormal and gamma section 5 applies the same simplified methodology to a deterministic aperture variation of sinusoidal behaviour then results obtained for the truncated model are compared with those earlier obtained for pure power law fluids section 6 reports some conclusions 2 flow of truncated power law fluid flow in a constant aperture fracture consider the flow of a shear thinning non newtonian fluid in a fracture of length l width w and constant aperture b the coordinate system is shown in figs 1 a b the fracture walls are at z b 2 and z b 2 suppose a uniform positive pressure gradient p x p 0 p l l is applied in the x direction assuming that b w the velocity components in the y and z directions are zero and the only nonzero velocity component vx is solely a function of z the fluid is described by the rheological truncated power law model reading in the simple shear situation described above τ μ a γ with τ shear stress and γ shear rate the apparent viscosity μa is given by 1 μ a μ 0 for γ γ 1 μ a m γ n 1 for γ 1 γ γ 2 μ a μ for γ γ 2 in eq 1 depicted in fig 1c μ 0 is the viscosity at zero shear rate μ is the limiting viscosity for γ n and m are the rheological and consistency index respectively γ 1 m μ 0 1 1 n is the lower shear rate at which the high viscosity cutoff μ 0 is introduced and γ 2 m μ 1 1 n is the higher shear rate at which the low viscosity cutoff μ is introduced the above four parameter model is identical to the pure power law model of parameters n and m in the intermediate shear stress range γ 1 γ γ 2 and overcomes the limitation of having μa for γ 0 and μa 0 for γ lavrov 2015 showed that the truncated power law model is practically indistinguishable for practical purposes from the carreau model he also derived the velocity field vx z and the flow rate per unit width q x q x w under a constant pressure gradient px depending on the aperture value the flow rate can take three different expressions namely 2a q x i b b 3 p x 12 μ 0 f o r b b 1 2 μ 0 γ 1 p x 2b q x i i b 2 1 n m 3 1 n 3

2a 2c 2c three flow regimes i low shear rate regime ii intermediate shear rate regime and iii high shear rate regime are possible within the fracture depending on the relationship between its aperture b and the two threshold apertures b 1 and b 2 3 flow in a variable aperture channel in single fracture flow modeling the fracture aperture b x y is usually taken to vary as a two dimensional spatially homogeneous and correlated random field characterized by a probability density function f b of given mean b and variance σ b 2 and possibly spatial correlation described by an aperture autocovariance function of given integral scale i or integral scales ix and iy in the anisotropic case alternatively a fractal distribution of given hurst coefficient h and correlated at all scales is adopted if an anisotropic aperture field of anisotropy ratio e i y i x is considered the two limiting cases e 0 and e give rise to a purely one dimensional aperture variation consequently flow under an external pressure gradient can be considered to take place either transverse case 1 fig 2 a or parallel to aperture variability case 2 fig 2b this approach was used for newtonian flow by silliman silliman 1989 to infer estimates of 2 d hydraulic and transport apertures by zimmerman zimmerman et al 1991 to determine the hydraulic aperture under deterministic sinusoidal variations and by di federico di federico 1997 1998 to derive estimates of hydraulic aperture for non newtonian power law flow under both deterministic and stochastic aperture variations respectively lavrov 2013a validated the approach with two dimensional numerical simulations conducted for a deterministic sinusoidal aperture profile in both directions comparison of his results with the geometric average of flow rates for one dimensional sinusoidal variations only along and only across the flow cases 1 and 2 respectively but with a sinusoidal variation see section 5 showed a relative discrepancy in terms of equivalent aperture equal to less than 10 for δ 0 4 δ being the non dimensional amplitude of the aperture variation in the sequel we consider first case 1 then case 2 3 1 flow parallel to constant aperture channels consider a fracture of dimensions l and w in the x and y direction respectively and aperture varying only in the y direction consider flow in the direction x parallel to constant aperture channels i e transverse to aperture variation case 1 fig 2a the applied pressure gradient is p x p 0 p l l the volumetric flux is obtained through the following procedure the fracture model is discretized into n neighboring parallel channels each having equal width δ y w n length l and constant aperture bi depending on the local aperture value in each channel the flow regime is either i or ii or iii and the corresponding flow rate per unit width is given either by 2a 2b or 2c the number of channels in each regime is ni nii niii respectively and the total width of the channels in each regime is wi wii wiii with n n i n i i n i i i and w w i w i i w i i i the i th channel in each regime j j i i i i i i has width w j i w j n j assuming that the shear between neighboring channels and the drag against the connecting walls may be neglected the total flow rate in the x direction is 3 q x i 1 n i q i b i w i i i 1 n i i q i i b i w i i i i 1 n i i i q i i i b i w i i i i this assumption is acceptable for channels with a smooth variation of the aperture i e with a smooth variation of the flow rate along the y direction otherwise a linear momentum sharing between the neighbouring channels due to tangential stress in the x z plane is expected taking the limit as nj the width of each channel tends to zero and the discrete aperture variation to a continuous one then under ergodicity and exploiting the previous relationships 3 gives for the flow rate per unit width in the x direction the expression 4 q x q x w i i p x 12 μ 0 p i i 2 1 n m 3 1 n 3 2 n 1 μ 0 2 n 1 1

consider now flow in the y direction perpendicular to constant aperture channels i e parallel to aperture variation case 2 fig 2b the fracture length is w and the applied pressure gradient is p y p 0 p w w while l is the fracture width perpendicular to gradient discretizing the fracture model into n cells of equal length δ y w n in series each cell has width l and constant aperture bi by virtue of mass conservation volumetric flux qy through each cell is the same depending on the local aperture value in each channel the flow regime is either i or ii or iii and the corresponding flow rate per unit width q y q y l is given respectively by the counterparts of eqs 2a 2b or 2c upon substitution of the subscript x with the subscript y this is so neglecting the pressure losses due to the succession of constrictions and enlargements the number of cells in each regime is ni nii niii respectively and the total length of the cells in each regime is wi wii wiii with n n i n i i n i i i and

albeit numerically the flow rate per unit width as a function of the applied pressure gradient and problem parameters as done in 4 for channels in parallel an alternative formulation of the problem using the same formalism adopted for flow parallel to constant aperture channel is presented in appendix a and leads to the same results 4 estimate of flow rate and discussion different distributions are adopted for the aperture field consistently with earlier work on flow and transport in variable aperture fractures moreno et al 1988 tsang et al 1988 in the following i lognormal and ii gamma distribution are considered the latter covering for values of the parameter d 3 4 also the normal case 4 1 lognormal distribution lognormal distributions for the aperture field were adopted by moreno et al 1988 and tsang et al 1988 its probability distribution function is given by 9 f b 1 b σ 2 π exp ln b ln b g 2 2 σ 2 where b g b exp σ 2 2 is the geometric mean b the arithmetic mean and σ 2 the variance of ln b utilizing eqs 4 5 with eq 6 gives for the factors i j j i i i i i i and p j j i i i i i the following expressions 10 i i b 3 2 exp 3 σ 2 1 erf 1 2 σ ln b 1 b 5 σ 2 2 i i i b 2 n 1 n 2

m and n i e for case 1 12 q x p l n 2 n 1 p x 2 n 1 m 1 n b 2 n 1 n exp 2 n 1 n 1 σ 2 2 n 2 and for case 2 13 q y p l n 2 n 1 p y 2 n 1 m 1 n b 2 n 1 n exp 2 n 1 n 1 σ 2 n in fig 3 flow rate and apparent viscosity versus the pressure gradient are depicted for lognormal aperture distribution and flow perpendicular to aperture variation case 1 the contribution of each single flow regime is also represented in order to quantify their influence on the total flow rate the presence of three possible flow regime i e i low shear rate ii mid shear rate and iii high shear rate allows us to understand why for a certain value of pressure gradient the two models sensibly differ clearly qx q x pl for μ 0 and μ 0 a similar behavior occurs for different aperture distibutions and direction of flow rate case 2 the different trends between qx and q x pl are showed in figs 4 a 4 f for lognormal distribution and case 1 with n 0 3 0 5 0 6 μ 0 0 5 pa s μ 0 001 pa s and m 0 005 pa s n figs 4a 4 b and 4 c depict qx and q x pl versus px for fixed σ 0 3 figs 4d 4 e 4 f do so versus σ for fixed p x 50 pa m 1 it is seen that the flow rate for the truncated model is always decidedly smaller than that associated with the pure power law except at very low gradient pressure where the opposite is true the difference between the two increases as the external pressure gradient and aperture variability become larger or sufficiently small increasing the rheological parameter n the difference between the truncated power law and pure power law model reduces in fig 4a the truncated power law model compared with the pure power law model for a fluid with n 0 3 exhibits all flow regimes here it is possible to observe a very small low shear rate regime for lower values of pressure gradient a mid shear rate where the two models perfectly match and a high shear rate regime with a lower slope than the pure power law model figs 4b and 4 c depict the same behavior for different fluids respectively with n 0 5 0 6 in these configurations the low shear rate regime is not present while the high shear rate regime is reached for higher values of pressure gradient and the difference between the models is less marked figs 4d 4 e and 4 f show how aperture variability σ influences the flow rate for a given pressure gradient px and different fluids for both models the flow rate increases with σ as the parallel arrangement emphasizes the importance of large aperture channels asssociated with a larger variability the truncated model has decidedly smaller flow rates than the pure power law the difference between the two models decreases as n increases until for n 0 6 the difference is very small and the two models provide identical results in a large range of aperture variability fig 5 shows instead the variation of flow rate with respect to pressure gradient for case 2 serial arrangement and both the truncated and pure power law models fig 5a highlights the behavior of flow rate versus pressure gradient for n 0 3 0 5 0 6 and fixed σ 0 5 here a monotonic increasing behavior occurs with a perfect match between truncated and pure power law model for low values of pressure gradient for higher values of the gradient the truncated model presents a lower slope with respect to the pure power law but this difference is less marked as n increases in particular the truncated model assumes almost the same values irrespective of the type of fluid for high gradient values the truncated model has a lower flow rate than the pure power law like in case 1 overall the difference between the two models strongly depends on the type of fluid as noted for case 1 fig 5b depicts the influence of aperture variability for σ 0 1 to 0 5 and fixed n 0 3 for lower values of pressure gradient the truncated and pure power law model perfectly match in particular for small values of aperture variability for higher values of pressure gradient the slope for the truncated model is still lower than the pure power law as in case 1 for both truncated and pure power law the flow rate decreases with increasing aperture variability as the serial arrangement emphasizes the importance of small apertures 4 2 gamma distribution a gamma distribution was adopted by moreno et al 1988 to reproduce the migration of contaminated water in fractured rock in the context of a capillary tube model and by tsang et al 1988 for one dimensional channels its probability distribution function is given by 14 f b 1 γ d b d 1 b g d exp b b g with the two parameters bg geometric mean and d for larger values of d the gamma distribution tends to the normal one the arithmetic mean and the variance of b are given by b b g d σ b 2 b g 2 d b 2 d utilizing eqs 4 5 with eq 6 gives for the factors pii piii and i j j i i i i i i the following expressions 15 i i b 3 γ d d 3 γ d 3 d b 1 b i i i b 2 n 1 n γ d d 2 n 1 n γ d 2 n 1 n d b 1 b γ d 2 n 1 n d b 2 b i i i i b 3 γ d d 3 γ d 3 d b 2 b 16 p i i 1 γ d γ d d b 1 b γ d d b 2 b p i i i 1 γ d γ d d b 2 b where γ z 0 e t t z 1 d t is the gamma function γ α x 0 x e t t α 1 d t γ x γ α x the lower incomplete gamma function and γ α x x e t t α 1 d t the upper incomplete gamma function the expression of the flow rate given by eq 4 with eqs 12 and 13 is compared with that of a pure power law qpl fluid of parameters m and n di federico 1998 i e for case 1 17 q x p l n 2 n 1 p x 2 n 1 m 1 n b d 2 n 1 n γ d 2 n 1 n γ d while for case 2 18 q y p l n 2 n 1 p y 2 n 1 m 1 n b d 2 n 1 n γ d γ d 2 n 1 1 n the latter expression is valid only for d 2 n 1 figs 6 and 7 depict the comparison between the truncated and pure power law models drawn for both lognormal and gamma distributions for case 1 and case 2 respectively here the two distributions are characterized by the same first two moments in particular the parameter d of the gamma distribution is derived by the variance of ln b σ previously converted in σb i e tsang et al 1988 19 σ b 2 b 2 exp ln 10 σ 2 1 the two distributions differ only by the third and fourth moment for σ 0 1 the skewness is 0 47 for gamma distribution and 0 30 for lognormal while kurtosis is 3 32 for gamma and 3 16 for lognormal distribution for σ 0 2 the skewness is 0 97 for gamma distribution and 0 61 for lognormal while kurtosis is 4 42 for gamma and 3 68 for lognormal distribution fig 6 drawn for the parallel arrangement shows that the models with the two different distributions and with tpl have a similar trend the slope of the q x p x relationship for the truncated model for both distributions is lower compared with the pure power law for high and low values of pressure gradient the lognormal distribution consistently shows a lower flow rate than the gamma distribution for the same pressure gradient and aperture variability due to the differences in the distribution shape the difference in flow rate between distributions increases with increasing aperture variability fig 7 drawn for the serial arrangement shows that for the same values of pressure gradient the pure power law model for lognormal distribution has a higher flow rate than the gamma distribution both for σ 0 1 and σ 0 2 for intermediate pressure gradient all distributions show a good agreement of the flow rate for the truncated power law and for the pure power law model again the differences between the power law and the truncated power law models become evident whenever the flow rate is in the regime controlled by the high and the low shear rate plateaus 5 deterministic aperture variation we consider a constant aperture with a sinusoidal perturbation as rough walled fracture di federico 1997 zimmerman et al 1991 as depicted in fig 8 20 b y b 1 δ sin 2 π y λ where b is the mean aperture δ is the magnitude of the roughness and λ is the wavelength of the aperture oscillations upon comparing the limiting aperture values b 1 b 2 for a given pressure gradient separating the different flow regimes for the truncated power law model and the minimum mean and maximum aperture values b min b 1 δ b and b max b 1 δ it is seen that ten possible combinations arise as reported in table 1 the standard deviation of the aperture distribution σb is related to the parameter δ by 21 σ b δ b 2 in the following we compare the behavior in terms of flow rate for a given value of the pressure gradient of a deterministic and stochastic aperture variation both for flow parallel to constant aperture channels case 1 and flow perpendicular to constant aperture channels case 2 the lognormal distribution is adopted for the stochastic variation hence the quantities ii iii and iiii and pii and piii are those reported in eqs 10 and 11 the same quantities evaluated for the deterministic variation are listed in tables 2 and 3 of appendix b for all the possible combinations presented in table 1 in fig 9 a for case 1 a fluid with rheology index n 0 5 is considered the roughness is taken to be δ 0 2 and the same variance is considered for both types of variation the flow rate increases with the pressure gradient and the agreement between deterministic and stochastic model is good the comparison between the two models for case 1 is also shown as a function of σ in fig 9b for n 0 5 and p x 30 pa m 1 here the deterministic model tends to predict higher values of the flow rate qx than the stochastic approach for increasing values of log aperture standard deviation fig 10 a depicts the comparison between deterministic and stochastic aperture variation for case 2 with n 0 3 and δ 0 2 it is seen that the stochastic variation tends to overestimate the flow rate for increasing pressure gradient while for lower values of px the agreement between the two models is quite good this trend in confirmed by fig 10b drawn for p x 0 5 pa m 1 where the deterministic model returns flow rates increasingly lower than the stochastic as σ increases 6 discussion and conclusions we derived analytical models for flow of non newtonian fluids in uneven channels simulating natural or artificial rock fractures our approach couples a four parameter rheological model the truncated power law tpl with a stochastic variation of the aperture field along a 1 d channel according to a generic probability distribution function pdf three different cases are considered including a deterministic variation of sinusoidal shape starting from the solution valid for tpl parallel plate flow which incorporates three possible flow regimes the conductance of the channel is determined as a function of rheological fluid parameters geometry and the pdf of the aperture distribution two limit cases providing an upper and lower bound to the flow rate under an assigned pressure gradient are considered the parallel pa and serial sa arrangements corresponding respectively to an external pressure gradient perpendicular or parallel to aperture variation results for the simpler two parameter power law pl rheological model provide the benchmark to discern the impact of the adoption of a more realistic rheological model on the conductance on one hand the parallel arrangement emphasizes the importance of large aperture channels here the tpl has a smaller conductance than the pl the difference increasing with aperture variability and pressure gradient and decreasing with flow behavior index on the other hand small apertures along the channels play a crucial role in the serial arrangement here results for the tpl and pl agree for intermediate gradients and differ for larger smaller ones when the conductance of the tpl is lower higher than the pl the differences between tpl and pl again increase with aperture variability and decrease with flow behavior index the impact of the specific pdf adopted for the aperture variation is moderate with the first two moments being equal the difference in conductance is an increasing function of aperture variability and depends on the third and fourth moment of the distribution specifically higher values of skewness and kurtosis imply a smaller conductance for the parallel and a larger conductance for the serial arrangement when a deterministic sinusoidal aperture variation is considered all trends valid for stochastic variations are confirmed differences in conductance with stochastic aperture variation increase with pressure gradient and aperture variability and are of opposite sign depending on the aperture arrangement our model reveals the coupled effect of aperture heterogeneity and a realistic rheological equation for non newtonian fluid flow in rock fractures a topic of interest in hydraulic fracturing drilling eor and environmental modelling and remediation the relevance of rheological properties of real fluids and of the stochastic nature of the fractures suggest a more in depth analysis of the coupling effects polymer flooding is often used for eor since the addition of polymers to the injected brine favors an improved sweep a reduction of fingering with a more stable displacement whilst eor polymers in a rheometer display newtonian and shear thinning behaviour approximated by a tpl relationship in the field polymers show a quite complex behavior partially captured in the present model dictated by the flow geometry driven by fractures networks recovery mechanism in fractured reservoirs carbonate reservoirs usually are extensively fractured but show a low porosity is strongly influenced by the fractures which show a well different transmissivity than the matrix and carry most of the flow limiting a large differential pressure and the efficiency of recovery the nature of the fluid and the characteristics of the fractures counteract this negative aspect as a matter of evidence the tpl fluids show a reduction increment of flow rate at high low shear rates for a given pressure gradient with respect to the pl fluids the relevance of this reduction increment and its onset are controlled by the newtonian plateaus and by the fractures parameters mainly the average and the variance of the aperture of the fractures results suggest to investigate further this coupling expanding the investigation to two dimensional modeling of the aperture variation inclusion of local pressure losses and adoption of yield stress rheological models or more complex models a further element adding complexity to the model is shear thickening behaviour due to elongation of the polymer molecules typical of flow in capillary tubes with a sharp contraction nguyen and kausch 1992 at large flow rates depending on the fractures characteristics an elongational contribution adds up to the total pressure drop showing a shear thickening effect which can be included in the present model appendix a alternative formulation for serial configuration the pressure gradient can be estimated as the inverse of eqs 2 2c we notice that while for a given pressure gradient the condition b b 1 and b 1 b b 2

the inverse functions for the low shear regime p y i q y i 1 and the high shear regime p y i i i q y i i i 1 can be found analytically at intermediate regime the inverse function p y i i q y i i 1 can be found analytically only for n 1 2 1 4 1 6 while in general a numerical inversion is requested we notice that for n 1 2 the inverse function has two real valued positive branches this mathematical aspect could bring to hysteretic behaviour of the flow in the fracture with different paths in the space p y q y according to the initial state i a low pressure gradient regime and ii a high pressure gradient regime for the same flow rate however upon introduction of further dissipative effects mainly due to expansion of the troughs the hysteresis should be mitigated and eventually cancelled we will not pursue this aspect which requires an experimental validation and we choose the branch of the inverse function corresponding to the high pressure gradient regime taking the limit as nj the length of each cell tends to zero and the discrete aperture variation to a continuous one then under ergodicity and exploiting the previous relationships eq 7 gives for the mean pressure gradient in

738,a conceptual model is presented for non newtonian fluid flow in a rough channel representing a single fracture the fluid rheology is described via a truncated power law tpl model approximating the carreau constitutive equation while the aperture variation along the channel is modeled via a stochastic distribution of assigned mean and variance the log normal and gamma distributions are considered together with a deterministic variation of sinusoidal behavior the flow rate in a fracture subject to an external pressure gradient is derived under the lubrication approximation for the two limiting cases of a pressure gradient which is i perpendicular and ii parallel to aperture variation these parallel and serial arrangements pa or sa provide an upper and lower bound to the fracture conductance different combinations of the parameters describing the fluid rheology and the variability of the aperture field are considered for a sensitivity analysis results are also compared with those valid for a pure power law pl fluid which provides a relevant benchmark the channel flow rate shows a direct inverse dependency upon aperture variability for pa sa the difference in flow rate between the pl and tpl models is positively affected by aperture variability and pressure gradient negatively affected by flow behaviour index while its sign is positive or negative depending on pa sa the influence of the specific pdf adopted for the aperture field is moderate an increasing function of aperture variability and depends on the third and fourth moment of the distribution the conductance for a deterministic aperture variation exhibits the same trends as a stochastic variation with differences from the latter depending on aperture variability and flow arrangement keywords fracture non newtonian truncated power law aperture variation lubrication theory 1 introduction hydraulic fracturing is largely used for optimal exploitation of oil gas and thermal reservoirs non newtonian fluids are most frequently used in this type of operations boronin et al 2015 linkov 2014 the challenge of modeling flow of these rheologically complex fluids is compounded by the possible interaction of multiple non newtonian fluids morris et al 2015 complex fluids interact with pre existing rock fractures also during drilling operations huang et al 2011 ozdemirtas et al 2010 enhanced oil recovery auradou et al 2008 and environmental remediation and other natural phenomena such as magma intrusions sand intrusions and mud volcanoes see medina et al 2015 medina et al 2015 and references therein hence it is important to model non newtonian flow in fractured media a first step in this process is a detailed understanding of flow in a single fracture as the space between fracture walls termed fracture aperture is typically spatially variable adler et al 2002 a large bibliography exists on newtonian flow in single variable aperture fractures neuzil and tracy 1981 and tsang and tsang 1987 adopted a one dimensional channel model with channels described by an aperture density distribution and a spatial correlation length other authors moreno et al 1988 tsang 1984 tsang and tsang 1989 tsang et al 1988 extended the model to two dimensional spatial variability of assigned correlation function while other studies brown 1987 mourzenko et al 2001 talon et al 2010 yan and koplik 2008 simulated the fracture surface roughness using fractal models of surface topography comprehensive reviews on flow in a single fracture were provided in zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 adler and thovert 1999 berkowitz 2002 and sahimi 2011 ultimately stochastic modeling of aperture variability at the single fracture scale leads to determination of the flow rate under a given pressure gradient as a function of the parameters describing the variability of the aperture field and the fluid rheological behaviour from the flow rate a flow or hydraulic aperture can then be derived silliman 1989 a second equivalent aperture can be defined for transport and usually differs from the hydraulic aperture tsang 1992 the equivalent flow aperture for flow of non newtonian fluids of power law nature in single variable aperture fractures has been obtained with an heuristic approach by di federico for a stochastic variation of assigned distribution di federico 1998 and for deterministic variations di federico 1997 2001 detailed numerical modeling of flow of a power law fluid in a variable aperture fracture was performed by lavrov 2013b 2014 whose work demonstrated that pronounced channelization effects are associated to a nonlinear fluid rheology a further study by lavrov 2013a validated the simplified model of di federico 1997 the availability of an equivalent flow aperture as a function of the parameters describing the fluid rheology and the aperture variability is enticing as it allows taking their interaction into account when modeling flow in fracture networks at a larger scale neuman 2005 bingham fluid flow in a variable aperture channel was studied analytically and numerically by roustaei et al 2016 highlightning the progressive departure from the lubrication approximation with increasing heterogeneity the onset of fouling layers and the existence of a limiting pressure gradient another relevant issue in non newtonian fracture flow is the rheological nature of the fluid the constitutive model routinely used for hydro fracturing modeling is the simple two parameter power law perkowska et al 2016 yet this model does not characterize real fluids at low and high shear rates as it implies for shear thinning fluids an apparent viscosity which becomes unbounded for zero shear rate and tends to zero for infinite shear rate on the contrary the four parameter carreau constitutive equation includes asymptotic values of the apparent viscosity at those limits lavrov 2015 showed the carreau rheological equation is well approximated by the truncated power law model and suggested to adopt the latter model for numerical modeling of flow in variable aperture fractures to this end he derived the expressions for flow of a truncated power law fluid between parallel walls under a constant pressure gradient a method to predict the flow of yield stress fluids described by a herschel bulkley model and of shear thinning fluids without yield stress described by carreau model through rough fractures was recently proposed and experimentally validated rodríguez de castro and radilla 2016 2017 this paper extends the adoption of the truncated power law model to fractures of variable aperture in a stochastic or deterministic fashion with the aim of understanding the joint influence of rheology and aperture spatial variability in a simplified geometrical setup where the variability is confined to one direction looking at the two limit cases where the aperture variability is either parallel or perpendicular to the flow direction this assumption which admittedly simplifies the real flow field aims at providing reference benchmarks to be compared with more complex simulations section 2 summarizes results on flow of a truncated power law fluid between parallel walls section 3 presents the general expressions of the flow rate for flow perpendicular and parallel to aperture variation section 4 deals with a stochastic aperture variation and illustrates results stemming from the adoption of two different pdfs for the aperture distribution lognormal and gamma section 5 applies the same simplified methodology to a deterministic aperture variation of sinusoidal behaviour then results obtained for the truncated model are compared with those earlier obtained for pure power law fluids section 6 reports some conclusions 2 flow of truncated power law fluid flow in a constant aperture fracture consider the flow of a shear thinning non newtonian fluid in a fracture of length l width w and constant aperture b the coordinate system is shown in figs 1 a b the fracture walls are at z b 2 and z b 2 suppose a uniform positive pressure gradient p x p 0 p l l is applied in the x direction assuming that b w the velocity components in the y and z directions are zero and the only nonzero velocity component vx is solely a function of z the fluid is described by the rheological truncated power law model reading in the simple shear situation described above τ μ a γ with τ shear stress and γ shear rate the apparent viscosity μa is given by 1 μ a μ 0 for γ γ 1 μ a m γ n 1 for γ 1 γ γ 2 μ a μ for γ γ 2 in eq 1 depicted in fig 1c μ 0 is the viscosity at zero shear rate μ is the limiting viscosity for γ n and m are the rheological and consistency index respectively γ 1 m μ 0 1 1 n is the lower shear rate at which the high viscosity cutoff μ 0 is introduced and γ 2 m μ 1 1 n is the higher shear rate at which the low viscosity cutoff μ is introduced the above four parameter model is identical to the pure power law model of parameters n and m in the intermediate shear stress range γ 1 γ γ 2 and overcomes the limitation of having μa for γ 0 and μa 0 for γ lavrov 2015 showed that the truncated power law model is practically indistinguishable for practical purposes from the carreau model he also derived the velocity field vx z and the flow rate per unit width q x q x w under a constant pressure gradient px depending on the aperture value the flow rate can take three different expressions namely 2a q x i b b 3 p x 12 μ 0 f o r b b 1 2 μ 0 γ 1 p x 2b q x i i b 2 1 n m 3 1 n 3

2a 2c 2c three flow regimes i low shear rate regime ii intermediate shear rate regime and iii high shear rate regime are possible within the fracture depending on the relationship between its aperture b and the two threshold apertures b 1 and b 2 3 flow in a variable aperture channel in single fracture flow modeling the fracture aperture b x y is usually taken to vary as a two dimensional spatially homogeneous and correlated random field characterized by a probability density function f b of given mean b and variance σ b 2 and possibly spatial correlation described by an aperture autocovariance function of given integral scale i or integral scales ix and iy in the anisotropic case alternatively a fractal distribution of given hurst coefficient h and correlated at all scales is adopted if an anisotropic aperture field of anisotropy ratio e i y i x is considered the two limiting cases e 0 and e give rise to a purely one dimensional aperture variation consequently flow under an external pressure gradient can be considered to take place either transverse case 1 fig 2 a or parallel to aperture variability case 2 fig 2b this approach was used for newtonian flow by silliman silliman 1989 to infer estimates of 2 d hydraulic and transport apertures by zimmerman zimmerman et al 1991 to determine the hydraulic aperture under deterministic sinusoidal variations and by di federico di federico 1997 1998 to derive estimates of hydraulic aperture for non newtonian power law flow under both deterministic and stochastic aperture variations respectively lavrov 2013a validated the approach with two dimensional numerical simulations conducted for a deterministic sinusoidal aperture profile in both directions comparison of his results with the geometric average of flow rates for one dimensional sinusoidal variations only along and only across the flow cases 1 and 2 respectively but with a sinusoidal variation see section 5 showed a relative discrepancy in terms of equivalent aperture equal to less than 10 for δ 0 4 δ being the non dimensional amplitude of the aperture variation in the sequel we consider first case 1 then case 2 3 1 flow parallel to constant aperture channels consider a fracture of dimensions l and w in the x and y direction respectively and aperture varying only in the y direction consider flow in the direction x parallel to constant aperture

discretized into n neighboring parallel channels each having equal width δ y w n length l and constant aperture bi depending on the local aperture value in each channel the flow regime is either i or

consider now flow in the y direction perpendicular to constant aperture channels i e parallel to aperture variation case 2 fig 2b the fracture length is w and the applied pressure gradient is p y p 0 p w w while l is the fracture width perpendicular to gradient discretizing the fracture model into n cells of equal length δ y w n in series each cell has width l and constant aperture bi by virtue of mass conservation volumetric flux qy through each cell is the same depending on the local aperture value in each channel the flow regime is either i or ii or iii and the corresponding flow rate per unit width q y q y l is given respectively by the counterparts of eqs 2a 2b or 2c upon substitution of the subscript x with the subscript y this is so neglecting the pressure losses due to the

albeit numerically the flow rate per unit width as a function of the applied pressure gradient and problem parameters as done in 4 for channels in parallel an alternative formulation of the problem using the same formalism adopted for flow parallel to constant aperture channel is presented in appendix a and leads to the same results 4 estimate of flow rate and discussion different distributions are adopted for the aperture field consistently with earlier work on flow and transport in variable aperture fractures moreno et al 1988 tsang et al 1988 in the following i lognormal and ii gamma distribution are considered the latter covering for values of the parameter d 3 4 also the normal case 4 1 lognormal distribution lognormal distributions for the aperture field were adopted by moreno et al 1988 and tsang et al 1988 its probability distribution function is given by 9 f b 1 b σ 2 π exp ln b ln b g 2 2 σ 2 where b g b exp σ 2 2 is the geometric mean b the arithmetic mean and σ 2 the variance of ln b utilizing eqs 4 5 with eq 6 gives for the factors i j j i i i i i i and p j j i i i i i the following expressions 10 i i b 3 2 exp 3 σ 2 1 erf 1 2 σ ln b 1 b 5 σ 2 2 i i i b 2 n 1 n 2

m and n i e for case 1 12 q x p l n 2 n 1 p x 2 n 1 m 1 n b 2 n 1 n exp 2 n 1 n 1 σ 2 2 n 2 and for case 2 13 q y p l n 2 n 1 p y 2 n 1 m 1 n b 2 n 1 n exp 2 n 1 n 1 σ 2 n in fig 3 flow rate and apparent viscosity versus the pressure gradient are depicted for lognormal aperture distribution and flow perpendicular to aperture variation case 1 the contribution of each single flow regime is also represented in order to quantify their influence on the total flow rate the presence of three possible flow regime i e i low shear rate ii mid shear rate and iii high shear rate allows us to understand why for a certain value of pressure gradient the two models sensibly differ clearly qx q x pl for μ 0 and μ 0 a similar behavior occurs for different aperture distibutions and direction of flow rate case 2 the different trends between qx and q x pl are showed in figs 4 a 4 f for lognormal distribution and case 1 with n 0 3 0 5 0 6 μ 0 0 5 pa s μ 0 001 pa s and m 0 005 pa s n figs 4a 4 b and 4 c depict qx and q x pl versus px for fixed σ 0 3 figs 4d 4 e 4 f do so versus σ for fixed p x 50 pa m 1 it is seen that the flow rate for the truncated model is always decidedly smaller than that associated with the pure power law except at very low gradient pressure where the opposite is true the difference between the two increases as the external pressure gradient and aperture variability become larger or sufficiently small increasing the rheological parameter n the difference between the truncated power law and pure power law model reduces in fig 4a the truncated power law model compared with the pure power law model for a fluid with n 0 3 exhibits all flow regimes here it is possible to observe a very small low shear rate regime for lower values of pressure gradient a mid shear rate where the two models perfectly match and a high shear rate regime with a lower slope than the pure power law model figs 4b and 4 c depict the same behavior for different fluids respectively with n 0 5 0 6 in these configurations the low shear rate regime is not present while the high shear rate regime is reached for higher values of pressure gradient and the difference between the models is less marked figs 4d 4 e and 4 f show how aperture variability σ influences the flow rate for a given pressure gradient px and different fluids for both models the flow rate increases with σ as the parallel arrangement emphasizes the importance of large aperture channels asssociated with a larger variability the truncated model has decidedly smaller flow rates than the pure power law the difference between the two models decreases as n increases until for n 0 6 the difference is very small and the two models provide identical results in a large range of aperture variability fig 5 shows instead the variation of flow rate with respect to pressure gradient for case 2 serial arrangement and both the truncated and pure power law models fig 5a highlights the behavior of flow rate versus pressure gradient for n 0 3 0 5 0 6 and fixed σ 0 5 here a monotonic increasing behavior occurs with a perfect match between truncated and pure power law model for low values of pressure gradient for higher values of the gradient the truncated model presents a lower slope with respect to the pure power law but this difference is less marked as n increases in particular the truncated model assumes almost the same values irrespective of the type of fluid for high gradient values the truncated model has a lower flow rate than the pure power law like in case 1 overall the difference between the two models strongly depends on the type of fluid as noted for case 1 fig 5b depicts the influence of aperture variability for σ 0 1 to 0 5 and fixed n 0 3 for lower values of pressure gradient the truncated and pure power law model perfectly match in particular for small values of aperture variability for higher values of pressure gradient the slope for the truncated model is still lower than the pure power law as in case 1 for both truncated and pure power law the flow rate decreases with increasing aperture variability as the serial arrangement emphasizes the importance of small apertures 4 2 gamma distribution a gamma distribution was adopted by moreno et al 1988 to reproduce the migration of contaminated water in fractured rock in the context of a capillary tube model and by tsang et al 1988 for one dimensional channels its probability distribution function is given by 14 f b 1 γ d b d 1 b g d exp b b g with the two parameters bg geometric mean and d for larger values of d the gamma distribution tends to the normal one the arithmetic mean and the variance of b are given by b b g d σ b 2 b g 2 d b 2 d utilizing eqs 4 5 with eq 6 gives for the factors pii piii and i j j i i i i i i the following expressions 15 i i b 3 γ d d 3 γ d 3 d b 1 b i i i b 2 n 1 n γ d d 2 n 1 n γ d 2 n 1 n d b 1 b γ d 2 n 1 n d b 2 b i i i i b 3 γ d d 3 γ d 3 d b 2 b 16 p i i 1 γ d γ d d b 1 b γ d d b 2 b p i i i 1 γ d γ d d b 2 b where γ z 0 e t t z 1 d t is the gamma function γ α x 0 x e t t α 1 d t γ x γ α x the lower incomplete gamma function and γ α x x e t t α 1 d t the upper incomplete gamma function the expression of the flow rate given by eq 4 with eqs 12 and 13 is compared with that of a pure power law qpl fluid of parameters m and n di federico 1998 i e for case 1 17 q x p l n 2 n 1 p x 2 n 1 m 1 n b d 2 n 1 n γ d 2 n 1 n γ d while for case 2 18 q y p l n 2 n 1 p y 2 n 1 m 1 n b d 2 n 1 n γ d γ d 2 n 1 1 n the latter expression is valid only for d 2 n 1 figs 6 and 7 depict the comparison between the truncated and pure power law models drawn for both lognormal and gamma distributions for case 1 and case 2 respectively here the two distributions are characterized by the same first two moments in particular the parameter d of the gamma distribution is derived by the variance of ln b σ previously converted in σb i e tsang et al 1988 19 σ b 2 b 2 exp ln 10 σ 2 1 the two distributions differ only by the third and fourth moment for σ 0 1 the skewness is 0 47 for gamma distribution and 0 30 for lognormal while kurtosis is 3 32 for gamma and 3 16 for lognormal distribution for σ 0 2 the skewness is 0 97 for gamma distribution and 0 61 for lognormal while kurtosis is 4 42 for gamma and 3 68 for lognormal distribution fig 6 drawn for the parallel arrangement shows that the models with the two different distributions and with tpl have a similar trend the slope of the q x p x relationship for the truncated model for both distributions is lower compared with the pure power law for high and low values of pressure gradient the lognormal distribution consistently shows a lower flow rate than the gamma distribution for the same pressure gradient and aperture variability due to the differences in the distribution shape the difference in flow rate between distributions increases with increasing aperture variability fig 7 drawn for the serial arrangement shows that for the same values of pressure gradient the pure power law model for lognormal distribution has a higher flow rate than the gamma distribution both for σ 0 1 and σ 0 2 for intermediate pressure gradient all distributions show a good agreement of the flow rate for the truncated power law and for the pure power law model again the differences between the power law and the truncated power law models become evident whenever the flow rate is in the regime controlled by the high and the low shear rate plateaus 5 deterministic aperture variation we consider a constant aperture with a sinusoidal perturbation as rough walled fracture di federico 1997 zimmerman et al 1991 as depicted in fig 8 20 b y b 1 δ sin 2 π y λ where b is the mean aperture δ is the magnitude of the roughness and λ is the wavelength of the aperture oscillations upon comparing the limiting aperture values b 1 b 2 for a given pressure gradient separating the different flow regimes for the truncated power law model and the minimum mean and maximum aperture values b min b 1 δ b and b max b 1 δ it is seen that ten possible combinations arise as reported in table 1 the standard deviation of the aperture distribution σb is related to the parameter δ by 21 σ b δ b 2 in the following we compare the behavior in terms of flow rate for a given value of the pressure gradient of a deterministic and stochastic aperture variation both for flow parallel to constant aperture channels case 1 and flow perpendicular to constant aperture channels case 2 the lognormal distribution is adopted for the stochastic variation hence the quantities ii iii and iiii and pii and piii are those reported in eqs 10 and 11 the same quantities evaluated for the deterministic variation are listed in tables 2 and 3 of appendix b for all the possible combinations presented in table 1 in fig 9 a for case 1 a fluid with rheology index n 0 5 is considered the roughness is taken to be δ 0 2 and the same variance is considered for both types of variation the flow rate increases with the pressure gradient and the agreement between deterministic and stochastic model is good the comparison between the two models for case 1 is also shown as a function of σ in fig 9b for n 0 5 and p x 30 pa m 1 here the deterministic model tends to predict higher values of the flow rate qx than the stochastic approach for increasing values of log aperture standard deviation fig 10 a depicts the comparison between deterministic and stochastic aperture variation for case 2 with n 0 3 and δ 0 2 it is seen that the stochastic variation tends to overestimate the flow rate for increasing pressure gradient while for lower values of px the agreement between the two models is quite good this trend in confirmed by fig 10b drawn for p x 0 5 pa m 1 where the deterministic model returns flow rates increasingly lower than the stochastic as σ increases 6 discussion and conclusions we derived analytical models for flow of non newtonian fluids in uneven channels simulating natural or artificial rock fractures our approach couples a four parameter rheological model the truncated power law tpl with a stochastic variation of the aperture field along a 1 d channel according to a generic probability distribution function pdf three different cases are considered including a deterministic variation of sinusoidal shape starting from the solution valid for tpl parallel plate flow which incorporates three possible flow regimes the conductance of the channel is determined as a function of rheological fluid parameters geometry and the pdf of the aperture distribution two limit cases providing an upper and lower bound to the flow rate under an assigned pressure gradient are considered the parallel pa and serial sa arrangements corresponding respectively to an external pressure gradient perpendicular or parallel to aperture variation results for the simpler two parameter power law pl rheological model provide the benchmark to discern the impact of the adoption of a more realistic rheological model on the conductance on one hand the parallel arrangement emphasizes the importance of large aperture channels here the tpl has a smaller conductance than the pl the difference increasing with aperture variability and pressure gradient and decreasing with flow behavior index on the other hand small apertures along the channels play a crucial role in the serial arrangement here results for the tpl and pl agree for intermediate gradients and differ for larger smaller ones when the conductance of the tpl is lower higher than the pl the differences between tpl and pl again increase with aperture variability and decrease with flow behavior index the impact of the specific pdf adopted for the aperture variation is moderate with the first two moments being equal the difference in conductance is an increasing function of aperture variability and depends on the third and fourth moment of the distribution specifically higher values of skewness and kurtosis imply a smaller conductance for the parallel and a larger conductance for the serial arrangement when a deterministic sinusoidal aperture variation is considered all trends valid for stochastic variations are confirmed differences in conductance with stochastic aperture variation increase with pressure gradient and aperture variability and are of opposite sign depending on the aperture arrangement our model reveals the coupled effect of aperture heterogeneity and a realistic rheological equation for non newtonian fluid flow in rock fractures a topic of interest in hydraulic fracturing drilling eor and environmental modelling and remediation the relevance of rheological properties of real fluids and of the stochastic nature of the fractures suggest a more in depth analysis of the coupling effects polymer flooding is often used for eor since the addition of polymers to the injected brine favors an improved sweep a reduction of fingering with a more stable displacement whilst eor polymers in a rheometer display newtonian and shear thinning behaviour approximated by a tpl relationship in the field polymers show a quite complex behavior partially captured in the present model dictated by the flow geometry driven by fractures networks recovery mechanism in fractured reservoirs carbonate reservoirs usually are extensively fractured but show a low porosity is strongly influenced by the fractures which show a well different transmissivity than the matrix and carry most of the flow limiting a large differential pressure and the efficiency of recovery the nature of the fluid and the characteristics of the fractures counteract this negative aspect as a matter of evidence the tpl fluids show a reduction increment of flow rate at high low shear rates for a given pressure gradient with respect to the pl fluids the relevance of this reduction increment and its onset are controlled by the newtonian plateaus and by the fractures parameters mainly the average and the variance of the aperture of the fractures results suggest to investigate further this coupling expanding the investigation to two dimensional modeling of the aperture variation inclusion of local pressure losses and adoption of yield stress rheological models or more complex models a further element adding complexity to the model is shear thickening behaviour due to elongation of the polymer molecules typical of flow in capillary tubes with a sharp contraction nguyen and kausch 1992 at large flow rates depending on the fractures characteristics an elongational contribution adds up to the total pressure drop showing a shear thickening effect which can be included in the present model appendix a alternative formulation for serial configuration the pressure gradient can be estimated as the inverse of eqs 2 2c we notice that while for a given pressure gradient the condition b b 1 and b 1 b b 2

be found analytically only for n 1 2 1 4 1 6 while in general a numerical inversion is requested we notice that for n 1 2 the inverse function has two real valued positive branches this mathematical aspect could bring to hysteretic behaviour of the flow in the fracture with different paths in the space p y q y according to the initial state i a low pressure gradient regime and ii a high pressure gradient regime for the same flow rate however upon introduction of further dissipative effects mainly due to expansion of the troughs the hysteresis should be mitigated and eventually cancelled we will not pursue this aspect which requires an experimental validation and we choose the branch of the inverse function corresponding to the high pressure gradient regime taking the limit as nj the length of each cell tends to zero and the discrete aperture variation to a continuous one then under ergodicity and exploiting the previous relationships eq 7 gives for the mean pressure gradient in

739,urbanization and changing rainfall intensities affect the performance of urban stormwater infrastructure creating the necessity to design resilient stormwater systems one proposed method to increase the resilience of stormwater infrastructure is the active control of system flows to improve the understanding of actively controlled urban water infrastructure function under variable hydro climate we develop a stochastic water balance model for stormwater retention and detention basins with both passive and actively controlled outflow structures under active outflow control the outflow valve is closed until the water level in the basin reaches a specified maximum at which point the valve opens and the basin empties using the stochastic water balance model we develop analytical expressions for the steady state probability density functions pdfs of water level and valve closure time as well as the joint pdf of water level and valve closure time these pdfs then are used to define water level and flow duration curves that provide a probabilistic description of the full range of basin performance the model accurately predicts the water level pdf estimated from data collected at a retention basin with a passive outflow structure the model provides a basis for evaluating how changes in the rainfall runoff process affected by land use and climate change will impact the variability of stormwater basin water storage and pollutant removal function we find that this variability can be managed through the adaptive updating of the active control rule for the outflow structure keywords stormwater management stochastic hydrology real time control urban runoff 1 introduction urbanization and changing precipitation regimes are creating new challenges for urban stormwater management the impacts of ongoing urbanization on hydrologic response are well known and include increased runoff volume peak flows and pollutant concentrations leopold 1968 at the same time the frequency of extreme intensity precipitation events has increased due to climate change kunkel et al 2013 the interaction of land use and climate change has led to altered rainfall runoff regimes and hydro climatic drivers of floods yang et al 2013 resilient and adaptable infrastructure is needed to manage urban stormwater in this shifting environment to offset the impacts of urban development urban stormwater management systems are designed to mimic pre development hydrology however these designs are often developed in a much simpler hydrologic context that does not reflect operational conditions stormwater detention and retention basin designs are commonly based on the runoff volume and peak flow produced during one or a small number of design storms that represent a given return period nrcs 1986 wisconsin department of natural resources 2007 this design storm approach assumes a single operational scenario with an assigned return frequency and thus simplifies the full dynamic range of basin operation that occurs under variable hydro climatic conditions therefore many existing urban stormwater management systems are not inherently equipped to adapt to land use or climate changes that influence runoff volumes and frequencies in response to changes in these drivers functionality may drift over time bhaskar et al 2016 kerkez et al 2016 therefore new analysis design and control approaches are needed to incorporate runoff variability into the understanding of urban water system function one opportunity to enhance adaptability and resilience of urban stormwater management systems to long term change is the active control of system outflows mullapudi et al 2017 the active control of stormwater basin outflows reduces peak outflows and increases pollutant removal efficiency in response to current rainfall and basin water depth actively adjusting the outflow gate increased the total suspended solids tss removal efficiency by 44 in one study gaborit et al 2013 another application achieved greater than 50 reduction in peak flow muschalla et al 2014 while ad hoc case studies of active stormwater control such as these exist our understanding of how to design active controls to meet hydrologic objectives remains limited mullapudi et al 2017 a major challenge for water resources management that is especially relevant to operation of active controls is to make effective predictions under large uncertainty from hydro climate variability hydro climatic variability and active control can be incorporated into models of stormwater infrastructure performance using numerical and analytical approaches numerical approaches provide for a continuous simulation of the water balance and hydraulic routing under a time varying hydro climate forcing including several sequential dry and wet weather periods analytical methods can be applied using a derived distribution approach in cases where the underlying physical model is sufficiently mathematically tractable derived distributions have been used to estimate temporal variability in runoff volume chen and adams 2007 and pollutant loading loganathan and delleur 1984 arising from temporal rainfall variability more recently bartlett et al 2016a b used a similar approach to transform spatial variability in rainfall and antecedent soil moisture into spatial variability of runoff generation and spatially lumped rainfall runoff curves beyond the derived distribution approach stochastic differential equations sdes combines the variability of the hydro climatic forcing with the temporal state dynamics of the infrastructure in particular one may pose a corresponding master equation that describes the temporal evolution of the probability density for the sde state variable sdes and the corresponding master equations have been used to model catchment response and streamflow variability mejía et al 2014 bartlett et al 2015 variability of stormwater runoff pollutant concentrations daly et al 2014 hydrologic operation of green roofs guo 2016 and the stochastic soil moisture dynamics of biofiltration systems daly et al 2012 these models account for interaction between the external hydro climatic forcing and the system state and provide clear analytical links between climate land use runoff and function of engineered hydrological systems in this paper we study the interaction between climate variability and active outflow control and its effect on the operation of stormwater basins toward this end we develop a stochastic water balance equation and then analyze the stochastic dynamics of water storage in passive and actively controlled stormwater detention and retention basins for the stochastic water balance we derive and solve the analogous master equation for analytical expressions for the steady state probability density functions pdfs of the basin water level and outflow closure time the water level pdf yields the level and flow duration curves and the ensemble average water balance at the seasonal scale the outflow closure time pdf provides insight into the actively controlled basin water retention time solutions are derived for passive and actively controlled outflow structures for different stage discharge curves this probabilistic characterization of stormwater basin function provides a basis for quantifying risk based metrics such as the outflow exceedance probability and adaptive management through active outflow control in terms of climate and basin characteristics 2 model description 2 1 water balance equation the water balance for a stormwater basin under active or passive outflow control is conceptualized as a one dimensional dynamical system with the state variable h the water depth in the basin the water balance for a generic basin can be written as 1 d v h t d t q i t e 0 t a s h q s h t q o h l h t where v h t is the water volume in the basin qi t is the time dependent inflow hydrograph from stormwater runoff e 0 t is the potential evaporation rate as h is the basin surface area qs h t is the state dependent structure outflow qo h is the emergency overflow and l h t represents exfiltration to or infiltration from the surrounding groundwater fig 1 qs h t represents the stage discharge curve of the outflow structure which may vary with time in an active control scenario both passive and controlled outflows are considered below the water balance 1 is simplified for analytical tractability we assume the basin is rectangular such that the surface area as is constant with depth we assume evaporation from the water surface and exfiltration are negligible compared to the rates of inflow and outflow and finally we assume there is a minimum water level hmin below which no outflow occurs and a maximum water level hmax above which emergency overflow occurs the minimum water level corresponds to the invert elevation of the outflow structure when hmin 0 the basin completely empties i e dry pond detention basin and when hmin 0 the basin retains a permanent pool of water which provides additional pollutant removal i e wet pond retention basin under the assumptions above the water balance can be written as a non linear ordinary differential equation ode for h with a time varying inflow forcing qi t and state dependent outflow rate qo h qs h t 2 a s d h d t q i t q o h q s h t 2 2 inflow hydrograph for urbanized watersheds with a time to peak inflow that is much shorter than the emptying time of the basin it is reasonable to assume the inflow hydrograph results in an instantaneous jump in the basin water level at the daily time scale denoted on a normalized basis as qi t qi t as therefore the inflow from stormwater runoff is modeled as a stochastic jump process and eq 2 becomes a stochastic differential equation sde with a non linear time dependent outflow the inflow qi t is modeled at the daily scale as a marked poisson arrival process with a constant mean inter arrival time λ 1 d and exponentially distributed runoff volumes with mean depth α m these assumptions have been applied in other studies chen and adams 2007 daly et al 2012 and the accuracy of this assumption for the present study is evaluated in section 3 4 below finally it is assumed that the emergency overflow results in an instantaneous water loss effectively imposing an upper bound of hmax on the basin water level for the assumptions outlined above the distribution of stormwater runoff inflows can be written as laio et al 2001 3 p q i h q i 1 α exp q i α δ q i h m a x h exp h m a x h α where the exponential distribution of the first term represents inflows without overflow initiation and the dirac delta function δ and exponential function represent the discrete probability of qi hmax h i e an inflow that produces an overflow event 2 3 outflow hydrograph passive and active control active control of stormwater basin outflows may be designed to meet a wide range of operational water quantity and quality criteria these criteria include limiting outflow rates to minimize increases above pre development conditions or enhancing the settling of suspended pollutants through increased detention time a common approach that offers a relatively simple starting point is on off i e bang bang control jacopin et al 2001 muschalla et al 2014 the on off control specifies a maximum water level set point denoted hs that triggers the outflow structure to open to its maximum area once the basin empties to the level hmin the outflow structure is closed until the set point is reached again both passive and actively controlled outflows can be modeled in the water balance eq 2 for both cases we specify a stage discharge relation with the general form 4 ρ h q s h a s 0 h h m i n k h b h h m i n for which the parameters k cm d 1 and b for passive outflow structures such as orifices and weirs are summarized in table 1 passive outflow structures are fully specified by eq 4 whereas actively controlled outflow structures require specification of the on off rule which is introduced in the solution to the water balance equation derived in section 3 4 2 4 case study the model performance was evaluated for the water level in a stormwater retention basin controlled by a passive outflow located in ann arbor mi kerkez et al 2016 mullapudi et al 2017 the basin has a maximum surface area of 8400 m2 at a water depth of 248 cm and a minimum surface area of approximately 3900 m2 at the invert elevation of the outflow structure the outflow structure consists of two circular 2 m diameter pipes the pond water level was recorded at 5 min intervals over a 3 month period between august 1 and october 20 2016 the depth and arrival time of individual runoff events were extracted from the water level time series to estimate the average inflow depth and average inflow frequency parameters α and λ the assumption of exponentially distributed inflow depths and inflow arrival times was verified using the 2016 water level data and daily rainfall data obtained from the city of ann arbor http www3 a2gov org raingauges spanning the years 2010 2018 the outflow stage discharge relation was estimated from the observed water level recession between events 2 5 model simulations numerical and analytical results are presented below the analytical model solutions are developed in section 3 1 through section 3 4 which are evaluated directly for a given set of parameters to verify the analytical model solutions numerical simulations of the water balance were implemented in matlab using a forward euler explicit time stepping scheme runoff inflows and inter event times were sampled from the corresponding distributions and a 30 year time series of stormwater runoff inflow events was generated 3 results the following section describes the deterministic and stochastic analysis of eq 2 in section 3 1 the deterministic dynamics of the basin drainage process are presented for each of the outflow stage discharge relationships listed in table 1 in sections 3 2 and 3 4 we examine the stochastic balance sde present the analogous master equation for steady state conditions and solve the master equation for the probability density function of water level ph h under passive and active control scenarios respectively in section 3 3 the performance of the model for a passive control scenario is demonstrated finally in section 3 5 summary statistics relevant to hydrologic function and design including the level and flow duration curves and the pdf of the valve closure time are analyzed and discussed 3 1 deterministic solution for a single drainage event for a single drainage event qi t 0 the resulting ode dh dt ρ h was solved with initial condition h t 0 h 0 and hmin 0 for each of the ρ h expressions in table 1 the resulting trajectories h t are summarized in table 1 and fig 2 note that for constant and orifice outflow stage discharge relations or any power law with 0 b 1 h reaches hmin in finite time for this case the inter storm water level trajectory is only valid for 0 t tf where tf satisfies h tf hmin these dynamics imply the basin spends a finite non zero fraction of time in an empty state a point which will become clear in the probabilistic analysis below 3 2 steady state probability distribution of water level passive outflow for the water balance in eq 2 forced by the runoff inflow distribution 3 the general solution for the steady state pdf of water level is derived from a master equation for the cumulative distribution function cdf in steady state in steady state this master equation may be derived as a balance of the upcrossing and downcrossing rate of any water level h brill 2008 bartlett et al 2015 i e 5 ρ h p h h λ u 0 h exp h u α p h u d u where ph h f h δ h p 0 is the steady state water level pdf f h is the continuous part of the pdf p 0 is an atom of probability at h 0 hmin is set equal to 0 for brevity and u is a dummy integration variable p 0 arises in cases where the water level reaches 0 in finite time in eq 5 the lhs is the downcrossing rate at level h due to outflow and the rhs is the upcrossing rate accounting for water level jumps due to runoff inflow by taking the derivative of both sides of eq 5 with respect to h one retrieves the master equation for the steady state dynamics of the pdf ph h the solution of eq 5 is brill 2008 botter et al 2009 6 p h h n λ δ h θ 1 b n ρ h exp h α λ 0 h d u ρ u where the atom of probability at h 0 is p 0 n λ θ 1 b note that for 0 b 1 n λp 0 which is equivalent to the steady state probability that an inflow event occurs when h 0 in eq 6 n or p 0 can be found by imposing a total probability equal to 1 p h m a x 0

of eq 7 is the basis for the specific solutions summarized in table 2 which are based on the parameters b and k for the different stage discharge curves of table 1 example steady state water level pdfs for a passive orifice discharge are illustrated in fig 3 numerical simulations demonstrate that the analytical solution is accurate the mode of the water level pdf is equal to zero for large values of a 0 fig 3a and increases to positive values as the outlet structure cross sectional area decreases the shape of the water level pdf is also sensitivity to the runoff inflow distribution as the mode increases with increasing runoff frequency λ fig 3b that is climate and watershed characteristics that generate more frequent less intense runoff are associated with more stormwater basin storage therefore changes in the basin design parameters e g a 0 or watershed or climate characteristics e g λ can change the most likely basin state from empty i e the mode of h is zero to partially full i e the mode of h is greater than zero 3 3 model performance for passive outflow visual inspection of the water level data confirms that stormwater runoff inflow events occur much more rapidly than outflow fig 4 a justifying the assumption that inflows events can be treated as an instantaneous random jump forcing at the time scale of the basin outflow process the estimated parameters for the inflow model were α 17 2 cm and λ 1 3 6 d respectively the distributions of extracted storm depths and inter storm durations are well approximated by the exponential distribution fig 4b from the long term rainfall data we estimated an average inter storm duration of 3 0 d and an average daily rainfall depth of 6 8 mm the distributions of daily rainfall depth and inter storm duration are also well approximated by the exponential distribution fig 4c further supporting our assumption note however that this assumption may fail for time series that span seasonal or inter annual rainfall variability porporato et al 2006 the outflow stage discharge relation was estimated from the data fig 5 the outflow process follows two regimes for water levels greater than 40 cm the stage discharge relation follows ρ h h 2 and for water levels less than 40 cm ρ h h 3 the basin water level exceeded 40 cm during one inflow event and for less than 1 of the time period further the estimated outflow rate at high water levels exceeds 100 cm day therefore at the daily time scale we assume that the basin has a maximum water level hmax 40 cm and ρ h h 3 the exponent b 3 is consistent with typical stage discharge curves for open channel flow in partially full circular cross sections for the estimated stage discharge curve of ρ h kh 3 the steady state water level pdf is 8 p h h n k h 3 exp h α λ 2 k h 2 the outflow coefficient k was estimated by the method of moments and estimated to be k 0 026 cm d the modeled and observed cdfs compare favorably for cumulative probabilities greater than 0 01 fig 6 3 4 steady state probability distribution of water level on off outflow control under active on off control driven by a single water level set point the basin water level dynamics can be in one of two regimes at any given time in the first regime the outflow structure is fully closed and the water level increases by successive inflow jumps generated by the watershed rainfall runoff process in the second regime the outflow structure is fully open when the structure is open the water level increases by successive inflow jumps and decreases according to the stage discharge curve between inflow events switching between these two regimes is triggered when the water level exceeds the outflow open set point hs outflow opens and when the water level reaches hmin outflow closes for constant and orifice outflow stage discharge curves h reaches hmin in finite time whereas for other structures a positive set point for valve closure must be specified because in theory the basin never fully empties example water level trajectories for a passive and controlled orifice outflow are compared in fig 7 the steady state water level pdf for the two regime system can be written as a weighted sum of the pdf for each regime 9 p h h c 1 p h 1 h 1 c 1 p h 2 h where c 1 is the ensemble average fraction of time spent in regime 1 filling outflow closed and 1 c 1 is the ensemble average fraction of time spent in regime 2 emptying outflow open the steady state pdfs p h 1 h and p h 2 h and the coefficient c 1 can be obtained by evaluating each regime separately for the filling regime we may pose a master equation for the cdf in terms of downcrossing and upcrossing rates downcrossing only occurs at level h hmin when the system switches from the emptying to the filling state i e when the outflow closes and sample paths are composed of only upcrossings therefore the steady state balance of downcrossings and upcrossings during the filling process can be written as brill 2008 10 c d λ u 0 h exp h u α p h 1 u d u where 0 h hs cd is the average downcrossing rate at which the emptying regime enters the filling regime i e the average rate at which the outflow structure closes hmin 0 and the rhs term accounts for upcrossings due to runoff inflow eq 10 can be solved to obtain the continuous part of the pdf f h 1 h c d α λ p 0 α where it is noted that steady state requires that cd λp 0 i e the rate of downcrossing equals the rate of leaving the level h 0 finally applying the normalization condition yields 11 p h 1 h 1 α h s δ h α α h s which states that when the outflow is closed the water level pdf is a mixed distribution with a continuous uniform pdf i e f h 1 h 1 α h s and an atom of probability of p 0 α α h s at h 0 the distribution only depends on the average runoff depth and the on off set point α and hs respectively likewise for the emptying regime the steady state master equation based on the cdf may be derived in terms of a balance of upcrossings and downcrossings i e 12 ρ h p h 2 h c u λ u 0 h exp h u α p h 2 u d u where cu is the average upcrossing rate at which the filling regime enters the emptying regime i e the average rate at which hs is crossed and the outflow structure opens and the second term on the rhs is the upcrossing rate due to runoff inflow the lhs of eq 12 is the downcrossing rate due to outflow eq 12 can be solved to obtain 13 p h 2 h c u ρ h exp f h 1 1 α u 0 h s h h s θ h s h exp f u d u where f u 0 u 1 α λ ρ y d y θ is the heaviside step function and the rate cu is the normalization constant of the pdf such that 0 h m a x p h 2 h d h 1 see appendix a the solution of 13 for the general stage discharge relation ρ h is 14 p h 2 h c u k h b exp h α λ k 1 b h 1 b 1 1 α u 0 h s h h s θ h s h exp u α λ k 1 b u 1 b d u finally the weight c 1 can be obtained by noting that at steady state the rate out of the emptying regime into the filling regime must be equal to the rate out of the filling regime into the emptying regime therefore c 1 cd 1 c 1 cu and 15 c 1 c u c d c u the full pdf ph h for an active outflow control is given by eq 9 which is based on the functions given by eqs 11 14 and 15 numerical and analytical solutions for the actively controlled water level pdf are shown in fig 8 a and the actively controlled water level pdf is compared to the passive water level pdf in fig 8b 3 5 comparing basin performance metrics under passive and active control in this section several basin performance metrics are derived from the previously developed pdfs and compared for passive and actively controlled outflows probabilistic performance metrics include the level duration curve ldc flow duration curve fdc the pdf of the valve closure time and the joint pdf of the water level and the valve closure time aggregate performance metrics include the ensemble average water level and outflow water balance 3 5 1 level and flow duration curves the steady state water level pdf and stage discharge curve can be used to construct the ldc and fdc the ldc is the complement of the water level cdf l h 1 p h h 1 0 h p h h d h the fdc is also the complement of a cdf but depends on the outflow status in addition to the basin water level the fdc can be written as 16 f q 1 p q q 1 c 1 1 q 0 p q q dq 1 c 1 where pq q is the pdf of the outflow rate and 1 c1 is the fraction of time the outflow is open with q 0 the outflow pdf can be obtained as a derived distribution of the water level pdf p q q p h q k 1 b k b q k b 1 b 1 based on a change of variables following eq 4 example ldcs and fdcs are plotted in fig 9 for an orifice outflow with passive and active control at several on off setpoints compared to passive outflow no control active control increases the ldc and therefore the water level at most return frequencies active control modifies the fdc in two ways first positive flows are restricted to the fraction of time c 1 when the basin is in the emptying regime secondly the distribution of flows is modified such that higher flows are more frequent with active control than passive outflow no control higher flows are a direct result of higher basin water levels under active control because of its control on the ldc and fdc the on off setpoint hs can be used to adapt stormwater basin performance to changes in the stormwater runoff inflow distribution to demonstrate the flow rate with an exceedance probability of 5 q 5 is plotted in fig 10 for several values of the on off level setpoint and rainfall frequency contours of constant q 5 indicate that for increased rainfall frequency the on off level setpoint can be increased to maintain q 5 therefore active on off control can be utilized to enhance resilience of stormwater basins to changing runoff inflow regimes similar results can be obtained for other exceedance probabilities 3 5 2 ensemble average water level and water balance the steady state water level pdf can be used to compute the average water balance partitioning to the outflow structure or the emergency overflow and the average basin water level these quantities represent the average basin function at the seasonal scale the ensemble average steady state water balance can be expressed as 17 q i q s q o where the brackets denote ensemble averages and subscripts s and o indicate outflow through the structure and emergency overflow respectively the ensemble average daily inflow volume is simply qi αλas the ensemble average overflow volume is related to the frequency of the water level crossing hmax λ o ph hmax ρ hmax porporato et al 2001 because the inflow events are exponentially distributed the overflow volumes are also exponentially distributed with mean α bartlett et al 2015 eq 3 21 therefore qo αph hmax ρ hmax as and qs qi qo finally the ensemble average water level can be obtained from the pdf by definition h 0 h m a x h p h h d h the passive orifice outflow is used as an example the average fraction of inflow controlled through the outflow structure is 18 q s q i 1 p 0 h m a x exp h m a x α λ k h m a x where p 0 is given in table 2 the ensemble average water level for a passive orifice outflow can be computed analytically but is not reported here for brevity similar expressions can be obtained for other outflow stage discharge curves and actively controlled outflows examples of the ensemble average water balance partitioning and the ensemble average water level are illustrated in fig 11 active control increases both the average water level and the runoff volume lost to emergency overflow increases in average water level due to active control are not sensitive to rainfall frequency and increase as the on off setpoint is increased increases in emergency overflow due to active control increase with the on off setpoint and decrease with rainfall frequency in this example for on off setpoints less than about half of the emergency overflow level the increase in overflow is negligible therefore this simple on off control rule for active control increases basin storage without significantly increasing overflow 3 5 3 distribution of the valve closure time one objective of active real time control of stormwater basin outflows is to increase water detention time for enhanced pollutant removal in addition to the detention time pollutant removal efficiency also depends on the basin water level the water level impacts the pollutant concentration through dilution as well as the critical settling velocity takamatsu 2010 on the other hand increased detention time may have negative consequences such as development of anoxic conditions or pests the framework introduced here can be used to provide insight into the impact of active controls on pollutant removal through the joint distribution of detention time and water level the distribution of times the basin spends in the filling regime regime 1 and therefore the times the valve is closed can be obtained from the time dependent solution of the pdf p h 1 h t the filling regime is a compound poisson process and the pdf of cumulative basin inflows at time t following valve closure is daly and porporato 2006 19 p h 1 h t exp h α λ t λ t α h i 1 2 λ h t α δ h where i 1 is the modified bessel function of the first kind of order 1 abramowitz and stegun 1972 the pdf of eq 19 can be integrated to define the probability that the valve reopens before a given time t which is equivalent to the probability that h t exceeds hs 20 p t c t h s p h 1 h t d h where tc is a random variable that defines the time between valve closing and opening therefore the pdf of valve closure times is 21 p t c t c d p t c t d t d d t h s p h 1 h t d h eq 21 does not have a closed form solution the sensitivity of p t c t c to hs and λ is illustrated in fig 12 as expected higher hs leads to longer valve closure times and therefore longer detention times runoff inflow distributions with more frequent and less intense inflows reduce the variability of the valve closure time whereas storm frequency has a minor impact on the mode of p t c t c note that eq 19 can also be used to define the pdf of h conditional on tc 22 p h t c h t c n exp h α λ t c λ t c α h i 1 2 λ h t c α δ h where n is a normalization constant that accounts for the fact that h is restricted between 0 and hs in regime 1 the joint distribution of h and tc can then be obtained combining eqs 21 and 22 23 p h t c h t c p h t c h t c p t c t c the sensitivity of p h t c h t c to hs and λ is illustrated in fig 13 in general there is a nearly linear relationship between the modes of the marginal valve closure time and water level distributions that is the valve closure time is strongly and positively related to the basin water level these basin performance metrics have opposite impacts on basin pollutant removal assuming settling as the primary pollutant removal process increased water level increases particle settling time whereas increased detention time increases the fraction of particles removed from the water column from this purely hydrologic perspective it is not clear how important this trade off is toward an effective balance between water storage and pollutant removal 4 discussion and conclusions a stochastic water balance model was developed for stormwater control basins and the model considers both passive and actively controlled outflows the proposed model joins a number of recent models and experiments aimed at quantifying the variability of urban stormwater infrastructure performance daly et al 2012 2014 li et al 2016 while previous studies have focused on dynamics and performance of bioretention and treatment facilities the present work addresses stormwater retention and detention basins as well as active real time control of basin outflows kerkez et al 2016 mullapudi et al 2017 the model describes the dynamics of the basin water level h and given the statistics of the runoff inflow process provides a probabilistic characterization of the basin hydrologic function results include the water level pdf the joint distribution of valve closure time and water level and average water balance under different land use climate and design characteristics the water level pdf which can also be expressed as a level duration curve leads directly to an analytical expression for the basin flow duration curve thus a full probabilistic description of hydrologic performance in passive and actively controlled stormwater basins has been achieved the model presented here has a number of limitations to be addressed in future work the model assumes the stormwater basin is rectangular and has a constant surface area with depth this assumption applies to rain barrels and subsurface rainwater harvesting tanks but most stormwater detention and retention ponds have sloped sides secondly the model assumes a poisson arrival process for stormwater runoff events and that runoff depths are exponentially distributed this assumption was shown to apply in the present case study however it may not be appropriate in all cases finally the model verification was limited by data availability during the three months of recorded water level data there were only 12 storms to estimate the parameters α and λ therefore confidence in these parameters is low in addition the outflow stage discharge relation parameters were estimated from the data limiting applicability of eq 8 to other ungauged sites analysis of the results demonstrates the role of active outflow control in altering the hydrologic dynamics of stormwater basins active control as defined here increases water storage volume and detention time which mitigate increased peak runoff flows and pollutant runoff due to urbanization respectively further the results show that active outflow control can be employed as an effective practice to adapt stormwater basin outflows to land use or climate changes that alter the timing and frequency of stormwater runoff events however active outflow control may increase the likelihood of emergency overflow and reduce the efficiency of pollutant removal by increasing particle settling time these trade offs and their implications must be addressed in future work this model represents a first step toward understanding the interaction between runoff variability and smart stormwater systems mullapudi et al 2017 as such our work focuses on the hydrologic performance of single stormwater management facility the modeling framework can be adapted to investigate progressively more

739,urbanization and changing rainfall intensities affect the performance of urban stormwater infrastructure creating the necessity to design resilient stormwater systems one proposed method to increase the resilience of stormwater infrastructure is the active control of system flows to improve the understanding of actively controlled urban water infrastructure function under variable hydro climate we develop a stochastic water balance model for stormwater retention and detention basins with both passive and actively controlled outflow structures under active outflow control the outflow valve is closed until the water level in the basin reaches a specified maximum at which point the valve opens and the basin empties using the stochastic water balance model we develop analytical expressions for the steady state probability density functions pdfs of water level and valve closure time as well as the joint pdf of water level and valve closure time these pdfs then are used to define water level and flow duration curves that provide a probabilistic description of the full range of basin performance the model accurately predicts the water level pdf estimated from data collected at a retention basin with a passive outflow structure the model provides a basis for evaluating how changes in the rainfall runoff process affected by land use and climate change will impact the variability of stormwater basin water storage and pollutant removal function we find that this variability can be managed through the adaptive updating of the active control rule for the outflow structure keywords stormwater management stochastic hydrology real time control urban runoff 1 introduction urbanization and changing precipitation regimes are creating new challenges for urban stormwater management the impacts of ongoing urbanization on hydrologic response are well known and include increased runoff volume peak flows and pollutant concentrations leopold 1968 at the same time the frequency of extreme intensity precipitation events has increased due to climate change kunkel et al 2013 the interaction of land use and climate change has led to altered rainfall runoff regimes and hydro climatic drivers of floods yang et al 2013 resilient and adaptable infrastructure is needed to manage urban stormwater in this shifting environment to offset the impacts of urban development urban stormwater management systems are designed to mimic pre development hydrology however these designs are often developed in a much simpler hydrologic context that does not reflect operational conditions stormwater detention and retention basin designs are commonly based on the runoff volume and peak flow produced during one or a small number of design storms that represent a given return period nrcs 1986 wisconsin department of natural resources 2007 this design storm approach assumes a single operational scenario with an assigned return frequency and thus simplifies the full dynamic range of basin operation that occurs under variable hydro climatic conditions therefore many existing urban stormwater management systems are not inherently equipped to adapt to land use or climate changes that influence runoff volumes and frequencies in response to changes in these drivers functionality may drift over time bhaskar et al 2016 kerkez et al 2016 therefore new analysis design and control approaches are needed to incorporate runoff variability into the understanding of urban water system function one opportunity to enhance adaptability and resilience of urban stormwater management systems to long term change is the active control of system outflows mullapudi et al 2017 the active control of stormwater basin outflows reduces peak outflows and increases pollutant removal efficiency in response to current rainfall and basin water depth actively adjusting the outflow gate increased the total suspended solids tss removal efficiency by 44 in one study gaborit et al 2013 another application achieved greater than 50 reduction in peak flow muschalla et al 2014 while ad hoc case studies of active stormwater control such as these exist our understanding of how to design active controls to meet hydrologic objectives remains limited mullapudi et al 2017 a major challenge for water resources management that is especially relevant to operation of active controls is to make effective predictions under large uncertainty from hydro climate variability hydro climatic variability and active control can be incorporated into models of stormwater infrastructure performance using numerical and analytical approaches numerical approaches provide for a continuous simulation of the water balance and hydraulic routing under a time varying hydro climate forcing including several sequential dry and wet weather periods analytical methods can be applied using a derived distribution approach in cases where the underlying physical model is sufficiently mathematically tractable derived distributions have been used to estimate temporal variability in runoff volume chen and adams 2007 and pollutant loading loganathan and delleur 1984 arising from temporal rainfall variability more recently bartlett et al 2016a b used a similar approach to transform spatial variability in rainfall and antecedent soil moisture into spatial variability of runoff generation and spatially lumped rainfall runoff curves beyond the derived distribution approach stochastic differential equations sdes combines the variability of the hydro climatic forcing with the temporal state dynamics of the infrastructure in particular one may pose a corresponding master equation that describes the temporal evolution of the probability density for the sde state variable sdes and the corresponding master equations have been used to model catchment response and streamflow variability mejía et al 2014 bartlett et al 2015 variability of stormwater runoff pollutant concentrations daly et al 2014 hydrologic operation of green roofs guo 2016 and the stochastic soil moisture dynamics of biofiltration systems daly et al 2012 these models account for interaction between the external hydro climatic forcing and the system state and provide clear analytical links between climate land use runoff and function of engineered hydrological systems in this paper we study the interaction between climate variability and active outflow control and its effect on the operation of stormwater basins toward this end we develop a stochastic water balance equation and then analyze the stochastic dynamics of water storage in passive and actively controlled stormwater detention and retention basins for the stochastic water balance we derive and solve the analogous master equation for analytical expressions for the steady state probability density functions pdfs of the basin water level and outflow closure time the water level pdf yields the level and flow duration curves and the ensemble average water balance at the seasonal scale the outflow closure time pdf provides insight into the actively controlled basin water retention time solutions are derived for passive and actively controlled outflow structures for different stage discharge curves this probabilistic characterization of stormwater basin function provides a basis for quantifying risk based metrics such as the outflow exceedance probability and adaptive management through active outflow control in terms of climate and basin characteristics 2 model description 2 1 water balance equation the water balance for a stormwater basin under active or passive outflow control is conceptualized as a one dimensional dynamical system with the state variable h the water depth in the basin the water balance for a generic basin can be written as 1 d v h t d t q i t e 0 t a s h q s h t q o h l h t where v h t is the water volume in the basin qi t is the time dependent inflow hydrograph from stormwater runoff e 0 t is the potential evaporation rate as h is the basin surface area qs h t is the state dependent structure outflow qo h is the emergency overflow and l h t represents exfiltration to or infiltration from the surrounding groundwater fig 1 qs h t represents the stage discharge curve of the outflow structure which may vary with time in an active control scenario both passive and controlled outflows are considered below the water balance 1 is simplified for analytical tractability we assume the basin is rectangular such that the surface area as is constant with depth we assume evaporation from the water surface and exfiltration are negligible compared to the rates of inflow and outflow and finally we assume there is a minimum water level hmin below which no outflow occurs and a maximum water level hmax above which emergency overflow occurs the minimum water level corresponds to the invert elevation of the outflow structure when hmin 0 the basin completely empties i e dry pond detention basin and when hmin 0 the basin retains a permanent pool of water which provides additional pollutant removal i e wet pond retention basin under the assumptions above the water balance can be written as a non linear ordinary differential equation ode for h with a time varying inflow forcing qi t and state dependent outflow rate qo h qs h t 2 a s d h d t q i t q o h q s h t 2 2 inflow hydrograph for urbanized watersheds with a time to peak inflow that is much shorter than the emptying time of the basin it is reasonable to assume the inflow hydrograph results in an instantaneous jump in the basin water level at the daily time scale denoted on a normalized basis as qi t qi t as therefore the inflow from stormwater runoff is modeled as a stochastic jump process and eq 2 becomes a stochastic differential equation sde with a non linear time dependent outflow the inflow qi t is modeled at the daily scale as a marked poisson arrival process with a constant mean inter arrival time λ 1 d and exponentially distributed runoff volumes with mean depth α m these assumptions have been applied in other studies chen and adams 2007 daly et al 2012 and the accuracy of this assumption for the present study is evaluated in section 3 4 below finally it is assumed that the emergency overflow results in an instantaneous water loss effectively imposing an upper bound of hmax on the basin water level for the assumptions outlined above the distribution of stormwater runoff inflows can be written as laio et al 2001 3 p q i h q i 1 α exp q i α δ q i h m a x h exp h m a x h α where the exponential distribution of the first term represents inflows without overflow initiation and the dirac delta function δ and exponential function represent the discrete probability of qi hmax h i e an inflow that produces an overflow event 2 3 outflow hydrograph passive and active control active control of stormwater basin outflows may be designed to meet a wide range of operational water quantity and quality criteria these criteria include limiting outflow rates to minimize increases above pre development conditions or enhancing the settling of suspended pollutants through increased detention time a common approach that offers a relatively simple starting point is on off i e bang bang control jacopin et al 2001 muschalla et al 2014 the on off control specifies a maximum water level set point denoted hs that triggers the outflow structure to open to its maximum area once the basin empties to the level hmin the outflow structure is closed until the set point is reached again both passive and actively controlled outflows can be modeled in the water balance eq 2 for both cases we specify a stage discharge relation with the general

are fully specified by eq 4 whereas actively controlled outflow structures require specification of the on off rule which is introduced in the solution to the water balance equation derived in section 3 4 2 4 case study the model performance was evaluated for the water level in a stormwater retention basin controlled by a passive outflow located in ann arbor mi kerkez et al 2016 mullapudi et al 2017 the basin has a maximum surface area of 8400 m2 at a water depth of 248 cm and a minimum surface area of approximately 3900 m2 at the invert elevation of the outflow structure the outflow structure consists of two circular 2 m diameter pipes the pond water level was recorded at 5 min intervals over a 3 month period between august 1 and october 20 2016 the depth and arrival time of individual runoff events were extracted from the water level time series to estimate the average inflow depth and average inflow frequency parameters α and λ the assumption of exponentially distributed inflow depths and inflow arrival times was verified using the 2016 water level data and daily rainfall data obtained from the city of ann arbor http www3 a2gov org raingauges spanning the years 2010 2018 the outflow stage discharge relation was estimated from the observed water level recession between events 2 5 model simulations numerical and analytical results are presented below the analytical model solutions are developed in section 3 1 through section 3 4 which are evaluated directly for a given set of parameters to verify the analytical model solutions numerical simulations of the water balance were implemented in matlab using a forward euler explicit time stepping scheme runoff inflows and inter event times were sampled from the corresponding distributions and a 30 year time series of stormwater runoff inflow events was generated 3 results the following section describes the deterministic and stochastic analysis of eq 2 in section 3 1 the deterministic dynamics of the basin drainage process are presented for each of the outflow stage discharge relationships listed in table 1 in sections 3 2 and 3 4 we examine the stochastic balance sde present the analogous master equation for steady state conditions and solve the master equation for the probability density function of water level ph h under passive and active control scenarios respectively in section 3 3 the performance of the model for a passive control scenario is demonstrated finally in section 3 5 summary statistics relevant to hydrologic function and design including the level and flow duration curves and the pdf of the valve closure time are analyzed and discussed 3 1 deterministic solution for a single drainage event for a single drainage event qi t 0 the resulting ode dh dt ρ h was solved with initial condition h t 0 h 0 and hmin 0 for each of the ρ h expressions in table 1 the resulting trajectories h t are summarized in table 1 and fig 2 note that for constant and orifice outflow stage discharge relations or any power law with 0 b 1 h reaches hmin in finite time for this case the inter storm water level trajectory is only valid for 0 t tf where tf satisfies h tf hmin these dynamics imply the basin spends a finite non zero fraction of time in an empty state a point which will become clear in the probabilistic analysis below 3 2 steady state probability distribution of water level passive outflow for the water balance in eq 2 forced by the runoff inflow distribution 3 the general solution for the steady state pdf of water level is derived from a master equation for the cumulative distribution function cdf in steady state in steady state this master equation may be derived as a balance of the upcrossing and downcrossing rate of any water level h brill 2008 bartlett et al 2015 i e 5 ρ h p h h λ u 0 h exp h u α p h u d u where ph h f h δ h p 0 is the steady state water level pdf f h is the continuous part of the pdf p 0 is an atom of probability at h 0 hmin is set equal to 0 for brevity and u is a dummy integration variable p 0 arises in cases where the water level reaches 0 in finite time in eq 5 the lhs is the downcrossing rate at level h due to outflow and the rhs is the upcrossing rate accounting for water level jumps due to runoff inflow by taking the derivative of both sides of eq 5 with respect to h one retrieves the master equation for the steady state dynamics of the pdf ph h the solution of eq 5 is brill 2008 botter et al 2009 6 p h h n λ δ h θ 1 b n ρ h exp h α λ 0 h d u ρ u where the atom of probability at h 0 is p 0 n λ θ 1 b

of eq 7 is the basis for the specific solutions summarized in table 2 which are based on the parameters b and k for the different stage discharge curves of table 1 example steady state water level pdfs for a passive orifice discharge are illustrated in fig 3 numerical simulations demonstrate that the analytical solution is accurate the mode of the water level pdf is equal to zero for large values of a 0 fig 3a and increases to positive values as the outlet structure cross sectional area decreases the shape of the water level pdf is also sensitivity to the runoff inflow distribution as the mode increases with increasing runoff frequency λ fig 3b that is climate and watershed characteristics that generate more frequent less intense runoff are associated with more stormwater basin storage therefore changes in the basin design parameters e g a 0 or watershed or climate characteristics e g λ can change the most likely basin state from empty i e the mode of h is zero to partially full i e the mode of h is greater than zero 3 3 model performance for passive outflow visual inspection of the water level data confirms that stormwater runoff inflow events occur much more rapidly than outflow fig 4 a justifying the assumption that inflows events can be treated as an instantaneous random jump forcing at the time scale of the basin outflow process the estimated parameters for the inflow model were α 17 2 cm and λ 1 3 6 d respectively the distributions of extracted storm depths and inter storm durations are well approximated by the exponential distribution fig 4b from the long term rainfall data we estimated an average inter storm duration of 3 0 d and an average daily rainfall depth of 6 8 mm the distributions of daily rainfall depth and inter storm duration are also well approximated by the exponential distribution fig 4c further supporting our assumption note however that this assumption may fail for time series that span seasonal or inter annual rainfall variability porporato et al 2006 the outflow stage discharge relation was estimated from the data fig 5 the outflow process follows two regimes for water levels greater than 40 cm the stage discharge relation follows ρ h h 2 and for water levels less than 40 cm ρ h h 3 the basin water level exceeded 40 cm during one inflow event and for less than 1 of the time period further the estimated outflow rate at high water levels exceeds 100 cm day therefore at the daily time scale we assume that the basin has a maximum water level hmax 40 cm and ρ h h 3 the exponent b 3 is consistent with typical stage discharge curves for open channel flow in partially full circular cross sections for the estimated stage discharge curve of ρ h kh 3 the steady state water level pdf is 8 p h h n k h 3 exp h α λ 2 k h 2 the outflow coefficient k was estimated by the method of moments and estimated to be k 0 026 cm d the modeled and observed cdfs compare favorably for cumulative probabilities greater than 0 01 fig 6 3 4 steady state probability distribution of water level on off outflow control under active on off control driven by a single water level set point the basin water level dynamics can be in one of two regimes at any given time in the first regime the outflow structure is fully closed and the water level increases by successive inflow jumps generated by the watershed rainfall runoff process in the second regime the outflow structure is fully open when the structure is open the water level increases by successive inflow jumps and decreases according to the stage discharge curve between inflow events switching between these two regimes is triggered when the water level exceeds the outflow open set point hs outflow opens and when the water level reaches hmin outflow closes for constant and orifice outflow stage discharge curves h reaches hmin in finite time whereas for other structures a positive set point for valve closure must be specified because in theory the basin never fully empties example water level trajectories for a passive and controlled orifice outflow are compared in fig 7 the steady state water level pdf for the two regime system can be written as a weighted sum of the pdf for each regime 9 p h h c 1 p h 1 h 1 c 1 p h 2 h where c 1 is the ensemble average fraction of time spent in regime 1 filling outflow closed and 1 c 1 is the ensemble average fraction of time spent in regime 2 emptying outflow open the steady state pdfs p h 1 h and p h 2 h and the coefficient c 1 can be obtained by evaluating each regime separately for the filling regime we may pose a master equation for the cdf in terms of downcrossing and upcrossing rates downcrossing only occurs at level h hmin when the system switches from the emptying to the filling state i e when the outflow closes and sample paths are composed of only upcrossings therefore the steady state balance of downcrossings and upcrossings during the filling process can be written as brill 2008 10 c d λ u 0 h exp h u α p h 1 u d u where 0 h hs cd is the average downcrossing rate at which the emptying regime enters the filling regime i e the average rate at which the outflow structure closes hmin 0 and the rhs term accounts for upcrossings due to runoff inflow eq 10 can be solved to obtain the continuous part of the pdf f h 1 h c d α λ p 0 α where it is noted that steady state requires that cd λp 0 i e the rate of downcrossing equals the rate of leaving the level h 0 finally applying the normalization condition yields 11 p h 1 h 1 α h s δ h α α h s which states that when the outflow is closed the water level pdf is a mixed distribution with a continuous uniform pdf i e f h 1 h 1 α h s and an atom of probability of p 0 α α h s at h 0 the distribution only depends on the average runoff depth and the on off set point α and hs respectively likewise for the emptying regime the steady state master equation based on the cdf may be derived in terms of a balance of upcrossings and downcrossings i e 12 ρ h p h 2 h c u λ u 0 h exp h u α p h 2 u d u where cu is the average upcrossing rate at which the filling regime enters the emptying regime i e the average rate at which hs is crossed and the outflow structure opens and the second term on the rhs is the upcrossing rate due to runoff inflow the lhs of eq 12 is the downcrossing rate due to outflow eq 12 can be solved to obtain 13 p h 2 h c u ρ h exp f h 1 1 α u 0 h s h h s θ h s h exp f u d u where f u 0 u 1 α λ ρ y d y θ is the heaviside step function and the rate cu is the normalization constant of the pdf such that 0 h m a x p h 2 h d h 1 see appendix a the solution of 13 for the general stage discharge relation ρ h is 14 p h 2 h c u k h b exp h α λ k 1 b h 1 b 1 1 α u 0 h s h h s θ h s h exp u α λ k 1 b u 1 b d u finally the weight c 1 can be obtained by noting that at steady state the rate out of the emptying regime into the filling regime must be equal to the rate out of the filling regime into the emptying regime therefore c 1 cd 1 c 1 cu and 15 c 1 c u c d c u the full pdf ph h for an active outflow control is given by eq 9 which is based on the functions given by eqs 11 14 and 15 numerical and analytical solutions for the actively controlled water level pdf are shown in fig 8 a and the actively controlled water level pdf is compared to the passive water level pdf in fig 8b 3 5 comparing basin performance metrics under passive and active control in this section several basin performance metrics are derived from the previously developed pdfs and compared for passive and actively controlled outflows probabilistic performance metrics include the level duration curve ldc flow duration curve fdc the pdf of the valve closure time and the joint pdf of the water level and the valve closure time aggregate performance metrics include the ensemble average water level and outflow water balance 3 5 1 level and flow duration curves the steady state water level pdf and stage discharge curve can be used to construct the ldc and fdc the ldc is the complement of the water level cdf l h 1 p h h 1 0 h p h h d h the fdc is also the complement of a cdf but depends on the outflow status in addition to the basin water level the fdc can be written as 16 f q 1 p q q 1 c 1 1 q 0 p q q dq 1 c 1 where pq q is the pdf of the outflow rate and 1 c1 is the fraction of time the outflow is open with q 0 the outflow pdf can be obtained as a derived distribution of the water level pdf p q q p h q k 1 b k b q k b 1 b 1 based on a change of variables following eq 4 example ldcs and fdcs are plotted in fig 9 for an orifice outflow with passive and active control at several on off setpoints compared to passive outflow no control active control increases the ldc and therefore the water level at most return frequencies active control modifies the fdc in two ways first positive flows are restricted to the fraction of time c 1 when the basin is in the emptying regime secondly the distribution of flows is modified such that higher flows are more frequent with active control than passive outflow no control higher flows are a direct result of higher basin water levels under active control because of its control on the ldc and fdc the on off setpoint hs can be used to adapt stormwater basin performance to changes in the stormwater runoff inflow distribution to demonstrate the flow rate with an exceedance probability of 5 q 5 is plotted in fig 10 for several values of the on off level setpoint and rainfall frequency contours of constant q 5 indicate that for increased rainfall frequency the on off level setpoint can be increased to maintain q 5 therefore active on off control can be utilized to enhance resilience of stormwater basins to changing runoff inflow regimes similar results can be obtained for other exceedance probabilities 3 5 2 ensemble average water level and water balance the steady state water level pdf can be used to compute the average water balance partitioning to the outflow structure or the emergency overflow and the average basin water level these quantities represent the average basin function at the seasonal scale the ensemble average steady state water balance can be expressed as 17 q i q s q o where the brackets denote ensemble averages and subscripts s and o indicate outflow through the structure and emergency overflow respectively the ensemble average daily inflow volume is simply qi αλas the ensemble average overflow volume is related to the frequency of the water level crossing hmax λ o ph hmax ρ hmax porporato et al 2001 because the inflow events are exponentially distributed the overflow volumes are also exponentially distributed with mean α bartlett et al 2015 eq 3 21 therefore qo αph hmax ρ hmax as and qs qi qo finally the ensemble average water level can be obtained from the pdf by definition h 0 h m a x h p h h d h the passive orifice outflow is used as an example the average fraction of inflow controlled through the outflow structure is 18 q s q i 1 p 0 h m a x exp h m a x α λ k h m a x where p 0 is given in table 2 the ensemble average water level for a passive orifice outflow can be computed analytically but is not reported here for brevity similar expressions can be obtained for other outflow stage discharge curves and actively controlled outflows examples of the ensemble average water balance partitioning and the ensemble average water level are illustrated in fig 11 active control increases both the average water level and the runoff volume lost to emergency overflow increases in average water level due to active control are not sensitive to rainfall frequency and increase as the on off setpoint is increased increases in emergency overflow due to active control increase with the on off setpoint and decrease with rainfall frequency in this example for on off setpoints less than about half of the emergency overflow level the increase in overflow is negligible therefore this simple on off control rule for active control increases basin storage without significantly increasing overflow 3 5 3 distribution of the valve closure time one objective of active real time control of stormwater basin outflows is to increase water detention time for enhanced pollutant removal in addition to the detention time pollutant removal efficiency also depends on the basin water level the water level impacts the pollutant concentration through dilution as well as the critical settling velocity takamatsu 2010 on the other hand increased detention time may have negative consequences such as development of anoxic conditions or pests the framework introduced here can be used to provide insight into the impact of active controls on pollutant removal through the joint distribution of detention time and water level the distribution of times the basin spends in the filling regime regime 1 and therefore the times the valve is closed can be obtained from the time dependent solution of the pdf p h 1 h t the filling regime is a compound poisson process and the pdf of cumulative basin inflows at time t following valve closure is daly and porporato 2006 19 p h 1 h t exp h α λ t λ t α h i 1 2 λ h t α δ h where i 1 is the modified bessel function of the first kind of order 1 abramowitz and stegun 1972 the pdf of eq 19 can be integrated to define the probability that the valve reopens before a given time t which is equivalent to the probability that h t exceeds hs 20 p t c t h s p h 1 h t d h where tc is a random variable that defines the time between valve closing and opening therefore the pdf of valve closure times is 21 p t c t c d p t c t d t d d t h s p h 1 h t d h eq 21 does not have a closed form solution the sensitivity of p t c t c to hs and λ is illustrated in fig 12 as expected higher hs leads to longer valve closure times and therefore longer detention times runoff inflow distributions with more frequent and less intense inflows reduce the variability of the valve closure time whereas storm frequency has a minor impact on the mode of p t c t c note that eq 19 can also be used to define the pdf of h conditional on tc 22 p h t c h t c n exp h α λ t c λ t c α h i 1 2 λ h t c α δ h where n is a normalization constant that accounts for the fact that h is restricted between 0 and hs in regime 1 the joint distribution of h and tc can then be obtained combining eqs 21 and 22 23 p h t c h t c p h t c h t c p t c t c the sensitivity of p h t c h t c to hs and λ is illustrated in fig 13 in general there is a nearly linear relationship between the modes of the marginal valve closure time and water level distributions that is the valve closure time is strongly and positively related to the basin water level these basin performance metrics have opposite impacts on basin pollutant removal assuming settling as the primary pollutant removal process increased water level increases particle settling time whereas increased detention time increases the fraction of particles removed from the water column from this purely hydrologic perspective it is not clear how important this trade off is toward an effective balance between water storage and pollutant removal 4 discussion and conclusions a stochastic water balance model was developed for stormwater control basins and the model considers both passive and actively controlled outflows the proposed model joins a number of recent models and experiments aimed at quantifying the variability of urban stormwater infrastructure performance daly et al 2012 2014 li et al 2016 while previous studies have focused on dynamics and performance of bioretention and treatment facilities the present work addresses stormwater retention and detention basins as well as active real time control of basin outflows kerkez et al 2016 mullapudi et al 2017 the model describes the dynamics of the basin water level h and given the statistics of the runoff inflow process provides a probabilistic characterization of the basin hydrologic function results include the water level pdf the joint distribution of valve closure time and water level and average water balance under different land use climate and design characteristics the water level pdf which can also be expressed as a level duration curve leads directly to an analytical expression for the basin flow duration curve thus a full probabilistic description of hydrologic performance in passive and actively controlled stormwater basins has been achieved the model presented here has a number of limitations to be addressed in future work the model assumes the stormwater basin is rectangular and has a constant surface area with depth this assumption applies to rain barrels and subsurface rainwater harvesting tanks but most stormwater detention and retention ponds have sloped sides secondly the model assumes a poisson arrival process for stormwater runoff events and that runoff depths are exponentially distributed this assumption was shown to apply in the present case study however it may not be appropriate in all cases finally the model verification was limited by data availability during the three months of recorded water level data there were only 12 storms to estimate the parameters α and λ therefore confidence in these parameters is low in addition the outflow stage discharge relation parameters were estimated from the data limiting applicability of eq 8 to other ungauged sites analysis of the results demonstrates the role of active outflow control in altering the hydrologic dynamics of stormwater basins active control as defined here increases water storage volume and detention time which mitigate increased peak runoff flows and pollutant runoff due to urbanization respectively further the results show that active outflow control can be employed as an effective practice to adapt stormwater basin outflows to land use or climate changes that alter the timing and frequency of stormwater runoff events however active outflow control may increase the likelihood of emergency overflow and reduce the efficiency of pollutant removal by increasing particle settling time these trade offs and their implications must be addressed in future work this model represents a first step toward understanding the interaction between runoff variability and smart stormwater systems mullapudi et al 2017 as such our work focuses on the hydrologic performance of single stormwater management facility the modeling framework can be adapted to investigate progressively more
